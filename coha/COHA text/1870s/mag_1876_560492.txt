CAMPAIGN AND BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG , JUNE AND JULY , 1863 . AFTER the battle of Chancellorsville the Confederates were much encourage ( l by the general condition of affairs . The army of the Potomac kept losing men by expiration of enlistment , until we had less than eighty - five thousand effectives , and these were badly organized , when General Lee commenced his movement the last of May , 1863 . Our forces were distributed into eight army corps , necessarily of small size : the first under John F. Reynolds ; second Hancock ; third , Sickles ; fifth , Meade ; sixth , Sedgwick ; eleventh , Howard ; twelfth , Sbcum , and the cavalry under Pleasanton , making an average for each corps of less than eleven thousand men . The largest corps , Sedgwick 's , was about fifteen thousand strong ; the smallest , Reynolds 's , numbered not more than eight thousand combatants . General Lee seems to have actually commenced the northward movement the 3d of June . It was always difficult for us to procure information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to gather corresponding information concerning us , because we were in the hostile country . I remember with what apparent ease and self-possession , during this northward march , farmers would be riding in pairs or threes , each with a bag of grain behind the saddle , apparently going to the nei*hboring mill ; and how surprised beyond expression they were when their counterfeit character was revealed . With few exceptions the Southern households , when opportunity rendered it possible , as at Chancellorsville , gave constant and full information to the enemy of our strength , position , and movements . However , in spite of difficulties , General Hooker had discovered and reported to Washington , as early as the 28th of May , the collection of a large body of the enemy 's cavalry at // 1876 . Culpepper and Jefferson . lie justly concluded that a general movement was on foot , and presumed it would be the same substantially as that of the year before . Still , everything seemed to be conjecture till after the cavalry action of General Pleasanton , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , merely a grand reconnoissance in force . It resulted in giving us this desired information : the corps of Longstreet and Ewell , having turned our right flank , were already en route towards the north ; and the enemy 's cavalry surely , and his whole force probably , was destined for Maryland and Pennsylvania . HOOKER 'S PLANS AND INSTRUCTIONS . From the information gathered from the prisoners and dispatebes captured during this reconnoissance , and from scouts who had noted the time it took the enemy 's column to pass a given point , it was plain to our commander that there was need of prompt action : either to cross the river and fall upon Lee 's rear , or to follow up his movement upon the inner lines , ready to resist any flank movement he might make , or , if an opportunity should offer at some favorable moment , to strike him in flank . General Hooker seems to have meditated the first course , and to judge from his correspondence with Washington he deemed it feasible . Doubtless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off Hill 's corps , fallen upon and crushed it after the departure of Ewell and Longstreet , and afterwards , if Lee had not turned back , made as good time as Lee himself in reaching Central Pennsylvania ; but his general instructions to cover Washington , always a matter of vital importance , and the specific objection of the president made at the time in a letter to him , caused him to restrict himself to a reconnoissance by the sixth corps , while the other corps were marching parallel with Lee 's column . Each army in motion was covered in flank by its own cavalry . General Hooker kept steadily to his object , namely , to take positions of observation , protect the capVOL . XXXVHI. - NO. 2211. 4 ital against sudden movements in that direction , and be ready to concentrate rapidly for any possible emergency . I belonged to the right wing , temporarily constituted under the immediate charge of General John F. Reynolds . It consisted of the first , third , and eleventh corps , and marched by the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run ) , Centreville , Gum Spring , and Goose Creek . Our three corps habitually encamped within five or six miles of each other , seldom followin' in precisely the same track except when forced to do so . The corps kept up constant intercommunication . There were frequent cavalry combats with Stuart 's cavalry at the gaps in the Bull Run range and the Blue Ridge , but few that drew into action any considerable infantry force , though a regiment , a brigade , or sometimes a division was detached in support . Mosby 's cavalry , guerrillas , scouts , and spies penetrated our lines in spite of every precaution , picked off our aids and messengers on their swift journeyings from corps to corps , and circulated every sort of false story that might be made use of to mislead us . The major part of the army of the Potomac was on the 22d of June not far from Edward 's Ferry , the place selected for crossing the Potomac . General Lee had rightly interpreted our movements , namely , the reconnoissance at Falmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by infantry at the gaps of the mountain ridges which run parallel with the Potomac ; and he had scarcely been checked for an hour in the execution of his main purpose . He did encounter a force of about seven thousand men under General R. H. Milroy , at Winchester , Virginia , which force , in an isolated position , without support , could not afford to wait for Lee 's arrival . But it was difficult for General Milroy , with his brave heart , to make up his mind to retreat till the enemy was actually upon him . He remained one day too long , his retreat was cut off , and it is a wonderful fact that nearly half of his command escaped and succeeded in getting upon the other side // THE ENEMY ' S CROSSING . of the Potomac , leaving the remainder Edward 's Ferry on the north side of the of his men , twenty-nine guns , upwards Potomac at that place . of two hundred wagons , and four hundred horses and mules in the hands of the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , served to depress us and inspirit the enemy . lie pressed on rapidly to Harper 's Ferry , where doubtless he hoped to repeat the tactics of a former occasion , that is , of seizing the commandiug points on the Virginia shore , and forcing a surrender . But this time we were fortunate in having in command there General Tyler , an officer as quick of apprehension and as fertile in expedients as Lee 's commanders . Tyler carefully withdrew to the almost impregnable position of Maryland Heights , a range of hills , on the eastern shore of the Potomac , which completely command the ground at Harper 's Ferry ; thus saving his command and taking an excellent post of observation . General Hooker was entirely right when he asked the control of this force . Had Milroy 's and Tyler 's troops been under his command , Milroy would have held merely an outpost for Tyler , and would doubtless have retired upon him on Lee 's approach . In such emergencies independent wills work at cross - purposes . For war , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly . I was ordered to cross the Potomac with my corps on the 24th of June , at Edward 's Ferry . * ? he uncertainty of the enemy 's movements , and correspondingly of our own , multiplied orders in an unusual manner . After my orders to cross the river and proceed to Sandy Hook , in the vicinity of Harper 's Ferry , General Butterfield , the chief of Hooker 's staff , signaled , " Have you received orders not to cross at Edward 's Ferry till further orders , but to camp near the telegraph office there ? You report from there to head - quarters army of Potomac . " Another order was to cross and march to Harper 's Ferry via Edward 's . Then came a dispatch from Hooker himself , to put my corps in camp on the south side of the Potomac ; next , one from General Seth Williams , A. A. G. , that I should guard the bridge and depots at General Seth Williams writes , " General Tyler telegraphs from Maryland Heights , Longstreet 's corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to - day in motion , and before six o'clock this morning commenced crossing by the ford , one mile below Shepherdstown , to Sharpsburg . I have reports from reliable parties that at least fifteen thousand have crossed the ford this morning , mostly infantry and artillery . The troops are halted , and the wagon train at ten o'clock ( this morning ) was moving . ' " General Hooker 's letter of this same date , probably written early in the morning , to General Halleck , explains that Ewell is already over the Potomac , and that if he can do so without observation he proposes to send to harper 's Ferry " a corps or two to sever Ewell from the balance of the rebel army , in case he should make a protracted sojourn with his Pennsylvania neighbors . " I presume that just as soon as General Hooker knew that Longstreet was also crossing the Potomac in force , he gave up the idea of the enemy 's intention to make a single corps raid . Also he surrendered the hope of dividino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In keeping with this view , the next day , the 25th of June , came new instructions to me : " The commanding general directs that you at once send a staff officer to report to General Reynolds , at or near the vicinity of Edward 's Ferry , and that you move your own command in the direction of Middletown instead of Sandy Hook . " This movement was executed in conjunction with the first and third corps ; " with a view , " General Hooker says , " to seize the passes of South Mountain . . . and confine him Lee to one line of invasion . " These objects were fully accomplished . It was easy to concentrate at any one of the three points , Frederick , Middletown , or South Mountain , in a day . I do not // wonder at General Hooker 's disappointment that the left at Harper 's Ferry should be absolutely anchored by keeping ten thousand men there to defend Maryland Heights . This was in effect the decision of General Halleck , general-in-chief , telegraphed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person had gone to Harper 's Ferry to reconnoitre . General Hooker 's prompt and well - known reply to Halleek 's message was , " My original instructions were to cover Harper 's Ferry and Washington . I have now imposed upon me , in addition , an enemy in my front of more than my numbers . I beg to be understood , respectfully but firmly , that I am unable to comply with these conditions with the means at my disposal ; and I earnestly request that I may be at once relieved from the position I occupy . " HOOKER RELIEYED ; ARMY FEELING . On the 28th , after his arrival at Frederick , General Hooker was relieved from the command , and General George G. Meade was appointed to succeed him . I was not , *t this time , familiar with the points at issue between Generals Halleek and Hooker , but I was somewhat acquainted with the feeling towards General Hooker among certain officers of rank in our army . President Lincoln wrote him on the subject in a letter dated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some painful intimations that some of your corps and division commanders are not giving you their entire confidence . " One of these officers , about the 18th or 19th of June , quite fiercely assailed me for " constantly sustaining General Hooker , " saying in substance that I was the only corps commander that spoke always in Hooker 's defense . I replied that " I was always loyal to the officer the government saw fit to place over me . " Though I believed , and do so still , that my dispositions at Chancehlorsville were as good as the position permitted , and that the defeat there was not due to any neglect on my part , willful or otherwise , but to other causes ( as I could have explained , had I ever been called upon by the committee on the conduct of the war or by General Hooker ) , nevertheless I was made to feel soon after that battle that General Hooker blamed me , and was against me . This made me so much the more careful in what I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a view to prevail on me to withdraw from the corps . And whatever private grievance I might have , I trod it under my feet , for I believed that General Hooker had grand qualities . He was cool and brave in action , clearheaded in council , and of a popular turn with the troops , and probably as able in matters purely military - in formin and executing plans of campaign embracing tactics and strategy - as General Lee . His great fault was that he was unmerciful in his criticism of senior and rival commanders . Judging of the army feeling as exhibited in private interviews , arid in the usual canvassing of reputations and characters around the camp-fires , I believe the change of commanders , ill-timed as it seemed , was acceptable to the officers . MEADE 'S OPERATIONS . After the telegrams between General Hooker and the government , Meade concentrated his army towards his right flank at Frederick , on the evenin* , of the 28th , saying , " I propose to move this army to-morrow in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in execution , to be completed the evenin , , of the 30th ( really finished the 29th ) , a movement upon Emmettsburg and Westminster : first and eleventh corps to Emmettsburg , third and twelfth to Taneytown , second to Frizelburg , fifth to Union , and sixth to New Windsor . lie drew French ( now properly placed under his command ) from Harper 's Ferry to Frederick , as a reserve and protection to his line of communication with Washington . He protected his flank with cavalry . This dispersed the army considerably , grouping two corps at Emmettsburg , two 1876. 51 // July , at Taneytown , and three around Westminster , on a line from right to left of about twenty-five miles ' frontage . General Meade 's object , explained at the time , was , " If Lee is moving for Baltimore , I expect to get between his main army and that place . If he is crossing the Susquehanna , I shall rely upon General Couch at Harrisburg holding him until I can fall upon his rear and give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the Potomac in our rear , and made a rai ( l around us . Ewell was at this time believed to be in the vicinity of York and Harrisburg . So that with Lee 's army apparently scattered from Ilagerstown to Carlisle , Harrisburg , and York , Meade hoped , as he said , to fall upon some portion of it in detail . But on the evening of the 30th , all our information showed that Lee was drawing in his divisions and brigades to locations between Chambersburg and Gettysburg . The part my corps took in these grand movements of preparation was very simple . I marched on the afternoon of the 28th of June from the beautiful , fertile , loyal , hospitable valley of which Middletown is the centre , to the north of Frederick . The next day , the 29th , my notes say , " The day was rainy , the roads heavy , and the march wearisome , yet the troops were in camp at Emmettsburg , having made about twenty miles , by seven r . M. " Orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half-way from Emmettsburg to Gettysburg , about six miles on . I changed position from the right to the left of the town , and the third corps ( Sickles 's ) encamped between Taneytown and my position . Slocum went to Littlestown . The cavalry kept in advance ; Buford 's division was already in Gettysburg . The rest of the army remained substantially as on the day before . The Confederate corps of A. P. Hill , or a large portion of it , was at Wiugard 's farm , on the road from Funkstown to the Chambersburg pike , the night before . Just at night I received a note from General Reynolds requesting me to ride up to Marsh Run and see him . He was stopping at a house on the right of the road when I reached there , occupying a back room on the south side . He said he was glad to see me , and immediately gave me General Meade 's confidential address , just issued , in which he required the officers in command fitly to address the troops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the approach of a great battle . He ( Reynolds ) showed me ; in a bundle of dispatches , - the information brought to him during the day , - evidence of the nearness , position , and designs of the enemy . lie sat down with me to study the maps of the country , and we consulted upon these matters till eleven o'clock at night , the last night of his life . He impressed me as unusually sad ; perhaps not more so than any clear-headed officer would be on the eve of an important battle . I took leave of him and rode rapidly back , six miles , to my command . It seemed that I was hardly asleep before a messenger from army headquarters at Taneytown waked me with orders for General Reynolds as the wing commander . They were the orders of march for the day . I opened the dispatch and noted its contents ( we read all dispatches , however directed , lest they should fall into the hands of the enemy and be lost ) , but did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time had been allowed him to give his own instructions based on them . But these orders of march , 50 soon known , enabled me to be in readiness . From them I quote the following : - " Orders . Headquarters at Taneytown . Third corps to Emmettsburg ; second corps to Taneytown ; fifth corps to Hanover ; twelfth corps to Two Taverns ; first corps to Gettysburg ; eleventh corps to Gettysburg ( in supporting distance ) ; sixth corps to Manchester . Cavalry to front and flanks , well out in all directions , giving timely notice of positions and movements of the enemy . " After indicating the probable position of Longstreet and Hill between Chainbersburg and Gettysburg , and Ewell at // Carlisle and York , and expressing the opinion that movements favored a disposition on Lee 's part to advance from Chambersburg to Gettysburg , General Meade concludes , " The general believes he has relieved Harrisbur* and Philadelphia , and now desires to look to his own army and assume position for offensive or defensive , or for rest to the troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now ask the reader to narrow his view , and accompany me while I play the small part assigned to me , and note what I observed , remembering that if I write more fully of my own work it is no disparagement to others who distinguished themselves . At 8.30 A. M. , at Emmettsburg , I received the order of march from Reynolds , for the time my immediate commander , and at once set in motion two columns then in readiness . One , Barlow 's division , with a battery , was put upon the direct road from Pmmettsburg to Gettysburg ( eleven miles ) ; the other two divisions , Schurz 's and Steinwehr 's , with four batteries remaining , upon an indirect road ( thirteen miles ) by Homer 's mill , coming into Gettysburg by the Taneytown road . An average of two and one half miles per hour on a hot July day , with the load of supplies each soldier had to carry , would be enough , and would bring Barlow 's division into Gettysburg a little after one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Reynolds 's wagons , and much obstructed all the way by trains and artillery carriages . ) Schurz and Steinwehr , upon an unobstructed road , would do well to make an average of three miles per hour , and might come in about the same time with Barlow . THE BATTLE : FIRST DAY . As soon as the columns were in motion , accompanied by my staff I took the shortest route , riding rapidly by the side of the road , in the woods , in the fields , anywhere to get past the impedi menta and Reynolds 's moving columns , and reached the vicinity of Gettysburg by 10.30 A. M. ( All the time I give was by my own watch . I notice variations in the time from a half to three quarters of an hour , as different officers have recorded the same event . ) A staff officer met me from Reynolds as I came in sight of town , and said that General Wadsworth had come suddenly upon the enemy and was cn0aged beyond the seminary ; and it was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing and some musketry . Reynolds 's column had left the road towards the west ; one division seemed on the ground and another was skirting the Oak or Seminary Ridge , closing up . My orders to keep within supporting distance , with a corps , would mean four or five miles back , if no combat was at band . But Reynolds 's word to me now by his aid was , " Come quite up to Gettysburg . " And as I asked where he wished to place me , the aid said , in substance , " Encamp anywhere about here , according to your judgment at present . " But circumstances change rapidly when an action has already begun . After his aid had gone and the firing seemed to increase , I became very anxious to see General Reynolds himself , that I might act with him to the best advantage . I sent an aid and orderlies to different places to look for him and report to me . Meanwhile , with the remainder of my staff I reconnoitred for the best position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of Sherfy 's peach-orchard , to a little rising ground there , then across the field , and ascended Cemetery Ridge . While there looking at the broad expanse of country over and beyond the little town at my fect , I distinctly remember turning to Colonel Meizenburg , the corps adjutant general , and saying , " This seems to be a good position , colonel . " He answered briefly , " It is the only position , general . " I now passed rapidly into the town and at first tried to get into the belfry of the court-house , but found no ladder ; some one recommended another place , 1876. 53 // across the street , through a store , up a stairway , through a lumber-room , then up another fii , ght of stairs , and out upon a balcony . It was probably the work of two minutes , when from what is now called Fahnestock 's observatory 1 had a fine post of observation . What could we see ? The roads , now so familiar , from Bonnaughtown , York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hagerstown ; roads emerging from Gettysburg like the spokes from the hub of a wheel ; roads which are exceedingly important for the soldier in command to have engraven on his memory . I saw Buford 's division of cavalry perhaps two miles off towards the northwest , seeming , in the distance and in the largeness of the field beyond the college , but a handful . I got glimpses of Wadsworth 's division of infantry , fighting near the Oak Ridge railroad cut . Success was then attending him , and prisoners *n gray were being conducted into the town . I saw Doubleday 's division beyond the Lutheran seminary , filing out of sight beyond the Oak Ridge to the south of west , a mile away . REYNOLDS ' S DEATH . As I stood there , and looked and heard and thought , of a sudden a young officer rode rapidly up the street from the west , touched his hat as he halted , and said , " General Reynolds is wounded , sir . I replied , " I am very sorry ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A few minutes after ( about 11.30 A.M. ) , his aid-de-camp , Major Biddle , brought me news of his death . His words were , " General Reynolds is dead , and you are the senior officer on the field . " Is it confessing weakness to say that when the responsibility of my position flashed upon me I was penetrated with an emotion never experienced before or since ? I realized that we had close to us a large part of Lee 's army , and that we ourselves had on the field now less than ten thousand men all told , and it seemed almost hopeless that Meade could gather his scattered forces in time for any considerable success to attend our arms . " But , " I thought , " God helping us , we will stay here till the army comes . " I assumed the command of the field , giving to General Schurz command of the eleventh corps . Doubleday succeeded to Reynolds , and Buford continued with his cavalry . I had sent an earnest call from Reynolds , received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schurz and Barlow . It was his last order to me : " I am hardly pressed ; have your troops move up at double-quick . " Immediately I sent the news to General Sickles , who must have been at Emmettsburg before that hour , urging him to come up as quickly as possible ; and through him on to General Meade at or near Taneytown , back to Slocum along the Baltimore pike to the vicinity of the Two Taverns , where he was supposed to be ; and again to the commanders of the eleventh corps on both roads of approach . I then rode slowly to the position Meizenburg and I had agreed upon as a good one , near the cemetery gate , where very soon I met General Carl Schurz in person , who had hastened on to see me ; and I instructed him ; as soon as the troops should arrive , to place his reserve batteries and Steinwehr 's division in support on those heights , and to send his other two divisions , Barlow 's and his own , now 8chimmelpfennig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as relief . Several writers have criticised this disposition , one set asserting substantially that it was a lame attempt on my part to carry out the instructions of General Reynolds , which he himself would have modified had he lived ; another , that I scattered my troops too much , and should have concentrated them at once ; and another still , that the disposition was well enough , but that I should have intrenched or barricaded more than was done . The first objection is simply not true . General Reynolds , as a true soldier and a military man of good capacity , met the enemy with his troops , which were but the advance of the main army , and attacked at once with boldness , as the wisest course to make the enemy more careful // and slower in developing his forces ; but he fell before he had informed me of any plan for a subsequent arrangement of troops . The second objection would be of value provided there had been time to take and fortify prominent points in the enemy 's front ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ewell 's corps than to let the flanking operation of Chancellorsville be repeated upon our exposed right flank . A well organized skirmish-line is better than nothing . The alternative would have been to occupy , at once and fully , Ccmetery Ridge and vicinage , and draw back the first corps . But this could not be done safely so early in the morning . The repulse of the Oak Ridge line would surely have fallen upon the new line at the cemetery , for the enemy 's numbers present were at least two to our one . Possibly more barricading and intrenching might have been done , even in the presence of actual firing ; I had it done in Georgia afterwards , under similar circumstances , but more was effected at Gettysbur* than is usually believed . The batteries on the cemetery heights were many of them covered . The walls and fences were taken possession of , and the houses towards the north and west of the town , as I ordered and as I am informed , were prepared and used as barricades . FURTHER MOVEMENTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the cemetery gate , he met his column that appeared first on the Taneytown road , and detached the brave and prompt Captain Dilger with his first Ohio battery in advance , which passed through Gettysburg at a trot and went at once to a good position on the right of Robinson 's division . I insert a short extract from General Schurz 's report to me . He says , " The right of the first corps seemed to extend across thc Cashtown roiid and the railroad northeast of it . It was at this time difficult to see how far the ground was in our possession . Of the enemy we saw but little , and had no means of forming a just estimate of his strength . 55 Either the enemy was before us in small force , and then we had to push him with all possible vigor , or he had the principal part of his army there , and then we had to establish ourselves in a position which would enable us to maintain ourselves until the arrival of re*inforcemeats . Either of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Accordingly you ordered me to take the third and first divisions of the eleventh corps through the town , to endeavor to gain possession of the eastern prolongation of the ridge partly held by the first corps , while you intended to establish the second division and the artillery ( the reserve batteries , Major T. W. Osborne , commanding ) , except the batteries attached to the first and third divisions , on the cemetery and the eminence east of it , as a reserve . " The third division arrived at 12.45 1* . M. probably , time blank in my copy , at a double-quick . The weather was sultry , and the troops , that had marched several hours without halting a single time , were much out of breath . I ordered General Schimmelpfennig . . . to advance briskly through the town , and to deploy on the right of the first corps in two lines . This order was executed with promptness and spirit . Shortly afterwards the first division , under General Barlow , arrived by the Emmettsburg road proper , advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form on the right of the third division. ** Meanwbile , as General Schurz was conducting his third divisioxt to battle , I left orders for Steiuwehr and Osborne to halt and form upon Cemetery Ridge , and also directed my chief of staff to remain there with all that pertained to my head-quarters , namely , clerks , orderlies , servants , horses , and the small cavalry dctachment . I set forth with two or three officers for a personal reconnoissance of the troops engaged at the front . I was just in time to meet the head of Barlow 's division , and accompanied it through the town along the street that is nearest the extension of the Emmettsburg road . He detached Captain Wheeler 's battery in advance . It moved with the Campaign and Battle of Gettysburg. // utmost rapidity to join Captain Dilger . The infantry marched more slowly , that they might come fresher into battle . As the column passed along , the street and houses seemed almost deserted . But for the occasional firing beyond the seminary , echoing through the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as were the streets of Baltimore when we came through that city a few days after the riot in 1861 . One beautiful exception greeted our eyes . A young lady , standing upon a piazza near a street corner upon our right , waved her handkerchief continuously as the men passed by . It gave them heart , reminding them of the true and loved ones for whom they were fighting . The soldiers answered with cheers , prolonged as the regiments came and went . My senior ai ( l-de-camp , Major C. H. Howard , was sent with orderlies to the position of General Bnford to consult with him , reconnoitre , and bring me information . I then rode rapidly along our line from our right to the position of General Doubleday on the left . General Wadsworth in his testimony says : " General Howard had ridden over to see me about two o'clock , and told me to hold the position as long as I could and then to retire . " Probably , as he was subordinate to General Doubleday , I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit is , " I found General Doubleday about a quarter of a mile beyond the seminary . His third division was drawn up with its front and left facing towatds the northwest , makincr a large angle with the ridoe* the artillery of this division was engaging the enemy at this time . His first division Wadsworth 's was located a little to the right of the railroad merely a railroad cut running from Gettysburg towards Chainbersburg , and his second division Robinson 's on Wadsworth 's right . " The left of Doubleday 's line , resting on a small stream called Willoughby 's Run , extended to an elevation north of the Chambersburg road and was then refused . Then there was an interval , occupied after one r . M. by Wheeler 's and Dil0er 's batteries belonging to the elev eath corps . From this place to Rock Creek , almost at right angles with the first corps line , were the two divisions of the eleventh corps , Barlow 's and Schimmelpfennig ' s . Such was the position of the troops . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's division , I directed General Sehurz to move forward and seize a woody height in front of his left , on the prolongation of Oak Ridge . But before he had advanced many steps , the report of Ewell 's corps advancing between the York and Harrisburg roads was brou0ht in by Major Howard , and confirmed by reports from Generals Buford and Schurz . I saw at once that my right would be completely enveloped if I pressed on for the woody height referred to , so I ordered the line to be halted , and skirmishers to be sent to try to get upon and occupy that position . Before their arrival the enemy had it in force . From this time , about two , till four P. M. , General Schurz with the advance division stood mainly on the defensive , constantly firing and receiving fire of artillery and infantry . General Barlow made one bold advance that for a few minutes broke the continuity of the line . The enemy 's batteries could be distinctly seen on a prominent slope north of Gettysburg , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we constantly replied from the three batteries at the front ( Lieutenant Wilkeson 's , of the fourth artillery , being with Barlow hotly engaged ) , and from Wildrick 's three-inch rifle guns on the cemetery heights near my head - quarters . A sad complaint came from General Buford that our shots from the latter , Wildriek 's battery , fell short , and only reached his line . Fortunately nobody on our side was killed by this fire . The accident arose from the poorness of the ammunition , and not from wnnt of skill in the artfllery officers . Not long after my return from Doubleday 's , about 2.45 r. xr. , perceiving that a severe attack had actually been begun upon the eleventh corps and right of the first , I sent again to General Slocum , stating that my right // flank was attacked and asking him if he was moving up to my relief . I stated that I was in danger of being turned and driven back . As to another message , owino ' to some difficulty in finding General Sickles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not deliver it to him till 3.30 P. M. , so that it was vain to expect help from that quarter short of two hours and a half . The first corps really did more fighting than the eleventh . It began early , when Wadsworth 's two brigades , Cutler 's an ( l Meredith 's , came into position . Doubleday says , " General Reynolds took Cutler 's brigade and Hall 's battery to hold his part of the line , and directed the other brigade to be placed on a line with the first in a piece of woods which lay between the two roads probably the Chambersburg and the next road to the south . These roads were already occupied by the enemy , who opened fire upon us , killing General Reynolds almost on the first volley . " The result of this first combat , thus begun , was to dislodge the enemy from the woods and take a large number of prisoners , his force being driven beyond Willoughby 's Run . Here is where Colonel Fairchild so distinguished himself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and a battery ( Hall 's ) being nearly disabled , all the horses and men at one gun either killed or wounded , he fell back with a part of Cutler 's brigade along the railroad cut towards town . Doubleday now assumed the offensive with a reserve regiment and some others at hand , and attacked the enemy 's advance in flank , enabling Wadsworth to catch in the railroad cut General Archer , of North Carolina , with part of his brigade and part of Davis 's ( rebel ) brigade , and make them prisoners . General Doubleday now extended his line with Robinson 's division and supported his right with proper reserves . This seems to have been the position of things when I went along his line . There was constant skirmishing and some artillery firing kept up all this time , but no vigorous attack again till it came along the whole line . My record is : " At 3.20 P. M. the enemy renewed his attack upon the first corps , hotly pressing the first and second divisions . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Earnest requests came to me from both corps for reinforcements ; Schurz must have another brigade on his right . My report says truly , " I had then only two small brigades of Steinwehr 's in reserve , and had already placed three regiments from these ( Costar 's brigade ) in the north edge of the town , with a view to cover the eleventh corps should it be forced to retire . " I feared the consequence of sparing another man from the cemetery . It was not a time to lose the nmicleus for a new line that must soon be formed . I did , however , give General Schurz another battery from the reserve , and requested General Buford with his cavalry to retire from his advanced position , to support as well as he could the right of Doubleday 's line . At 3.4b Generals Doubleday and Wadsworth besought me again for reinforcements . I directed General Schurz if he could possibly spare a regiment to send one immediately to Wadsworth , for I deemed his front the ground which General George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the enemy is most obstinate ) . I have no record as to whether Schurz sent this regiment or not2 In fact , fifteen minutes after this order left me , time musketry fire on the right and left became terrific , seemingly all along the line , and Doubleday was outflanked toward the left . I then sent an aid ( I think it must have been Captain Hall ) to General Doubleday with these words : " If you can not hold out longer , you must fall back to the cemnetery and take position on the left of the Baltimore pike . " The general , and I believe him a true man , does not give me credit for this order . It is possible the aid may have said , " We must hold on to the seminary as long as possible , " in the excitement using seminary for cemetery ; or he may have failed to reach him with the order . 1876. 57 // ORDERS FOR RETREAT . A few minutes later , being satisfied I could hold the front no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive order ( General Schurz names this order in his report ) to Generals Schurz and Doubleday to fall back gradually , disputing the ground obstinately , and to form near my position , the eleventh corps on the right and the first corps on the left of the Baltimore pike ; and , as I knew our line would necessarily be short , and appear so to General Lee 's observation , I asked General Buford to make all the show he could on our left , fronting the enemy 's right . This he promptly did . Now let it be remembered , when the staff officers left me with orders , our troops were already giving way . Soon the division of the eleventh corps nearest Doubleday was flying to the shelter of the town , widcning the gap there ; and the enemy in line pressed rapidly through the interval . Of course Robinsoa and Wadsworth had to give way . General Doubleday says , " I think the retreat would have been a very successful one if it had not been unfortunately the case that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out very well on the extreme right , had been surrounded and had fallen back at the same time that my right flank fell back . These two bodies of men became entangled in the streets of the town , and quite a number were captured . " This was literally the case . The provisions made to cover the retirement of the troops , namely , the sending of Costar 's brigade to the edge and front of the town , and the proper location and service of batteries by my chief of artillery , Major T. W. Osborne , checked the eager advance of the enemy , and broke and flung back a column of his in the act of turning the right flank of our new position . As the troops came up the Baltimore pike , very much broken , Schimmelpfennig , the commander of the leading division , lost his way , and to avoid falling into the enemy 's hands hid himself among some piles of lumber , and did not succeed in joining his command until after the battle of the third day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the last minute , doing everything to inspirit their troops engaged , and save what they could of their broken columns . I received the first regiment arriving , and , leading the way with the corps flag , placed it in position on the right of Steinwehr 's line . Its colonel , Von Amsburg , seemed at the time utterly crestfallen and broken , but the German soldiers answered my action and followed my signal with a shout . General Addbert Ames , who succeeded General Barlow in command of his division after Barlow was badly wounded , came to me about this time and said , " I have no division : it is all cut to pieces . " I replied , " Do what you can , Ames , to gather the fragments and extend the line to the right . " He did so , dnd succeeded better than he had feared . The firiuc , of the enemy now measurably subsided ; only an occasional cannon shot and scattering musketry reached us . HANCOCK 'S ARRIVAL . At this moment , 4.30 P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day , General Hancock appeared . ( lie reports to the committee on the conduct of the war that he was at Cemetery Hill by 3.30 i*. r*t . ) General Doubleday states that his troops did not commence to give way till a quarter before four ; and surely it was half an hour later than this that he was leading his corps into position on Cemetery Ridge , where he and I first met Hancock . General Hancock greeted me in his usual frank and cordial manner , and used these words : " General Meade has sent nie to represent him on the field . " I replied , " All right , Hancock . This is no time for talking . You take the left of the pike and I will arrange these troops to the right . " He said no more , and moved off in his peculiar gallant style to gather scattered brigades and put them into position . I noticed that he sent Wadsworth 's division , without consulting me , to the right of the eleventh corps , to CuIp 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , I // made no objection , - probably would not have made any in any event , - but worked away , assisted by my officers , organizing and arranging batteries and infantry along the stone wall and fences toward Gettysburg , and along the northern crest of the ridge . It did not strike me then that Hancock , without troops , was doing more than directing matters as a temporary chief of staff for Meade . MEADE ' S ORDER SUPERSEDING HOWARD . But just before night , when the order from General Meade came to me , superseding me in command of the field by a junior in rank , I was of course deeply mortified , and immediately sought General Hancock and appealed to his magnanin*ity to represent to General Meade how I had performed my duty on that memorable day , which I think he then did . I know that afterward General Hancock said in substance to Vice-President Hamlin , concerning this battle , " The country will never know how much it owes to your Maine general , Howard . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I saw in company with Hancock for the first time . He had placed his two divisions as I had requested , one at the extreme right , and the other at the left , some time before I saw him . Slocum answered me roughly that evening , and feeling that for some unaccountable reason I was blamed where I ought to be commended , I sat down and wrote a letter to General Meade . HEAD-QUARTERS ELEVENTH CORPS , July 1 , 1863 . MAJOR - GENERAL MEADE , commanding Army of the Potomac : GENERAL , - General Hancock 's order to assume command reached here in writing at seven ( P. M. ) . At that time , General Slocum being present , having just arrived at this point , I turned over the command to him . This evening I have read an order stating that if General Slocum was present he would assume command . 59 I believe I have handled these two corps to-day from a little past eleven until four o'clock , - when General Hancock assisted me in carrying out orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of your corps commanders could have done . Had we received reinforcements a little sooner , the first position assuiued by General iReynolds and held by General Doubleday till my corps came up mi*ht have been maintained ; but the position was not a good one because both flanks were exposed , and a heavy force approaching from the north roads rendered it untenable , being already turned , so that I was forced to retire the command to the position now occupied , which I regard as a very strong one . The above has mortified and will disgrace me . Please inform me frankly if you disapprove my conduct to-day , that I may know what to do . I am , * , eneral , very respectfully , your obedient servant , 0 . 0 . HOWARD , Major- General Commanding . General Sickles had meanwhile arrived with the third corps , and placed his command on our left , extending the line , heartily approving the position and distribution of the troops . CLOSE OF FIRST DAY 'S BATTLE . Thus ended the first day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No sane man expected a victory over Lee 's army to be gained with an advance guard ; twenty-two thousand infantry against sixty thousand of the same blue-eyed Saxon race , in an open country , where there was no pass to be defended , no mountain or river to be used as an auxiliary obstacle . The first and eleventh corps and Buford 's small division of cavalry did wonders : held the vast army of General Lee in check all day ; took up a strong position ; fou*ht themselves into it , and kept it for the approaching army of the Potomac to occupy with them , so as to meet the foe with better prospects of victory . General Lee saw our position , was deceived as to our numbers , and therefore waited for the remainder Campaign and Battle of aettysburg. // of his army before re-attacking . But the battle cost us many valuable lives . Doubleday fixes his loss at upwards of five thousand . General Buford 's and Schurz 's would probably reach four thousand , killed , wounded , and prisoners ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen thousand . Barlow with more than a thousand other wounded men was left in the hands of the enemy . Mrs. Barlow generally kept near the field of battle where ber husband was engaged , for be seldom escaped a shot . He was wounded in many battles . After Antietam he recovered with great difficulty and many drawbacks , under his wife 's most careful nursing . I shall never forget Mrs . Barlow 's coming up to the cemetery and saying she must go to her husband . She started at once down the Baltimore pike into the town , but the skirmishers would not cease firing to enable her to pass that way ; then she returned and took another course , going west across the fields , where everybody could see her to be a non - combatant . This time she passed through both lines unharmed , and reached her diusband . General Slocum , with whom I had been acquainted at West Point , and with whom I had become better acquainted during our service together in the army of the Potomac , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up to Gettysburg to participate in the action , and only sent his troops late in the afternoon at my request . He explained the course he took by showing that it was contrary to the plan and purpose of General Meade to bring on the battle at Gettysburg , he having arranged for another defensive position at Pipe Clay Creek . I think he did wrong to delay , and was hardly justified under the circumstances , even by the written orders of General Meade ; still , in all his previous history and subsequent lengthy service by my side in the West and South he showed himself a patriot in spirit , a brave man , and an able commander . As the result proved , it is perhaps as well that he did not come earlier , for he and his troops were fresh for the very hardest fighting on subsequent days . I must speak of General Steinwehr . He came upon the field with a hearty spirit , ready to do his part . During the retreat he kept his men steadily in position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of battle , probably the most important in the annals of our war , was formed . SECOND DAY 'S BATTLE ; MEADE 'S ARRIVAL . Generals Slocum and Sickles and myself took up our quarters for the night near the cemetery gate . About three o'clock on the morning of the 2d , General Meade and staff appeared at the cemetery . The first words he said to me were in substance that " he was very sorry to have seemed to cast any discredit upon me ; he had no blame to affix . " General Butterfield , it seems ( according to his own testimony ) , as soon as Reynolds 's death was known at Taneytown , had urged General Meade to go to Gettysburg himself , or send there his chief of staff . Meade not thinking this best , Butterfield said he ought to send some one on the field fully possessed of his views and intentions ; adding , " I should entrust that duty to General Hancock . " Meade assented , and Butterfield then drew the order accordingly , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me under the general command of an officer my senior in years and service in the old army , but my junior in the volunteer appointment . From these statements it is now easy to understand General Meade 's attitude toward me . He may have been prejudiced , but certainly , as I nn ( lerstOod the matter at the time , General Meade really intended , and Hancock so implied in his conversation with me , that he ( Hancock ) was to represent Meade as Butterfield , the chief of staff , would have done on the field of battle . Of course it will make very little difference to posterity whether I served under Hancock unwittingly for two hours // and a half , or not . But it is of importance to me and to mine to explain the facts of the case . General Meade then asked me concerning the position . I said , " I am confident we can hold this position . " " I am glad to hear you say so , " he replied , " for it is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is a good place to fight from , general . " After a brief conversation concerning the location of the troops , as the dawn was just appearing in the east , we rode along the lines in rear of the sleeping soldiers , and the general saw for himself how much these lines needed strengthening and extension . The ( different corps , except the sixth , were near at hand for this work . General Meade , stationed near where the soldiers ' monument now is , took an officer 's survey of the whole field , as the sun was rising at his back . The cannonade , which began and continued for an hour from a Confederate battery situated near Blochor 's house beyond our right , and was replied to by our own guns , and the rattling of musketry along the picket-lines , intensified every faculty of observation , He could see Cemetery Ridge almost like a bastioned fort on his right , where it was broken by the valley of Rock Creek , with Culp 's Hill fringed with trees for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baltimore pike for its face . This ridge , turning near the town , passed in front of him , gradually diminishing in elevation , till , just beyond Zeigler 's Grove , on his left , it is scarcely higher than the ground for a quarter of a mile in its front . He noticed then , a little farther to the south , what we called at the time Little Round Top , a small rocky spur rising abruptly , and beyond this a higher hill of the same nature , more wooded and more extended , called Big Round Top . Beginning at the crossing of Rock Creek , off to the right and rear of IMeade 's post of observation , near McAllister 's mill , and letting the eye sweep around westward by Culp 's Hill to the highest point of Cemetery Hill , thence southward to the farthest end of Big Round Top , General Meade beheld the natural formation destined to be covered by his lines of infantry . It was shaped like a fishing - hook ( to which several writers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mill , the convex bend at the Cemetery lull near Gettysburg , and the shank representing the remainder of the line . The position of the enemy could be divined only by glimpses of batteries , location of skirmish lines , and general probabilities . Meade could see Oak or Seminary Ridge running north and south a mile to the westward , partially covered with trees . He caught the motion of a column of infantry far to the north* moving towards our right . lie saw the several roads converging toward the town , the rolling interval to the northwest , the detached hills to the north and beyond Rock Creek , which were in view , and evidently afforded excellent positions to the enemy for placing artillery on our front and flank , so as to bring a concentrated fire upon the cemetery . The general stood here in this magniflee nt morning light with a panorama spread before him of hill and valley and mountain , of woodland and cultivated farms , of orchard and grassland , as beautiful as nature anywhere furnishes . But he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning for himself ; plan against plan , move against move . In a few minutes he turned away slowly and thoughtfully , rode back to the gate , and soon after , the army lines began to take new form . Geary 's division of Slocum 's corps passed from the left , near Zeigler 's Grove , to the east of Culp 's Hill , and Williams 's division extended thence to McAllister 's mill ; this located the twelfth corps line , partially intrenched or covered by rocks and trees on the extreme right . Wadsworth 's division of the first corps stayed and for tified Culp 's Hill , where Hancock placed it the evening before . Ames 's division of the eleventh corps carried on the line to the steep part of Cemetery Ridge , facin* , northwest . There were Schurz 's and Steinwehr 's divisions behind the famous stone wall and the apple orchard near town . Doubleday 's and Robin1876. 61 // son 's divisions , first corps , came next in order , strengthened by Stannard 's brigade of Vermont troops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched up from Taneytown the night before , under General Gibbon , to within three miles of the battle-field , now filed into place , extending south over the lower land , from and beyond Zeigler 's Grove . Then Sickles 's third corps was moved to the left and farther west than Hancock 's , a part being in front of Little Round Top . About eight o'clock A. M. , the fifth corps , commanded by General Sykes , coming in along the Hanover road , marched through the fields to a position as a temporary reserve in rear of Little Round Top . General Pleasanton 's cavalry corps was disposed beyond Rock Creek to protect our flanks , General Gregg commanding a division operating on the extreme right , near the Bonnaugbtown road , and General Kilpatrick 's division , on the extreme left beyond Bi* Round Top , pushin0 towards the Emmettsburg road . General Buford 's division of cavalry , that had served so faithfully during the preliminary operations , was withdrawn from Sickles 's left , where I had placed it , and sent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster . General Sedgwick , as soon as he received his orders on the night of the 1st , set his sixth corps in motion from Westminster about nine o'clock r . M. , and marched all night and the next day , with scarcely a halt , making thirty-four or thirty-five miles in seventeen hours . At two p. lvi . I saw this corps move to the rear of the first and second corps , forming each brigade in line in rear of the preceding . As soon as a brigade had reached its position the officers and men unslung their blankets and lay down , covering themselves for rest ; they were soon sleeping soundly . General Meade 's head-quarters were established at Mrs. Leister 's house , situated on the Taneytown road not far to the southeast of Zeigler 's Grove , a point that proved to be more exposed to the enemy 's artillery fire than any other within our lines , except the cemetery itself . LEE 'S POSITION . In rear of and near the middle of his own lines , where the Chambersburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone house of Mrs. Mary Marshall , General Robert E. Lee made his headquarters . They had an advantage over General Meade 's , hem0 less exposed to the fire and more commanding as a post of observation . His troops after getting into place were situated as follows : Ewell with three divisions opposite our right , Johnston 's division having his left beyond Rock Creek at Benner 's Hill , and Early 's division extending the line to near town , the two confronting Sbcum , Wadsworth , and Ames . Then Rhodes 's line , passing through Gettysburg along Middle Street , stretched out toward the Seminary Hill or Oak Ridge . Hill 's corps of three divisions faced the eleventh corps ( my own ) , the first ( General Newton commanding ) , and the second ( Hancock 's ) , extending from the Shippensburg road to and a little beyond the Hagerstown road ; his divisions were commanded by Heath , Pender , and Anderson , in the order named . Longstreet 's corps continued the line along the Oak Ridge and across the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the right of MeLaws 's , and Pickett 's in reserve . Lee 's cavalry was not much used till near the close of the engagements at Gettysburg , being allowed to rest after its arduous service in the preliminary campaign and long raids around our right flank . General Lee 's artillery officers had placed their guns on every favorable position , as I have intimated , on front and flanks , having for use two hundred and seventyfive guns . General Hunt , Meade 's chief of artillery , saw to the posting of our batteries . Cemetery Ridge was covered with them , and batteries or parts of batteries were placed wherever there was an available point . I took my head-quarters in the cemetery at the highest point , where the ridge slopes to the eastward , very near the place where the monument now is . The officers and men were rested and encouraged hy the usual // influence of complete arran* , ement , confident movements , and large auxiliaries . OPENING OF THE BATTLE . My record of the opening of this battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other corps were moving into position until about four i*. in . Just before this , orders had been issued to the my divisions to make ready for battle , as the enemy was reported advancing on our left . iNow the enemy opened fire from some dozen batteries Hunt says one hundred and twenty guns , to our right and front , bringing a concentrated fire upon our position . " Osborne and Wainwright replied with spirit . Projectiles filled the air ; they went over us and set ambulances , spare wagons , and a host of army followers into rapid motion farther to the rear , for shelter . A part fell short and were harmless , or occasionally exploded , throwing out their fragments to trouble the artillery men and horses , or to rattle among the tombstones . Seldom did a shell explode on the crest where the infantry was lying ; but now and then one more murderous than the rest would strike a regiment . One such shell , I remember , killed in a single regiment of ours twenty-seven men . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively at work during this cannonade . My attention was called to a young artilleryman who ran backward and forward from the gun to the limber , carrying ammunition . He was singing and whistling , and very active . As a shot or shell came near , the horses would spring to one side or pull back . He would then run to their heads and straighten the team , and return to his work , exhibitin * no impatience . Just as I was remarking him for his heartiness and lively conduct , a solid shot struck him on his thi*h ; he gave one sharp cry , and was no more . One who stood near me at this time writes , " Then came a storm of shot and shell ; marble slabs were broken , iron fences shattered , horses disemboweled . The air was full of wild , hideous noises , the low buzz of round shot , the whizzing of elongated bolts , and the stunning explosion of shells overhead and all around . . . . In three minutes after our batteries opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of artillery . " Undoubtedly General Lee made up his mind from careful observation that the hills , Little nud Big Round Top , afforded the key to our position . Could he get a lodgment on these heights , a single battery might be so placed as to paralyze our whole centre and right . There would be an enfilading fire , sweeping the troops of Hancock , Newton , and myself , and a reverse fire - or fire from the rear - upon the rest of our line . LONGSTEEET S ATTACK ON SICKLES . General Sickles , for the time constituting our left , had moved his corps forward to the slight ridge of land that runs obliquely from the cemetery southwest towar ( ls Oak Ridge taking around considerably in advance of Hancock 's left . The position itself was doubtless intrinsically better for meeting an assault than the continuation of Hancock 's line at that time , but it isolated the third corps and exposed its flank to be turned . While Longstreet made the main attack here , Ewell was to attack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work opposite his own place in the general line , that Meade might not reinforce . In perhaps three quarters of an hour after the batteries began , there was for a few minutes a lull in the firing , when it again opened with redoubled violence on our left . Hood and McLaws in line moved to the attack . The division on Sickles 's left , extending back from the peach orchard , rested its flank on Big Round Top . The brigades of Wood and Dc Trobriand on that flank received the first onslaught , but , being posted as well as could be under the circumstances in that advanced position , returned the enemy 's fire with vigor and effect . Graham 's brigade , making an angle just north of the orchard , and with little cover , met a fearfully destructive fire 1876. 63 // almost simultaneous with that on the left ; it did not hold its ground long , though the contest at the peach orchard , and at Rose 's house , a little to the south of it , was somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Bigelow 's fired rapidly from a position near A. Trostle 's barn , and when forced to retire , did so with the prolonge , keeping up the fire . The Confederates , pressing back the broken infantry line , came upon this battery with a rush . Bigelow is said to have blown them from the muzzles of his guns , but still they came on , and clambered over his limbers and shot his horses . Five of his non - commissioned officers and twenty-two of his men were killed or wounded , and he himself wounded in the side . Still he held on and fired till the corps chief of artillery , MeGilvery , had brought up his reserve battery to the high ground in his rear . These brave men brought off only two guns , but they had done their part in delayin0 ' Lon*street 's advance . General Humphreys s division , being opposite A. P. Hill 's men , was not hotly engaged till our troops on his left had been for some time in the fight ; buthy six i*. 11. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after making all possible resistance he retired slowly and in very good order to the position of Hancock . During this fearful conflict between the Round Tops and the Emmettsburg road , groves , orchards , trees , knolls , stone walls , large rocks , and every natural obstacle or cover had been taken advantage of by our men in retiring , and by the enemy in advancing , so that the necessary delay was effected to enable General Meade to do what it would of course have been wise to do before , namely , get the fifth corps upon the heights at the left . Birney had called for this corps as reThforcement before the action began . General Sykes is said to have replied " that he would be up in time , that his men were making coffee and were tired . " The spirit of the men going into battle is all important . The coffee and the resting are often absolutely necessary to the soldier , to enable him to keep on his feet and bear his part . General Meade and not General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly in position to reinforce Birney , in case of need , in a very few minutes . But to my mind there is a remarkable providence in the fact so much complained of , namely , that " General Sickles had taken up an advanced position ; " for thus lie caused the delay of Longstreet , and enabled Meade to put Sykes into position to save his extreme left , which was the very high ground that Lee made his main attack to secure . General Sickles was severely wounded , losing his leg . He called upon Meade for rei*nforeements , and turned over his command to Birney . While the fifth corps was moving into position , General Warren , Meade 's chief engineer , kept the signal flags waving on Little Round Top , detached Jlazlett 's battery and ' supported it by Vincent 's brigade of Barnes 's division , and undertook to secure this vital point , lie was just in time , for Hood 's men were upon them in five minutes ; but they had our best troops to meet . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the precipitous cra , s , only to be hurled back again . " Never was there a wilder place for combat , and never was there a combat more fierce than was seen there on that hot July evening , with blazing musketry and hand-to-hand struggles , with clubbed fire-arms and jagged stones . For half an hour this conflict went on , when a charge from the twentieth Maine , under Colonel Chamberlain , hurled the Texans from the hill . " Chamberlain occupied the left of the line , while Vincent 's brigade and Weed 's brigade of Ayer 's division and Crawford 's division broke Hood 's and MeLaws 's advance farther to the right . General Hancock , after Sickles 's wound , was given the care of the two corps , the second and third . He pressed forward rei$nforcements as they were needed . From my post of observation I could see brigades and divisions move out westward , with their flags flying and their bayonets gleaming I Lossing // in the sunlight ; then the fearful rattling of the musketry would follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Humplireys , on retiring , reached the open space at his rear , he thought for a moment the day was lost , and the enemy thought their victory sure . But in a few moments Meade had sent forward Wheaton 's division of the sixth corps , and the other fresh troops just named ; the new line was complete ; then , as soon as Humphreys 's men were out of the way , a sheet of fire opened from Zeigler 's Grove to Little Round Top , and the enemy were repulsed . Histories , reports , testimonies , and letters are crowded with thrilling incidents in the battle I have outlined . General Weed fell at Hazlett 's battery on Little Round Top . Lieutenant Hazlett saw his commander fall , and as he hastened to him to catch his last words , he was struck by a bullet and fell dead across the body of his general . General Vincent , commanding the supporting brigade of Hazlett 's battery , fell while standing , in an elevated position where he could see and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross , in Caldwell 's division of Hancock 's corps , commanded the brigade that I had led during McClellan 's campaign . His regiment was the fifth New Hampshire . He was tall , handsome , with a clear , black , restless eye , and a warm heart . Nothing seemed to please him better than the excitement of battle . He is said to have been wounded nine times in previous combats . He exclaimed , a few hours after the fatal shot had struck , " I did hope I would live to see peace and our country restored ! General Zook , of New York , in the same division , was another that I counted as a personal friend . He fell in CaIdwell 's advance . I remember distinctly his high character , pleasant face , and genial companionship , and can hardly realize that he is gone . My brother , who is a minister , having been sent by the Christian Commission , was moving around relieving the wounded , and found his own cousin , Major S. P. Lee , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took charge 65 of him and carefully nursed him till he became convalescent . NIGhT ENGAGEMENT . After the struggle had closed , and when we supposed we should have a rest for the night , some troops in our front , said to be the " Louisiana Tigers , " sprang from their cover under the steep hill on the north end of Cemetery Ridge , broke through Ames 's division , and in three minutes were upon our batteries , Wiedrick 's and others , almost without firin* , a shot . General Schurz by my order sent a part of a brigade under Colonel Krizanowski to the batteries ' immediate relief ; the artillerymen left their guns , and used sponge - staffs , handspikes , or anything they could lay hold of , to beat back the enemy , and as soon as help came the batteries were cleared . Schurz also sent a brigade farther to the right to help General Green , who requested reiinforcements . I sent to Meade for more troops , as a part of Ames 's division was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firing , had detached Colonel S. S. Carroll , with his spirited brigade , to my aid . His men formed at right angles to the general line , and swept swiftly over the highest ground northward , carrying everything before them . Generals Steinwehr and Newton immediately filled any gaps made on my left by sudden withdrawals . This night engagement extended as far as Slocum had any troops . It was Ewell 's effort on our right to assist Lee 's main attack after Williams 's and a part of Geary 's divisions had been withdrawn , and ordered off to r&amp;inforce the right . The enemy 's troops took quiet possession of the points vacated , and really slept within our lines , but the ground was so rough , and the woods so thick , that their generals did not realize till morning what they had gained . This then was the condition of things at the close of the second day . Lee held Sickle* s advance position of the morning , and part of our rifle - pits or barricades between Mc Allister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill . Lee modestly says , " These partial successes determined me to continue the assault next day . " THIRD DAY 'S BATTLE . The detachments of the twelfth corps ( Williams 's division strengthened by Lockwood 's bri0ade ) that had given efficient help on the left during the 2d of July , and two brigades of Geary 's division , which Meade says did not reach the scene of action from having mistaken the road , attempted after night to return to their breastworks on the extreme right of our line ; but , as I have intimated , they found them already occupied by Johnston 's Confederates . General Slocum was at this time in command of more troops than the twelfth corps , and General A. S. Williams had the latter . Williams made arrangements to attack the enemy at daylight and regain the position formerly occupied by the corps.1 I slept with others inside of a family lot in the cemetery , beside an iron fence , with a grave mound for a pillow . Being very weary , for want of rest on previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I heard quick and sharp musketry firing , with an occasional sound of artillery . It began like the pattering of rain on a fiat roof , only louder , and was at first intermitted . Then it would ineren e in volume of sound till it attained a continuous roar . Of course I sent at once to the right and to headquarters to ascertain what the firing meant . The reply came shortly , " The twelfth e rps is regaining its lines . " By seven o ci ck the battle was fully joined . The Confederates were determined to hold on , and disputed the ground witk great obstinacy . But after a lively contest of fiv*e hours , Ewell was driven beyond Rock Creek , and the breastworks were reoceupied and held . I went over this ground five years after the battle , and marks of the struggle were still to be observed : the moss on the rocks was discolored in hundreds of places where the bullets had struck ; the trees , as cut 1 See General Meade 's corrected report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were still there ; stumps and trees were perforated with holes where leaden balls had since been dug out , and remnants of the rough breastworks remained . I did not wonder that General Geary , who was in the thickest of this fight , thought the main battle of Gettysburg must have been fought there . CAVALRY COMBATS ON THE FLANK . Stuart 's cavalry made a demonstration at this time beyond Ewell . General Gregg 's division , by iPleasanton 's direction , engaged the enemy in an artillery duel near the Bonnaughtown road , and checked his advance so as to prevent mischief from that quarter . About this time our bold , sanguine Kilpatrick moved his division of cavalry over beyond the enemy 's right , near the Emmettsburg road , where Pleasanton later in the day directed him " to pitch in with all his might on Longstreet 's right . " In these combats of Kilpatrick several valuable officers lost their lives ; among them was General Farnsworth , in command of a brigade , near the time of Pickett 's repulse . Pleasanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows : " I have always been of the opinion that the demonstration of cavalry on our left materially checked the attack of the enemy on the 3d of July ; for General Hood , the rebel general , was attempting to turn our flank when he met these two brigades of cavalry , and the officers reported to me that at least two divisions of the rebel infantry and a number of batteries were held back , expecting an attack from us on that flank . " LAST CANNONADE AND ASSAULT . The last bloody contest at Gettysburg opened about one is . M. by a cannonade . Lee 's plan of attack was the same as that of the day before , except that Longstreet now had Pickett 's division , and Lee added one division and two brigades of A. P. Hill to the attacking column . Also there was a different massing of the artillery . Longstreet is said to have // brought together in his front , opposite the low ground north of Little Round Top , fifty-five long-range guns , and Hill massed some sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The signal-gun was fired by the enemy , and from the southwest , west , north , and northeast , his batteries opened , hurling into the cemetery grounds missiles of every description . Shells burst in the air , on the ground , at our right and left , and in front , killing men and horses , exploding caissons , overturning tombstones , and smashing fences . The troops hugged their cover , when they had any , as well as they could . One re , , iment of Steinwehr 's was fearfully cut to pieces by a shell . Several officers passing a certain path within a stone 's - throw of my position were either killed or wounded . The German boy holding our horses under the cover of the Cemetery Hill , on the eastern slope , near a large rock , had his left arm clipt off with a fragment of a shell . Men fell while eating , or while the food was in their hands , and some with cigars in their mouths . As there seemed to be actually no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly in front of four twelve - pound Parrott guns that played over our heads , almost every available space being covered with artillery . As the sabots ( the pieces of wood that are placed between the cartridges and the elongated shot ) would sometimes fly off and hit us when the guns fired , we made large piles of hard-bread boxes , and sat in front of them , watching the operations of the enemy with our glasses ; thus protected against our own guns , but exposed to the enemy 's . At half past two * . xt. we ceased to reply . We had ammunition and were not silenced , but we knew that this cannonade preceded an attack , and we thought it possible the enemy would conclude that we had been stopped by their effective shots , and would proceed to the contemplated assault ; then we should need batteries in readiness , and plenty of ammunition . We were right . The firing of the enemy lulled , and I could see , better than the day before , their infantry in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was exposed to my view , as it started from Oak Ridge , opposite our left . It was like an extensive parade ; the flags were flying and the line steadily advancin , , . As I now know , these were Pickett 's and Petegrew 's divisions and part of Anderson 's . On , on they came . As soon as they were near enough Osborne , Wainwright , McElvery , and other artillery ekiefs started the fire of their batteries . first with solid shot , making hardly any impression , soon with shells exploding near and over and beyond the advancing line . Now gaps were plainly made , but quickly filled . When nearer , the canister was freely used , and the gaps in the enemy 's line grew bigger and harder to close . Soon this array caine within short musketry range of our full long line in their front , all concealed by temporary cover , breastworks , stone walls , and trenches . As if by some simultaneous impulse , the whole line fired and continued to fire rapidly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw no longer any enemy 's line . There was running in every direction . Regiments of ours from Steinwehr 's position to Round Top were moving into the valley with their flags flyin0 and apparently without much order , taking flags , guns , and prisoners , and bringing them in . General Hancock commanded the majority of the troops on that front of attack , namely , the first , second , and third corps ; Newton having the first , Gibbon the second , and Birney the third , during this day 's combat . Hancock says : - " The shock of the assault fell on the second and third divisions of the second corps ; and those were the troops , assisted by a small brigade of Vermont troops , together with the artillery of our line , which fired from Round Top to Cemetery Hill at the enemy , all the way as they advanced , whenever they had the opportunity . . . . No doubt there were other troops that fired a little , but these were the troops that really withstood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wounded at the close of the assault , and that ended my operations with the army for that campaign . " Campaign and Battle of aettysburg. // General Hancock mentions the fact that General Gibbon was also wounded during this assault , and thinks that the absence of two commanders who knew thoroughly the circumstances at such a moment as this was a great detriment ; otherwise , advantage would have been taken of the enemy 's repulse by our making a decisive advance . Longstreet 's troops on the right of his attacking column attempted to turn our left , as I have previously stated , and such of them as were beyond our infan-. try were held in check by Kilpatrick 's cavalry , while the remainder made nothing more than a demonstration against Big Round Top . But it is represented in the reports that as Ayer 's regulars were disputing with the foe the possession of the ground near Little Round Top , General Meade himself made a visit to that point , accompanied by several general officers . He asked what command that was occupying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of Sykes 's corps , he directed Sykes to order Crawford to advance and clear the woods in his front . General Crawford says : " I directed the command at once to advance . Hardly had the men unmasked from the hill before a battery of the enemy , stationed on a ridge beyond the wheat field , opened with grape and canister . " Crawford 's skirmishers pushed forward , and began to fire upon the cannoneers . The battery limbered up and fled . Crawford adjusted his line and charged across the wheat field and into the piece of wood beyond , driving a brigade of Georgia troops , of Hood 's division , before him , capturing 260 prisoners , a gun , caisson , 7000 stand of arms , and all the wounded that had been there for some time uncared for . Crawford in this gallant charge , initiated by General Meade himself , retook the ground that had been lost the day before , and ended the battle . Our entire loss is reported at 23 ,  - -  186 , of whom 2834 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is difficult to ascertain Lee 's losses . We had in our hands upwards of 7000 wounded Confederates , the most of whom were so severely injured that they could not accompany the retiring army . The hospital record gives the number 7262 . If we deduct this from the whole number of prisoners , which I believe is understated by General Mende at 13,621 , it gives us 6359 well prisoners . The most moderate estimate that I have seen of the enemy 's loss in killed is 5500 . Now , if we place the number who were not *o severely wounded as to be left behind , and those who escaped from the field and did not fall into our hands but were lost to the enemy , at 10,000 ( probably the number was much greater ) , we have 29,121 for the aggregate of Lee 's losses . Another classmate of mine besides Weed was killed during this engagement , but on the other side , General Pender . He had a division in Hill 's corps . The Richmond Enquirer blamed him for too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner . He was of rather small stature , full of quaint humor when a cadet , and quite popular . Our mathematical professor at West Point , Guy Peck , used to say to him , in his inimitable style , as he would ask some queer question during recitation : " Do n't be facetious , Mr. Fender . " It was told me at this time that General Armistead , one of Pickett 's brigade commanders , started with his brigade , and moved straight forward till he reached our batteries . He had his hat on the point of his sword , pressing forward with his men diminishing in number till his surrender , when he had less than ten left . He was several times wounded , and died within our lines . AFTER THE BATTLE . Nothing can ever give an adequate pictur* of that field of battle during the night of Friday and the two following days . There is an exhilaration in the preparation for conflict , there is spirited excitement during the storm of the heated engagement ; but who can bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces of the dying , or of the pale , quiet sufferers who lie for hours and sometimes days for their turn to 68 // lose an arm or a leg at the hands of the overtasked surgeon ? I saw , just before leaving the cemetery on the 5th of July , a large plat of *round covered with wounded Confederates , some of whom had been struck on the first and some on the second day 's battle , not yet attended to . The army surgeons , and the physicians who now flocked to their aid by every incoming railroad train from the North , were doing their best , yet it took time and unremitting labor to go through the mass . The dirt and blood and pallor of this bruised mass of humanity affected me in a manner 1 can never forget , pleading pathetically for peace and good-will toward men . A story is told by Hon. E. P. Smith of an army chaplain ( William R. Eastman , seventy - second New York regiment ) , the son of the secretary of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His horse , plunging during the battle , struck him on the knee-pan ; . . . the pain became almost unendurable . As he lay suffering and thinking , he heard a voice : Oh my God ! ' He thought , Can anybody be swearing in such a place as this ! He listened again : a prayer began . He tried to draw up his stiffened limb , but he could not rise . He then thought , I can roll ; and over and over he rolled , in pain and blood , and by dead bodies , till he reached the dying man , and prayed with him . At length one of the line officers came up and said , Where s the chaplain ? One of the staff officers is dying . ' here he is ! ' cried out the sufferer . Can you come and see a dying officer ? ' I can not move . ' If I detail two men to carry you , can you go ? ' Yes . ' They took him gently up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore him over the field and laid him down beside bleedin0 , dying men , while he preached Christ , and prayed . " Would that every regiment at Gettysburg had had such a true hero for a chaplain , *nd that he had been desired and permitted thus to do his lawful work ! The annals of the celebrated Christian Commission , of which the noble , indefatigable George H. Stuart was president , show the truly Christian work that was done through this channel at Gettysburg , in the alleviation of human suffering and the lifting up of human hearts into perennial joy . These facts relieve the gloom somewhat . SLOWNESS OF PURSUIT . I have never been able satisfactorily to account for General Meade 's apparent reluctance to push in his reserves promptly , after the repulse of the third day . He could have struck Lee 's right flank vigorously with twenty thousand fresh men before Lee could have recovered from the shock of his defeat , and before Ewell could with safety have brought reinforcements from his left . General Hancock testifies that Meade said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifth and sixth corps on the enemy 's flank . He ( Meade ) said " he had ordered the movement , but the troops were slow in collecting , and moved so slowly that nothing was done before night , " except what I have related of the ( livision of General Crawford , who commanded the Pennsylvania reserves . I have thought that the fearful exposure of General Meade 's head-quarters , where so many of his general and staff officers were wounded , and where so much havoc was occasioned by the enenly 's artillery , had so impressed Gcneral Meade that he did not at first realize the victory he had won . This he would have done from some other post of observation . Had he thus realized the situation , he would not at such a time have tolerated slowness on the part of afly of his lieutenants . Still , it is well for our countrymen to remember that this was the end of three days of extraordinary anxiety and excitement . Officers and men were quite ready to be satisfied with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-needed rest , and were fearful of losing , by a too sudden advance , what had already been gained . And doubtless the greater sense of responsibility felt by the commanding general 1876. 69 // had the effect to increase his natural conservatism . As soon as the news of Lee 's defeat reached General French at Frederick , he reoccupied Harper 's Ferry and destroyed Lee 's bridge across the Potomac ; so that it would seem that his defeated army was almost at our disposal . He withdrew from our front , during the night of the 4th of July , by the way of Fairfield and Caslitown , and pushed on as rapidly as he could to Williamsport . The circumstance of the retreat and our slow pursuit , the stand of Lec at the river , our council of war , where Wadsworth , Pleasanton , and myself urged an immediate attack , and our failure to attack , are familiar to all who were connected with the army . THE THANKS OF CONGRESS ; PRESIDENT LINCOLN . When General Meade and his army received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said on the floor of the Senate , " As I have read the history of that campaign , the man who selected the position where the battle of Gettysburg was fought , and who , indeed , fought it on the first day , was General Howard ; and to him the country is indebted as much for the credit of securing that victory as to any other person . I wish , therefore , as a reco0 nition of his merits , to couple his name with that of General Meade in the vote of thanks . " It was so done . And surely I had a right to he glad and proud of this unsought and unexpected testimonial . But as it was intimated to me , after Lee 's escape , that it was believed that I was ambitious for the command , for Meade 's place , I wrote to Mr. Lincoln a letter which drew from him a - characteristic answer . Since neither of these letters has ever been in print , I insert them both at length . HEAD-QUARTERS ELEVENTH CoRPs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 , 1863 . ) To THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : SIR , - Having noticed in the news-July , papers certain statements bearing upon the battle of Gettysburg and subsequent operations which I deem calculated to convey a wrong impression to your mind , I wish to submit a few statements . The successful issue of the battle of Gettysburg was due mainly to the energetic operations of our present commandin* general prior to the engagement , and to the manner in which he handled his troops on the field . The reserves have never before , during this war , been thrown in at just the right moment ; in many cases when points were just being carried by the enemy , a regiment or brigade appeared , to stop his progress and hurl him back . Moreover , I have never seen a more hearty cooperation on the part of general officers than since General Meade took command . As to not attacking the enemy prior to leaving his stronghold beyond the Antietam , it is by no means certain that the repulse of Gettysburg might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the commanding general was in favor of an immediate attack ; but with the evident difficulties in our way , the uncertainty of a success , and the strong conviction of our best military minds against the risks , I must say that I think the general acted wise ly . As to my request to make a reconnoissance on the morning of the 14th , which the papers state was refused , the facts are that the general had required me to reconnoitre the evening before , and give my opinion as to the practicability of making a lodgment on the enemy 's left ; and his answer to my subsequent request was that the movements he had already ordered would subserve the same purpose . We have , if I may be allowed to say it , a commandin* , general in whom all the officers with whom I have come in contact express complete confidence . I have said thus much because of the censure and of the misrepresentations which have grown out of the escape of Lee 's army . Very respectfully your obedient serv ant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
