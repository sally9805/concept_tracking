txt One of the most remarkable contributions to political literature which we have seen for many a day is " BILL " KING 'S letter to the Minnesota Legislature . It is absolutely unique in quality , occasion , and . character . Many years ago , when J omq HOLMES , whose biting sarcasm made him the compeer of RANDOLPH and TRISTAM BURGESS , was a Senator from the then new State of Maine , he fell out with the Legislature of his State . It was about a question of politics , and the legislators censured HOLMES , and curtly suggested that he should resign . The sturdy old man wrote a letter , in which he lectured the Legislature on its duties , told them he should not resign , and , in the language of the region , " took the skin off " the men who presumed to send . him instructions to do anything . We can not believe that the ex-Postmaster of the House had in mind so ancient a precedent as that established by HOLMES , when he penned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose letter is a historical curiosity , was satirical ; KING is merely abusive . Moreover , the body which lectured HOLMES was the legitimate successor of that which had elected him . KING 'S legislative critics had no hand in sending him to Congress , and could not be held . responsible for his sins . Nevertheless , as the convention which nominated him had long since dissolved into its popular elements , and as the people who elected him had no longer any form of authoritative expression , the Legislature of the whole State might venture to speak for the Congressional district which KING proposes to represent in the next Congress . Indeed , it is a pretty nice point whether the people of a portion of a State , or the Legislature of the whole State , shall take cognizance of accusations brought against a Representative . We must suppose that the crafty ex-Postmaster saw his advantage , when he was greeted with the unwelcome resolutions demanding his resignation in default of an explanation of the charges of bribery preferred against him . But he seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the , allegation that he had been concerned in nefarious and . corrupt practices , he says , " You 're another . " His letter , stripped of all verbiage , amounts to just that . With what is meant to be fine sarcasm , he accuses hiscensors of " dealing in bogus half-breed scrip "  --  a variety of wickedness which has a local flavor , and of handling " swindling Government and Indian contracts "  --  a line of business which , we regret to say , is not confined to Minnesota nor to any class of legislators . He twits them with having only a sixtydays ' term of official life , and iterates and reiterates the , Samoa phrases of " lie , " " liars , " and " lying " in all their offensive variations . We are puzzled to know whether it is the man 's habitual politeness or a caustic sarcasm that impels him to call these " liars , thieves ' , and robbers , " by the formal title of " Gentlemen Senators , and Representatives . " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must think so meanly of his neighbors should persist in calling them cc gentlemen . " When Speaker , n oar own refined Democratic Assembly the other , day , had occasion to gird at a fellow-member , he explained that he used the epithet " gentleman " in speaking of him in the third person , purely in a Pickwickian sense . We submit that Mr. 's sarcasm was subtler , though none the less ill-bred , than Mr. KING 'S . Perhaps Mr. CLARK BELL , who addressed a Senate committee as " gents , " cane nearer the mark than either ; for he probably had in mind HOLMES ' line " A word not made for gentlemen , but gents . ' " The odd . thing about KING 'S letter , howevents its abrupt appearance out of indefinite space . The writer is " wanted , " as the Police would say . There is something the matter with his testimony before an investigating committee of Cong , ress . Between his word and Mr. Iuwnc 's word there is a great gulf fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lie out somewhere . " KING has been sought as diligently as though he were one of the lost arts , or a LIVINGSTONE iu the wilds of Africa . He is not found ; but when the Minnesota Legislature pass a series of blistering resolutions , there suddenly comes , without any mark to say in what quarter of the globe it originated , a letter from the wandering fugitive . It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that KING is in hiding . and that he will not appear until , to quote his own words , his " own good time " shall arrive . When he reminds his censors that they will soon " disappear into nothingness , " he forgets that he puts it in their power to retort that ho has already disappeared into a limbo quite as vague as any nothingness into which the average Minnesota law-maker can dissolve . There has been a great deal of mud thrown on both sides of this controversy . The Legislature have assailed KING on charges which are known all over the country . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pretend to say whether it has foundation or not . It is enough to know that this Minnesota politician is an adept in the ways of the small politics of his own State . It needed , apparently , some such accusation as that now brought against him to compel him to give a hint of what he knows about the corruption which he should have long ago exposed . It required a vote of the Legislature to oblige him to accuse the Chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee of " fingering and disbursing thousand-dollar checks . " Does the es Postmaster , now traveling his eccentric orbit somewhere in space , - want us to be reminded that when rogues fall out honest men get their dues I We must leave the Criminal Court of the District of Columbia and the House of Representatives to settle with KING . It is pretty clear that that " gentleman " will not try actual conclusions with the Legislature before it returns to the " nothingness " of which . he so derisively speaks .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
