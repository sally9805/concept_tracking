txt London , like Paris , is enjoying the sensation of an interdioted play . The offense this time appears to have been political , not social , and as the prohibition was issued after the drama had already been formally sanctioned , and then in due course acted , the affair is causing not a little commotion . On Monday . March 3 , the piece in question was brought out at the Court Theatre , which is under the matiagement of Miss Lrrrorr. ft is called " The Happy Land , " and , from the accounts , we gather that it is a broad political satire . Previously read . and licensed in the Lord Chamberlain 's office , in accordance with the usual- rale , the subsequent interdict is regarded as irregular , although it has not excited surprise . A correspondent of the Daily News expresses amazement , indeed , that the piece ever passed through the Lord Chamberlain 's office at all . But this is answered , in some measure , by the fact that Miss Lrrrorr was told , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an explanation , that the piece , as acted , did not tally with the copy deposited in the Lord . Chamberlain 's office . In other words , that changes had been made in the text . as acted . Anyhow . on the fourth night , the audience were informed that the authorities had forbidden " The Happy Land " to be repeated . It was added , on the part of the manager , that as the notice had been received too late to change the bills , she should take the risk and play the piece in spite of it . " The Happy Land " was , however , prudently withdrawn on Friday , although it was supposed a compromise would be effected and the drama reproduced almost immediately , with some alterations . " The Happy Land " is a general satire on popular government in England. ; but that in it which has chiefly given offense has been a lively caricature of Messrs . GLADSTONE , LOWE , and AYRTON . They are represented as having been sent for by the Queen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as they have carried on in a certain " happy land , " on earth . The three go to the moon and set everything by the ears , each riding his special hobbies until the Moonites think chaos is come again . The dress and manner of each Minister is elaborately burlesqued , and at one point the three sing a song with a chorus , and dance a breakdown at the end of every verse . The burden of Mr. GLADSTONE 'S verse is. that the Ministers of a " Happy Land " were willing , if not eager , to endure any amount of humiliation ? " Here a snub , there a snub , everywhere a snub . " Mr. AYRTON , on the other hand , goes in for any amount of contention ? " Here a row , there a row , everywhere a row . " And Mr. Lows indicates his parsimony by " Here a save , there a save , everywhere a save . " Finally , all three burst into a sort of Pyrrhic dance , with " Here a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The audience roared with applause at all this , and each night the piece was acted the theatre was crammed to overflowing . Before issuing his prohibition , it is stated that the Lord Chamberlain went to see " The Happy Land , " and , according to a correspondent of the Manchester Guardian , " enjoyed the fan of the political caricatures as heartilyas any one else . " The upshot of the piece is the conclusion on the part of the Moonites that if the results brought about by the three obnoxious Ministers are the legitimate fruit of " popular government , " they had better forthwith eschew popular gov ernmentand banish it forever from their midst ; and this they proceed to do . The Lord Chamberlain does not profess. it seems , to object to this , but rather to personal ridicule cast on Messrs . GLADSTONE . AYRTON . and LOWE . At last accounts , Miss LIrroN had proposed to omit having the faces of the three actors who personate those gentlemen from being " made up " in imitation of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Chamberlain to be objectionable . It is likely . therefore , that the next mail will bring us news that the prohibition has been withdrawn , and that " The Happy Land , " shorn of that which probably made it most attractive . has been restored to the boards of the Court Theatre .
