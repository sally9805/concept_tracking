txt Attorney-General DEVENS , having been applied to by the Treasury for an opinion as to the true construction of sections 3,408 and 5.214 , Revised Statutes , which imposes a tax on capital stock of national banks " beyond the average amount invested in United States bonds , " as to whether the amount so invested " is to be ascertained by taking tile price paiu or market value of these bonds , as is done by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue un ? der the first cited section , or by looking only at their face value , the method adopted by the Treasurer of the United States under the last-named section , " has replied that , in his view , the face value must be taken . The banks being taxed upon the excess of their stock over their investments in these bonds , the question practically is whether they shall be taxed upon the premium paid originally on the bonds , or upon the amount now represented by the premium in assets . The words above quoted , " the price paid or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internal Revenue , " are obscure , " price paid or market value " being very different things , and two of the things between which a choice must be made iu interpreting the law . It seems to us that the Attorney-General is grossly wrong , and as unfortunate in his reasons as in his conclusion , reminding us of the story of the old Judge who told his younger brother to let his decisions be anything he pleased , but to beware against entrapping himself by giving reasons . The reasons of the Attorney-General are " the certainty and uniformity particularly desirable in fixing a basis for taxation , as well as the common usage of speaking of the amount invested in any enterprise according to the par value of the shares owned , disregarding brokerage paid and accrued interest or earnings . " In cases of constvaing obscure language , usage may properly be appealed to , but considerations of convenience and uniformity  --  however desirable to attain both in taxing ? have nothing to do with construing the law , the question being solely what is meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A national bank organized with a million capital paid in ; it expended $830 , - 000 of this for $800,000 bonds at 110 ; the bonds are now worth $840,000 , at 105 ; is the " amount invested " par value , cost value , or present value ? The law does not , as it might have done , say what amount invested in bonds is to be tax free , nor how the bonds shall be reckoned ; a bank might so invest its profits until its total bonds exceeded its capital ; does the law mean to exempt all its bonds , or what then ? Now , if we read the law as equivalent to " the =bunt of its capital stock " or " the portion of its capital stock " invested in bonds , it seems indisputable that the sum paid for the bonds is the sum exempted , for that is precisely the part of capital stock thus invested ; in this view , cost value must be taken . On the other hand , the act of Feb. 25 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempting all of them from State taxation , in anybody 's hands ; the Banking act was passed while the issue of the war was still uncertain , and the inducement to help the bonds remained ; the clause in question levied a tax , subject to an exemption in favor of bonds , and the rational construction is that out of the desire to influence the ' banks to liberal sub ? scriptions , as well as to coax them into the new system , the intent was to exempt their entire bondholdings from the tax . By this view it is clear that either the cost value or the market value must be taken . Suppose the bonds had averaged 150 cost , would it be rational : to assume the harsh construction ? that ? only 100 should be exempt ? Or suppose the average cost had been 50 , would it be rational to assume 100 as the exempt value ? Either cost value or market value must be taken , it seems clear to us , but par value is utterly foreign to the case ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we take the reasonable construction to be that the excess of stock ? over bonds owned is. taxable . counting the latter at market value or at cost value , as one or the other is the higher . ' We conclude this , not to give the banks the advantage , but because the evident in- : tent was to offer them inducements to take the bonds , and because the common usage , to which Mr. DEVENS appeals , unforWnately for himself , is squarely against him . A 10 per cent . stock , bought at 50 , yields 20 on thatpurchase money , and a 5 per cent . stock , bought at 200 , yields 212 ; yet if the market price is 200 in the one case and . 100 in the other , the real yield on the money actually invested is 5 in each case , the rule being to compute interest as being yielded on the money locked up in the security , which is the market value , unless that has sunk be. : low cost ; when cost is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 was paid , and the market price is $110 , the holder 's interest is on the $110 he might sell for ; if the market price is 90 , his interest is on the $100 he has locked up . In reckoning assets , everybody counts what he has got  --  the sum for which he could exchange the security , premium being as much a part of the property as the par is . Does it admit of question that " the amount : " which the banks possess , invested in G overnments , is the amount for which those could be sold ? Supposing market value to decline below cost , what the banks would hold would still be the former ; in that case , we think the latter should be taken as the exemption , because , for the purpose and in view of the clear favorable intent of the exemption itself , it would be reasonable that the banks should go free on what they originally put in . The Banking act gives stated authority to tax hank shares , without specifying by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the exemption on bonds , and although the majority in the Supreme Court decided against them , Chief-Justice CEASE ( WAv:E and SIVAYNT concurring ) sustained their general position , saying that " the law demands true valuation , " that is , with deduction of bonds . Then the Tax Commissioners of this City assessed surplus as taxable , and the Gallatin Bank , about two years ago , claiming that shares should be assessed at par value , carried the case , by two successive appeals , to the Supreme Court , which in March last decided against it . The banks hold about $380,000,000 of bonds ; the total tax difference by reckoning these at par or at market value would not exceed $100 000 , Still , aside from the merits of the decision about the tax on surplus , it seems that if bank shares , for purposes of taxation , must be counted at market value , because that is the true and actual value in feet , the bonds of the banks , for purposes of tax exemption , should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasen . It is a matter of principle more than of money importance ; but consistency is worth something , and it seems a pat illustration of the disposition to hit banks all around that their shares must be counted by Government at the highest figure when they are to be taxed , and their bonds at the lowest when they are to be deducted from the taxable stock .
