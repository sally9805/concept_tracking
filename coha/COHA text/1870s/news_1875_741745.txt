txt It would doubtless be a great relief to the Police if residents in the City would bring themselves to the belief that burglary is an established institution ' among us ; to be tolerated . therefore , and not sunpressed . It would save the thieves some anxiety , . and it would lessen a little of , that unpleasant sensation which it is fair to suppose that even the Police Commissioners sometimes feel'at being constantly reminded by the pubs ' . : , that their department is inefficient , if not something worse . It would very much extend the area of good feeling too . The gentlemen who make it their business to break into our houses would not be required , in order to protect themselves , to murder their victims . So far , life would be rendered more secure . Every one could go to rest with the peaceful conviction that , although money and valuables might disappear during the night , there need be no throats cut nor any personal injury inflicted . Burglary would become a recognized occupation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their skill in the ' art . It would be deemed as essential that houses should not be broken into in a bungling way , as it is now the approved notion that surgeons should not take off legs or perform other operations in. an inartistic manner . But if anything near to this point in the progress of civilization can be attained , a hint has reached us from the city of Lyons , in France , which may be useful . There burglars are not recognized in high social circles any more than they are here , but they evince a high consideration for the people upon whom they prey . One of the qualifications for a first-class housebreaker in that city is the possession of a cultivated voice , with , of course , some knowledge of operatic music and popular melodies . Since this came to be insisted upon , the sensation of having the house pillaged has been rendered less unpleasant . Of course an individual burglar is of no use at all under such an arrangement . The owner of the family plate Would derive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while singing the last new song . But it Is very different when the thieves associate in bands , and openly parade the streets serenading the inhabitants , and engaging their attention while two or three of their number are operating at the basement of the nearest house . People who appreciate the rich music of cultivated voices can not fail to enjoy a treat of that kind , and if they do lose any valuables that may have been within reach of the strangers , they at least have the consolation of knowing that they got something in exchange . If there be any regret occasioned by the loss , it is tempered with the recollection of some very pleasurable moments . If this style of proceeding be something novel , as it seems to us it must be , the credit of introducing it must , it is said , be given to some traveling Italians . These gentlemen have been enchanting the people of Lyons with their extraordinary voices , and at the same time breaking into their houses with such consummate skill that all the efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been baffled ; and the French Police are rarely guilty of negative faults . They are much more likely to arrest half a dozen innocent men than to let a guilty one escape , if they can possibly help it , In the interest of all parties , therefore , the suggestion is a useful one . If all the burglars in New-York would learn to sing , they might contribute very much to the pleasures of the public , and possibly do a great deal toward cultivating the- national taste for classical music . At present they are a very , useless set of people . They do their stealing in a heartless manner , regardless of the duty of making some little return for the privilege accorded to them by the Police of subsisting upon plunder . Besides . if burglaries are not to be prevented , it would be much more agreeable to have our houses broken into and robbed to the strains of inspiriting music than it is under the prevalent old-fashioned system . If , therefore , the Police will not protect property , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so arrange with the thieves that robberies may henceforth be condueted - with a little more music than has hitherto been customary .
