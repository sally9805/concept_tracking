txt FRAUDS ON THE GOVERNMENT . A characteristic story is told of a country trader whose clerks sold a saddle to one of his regular customers and forgot to charge it on the books . Somebody must pay for it , and the canny storekeeper , finding that six of his regular patrons had bought goods during that day , ordered that the saddle be put into the account of each one of them . For , argued this profound student of human nature , the customers who have not bought a saddle will say so ; the right man will pay for it . When the bills were collected , after the Fall crop was sold , the trader found that five of the six customers had . paid for the saddle without demur . That is to say , four men were mulcted in order that the negligence of one clerk should be remedied . We can not say how much of the public and private business of this world is conducted on the same principle . In some largo business concerng the managers annually charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable sum to cover the negligence and dishonesty of their employes . In sonic eases , thousands of dollars go to this account to make up for losses incurred by loose calculations , CITOIS in bills , petty thefts , and by somo one or another of the numberless leaks which a vast business , employing many people , must sustain . Managers of banks , insurance and railroad companies , manufactories , and mercantile concerns use every effort to guard against fraud from within and without . In spite of their precautions , they continually sufferluss . They are not driven out of business , and , though their profits may be affected by these derelictions and petty conspiracies , they manage to get on by dividing the loss with their customers . If they sometimes saddle the whole deficiency on those whom they serve , the burden allotted . to each comes iu the shape of an enhanced price on whatever he buys , whether it may be a bill of exchange or a pound of tea . officials in high places can not prevent the purchase of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . On the other hand , it would be childish to say that we must give up the attempt to collect import and excise dues thoroughly because rogues will cheat the Government . It is the plain.duty of those who make the laws to remove as far as possible all temptation and opportunity from dishonest persons ; but , so long as the expenses of the Government must be met by some system of taxation , even this is a difficult duty . Of course , when taxes are lighter , there will be less inducement to evade them . When opium pays one hundred per cent . duty , John Chinaman smuggles the drug in his cue , his clothes , and his brazen idols . " When whisky pays a tax of ninety cents a gallon , the Missouri distiller runs his illicit liquor into hidden vats underground , perjures himself daily , and corrupts an entire force of detectives . If we add . to this statement that a vast body of public servants is appointed by means that have nowhere any responsible centre , the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be most difficult . Like prudent bankers and merchants , we may make our allowance for loss ; but we must not relax vigilance nor cease to hope that we may annually lessen temptation to crime . The Government annually transacts an enormous business . Its employes are numbered by thousands , and its customers comprise the entire population of the United States . When we consider how many people pay taxes , deal in bonds , import dutiable goods , and purchase lands of the Government , we gain some idea of the extent of the business done , and of the opportunities for fraud which are constantly afforded to customers and employes . Here is the " silk conspiracy , " as it is called , in which an enormous capital was required , a great force of men employed , and an intricate system maintained . The conspiracy ramified throughout the United States , and affected the business of several ports of entry . It involved the time and money of the Government 's customers , as well as the . presumed negligence or complicity of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly estimated at one million of dollars . This deficiency must be made up partly by the divided losses of holiest importers , and partly by the additional burden of tax-payers generally . So long as we raise a portion of the money needed to carry on the Government by a tariff on imported goods , dishonest men will endeavor to cheat the Government by evading that tariff , and thus secure an unlawful advantage of competitors iu trade who pay import dues . So of the excise ditties ; the temptation to evade payment of certain kinds of taxes is so great that legislators continually study to find objects for taxation that shall at once be easily accessible , fairly taxable , and also promise to yield nearly all of the amount levied . Nevertheless , they are often baffled . ? Every once in a while it conies out that enormous frauds have been carried on with such success that even the seizure and destruction of a vast business is not ruin to mon who have made enough by illicit trade to be able to balance their profits against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves a great number of men . Some of them were employes of the Government ; some of them were its customers , and professed to pay the lawful tax on whisky . We speak of their frauds as " gigantic . " So they are , because their business is gigantic ; the whisky interest is one of the largest in the country , and when a considerable portion of it became a conspiracy against the Government , it long defied detection , for it employed first-rate talent , costly machinery , and every device possible to men of large resources and abundant means . We saw , the other day , ' how it was possible for a gang of conspirators to rob a bank of hundreds of thousands , get away without detection , and then sell back to the President of the bank the same securities which Ile knew had been stolen out of his custody . This was a private transaction ; and the robbers are , to this day , unpunished , if not unknown , Their case would have been no dirThrent if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , it is expected , apparently , that the Government shall be better able , with its intricate machinery and divided responsibility of appointment , to escape with fewer losses , relatively speaking , than fall upon men who manage their own private or corporate affairs . It is undeniable that there is great need of reformation in the organization of the public service . In a country like ours , whore a vast territory makes necessary a great force of public servants , and where business affairs goubrally are not conducted with closeness and caution , fraud has abundant opportunities . It is undoubtedly true that men are sometimes put into the public service for the secret purpose of procuring confederates " on the inside . " In this way the Western Whisky Ring were able to defy detection for a good while . They received information before precautionary measures could reach them . The utmost vigilance on the part of public to cause much confusion and Wary , but hi is not strong enough to succeed .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
