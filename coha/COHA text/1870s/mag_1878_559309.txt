No . CCLXIV . SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER , 1878 . I. KIN BEYOND SEA . IT is now nearly half a century since the works of De Tocqueyule and De Beaumont , founded upon personal observation , brought the institutions of the United States effectually within the circle of European thought and interest . They were cooperators , but not upon an equal scale . IDe Beaumont belongs to the class of ordinary though able writers : Dc Tocqueville was the Burke of his age , and his treatise upon America may well be regarded as among the best books hitherto produced for the political student of all times and countries . But higher and deeper than the concern of the Old World at large in the thirteen colonies , now grown into thirty-eight States , besides eight Territories , is the special interest of England in their condition and prospects . I do not speak of political controversies between them and us , which are happily , as I trust , at an end . I do not speak of the vast contribution which from year to year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wealth and comfort of the other ; nor of the friendly controversy , which in its own place it might be well to raise , between the leanings of America to protectionism , and the more daring reliance of the old country upon free and unrestricted intercourse with all the world ; nor vot. cxxvn.  - -  *o. 264 13 // of the menace which , in the prospective development of her resources , America offers to the commercial pre*3minence of England . On this subject I will only say that it is she alone who , at a coming time , can , and probably will , wrest from us that commercial primacy . We have no title , I have no inclination , to murmur at the prospect . If she acqnires it , she will make the acquisition by the right of the strongest ; but , in this instance , the strongest means the best . She will probably become what we are now , the head servant in the great household of the world , the employer of all employed , because her service will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her than Venice , or Genoa , or Holland , has had against us . One great duty is entailed upon us , which we , unfortunately , neglect-the duty of preparing , by a resolute and sturdy effort , to reduce our public burdens , in preparation for a day when we shall probably have less capacity than we have uow to bear them . Passing by all these subjects , with their varied attractions , I come to another , which lies within the tranquil domain of political philosophy . The students of the future , in this department , will have much to say in the way of comparison between American and British institutions . The relationship between these two is unique in history . It is always interesting to trace and to compare constitutions , as it is to compare languages ; especially in such instances as those of the Greek states and the Italian republics , or the diversified forms of the feudal system in the different countries of Europe . But there is no parallel in all the records of the world to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her innumerable children over all the earth , to be the founders of half a dozen empires . She , with her progeny , may almost claim to constitute a kind of universal church in politics . But , among these children , there is one whose place in the world 's eye and in history is superlative : it is the American Republic . She is the eldest born . She has , taking the capacity of her land into view as well as its mere measurement , a natural base for the greatest continuous empire ever established by man . And it may be well here to mention , what has not always been sufficiently observed , that the distinction between continuous empire , and empire severed and dispersed over sea , is vital . The development which the republic has effected has been unex // ampled in its rapidity and force . While other countries have doubled , or at most trebled , their population , she has risen , during one single century of freedom , in ronnd numbers , from two millions to , forty-five . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the decennial stages of the progress thus far achieved , a series for the future ; and , reckoning upon this basis , I suppose that the very next census , in the year 1880 , will exhibit her to the world as certainly the wealthiest of all the nations . The huge figure of ? 1,000,000,000 , which may be taken roundly as the annual income of the United Kingdom , has been reached at a surprising rate ; a rate which may perhaps be best expressed by saying that , if we had started forty or fifty years ago from zero , at the rate of our recent annual increment , we should now have reached our present position . But while we have been advancing with this portentous rapidity , America is passing us by in a canter . Yet even now the work of searching the soil and the bowels of the territory , and opening out her enterprise throughout its vast expanse , is in its infancy . The England and the America of the present are probably the two strongest nations of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the America and the England of the future , that the daughter , at some no very distant time , will , whether fairer or less fair , be unquestionably yet stronger than the mother . " 0 matre forti fIlia fortior. " * But all this pompous detail of material triumphs , whether for the one or for the other , is worse than idle , unless the men of the two countries shall remain , or shall become , greater than the mere things that they produce , and shall know how to regard those things simply as tools and materials for the attainments of the highest purposes of their being . Ascending , then , from the ground-floor of material industry toward the regions in which these purposes are to be wrought out , it is for each nation to consider how far its institutions have reached a state in which they can contribute their maximum to the store of human happiness and excellence . And for the political student all over the world it will be beyond anything curious as well as useful to examine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparatus // the two greater branches of a race born to command have been minded , or indnced , or constrained , to work ont , in their seasevered seats , their political destinies according to their respective laws . No higher ambition can find vent in a paper such as this than to suggest the position and claims of the subject , and slightly to indicate a few outlines , or at least fragments , of the working material . In many and the mo3t fundamental respects the two still carry in undiminished , perhaps in increasing , clearness the notes of resemblance that beseem a parent and a child . Both wish for self-government ; and , however grave the drawbacks under which in one or both it exists , the two have , among the great nations of the world , made the most effectual advances toward the true aim of rational politics . They are similarly associated in their fixed idea that the force in which all government takes effect is to be constantly backed , aud , as it were , illuminated , by thought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time " bare the sword " ( IRom. xiii . 4 ) . Bare it , as the apostle says , with a mission to do right ; but he says nothing of any duty , or any custom , to show by reason that he was doing right . Our two governments , whatsoever they do , have to give reasons for it ; not reasons which will convince the unreasonable , but reasons which on the whole will convince the average mind , and carry it unitedly forward in a course of action , often though not always wise , and bearing within itself provisions , where it is unwise , for the correction of its own unwisdom before it grow to an intolerable rankness . They are governments , not of force only , but of persuasion . Many more are the concords , and not less vital than these , of the two nations as expressed in their institutions . They alike prefer the practical to the abstract . They tolerate opinion , with only a reserve on behalf of decency ; and they desire to confine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , as such , entirely free . They set a high value on liberty for its own sake . They desire to give full scope to the principles of self-reliance in the peoplp , and they deem self-help to be immeasurably superior to help in any other form  --  to be the only help , in short , which ought not to be continually , or periodically , put upon its trial , and // required to make good its title . They mistrust and mislike the centralization of power ; and they cherish municipal , local , even parochial liberties , as nursery-grounds , not only for the production here and there of able men , but for the general training of public virtue and independent spirit . They regard publicity as the vital air of politics ; through which alone , in its freest circulation , opinions can be thrown into common stock for the good of all , and the balance of relative rights and claims can be habitually and peaceably adjusted . It would be difficult , in the case of any other pair of nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common and so distinctive as has been given in this probably imperfect enumeration . There were , however , the strongest reasons why America could not grow into a reflection or repetition of England . Passing from a narrow island to a continent almost without bounds , the colonists at once and vitally altered their conditions of thought , as well as of existence , in relation to the most important and most operative of all social facts , the possession of the soil . In England , inequality lies imbedded in the very base of the social structure ; in America , it is a late , incidental , unrecognized product , not of tradition , but of industry and wealth , as they advance with various and , of necessity , unequal steps . Heredity , seated as an idea in the heart 's core of Englishmen , and sustaining far more than it is sustained by those of our institutions which express it , was as truly absent from the intellectual and moral store with which the colonists traversed the Atlantic as if it had been some forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargoes . Equality combined with liberty , and renewable at each descent from one generation to another , like a lease with stipulated breaks , was the groundwork of their social creed . In vain was it sought , by arrangements such as those concocted with the name of Baltimore or of Penn , to qualify the action of those overpowering forces which so determined the case . Slavery itself , strange as it now must seem , failed to impair the theory , however it may have imported into the practice a hideous solecism . No hardier republicanism was generated in New England than in the slave States of the South , which produced so many of the great statesmen of America . It may be said that the North , and not the South , had the // larger number of colonists , and was the centre of those commanding moral influences which gave to the country as a whole its political and moral atmosphere . The type and form of manhood for America was supplied neither by the iRecusant in Maryland , nor by the Cavalier in Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been a form and type widely different , could the colonization have taken place a couple of centuries , or a single century , sooner . Neither the Tudor nor even the Plantagenet period could have supplied its special form . The Reformation was a cardinal factor in its production ; and this in more ways than one . Before that great epoch , the political forces of the country were represented on the whole by the monarch on one side , and the people on the other . In the people , setting aside the latent vein of Lollardism , there was a general homogeneity with respect to all that concerned the relation of governors and governed . In the deposition of sovereigns , the resistance to abuses , the establishment of institutions for the defense of liberty , there were no two parties to divide the land . But , with the Reformation , a new dualism was sensibly developed among us . Not a dualism so violent as to break up the national unity , but yet one so marked and substantial that thenceforward it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent the entire English character , and the old balance of its forces . The wrench which severed the Church and people from the Roman obedience left for domestic settlement thereafter a tremendous internal question , between the historical and the new , which in its milder forms perplexes us to this day . Except during the short reign of Edward VI. , the civil power , in various methods and degrees , took what may be termed the traditionary side , and favored the development of the historical more than the individual aspect of the national religion . These elements confronted one another during the reigns of the earlier Stuarts , not only with obstinacy but with fierceness . There had grown up with the Tudors , from a variety of causes , a great exaggeration of the idea of royal power ; and this arrived , under James I. and Charles I. , at a rank maturity . Not less but even more masculine and determined was the converse development . Mr. ilallamn saw , and has said , that at the outbreak of the Great Rebellion the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one party but from both . In that mixed fabric had once been harmonized the ideas both of religions duty and of allegiance as related to it , which were now held in severance . The hardiest and dominating portion of the American colonists represented that severance in its extremest form , and had dropped out of the order of the ideas , which they carried across the water , all those elements of political Anglicism which give to aristocracy in this country a position only second in strength to that of freedom . State and Church alike had frowned upon them ; and their strong reaction was a reaction of their entire nature , alike of the spiritual and the secular man . All that was democratic in the policy of England , and all that was Protestant in her religion , they carried with them , in pronounced and exclusive forms , to a soil and a scene singularly suited for their growth . It is to the honor of the British monarchy that , upon the whole , it frankly recognized the facts , and did not pedantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the infant states . It is a thing to be remembered that the accusations of the colonies in 1776 were entirely leveled at the reigning king , and that a true acquittal was thus given by them to every preceding reign . Their infancy had been upon the whole what their manhood was to be , self-governed and republican . Their Revolution , as we call it , was like ours in the main , a vindication of liberties inherited and possessed . It was a conservative revolution ; and the happy result was that , notwithstanding the sharpness of the collision with the mother-country and with domestic loyalism , the thirteen colonies made provision for their future in conformity , as to all that determined life and mannersq with the recollections of their past . The two constitutions of the two countries express indeed rather the differences than the resemblances of the nations . The one is a thing grown , the other a thing made : the one a praxis , the other a pojesis : the one the offspring of tendency and indeterminate time , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Constitution is the most subtile organism which has proceeded from the womb and the long gestation of progressive history , so the American Constitution is , so far as I can see , the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man . It has had a century of trial , under the pressure of exigencies caused // by an expansion unexampled in point of rapidity and range ; and its exemption from formal change , though not entire , has certainly proved the sagacity of the constructors , and the stubborn strength of the fabric . One whose life has been greatly absorbed in working , with others , the institutions of his own country , has not had the opportunities necessary for the careful and searching scrutiny of institutions elsewhere . I should feel , in looking at those of America , like one who attempts to scan the stars with the naked eye . My notices can only be few , faint , and superficial ; they are but an introduction to what I have to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . America , whose attitude toward England has always been masculine and real , has no longer to anticipate at our hands the frivolous and offensive criticisms which were once in v'ogue among us . But neither nation prefers ( and it would be an ill sign if either did prefer ) the institutions of the other ; and we certainly do not contemplate the great Republic in the spirit of mere optimism . We see that it has a marvelous and unexampled adaptation for its peculiar vocation ; that it must be judged , not in the abstract , but under the fore-ordered laws of its existence ; that it has purged away the blot with which we brought it into the world ; that it bravely and vigorously grapples with the problem of making a continent into a state ; and that it treasures with fondness the traditions of British antiquity , which are in truth unconditionally its own , as well , and as much , as they are ours . The thing that perhaps chiefly puzzles the inhabitants of the old country is , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually disturbed by the business of the presidential elections ; and , still more , why they should raise to its maximum the intensity of this perturbation by providing , as we are told , for what is termed a clean sweep of the entire civil service , in all its ranks and departments , on each accession of a Chief Magistrate . We do not perceive why this arrangement is more rational than would be a corresponding usage in this country on each change of ministry . Our practice is as different as possible . We limit to a few scores of persons the removals and appointments on these occasions ; although our ministries seem to us , not unfrequently , to be more sharply severed from one another , // in principle and tendency , than are the successive Presidents of the great Union . It would be out of place to discuss in this article occasional phenomena of local corruption in the United States , by which the nation at large can hardly be touched ; or the mysterious manipulations of votes for the presidency , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious influences which are shaping the politics of the negroes and of the South . These last are corollaries to the great sliwe-question ; and it seems very possible that after a few years we may see most of the laborers , both in the Southern States and in England , actively addicted to the political support of that section of their countrymen who to the last had resisted their emancipation . But if there be those in this country who think that American democracy means public levity and intemperance , or a lack of skill and sagacity in politics , or the absence of self-command and self-denial , let them bear in mind a few of the most salient and recent facts of history , which may profitably be recommended to their reflections . We emancipated a million of negroes by peaceful legislation ; America liberated four or five millions by a bloody civil war ; yet the industry and exports of the Southern States are maintained , while those of our negro colonies have dwindled ; the South enjoys all its franchises , but we have , proh pudor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in Jamaica , the chief of our islands , than by the hard and vulgar , even where needful , expedient of abolishing entirely its representative institutions . The civil war compelled the States , both North and South , to train and embody a million and a half of men , and to present to view the greatest , instead of the smallest , armed forces in the world . Here there was supposed to arise a double danger . First , that , on a sudden cessation of the war , military life and habits could not be shaken off , and , having become rudely and widely predominant , would bias the country toward an aggressive policy , or , still worse , would find vent in predatory or revolutionary operations . Secondly , that a military caste would grow up , with its habits of exclusiveness and command , and would influence the tone of politics in a direction adverse to republican freedom . But both apprehensions proved to be wholly imaginary . The inun // merable soldiery was at once dissolved . Cincinnatus , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , the type and mould of a nation . The whole enormous mass quietly resnmed the habits of social life . The generals of yesterday were the editors , the secretaries , and the solicitors , of to-day . The just jealousy of the state gave life to the now-forgotten maxim of Judge Blackstone , who denounced as perilous the erection of a separate profession of arms in a free country . The standing army , expanded by the heat of civil contest to gigantic dimensions , settled down again into the framework of a miniature with the returning temperature of civil life , and became a power wellnigh invisible , from its minuteness , amid the powers which sway the movements of a society exceeding forty millions . More remarkable still was the financial sequel to the great conflict . The internal taxation for Federal purposes , which before its commencement had been nnknown , was raised , in obedience to an exigency of life and death , so as to exceed every present and every past example . It pursued and worried all the transactions of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest in the world , and the capital touched ? 560,000,000 . Here was provided for the faith and patience of the people a touchstone of extreme severity . In England , at the close of the great French war , the propertied classes , who were supreme in Parliament , at once rebelled against the Tory Government , and refused to prolong the income-tax even for a single year . We talked big , both then and now , about the payment of onr national debt ; but sixty-three years have now elapsed , all of them except two called years of peace , and we have reduced the huge total by about oneninth ; that is to say , by little over ? 100,000,000 , or scarcely more than ? 1,500,000 a year . This is the conduct of a state elaborately digested into orders and degrees , famed for wisdom and forethought , and consolidated by a long experience . But Ainerica continued long to bear , on her nnaccnstomed and still smarting shoulders , the burden of the war taxation . In twelve years she has reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at the rate of ? 13,000,000 for every year . In each twelve months she has done what we did in eight years ; her self-command , self-denial , and wise forethought for the future have been , to say the least , eightfold ours . These are facts which redound greatly to her honor ; and the historian // will record with surprise that an enfranchised nation tolerated burdens which in this conntry a selected class , possessed of the representation , did not dare to face , and that the most unmitigated democracy known to the annals of the world resolutely rednced at its own cost prospective liabilities of the state , which the aristocratic , and plutocratic , and monarchical Government of the United Kingdom has been contented ignobly to hand over to posterity . And such facts should be told out . It is our fashion so to tell them , against as well as for ourselves ; and the record of them may some day be among the means of stirring us up to a policy more worthy of the name and fame of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under some heavy and , I fear , increasing disadvantages , which amount almost to disabilities . Not , however , any disadvantage respecting power , as power is commonly understood . But , while America has a nearly homogeneous country , and an admirable division of political labor between the States individually and the Federal Government , we are , in public affairs , an overcharged and overweighted people . We have undertaken the cares of empire upon a scale , and with a diversity , unexampled in history ; and , as it has not yet pleased Providence to endow us with brain-force and animal strength in an equally abnormal proportion , the consequence is that we perform the work of government , as to many among its more important departments , in a very superficial and slovenly manner . The affairs of the three associated kingdoms , with their great diversities of law , interest , and circumstance , make the government of them , even if they stood alone , a business more voluminous , so to speak , than that of any other 33,000,000 civilized men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious devolution , it is probable that much might be done ; but nothing is done , or even attempted to be done . The greater colonies have happily attained to a virtual self-government ; yet the aggregate mass of business connected with our colonial possessions continues to be very large . The Indian Empire is of itself a charge so vast , and demanding so much thought and care , that , if it were the sole transmarine appendage to the crown , it would amply tax the best ordinary stock of human energies . Notoriously , it obtains from the Parliament only a small fraction of the attention it deserves . Questions affecting individuals , again , or small // interests , or classes , excite here a greater interest , and occupy a larger share of time , than perhaps in any other community . In no country , I may add , are the interests of persons or classes so favored when they compete with those of the public ; and in none are they more exacting , or more wakeful to turn this advantage to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our trade comes a breadth of liability not less large , to consider everything that is critical in the affairs of foreign states ; and the real responsibilities , thus existing for us , are unnaturally inflated by fast-growing tendencies toward exaggeration of our concern in these matters , and even toward setting up fictitious interests in cases where none can discern them except ourselves , and such Continental friends as practise upon our credulity and our fears for purposes of their own . Last of all , it is not to be denied that in what I have now been saying I do not represent the public sentiment . The nation is not at all conscious of being overdone . The people see that their House of Commons is the hardest working legislative assembly in the world ; and , this being so , they assume it is all right . Nothing pays better , in point of popularity , than those gratuitous additions to obligations already beyond human strength , which look like accessions or assertion of power ; such as the annexation of new territory , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Suez Canal . All my life long I have seen this excess of work as compared with the power to do it ; but the evil has increased with the surfeit of wealth , and there is no sign that the increase is near its end . The people of this country are a very strong people ; but there is no strength that can permanently endure , without provoking inconvenient consequences , this kind of political debauch . It may be hoped , but it can not be predicted , that the mischief will be encountered and subdued at the point where it will have become sensibly troublesome , but will not have grown to be irremediable . The main and central point of interest , however , in the institutions of a country is the manner in which it draws together and compounds the public forces in the balanced action of the state . It seems plain that the formal arrangements for this purpose in America , are very different from ours . It may even be a // question whether they are not , in certain respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rapid effect than those of the Union , to any formed opinion , and resolved intention , of the nation . In the formation of the Federal Government we seem to perceive three stages of distinct advancement : 1 . The formation of the Confederation , under the pressure of the War of Independence . 2 . The Constitution , which placed the Federal Government in defined and direct relation with the people inhabiting the several States . 3 . The struggle with the South , which for the first time , and definitely , decided that to the Union , through its Federal organization , and not to the State governments , were reserved all the questions not decided and disposed of by the express provisions of the Constitution itself . The great arcanum* irnperii , which with us belongs to the three branches of the Legislature , and which is expressed by the current phrase , " omnipotence of Parliament , " thus became the acknowledged property of the three branches of the Federal Legislature ; and the old and respectable doctrine of State independence is now no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquarianism . Yet the actual attributions of the State authorities cover by far the largest part of the province of government ; and , by this division of labor and authority , the problem of fixing for the nation a political centre of gravity is divested of a large part of its difficulty and danger , in some proportion to the limitations of the working precinct . Within that precinct the initiation , as well as the final sanction in the great business of finance , is made over to the popular branch of the Legislature , and a most interesting question arises upon the comparative merits of this arrangement , and of our own method , which theoretically throws upon the crown the responsibility of initiating public charge , and under which , until a recent period , our practice was in actual , and even close , correspondence with this theory . We next come to a difference still more marked . The Federal Executive is born anew of the nation at the end of each four years , and dies at the end . But , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person both of the President and of his ministers , alike of the people , of their representatives , and of that remarkable body , the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern jpolitics , the // Senate of the United States . In this important matter , whatever be the relative excellences and defects of the British and American systems , it is most certain that nothing would indnce the people of this country , or even the Tory portion of them , to exchange our own for theirs . It may , indeed , not be obvious to the foreign eye what is the exact difference of the two . Both the representative Chambers hold the power of the purse . But in America its conditions are such that it does not operate in any way on behalf of the Chamber or of the nation , as against the Executive . In England , on the contrary , its efficiency has been such that it has worked out for itself channels of effective operation , such as to dispense with its direct use , and avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote of the House of Commons , declaring a withdrawal of its confidence , has always sufficed for the purpose of displacing a ministry ; nay , persistent obstruction of its measures , and even lighter causes , have conveyed the hint , which has been obediently taken . But the people , how is it with them ? Do not they in England part with their power , and make it over to the House of Commons , as completely as the American people part with it to the President ? They give it over for four years ; we for a period which on the average is somewhat more : they , to resume it at a fixed time ; we , on an unfixed contingency , and at a time which will finally be determined , not according to the popular will , but according to the views which a ministry may entertain of its duty or convenience . All this is true ; but it is not the whole truth . In the United Kingdom , the people as such can not commonly act upon the ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gain the end : for they can work upon that which works upon the ministry , namely , on the House of Commons . Firstly , they have not renounced , like the American people , the exercise of their power for a given time ; and they are at all times free by speech , petition , public meeting , to endeavor to get it back in full by bringing about a dissolution . Secondly , in a Parliament with nearly 660 members , vacancies occur with tolerable frequency ; and , as they are commonly filled up forthwith , they continually modify the color of the Parliament , conformably , not to the past , but to the present feeling of the nation ; or , at least , of the constituency , // which for practical purposes is different indeed , yet not very different . But , besides exercising a limited positive influence on the present , they suppiy a much less limited indication of the future . Of the members who at a given time sit in the House of Commons , the vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit there again , after a dissolution which may come at any moment . They therefore study political weather-wisdom , and in varying degrees adapt themselves to the indications of the sky . It will now be readily perceived how the popular sentiment in England , so far as it is awake , is not meanly provided with the ways of making itself respected , whether for the purpose of displacing and replacing a ministry , or of constraining it ( as sometimes happens ) to alter or reverse its policy , sufficiently , at least , to conjure down the gathering and muttering storm . It is true , indeed , that every nation is of necessity , to a great extent , in the condition of the sluggard with regard to public policy ; hard to rouse , harder to keep aroused , sure after a little while to sink back into his slumber . They have a vast but an encumbered power ; and , in their struggles with overweening authority , or with property , the excess of force , which they undoubtedly possess , is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his knowledge of their weakness , and by his command of opportunity . But this is a fault lying rather in the conditions of human life , than in political institutions . There is no known mode of making attention aud inattention equal in their results . It is enough to say that in England , when the nation can attend , it can prevail . So we may say , then , that in the American Union the Federal Executive is independent for each four years both of the Congress and of the people . But the British ministry is largely dependent on the people whenever the people firmly will it ; and is always dependent on the House of Commons , except when it can safely and effectually appeal to the people . So far , so good . But if we wish really to understand the manner in which the queen 's Government over the British Empire is carried on , we must now prepare to examine into sharper contrasts than any which our path has yet brought into view . The power of the American Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passes from him to his successor . His ministers , grouped around him , are the servants , not only of his office , but of his mind . The intelligence which carries on the Government has its main seat in him . The responsibility of failures is understood to fall on him ; and it is round his head that success sheds its halo . The American Government is described truly as a government composed of three members , of three powers distinct from one another . The English Government is likewise so described , not truly , but conventionally . For in the English Government there has gradually formed itself a fourth power , entering into and sharing the vitality of each of the other three , and charged with the business of holding them in harmony as they march . This fourth power is the ministry , or more properly the cabinet . For the rest of the ministry is subordinate and ancillary ; and , though it largely shares in many departments the labors of the cabinet , yet it has only a secondary and derivative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present British Constitution is worth having , which does not take this fourth power largely and carefully into view . And yet it is not a distinct power , made up of elements unknown to the other three ; any more than a sphere contains elements other than those referable to the three co6rdinates which determine the position of every point in space . The fourth power is parasitical to the three others ; and lives upon their life , without any separate existence . One portion of it forms a part , which may be termed an integral part , of the House of Lords , another of the House of Commons ; and the two conjointly , nestling within the precinct of royalty , form the inner council of the crown , assuming the whole of its responsibilities , and in consequence wielding , as a rule , its powers . The cabinet is the threefold hinge that connects together for action the British Constitution of king or queen , Lords , and Commons . Upon it is concentrated the whole strain of the Government , and it constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working system of the state , although the ultimate superiority of force resides in the representative Chamber . There is no statute or legal usage of this country which requires that the ministers of the crown should hold seats in the // one or the other House of Parliament . It is , perhaps , upon this account that , while most of my countrymen would , as I suppose , declare it to be a becoming and convenient custom , yet comparatively few are aware how near the seat of life the observance lies , how closely it is connected with the equipoise and unity of the social forces . It is rarely departed from , even in an individual case ; never , as far as my knowledge goes , on a wider scale . From accidental circumstances it happened that I was a Secretary of State between December , 1845 , and July , 1846 , without a seat in the House of Commons . This ( which did not pass wholly without challenge ) is , I believe , by much the most notable instance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last fifty years that our constitutional system has completely settled down . Before the reform of Parliament it was always easy to find a place for a minister excluded from his seat ; as Sir iRobert Peel , for example , ejected from Oxford University , at once found refuge and repose in Tamworth . I desire to fix attention on the identification , in this country , of the minister and the member of a House of Parliament . It is , as to the House of Commons especially , an inseparable and vital part of our system . The association pf the ministers with the Parliam*nt , and through the House of Commons with the people , is the counterpart to their association as ministers with the crown and the prerogative . The decisions that they take are taken under the competing pressure of a bias thisway and a bias that way , and strictly represent what is termed in mechanics the composition of forces . Upon them , thus placed , it devolves to provide that the Houses of Parliament shall loyally counsel and serve the crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its obligations to the nation . I will not presume to say whether the adoption of the rule in America would or would not lay the foundation of a great change in the Federal Constitution ; but I am quite sure that the abrogation of it in England would either alter the form of government , or bring about a crisis . That it conduces to the personal comfort of ministers I will not undertake to say . The various currents of political and social influences meet edgewise in their persons , much like the conflicting tides in St. George 's Channel or the Straits of Dover ; for while they are the ultimate regulators of the relations between the crown on the one side , and the // people through the Houses of Parliament on the other , they have no authority vested in them to coerce or censure either way . Their attitude toward the Houses must always be that of deference , their language that of respect , if not submission . Still more must their attitude and language toward the sovereign be the same in principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though upon them lies the ultimate responsibility of deciding what shall be done in the crown 's name in every branch of administration , and every department of policy , coupled only with the alternative of ceasing to be ministers , if what they ma advisedly deem the requisite power of action be denied them . In the ordinary administration of the government t e sovereign personally is , so to speak , behind the scenes ; performing , indeed , many personal acts by the sign-manual , or otherwise ; but , in each and all of them , covered by the counter-signature or advice of ministers who stand between the august personage and the people . There is , accordingly , no more power , under the form of our Constitution , to assail the monarch in his personal capacity , or to assail through him the line of succession to the crown , than there is at chess to put the king in check . In truth , a good deal , though by no means the whole , of the philosophy of the British Constitution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against which the only reproach  --  the reproach of Lord Bacon-is that it is hardly a relaxation , but rather a serious tax upon the brain . The sovereign in England is the symbol of the nation 's unity , and the apex of the social structure ; the maker ( with advice ) of the laws ; the supreme governor of the Church ; the fountain of justice ; the sole source of honor ; the person to whom all military , all naval , all civil service is rendered . The sovereign owns very large properties ; receives and holds , in law , the entire revenue of the state ; appoints and dismisses ministers ; makes treaties ; pardons crime , or abates its punishment ; wages war , or concludes peace ; summons and dissolves the Parliament ; exercises these vast powers for the most part without any specified restraint of law ; and yet enjoys , in regard to these and every other function , an absolute immunity from consequences . There is no provision in the law of the United Empire , or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account ; // and only in one solitary and improbable but perfectly defined case-that of his submitting to the jurisdiction of the pope-is he deprived by statute of the throne . Setting aside that peculiar exception , the offspring of a necessity still freshly felt when it was made , the Constitution might seem to be founded on the belief of a real infallibility in its head . Less , at any rate , can not be said than this . Regal right has , since the Revolution of 1688 , been expressly founded upon contract ; and the breach of that contract destroys the title to the allegiance of the subject . But no provision , other than the general rule of hereditary succession , is made to meet either this case or any other form of political miscarriage or misdeed . It seems as though the genius of the nation would not stain its lips by so much as the mere utterance of such a word ; nor can we put this state of facts into language more justly than by saying that the Constitution would regard the default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , and would simply trust to the inherent energies of the several orders of society for its legal reconstruction . The original authorship of the representative system is commonly accorded to the English race . More clear and indisputable is its title to the great political discovery of constitutional kingship . And a very great discovery it is . Whether it is destined , in any future day , to minister in its integrity to the needs of the New World , it may be hard to say . In that important branch of its utility which is negative , it completely serves the purposes of the many strong and rising colonies of Great Britain , and saves them all the perplexities and perils attendant upon successions to the headship of the Executive . It presents to them , as it does to us , the symbol of unity , and the object of all our political veneration , which we love to find rather in a person than in an abstract entity , like the state . But the Old World , at any rate , still is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre of civilization , and to hold the primacy of the race ; and of this great society the several members approximate , in a rapidly-extending series , to the practice and idea of constitutional kingship . The great states of Christendom , with only two exceptions , have , with more or less distinctness adopted it . Many of them , both great and small , have thoroughly assimilated it to their system . The autocracy of Russia , and the Republic of France , each of them congenial to // the present wants of the respective countries , may yet , hereafter , gravitate toward the principle which elsewhere has developed so great an attractive power . Should the current that has prevailed through the last half - century maintain its direction and its strength , another fifty years may see all Europe adhering to the theory and practice of this beneficent institution , and peaceably sailing in the wake of England . No doubt , if tried by an ideal standard , it is open to criticism . Aristotle and Plato , nay , Bacon , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some men would draw disparaging comparisons between the medieval and the modern king . In the person of the first was normally embodied the force paramount over all others in the country , and on him was laid a weight of responsibility and toil so tremendous that his function seems always to border upon the superhuman ; that his life commonly wore out before the natural term ; and that an indescribable majesty , dignity , and interest , surround him in his misfortunes , nay , almost in his degradation ; as , for instance , amid " The shrieks of death , through Berkeley 's roof that ringShrieks of an agonizing king . " * For this concentration of power , toil , and liability , milder realities have now been substituted ; and ministerial responsibility comes between the monarch and every public trial of necessity , like armor between the flesh and the spear that would seek to pierce it ; only this is an armor at once living and impregnable . It may be said by an adverse critic that the constitutional monarch is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms ; but that those who wield the arms , and those alone , constitute the true governing authority . And no doubt this is so far true , that the scheme aims at associating in the work of government with the head of the state the persons best adapted to meet the wants and wishes of the people , under the condition that the several aspects of supreme power shall be severally allotted ; dignity and visible authority shall lie wholly with the wearer of the crown , but labor mainly , and responsibility wholly , with its servants . Hence , without doubt , it follows that , should differences // arise , it is the will of those , in whose minds the work of government is elaborated , that in the last resort must prevail . This capital and vital conseqnence flows ont of the principle that the political action of the monarch shall everywhere be mediate , and conditional upon the concurrence of confidential advisers . It is impossible to reconcile any , even the smallest , abatement of this doctrine with the perfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in England no disloyalty more gross , as to its effects , than the superstition which affects to assign to the sovereign a separate , and , so far as separate , transcendental , sphere of political action . Anonymous servility has , indeed , in these last days , hinted such a doctrine ; * but it is no more practicable to make it thrive in England than to rear the jungles of Bengal on Salisbnry Plain . There is , indeed , one great and critical act , the responsibility for which falls momentarily or provisionally on the sovereign : it is the dismissal of an existing ministry , and the appointment of a new one . This act is usually performed with the aid drawn from authentic manifestations of public opinion , mostly such as are obtained through the votes or conduct of the House of Commons . Since the reign of George III . there has been but one change of ministry in which the monarch acted without the support of these indications . It was when William IV. , in 1834 , dismissed the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though after a lukewarm fashion , by a large majority of the existing House of Commons . But the royal responsibility was , according to the doctrine of our Constitution , completely taken over , ex 908t facto , by Sir Robert Peel , as the person who consented , on the call of the king , to take Lord Melbourne 's office . Thus , though the act was rash , and hard to justify , the doctrine of personal immunity was in no way endangered . And here we may notice that in theory an absolute personal immunity implies a correlative limitation of power , greater than is always found in practice . It can hardly be said that the king 's initiative left to Sir Robert Peel a freedom perfectly unimpaired . And most certainly it was a very real exercise of personal power . The power did not suffice for its end , which was to overset the Liberal predominance ; but it very // nearly sufficed . Unconditionally entitled to dismiss the ministers , the sovereign can , of course , choose his own opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count upon the people . William IV. , in the year 1834 , had neither Parliament nor people with him . His act was within the limits of the Constitution , for it was covered by the responsibility of the acceding ministry . Put it reduced the Liberal majority from a number certainly beyond three hundred to about thirty ; and it constituted an exceptional but very real and large action on the politics of the country , by the direct will of the king . I speak of the immediate effects . Its eventual result may have been different ; for it converted a large , disjointed mass into a smaller but organized and sufficient force , which held the fortress of power for the six years 1835- ' 41 . If the royal intervention anticipated and averted decay from natural causes , then , with all its immediate success , it defeated its own real aim . But this power of dismissing a ministry at will , large as it may be under given circumstances , is neither the safest nor the only power which , in the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wearer of the crown . He is entitled , on all subjects coming before the ministry , to knowledge and opportunities of discussion , unlimited save by the iron necessities of business . Though decisions must ultimately conform to the sense of those who are to be responsible for them , ye* their business is to inform and persuade the sovereign , not to overrule him . Were it possible for him , within the limits of human time and strength , to enter actively into all public transactions , he would be fully entitled to do so . What is actually submitted is supposed to be the most fruitful and important part , the cream of affairs . In the discussion of them the monarch has more than one advantage over his advisers . He is permanent , they are fugitive ; he speaks from the vantage-ground of a station unapproachably higher ; he takes a calm and leisurely srurvey , while they are worried with the preparatory stages , and their force is often impaired by the pressure of countless detail . He may be , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every discovery of a blot , that the studies of the sovereign in the domain of business enable him to make , strengthens his hands and enhances his authority . It is plain , then , that there is abundant // scope for mental activity to be at work under the gorgeous robes of royalty . This power takes spontaneously the form of influence , and the amount of it depends on a variety of circumstances - on talent , experience , tact , weight of character , steady , untiring industry , and habitual presence at the seat of government . In proportion as any of these might fail , the real and legitimate influence of the monarch over the course of affairs would di-. minish ; in proportion as they attain to fuller action , it would increase . It is a moral , not a coercive influence . It operates through the will and reason of the ministry , not over or against them . It would be an evil and a perilous day for the monarchy were any prospective possessor of the crown to assume or claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , in any one department of the state . The ideas and practice of the time of George III. , whose will in certain matters limited the action of the ministers , can not be revived , otherwise than by what would be , on their part , nothing less than a base compliance , a shameful subserviency , dangerous to the public weal , and , in the highest degree , disloyal to the dynasty . Because , in every free state , for every public act , some one must be responsible ; and the question is , " Who shall it be * " The British Constitution answers , " The minister , and the minister exclusively . " That he may be responsible , all action must be fully shared by him . Sole action , for the sovereign , would mean undefended , unprotected action ; the armor of irresponsibility would not cover the whole body against sword or spear ; a head would project beyond the awning , and would invite a sunstroke . The reader , then , will clearly see that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Constitution , or to a right judgment upon it , than the distinction between the sovereign and the crown . The crown has large prerogatives , endless functions essential to the daily action , and even the life , of the state . To place them in the hands of persons who should be mere tools of a royal will , would expose those powers to constant unsupported collision with the living forces of the nation , and to a certain and irremediable crash . They are , therefore , intrusted to men who must be prepared to answer for the use they make of them . This ring of responsible ministerial agency forms a fence around the // person of the sovereign , which has thus far proved impregnable to all assaults . The august personage who from time to time may rest within it , and who may possess the art of turning to the best account the countless resources of the position , is no dumb and senseless idol ; but , together with real and very large means of influence upon policy , enjoys the undivided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is likewise the first and by far the weightiest among the forces which greatly mould , by example and legitimate authority , the manners , nay , the morals , of a powerful aristocracy and a wealthy and highly-trained society . The social influence of a sovereign , even if it stood alone , would be an enormous attribute . The English people are not believers in equality ; they do not , with the famous Declaration of July 4 , 1776 , think it to be a self-evident truth that all men are born equal . They hold rather the reverse of that proposition . At any rate , in practice they are what I may call determined inequalitarians ; nay , in some cases , even without knowing it . Their natural tendency , from the very base of British society , and through all its strongly-built gradations , is to look upward ; they are not apt to " untune degree . " The sovereign is the highest height of the system ; is , in that system , like Jupiter among the Roman gods , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secundum. " * Not , like Mont Blanc , with rivals in his neighborhood , but like Ararat or Etna , towering alone and unapproachable . The step downward from the king to the second person in the realm is not like that from the second to the third : it is more even than a stride , for it traverses a gulf . It is the wisdom of the British Constitution to lodge the personality of its chief so high that none shall under any circumstances be tempted to vie , or to dream of vying , with it . The office , however , is not confused , though it is associated , with the person ; and the elevation of official dignity in the monarch of these realms has now for a testing period worked well in conjunction with the limitation of merely personal power . In the face of the country the sovereign and the ministers are an absolute unity . The one may concede to the other ; but the * Hor. , Od . I. , xii. , 18. // limit of concessions by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try the experiment of changing his government ; and the limit of concession by the ministers is at the point where they become unwilling to bear what in all circumstances they must bear while they remain ministers , the undivided responsibility of all that is done in the crown 's name . But it is not with the sovereign only that the ministry must be welded into identity . It has a relation to sustain to the House of Lords , which need not , however , be one of entire unity , for the House of Lords , though a great power in the state , and able to cause great embarrassment to an administration , is not able by a vote to doom it to capital punishment . Only for fifteen years , out of the last fifty , has the ministry of the day possessed the confidence of the House of Lords . On the confidence of the House of Commons it is immediately and vitally dependent . This confidence it must always possess , either absolutely from identity of political color , or relatively and conditionally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority in the Chamber has put the machine for the moment out of gear , and the unsafe experiment of a sort of provisional government is tried ; much as the Roman Conclave has sometimes been satisfied with a provisional pope , deemed likely to live for the time necessary to reunite the fractions of the prevailing party . I have said that the cabinet is essentially the regulator of the relations between king , Lords , and Commons , exercising functionally the powers of the first , and incorporated , in the persons of its members , with the second and the third . It is , therefore , itself a great power . But let no one suppose it is the greatest . In a balance nicely poised a small weight may turn the scale , and the helm that directs the ship is not stronger than the ship . It is a cardinal axiom of the modern British Constitution that the House of Commons is the greatest of the powers of the state . It might , by a base subserviency , fling itself at the feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season of exhaustion allow the slow persistence of the Lords , ever eying it as Lancelot was eyed by iMlodred , to invade its just province by baffling its action at some time propitious for the purpose . But no constitution can anywhere keep either sovereign , or Assembly , or nation , true to its trust and to itself . All that can be done has been done . The // Commons are armed with ample powers of self-defense . If they use their powers properly , they can only be mastered by a recurrence to the people , and the way in which the appeal takes effect is by the choice of another House of Commons more agreeable to the national temper . Thus the sole appeal from the verdict of the House is a rightful appeal to those from whom it received its commission . This superiority in power among the state forces was in truth established even before the House of Commons became what it now is , representative of the people throughout its entire area . In the early part of the century a large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peerage , or from the crown , or by the direct action of money on a mere handful of individuals , or , as in Scotland , for example , from constituencies whose limited numbers and upper-class sympathies usually shut out popular influences . A real supremacy belonged to the House as a whole ; but the forces of which it was compounded were not all derived from the people , and the aristocratic power had found out the secret of asserting itself within the walls of the popular Chamber , in the dress and through the voices of its members . Many persons of gravity and weight saw great danger in a change like the first Reform Act , which left it to the Lords to assert themselves thereafter by an external force , instead of through a share in the internal composition of a body so formidable . Bnt the result proved that they were sufficiently to exercise , through the popular will and choice , the power which they had formerly put in action without its sanction , though within its proper precinct and with its title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by far superior , in the force of its political attributes , to any other single power in the state . But it is watched ; it is criticised ; it is hemmed in and about by a multitude of other forces : the force , first of all , of the House of Lords , the force of opinion from day to day , particularly of the highly anti-popular opinion of the leisured men of the metropolis , who , seated close to the scene of action , wield an influence greatly in excess of their just claims ; the force of the classes and professions ; the just and useful force of the local authorities in their various orders and places . Never // was the great problem more securely solved , which recognizes the necessity of a paramount power in the body politic to enable it to move , but requires for it a depositary such that it shall be safe against invasion , and yet inliibited from aggression . The old theories of a mixed government , and of the three powers , coming down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the living British Constitution , are cold , crude , and insufficient , to a degree that makes them deceptive . There is still lacking an amalgam , a reconciling power , what may be called a clearing-house of political forces , which shall receive into itself everything , and shall balance and adjust everything , and , ascertaining the net result , let it pass on freely for the fulfillment of the purposes of the great social union . Like a stout bufferspring , it receives all shocks , and within it their opposing elements neutralize one another . This is the function of the British cabinet . It is perhaps the most curious formation in the political world of modern times , not for its dignity , but for its subtilty , its elasticity , and its many-sided diversity of power . It is the complement of the entire system ; which appears to want nothing but a thorough loyalty in the persons composing its several parts , with a reasonable intelligence , to insure its bearing , without fatal damage , the wear and tear of ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of centuries to bring the British cabinet to its present accuracy and fullness of development ; for the first rudiments of it may perhaps be discerned in the reign of Charles I. Under Charles IT . it had fairly started from its embryo ; and the name is found in the contemporary diary of Pepys . It was for a long time without a ministerial head ; the king was the head . While this arrangement subsisted constitutional govermnent could be but half established . Of the numerous titles of the IRevolution of 1688 to respect , not the least remarkable is this , that the great families of the country , and great powers of the state , made no effort , as they might have done , in the hour of its weakness , to aggrandize themselves at the expense of the crown . Nevertheless , for various reasons , and , among them , because of the foreign origin , and absences from time to time , of several sovereigns , the course of events tended to give force to the organs of government actually on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uplift , this as yet novel creation . So late , however , as the impeachment of Sir Robert Walpole , his friends thought it expedient to urge on his behalf in the House of Lords that he had never presumed to constitute himself a prime-minister . The breaking down of the great offices of state by throwing them into commission , and last among them of the Lord High Treasurership after the time of Harley , Earl of Oxford , tended , and may probably have been meant , to prevent or retard the formation of a recognized chiefship in the ministry , which even now we have not learned to designate by a true English word , though the use of the imported phrase " premier " is at least as old as the poetry of Burns . Nor can anything be more curiously characteristic of the political genius of the people than the present position of this most important official personage . Departmentally , he is no more than the first named of five persons , by whom jointly the powers of the Lord Treasurership are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , otherwise than by mere priority , their head ; and he has no special function or prerogative under the formal constitution of the office . He has no official rank , except that of a privy councilor . Eight members of the cabinet , including five Secretaries of State , and several other members of the Government , take official precedence of him . His rights and duties as head of the administration are nowhere recorded . He is almost , if not altogether , unknown to the statute law . Nor is the position of the body over which he presides less singular than his own . The cabinet wields , with partial exceptions , the powers of the Privy Council , besides having a standingground , in relation to the personal will of the sovereign , far beyond what the Privy Council ever held or claimed . Yet it has no connection with the Privy Council , except that every one , on first becoming a member of the cabinet , is , if not belonging to it already , sworn a member of that body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular committees for education and for trade . But the cabinet has not even this degree of formal sanction to sustain its existence . It lives and acts simply by understanding , without a single line of written law or constitution to determine its relations to the monarch , or to the // Parliament , or to the nation ; or the relations of its members to one another , or to their head . It sits in the closest secrecy . There is no record of its proceedings , nor is there any one to hear them , excePt upon the very rare occasioi*s when some important functionary , for the most part military or legal , is introduced , pro h4c vice , for the purpose of giving to it necessary information . Every one of its members acts in no less than three capacities : as administrator of a department of state ; as member of a legislative chamber ; and as a confidential adviser of the crown . Two at least of them add to those three characters a fourth ; for , in each House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers should be what is termed its leader . This is an office the most indefinite of all , but not the least important . With very little of defined prerogative , the leader snggests , and in a great degree fixes , the course of all principal matters of business , supervises and keeps in harmony the action of his colleagues , takes the initiative in matters of ceremonial procedure , and advises the Honse in every difficulty as it arises . The first of these , which would be of but secondary consequence where the Assembly had time enough for all its duties , is of the utmost weight in our overcharged House of Commons , where , notwithstanding all its energy and all its diligence , for one thing of consequence that is done , five or ten are despairingly postponed . The overweight , again , of the House of Commons is apt , other things being equal , to bring its leader inconveniently near in power to a primeminister , who is a peer . He can play off the House of Commons against his chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily most rare , when he has served him very ugly tricks . ( The nicest of all the adjustments involved in the working of the British Government is that which determines , without formally defining , the internal relations of the cabinet . On the one hand , while each minister is an adviser of the crown , the cabinet is a unity , and none of its members can advise as an individual , without , or in opposition actual or presumed to , his colleagues . On the other hand , the business of the state is a hundred-fold too great in volume to allow of the actual passing of the whole under the view of the collected ministry . It is therefore a prime // office of discretion for each minister to settle what are the departmental acts in which he can presume the concurrence of his colleagues , and in what more delicate , or weighty , or peculiar cases he must positively ascertain it . So much for the relation of each minister to the cabinet ; but here we touch the point which involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relation to its head . The head of the British Government is not a grand-vizier ; he has no powers , properly so called , over his colleages ; on the rare occasions when a cabinet determines its course by the votes of its members , his vote counts only as one of theirs . But they are appointed and dismissed by the sovereign on his advice . In a perfectly-organized administration , such for example as was that of Sir IRobert Peel in 1841- ' 46 , nothing of great importance is matured , or would even be projected , in any department without his personal cognizance ; and any weighty business would commonly go to him before being submitted to the cabinet . He reports to the sovereign its proceedings , and he also has many audiences of the august occupant of the throne . He is bound , in these reports and audiences , not to counterwork the cabinet ; not to divide it ; not to undermine the position of any of his colleagues in the royal favor . If he departs in any degree from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities to increase his own influence , or pursue aims not shared by his colleagues , then , unless he is prepared to advise their dismissal , he not only departs from rule , but commits an act of treachery and baseness . As the cabinet stands between the sovereign and the Parliament , and is bound to be loyal to both , so he stands between his colleagues and the sovereign , and is bound to be loyal to both . As a rule , the resignation of the first minister , as if removing the bond of cohesion in the cabinet , has the effect of dissolving it . A conspicuous instance of this was furnished by Sir Robert Peel in 1846 , when the dissolution of the administration , after it had carried the repeal of the Corn Laws , was understood to be due not so much to a united deliberation and decision as to his initiative . The resignation of any other minister only creates a vacancy . In certain circumstances , the balance of forces may be so delicate and susceptible that a single resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule in the one case is the rare // exception in the other . The prime-minister has no title to override any one of his colleagues in any one of the departments . So far as he governs them , unless it is done by trick , which is not to be supposed , he governs them by influence only . Upon the whole , nowhere in the wide world does so great a substance cast so small a shadow ; nowhere is there a man who has so much power , and so little to show for it in the way of formal title or prerogative . The slight record that has here been traced may convey but a faint idea of a unique creation . Yet , slight as it is , I believe it tells more than , except in the school of British practice , is elsewhere to be learned of a machine so subtly balanced that it seems as though it were moved by something as delicate and slight as the main-spring of a watch . It has not been the offspring of the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the constitutional powers in this country , have grown into their present dimensions , and settled into their present places , not as the fruit of a philosophy , not in the effort to give effect to an abstract principle ; but by the silent action of forces , invisible and insensible , the structure has come up into the view of all the world . It is , perhaps , the most conspicuous object on the wide political horizon ; but it has thus risen , without noise , like the Temple of Jerusalem . " No workman steel , no ponderous hammers rung ; Like some tall palm the stately fabric sprung . " * When men repeat the proverb which teaches us that " marriages are made in heaven , " what they mean is that , in the most fundamental of all social operations , the building up of the family , the issues involved in the nuptial contract lie beyond the best exercise of human thought , and the unseen forces of providential government make good the defect in our imperfect capacity . Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competing influences and powers , which brings about the composite harmony of the British Constitution . More , it must be admitted , than any other , it leaves open doors which lead into blind alleys ; for it presumes , more boldly than any other , the // good sense and good faith of those who work it . If , unhappily , these personages meet together , on the great arena of a nation 's fortunes , as jockeys meet upon a race-course , each to urge to the uttermost , as against the others , the power of the animal he rides , or as counsel in a court , each to procure the victory of his client without respect to any other interest or right-then this boasted Constitution of ours is neither more nor less than a heap of absurdities . The undoubted competency of each reaches even to the paralysis or distraction of the rest . The House of Commons is entitled to refuse every shilling of the supplies . That House , and also the House of Lords , is entitled to refuse its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entitled to make a thousand peers to-day and as many to-morrow ; it may dissolve all and every Parliament before it proceeds to business ; may pardon the most atrocious crimes ; may declare war against all the world ; may conclude treaties involving unlimited responsibilities , and even vast expenditure , without the consent , nay , without the knowledge , of Parliament , and this not merely in support or in development , but in reversal , of policy already known to and sanctioned by the nation . But the assumption is that the depositaries of power will all respect one another ; will evince a consciousness that they are working in a common interest for a common end ; that they will be possessed together with not less than an average intelligence , of not less than an average sense of equity and of the public interest and rights . When these remarkable expectations fail , then , it must be admitted , the British Constitution will be in danger . Apart from such contingencies , the offspring only of folly or of crime , this Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-run , as man changes between youth and age , but also , like the human body , with a quotidian life , a periodical recurrence of ebbing and flowing tides . Its old particles daily run to waste , and give place to new . What is hoped among us is that which has usually been found , that evils will become palpable before they have grown to be intolerable . There can not , for example , be much doubt , among careful observers , that the great conservator of liberty in all former times , namely , the confinement of the power of the purse to the // popular Chamber , has been lamentably weakened in its efficiency of late years-weakened in the Honse of Commons , and weakened by the House of Commons . It might , indeed , be contended that the House of Commons of the present epoch does far more to increase the aggregate of public charge than to rednce it . It might even be a question whether the public would take benefit if the House were either intrusted annually with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really responsible to the people for the spending of their money , or else were excluded from part , at least , of its direct action upon expenditure , intrusting to the executive the application of given sums , which that executive should have no legal power to exceed . Meantime we of this island are not great political philosophers ; and we contend with an earnest , but disproportioned , vehemence about changes which are palpable , such as the extension of the suffrage , or the redistribution of parliamentary seats , neglecting wholly other processes of change which work beneath the surface , and in the dark , but which are even more fertile of great organic results . The modern English character reflects the English Constitution in this , that it abounds in paradox ; that it possesses every strength , but holds it tainted with every weakness ; that it seems alternately both to rise above , and to fall below , the standards of average humanity ; that there is no allegation of praise or blame which , in some one of the aspects of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of much default , and much transgression , the people of this United Kingdom either have heretofore established , or will hereafter establish , their title to be reckoned among the children of men for the eldest-born of an imperial race . In this imperfect survey I have carefully avoided all reference to the politics of the day and to particular topics , recently opened , which may have undergone a great development before these lines appear in print on the other side of the Atlantic . Such reference would , without any countervailing advantage , have lowered the strain of these remarks , and would have complicated with painful considerations a statement essentially impartial and general in its scope . For the yet weightier reason of incompetency , I have avoided // the topics of chief present interest in America , including that proposal to tamper with the true monetary creed , which the Tempter lately presented to the nation in the Silver Bill . But I will not close this paper without recording my conviction that the great acts , and the great forbearances , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group which will ever be a noble object , in his political retrospect , to the impartial historian ; and that , proceeding as they did from the free choice and conviction of the people , and founded as they were on the very principles of which the multitude is supposed to be least tolerant , they have , in doing honor to the United States , also rendered a splendid service to the general cause of popular government throughout the world .
