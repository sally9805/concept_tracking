A WELL educated man has been tersely defined to be " one who knows a little of everything and a , good deal of something . " Paraphrasing and expanding the epigrammatic utterance , we may say that every leader of thought should possess two features : F.irst , a marked and practical excellence in his special department ; next , that general culture which will enable him to sympathize with and appreciate his co-workers in every other department . As it is the function of the educational system of a country to qualify its youth for becoming leaders of thought , this , then , can be the only standard by which to judge such a system ; whether or not it develops its pupils fully and naturally , and without waste of time or money . Common schools , academies , and colleges constitute our American educational system . How does it stand , then , with that system when examined by such a test ? Let us not overlook one important element in the computation . Defects , if there be found any , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth . A nation that has been rebaptized in fire and blood and has saddled itself with a heavy debt , has already passed its adolescence . Moreover , we are soon to be diiectly confronted with the ripest culture of the most cultured continent .. Every fresh mile of railroad that is laid between the East and the West , every additional steamer that is placed on our Atlantic lines , is another twist of the great windlass that unremittingly approximates America to Europe . We are no longer the United States of 1790 , or of 1830 , or even of i86o , but the American nation of to-day , with a nation 's desires and also a nation 's responsibilities . It may be safely said that the gulf between x86o and 1870 is wider in many places than that between 1775 and 1790 . " Oh , we are a young and growing nation , and do not yet need any elaborate education . " Every one has heard the commonplace . But have we grown as fast intellectually as England , or France , or Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not come so satisfactory as one might suppose . And again , who shall say that we , to-day as a nation , have not need of the highest education fully as much as any . nation in Europe ? We have the same vast legislative , social , and financial problems to meet and to solve . The method of our training may be slightly varied , the subject matter may be different-that is , more directly suited to our peculiar wants . But the training itself , the developing process , should be as elaborate here as elsewhere . Slightly changing one of Aristotle 's sayings , we may claim . that there are many ways of teaching badly , but one of teaching well . If , now , there is one glaring and yet deep-seated defect in our intellectual activity , it is that we are not trained to our work . No one can go through the length and breadth of the land , Diogenes-like , and truthfully report that he has seen more than a handful of lawyers , doctors , editors , teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective vocations . Their work is done , but it is , done spasmodicafly and unevenly ; it is wrung out by the hardest , it has not that indescribable finish and that proportion which are the characteristics of true culture . There is no lack of innate capacity or of energy in the workers themselves . We are forced , therefore , to the judgment that there must be something wrong in our educational system . The present article will not attempt to discuss the entire American system , // but only so much of it as is embodied in the colleges . Even this circumscribed field is too large for the measuring rod of a magazine essay . The public is aware that one of the leading professors in one of our best known colleges has recently published an elaborate treatise in behalf of the existing system. * Professor Porter is amonk those genial and liberal instructors who constitute the glory of a land . His ability as a writer is shown by his book itself . This is characterized throughout by a warm , manly tone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . It is a work which should be read by every publicspirited reader , whether alumnus or autodidact . To the former it will come as a reviver of golden old memories ; to the latter it may-let us hope that it willprove the sober guide to an unknown , a dreamland of thought , and sentiment , and good-fellowship . The writer of the present article , however , while conceding the general merits of Professor Porter 's work , must state at the outset that he dissents from many of his views , and that radically . Still he is unable , for want of space , to take them up in order and discuss each with the minuteness that it deserves . All that he can attempt will be to exhibit the subject from another point of view , with a different spirit , giving to the book a new interpretation as it were , whereby the reader may be enabled to look between the lines to another world beyond . Professor Porter 's chief fault does not lie in what he says so much as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader feel wherein the essential excellence of a well-educated man consists ; he never gives a clear idea of a university , although it is evident that he is constantly haunted by the phantom . of one . He never even presents a theory of education as a whole . According to his views the American college is the natural and therefore the suitable product of American society and the American mind . Whereto it might be replied that a crooked and stunted tree is also a natural growth , but hardly a normal one . Inasmuch as the entire question revolves upon this p*int , not whether the American college is doing good , but whether it is doing the good that we are entitled to expect from it , and as the adjustment of this main point involves the adjustment of the subsidiary ones above indicated , the failure to discuss them must be pronounced a serious defect . For instance , Professor Porter claims that the traditional college curriculum is the one best adapted to fit a young man for life generally . These are his words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curriculum of studies has been prescribed , has been that certain studies ( among which the classics and mathematics are prominent ) are best fitted to prepare a man for the most efficient and successful discharge of public duty . By public duty ' we do not mean merely professional duty , but duty in that relatively commanding position which a thoroughly cultured man is fitted to occupy . By a thoroughly cultured man we mean a man who has been trained to know himself in his constitution , e his duties , and his powers ; to know society in its history and institutions , and to know nature in its development and scientific relations . " This sounds well , but unfortunately is not borne out by the facts . The curriculum hitherto enforced has been conspicuously defective in the most vital point . Not mathematics , not classics , not natural history , not one of the ordinary college studies possesses one tithe of the significance for the average cultured American as the shamefully neglected study of history . Yet among our hundreds of colleges there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Cornell , and the last named , probably because it is the latest founded and // most radical , has the best course . Will Professor Porter , or any one else sharing his views , name the American colleges that have a professorship of history , not of such far-fetched specialities as ancient history , or medieval history , or the history of England or of the United States , but merely of history anywhere and anyhow ? It is a deplorable fact that our schoolboys know more of hi'story than our collegians . The result we read every day in the nauseating ignorance displayed by our editors , lawyers , would-be orators and critics , to say nothing of the small-talk of society . We like to call ourselves a practical people . In the matter of education at least we are singularly unpractical . The principal vocations in life are the bar , the press , the school-room , the investigating laboratory or workshop , the sickroom , and the pulpit . Setting aside the last two , we may ask ourselves the question : Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate preparation , just such a preparation as they really need and nothing else ? Our theologians , it is evident , must be trained in exclusive denominational schools , and our doctors in the great cities . It is more than doubtful whether any general system of university education in this country could be devised for satisfactorily embracing these two classes . Now as to the others . Is provision made anywhere for the thorough , elaborate study of law before the young lawyer is plunged into the dust and turmoil of practice ? Where does the young writer find the opportunity to master such trifles as political economy , history , or *sthetics before he is broken into or broken down by the treadmill of the press ? As to our pedagogues , the less we say of them the better . Even the students of science have little chance of advancing beyond the mere rudiments of their respective studies . We are , in this matter of education , most unpractical , and yet , paradoxical as it may seem , we are unpractical because we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize a theory of education . We have never even put the question how we can best give our young men the general and the special training that they need . Like Topsy , our colleges have siml ) ly grown . Germany has long ago met and answered this great question . Outside of Germany* we shall look in vain for the full ideal and realization of national education , perfect , of course , humanly speaking . Yet five years ago , or even as recently as last July , Germany was looked upon by the mass of Americans as inhabited by a dreaming , u npractical folk . France is now learning , to her utter discomfiture , that the maudits Aliernands. are intensely practical , and we can at least watch from afar and profit by her experience . The wonderful results of the Franco-Prussian war are , not due to mere numbers , but to discipline and patience , brains and method . Jean Paul has some pretty lines about the English holding the empire of the sea , the French the empire of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like all men that create the world from the recesses of their own brain , Jean Paul occasionally hits the truth . This time he does not . Whatever was or might have been the Germany of thirty years ago , it is high time to proclaim the fact , novel to many and yet long known to some , that Germany is in all the essentials of life the most practical nation in Europe , say in the world . No other nation can produce on an emergency so many men perfectly trained for just the work that is demanded of them , be that work the marshalling of a vast army , or the building of a railroad , or the revision of a code of laws , or the publishing of a Sanscrit dictionary* or the illustration of a yourg ladies ' poetical album . Other nations are now openly admiring and secretly Including Holland and the Scandinavian countries . // hating the marvellous results . Whether any of them will adopt the training remains to be seen . The German theory of education , compressed within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preliminary training , the utmost rigor ; for special development , th&amp;utmost freecfom . The foundations are laid slowly , elaborately , conscientiously in the gymnasium or in the Rea ? scku/e . The pupil is held strictly to his daily and yearly tasks , neither hurried nor neglected . The classes are small , the teachers themselves have all passed through the same process . Nothing like cramming is tolerated , but the hours are taken up in teaching and ex*danation quite as much as in hearing recitations . Then when the scholar has passed his abituKent examination the university receives him as a student . He is free to choose his faculty and has perfect control over his time . The only compulsion that he has to expect is the probable necessity of passing the doctoral or the state examination at the end of three or four years . The Germans thus acknowledge this fundar*ental truth that , up to a certain age , all minds may and should be taught uniformly . After that age has been reached compulsory training is alike odious and unprofitable . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there is a spiritual as well as a physical puberty . " This spiritual puberty forms the dividing line , then , between the boy and the young man . Henceforth the latter is put upon his mettle . All that the university can do , or attempt to do , is to furnish him with the means and the opportunity of learning . Is the , system a good one ? By its fruits shall it be judged . No other nation , least of all our own , can claim that its university men are its true representatives . No other nation can boast of such rank and file of lawyers , doctors teachers , editors , writers , clergymen-all university men . Irrespective of section or creed the alumni of the German universities are the fruit and flower of the nati6nal stem . They are true brethren in the spirit . What have we to exhibit in the way of off-set ? Schools by the thousands and colleges by the dozen ; but no education , no method . We never acknowledge practically the existence of mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our schools are fitful in method and lax in discipline . Our colleges are superficial and rigid . Let us examine the average American boy as he comes up to college . In all probability he has attended three or four schools and changed his studies and text-books a dozen times . He has spent five or six years in failing to learn Latin , a language whose elements any boy of good parts can master in two years ; he has dabbled in various mathematical studies , has written a few English compositions , and is probably unable to distinguish between William III . and William the Conqueror . He has not been trained thoroughly to anything . Let us now follow him through four years of college life . He reads a little more Latin and Greek , ponying his way along the thorny path . He is heart-broken over the calculus and analytics , yawns over Butler 's Analogy and the Eviderfces of Christianity , tries his hand at flowery essays , takes a rapid survey of the natural sciences . compressed into the senior year , arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biennials , he descends from the commencement stage a baccalaureus artium . In all those four years he has had perhaps one congenial study to compensate for a score of distasteful ones . But not once has he been placed face to face with the momentous problem : What shall I study , why shall I study it , how shall I study it to the best advantage ? His educational pabulum has come to him cut and dried . He has worn the contract livery of stock educationalism . There are exceptions , but only such rare and radiant ones as make the surrounding d*irkness more visible . // The cardinal vice of our colleges is that they admit to the lower classes mere boys who should still be at school , while the upper classes are forced through a curriculum when they should have liberty of study . This evil Professor Port&amp; proposes to remedy , in*part , by giving the upper-class men a certain option between courses of study , and by making the instruction somewhat more liberal in its method . To this it may be replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , and-an even more fatal objection-Professor Porter ignores the radical di4'feren*e that must ever exist between a school and a university . The sooner this difference is comprehended , and the more firmly it is insisted upon , the better for us all . It is impossible that the same institution should be both school and college or university ; that the same set of men should be successively scholars aud students , teachers and professors . The methods are different ; so are the objects aimed at . The transition from scholardom to studentdom should be attended by a total change of atmosphere and surroundings . It is worthy of note that Professor Porter never acknowledges the true position of a professor . He even says , pp. 154- ' 5 : " No mistake can be greater than to suppose that a college gains very largely by adding to its corps of professors eminent personages who have little or no concern with the business of instruction , or who come rarely in contact with the students . The continued residence of a resident pro-. fessor of acknowledged eminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular renown , neither of whom holds a constant and intimate connection with the processes of instruction and moulding that are every day forming and exciting the minds and character of the students , is of comparatively little significance . " In other words , men like Goldwin Smith at Cornell , and Lowell , Fiske , and Howells at Harvard , are mere ornamental figureheads . Begging Professor Porter 's pardon , may one inquire whether there is not such a thing as the mediate transmission of spirit , the interfiltration of knowledge whether the regular teachers themselves do not need to be taught , kept up to the proper level by the presence and example of just such master-minds ? Surely we are not to set so penny-wise a value upon the recently inaugurated course of Harvard lectures , or assert that the students reap no benefit , because the information thus imparted must first pass through the minds of the regular faculty . Alas ! An American professor is too often only a nondescript , a jack of all trades , equally ready to teach surveying and Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not docked to whitewash the college fence . But there are some among us whose ideal of a professor is a trifle more exalted . They regard hin , as a man who has devoted his life to research in some one department , and expect from him original productions that shall shed a lustre upon the uuive.rsity . They consider it to be his mission to be learned and to impart learning , not to confound lazy or unwilling minds'with easy questions for so many hours per diem , or to waste his midnight oil upon the troubled waters of a Freshman hornspree . These same theorists persist also in hoping for a university among us that shall be a real university ; not a mere dwelling factory such as we already possess by the score , but a centre of thought and research , an exchange-place of learning , a nursery where the young tree , removed from the forcing atmosphere of the hot-house , may develop itself freely and hardily in the broad sunshine . On page 27 ! Professor Porter says : " We are in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university . We believe this to be desirable and possCble , with enterprise , patience , time , and money . " We have no right to question his individual opinion thus publicly expressed . At the same time 24 // his book , as a whole , is a strong argument in favor of the existing regime . In fact , we may regard it as the final word of the advocates of the old as o1iposed to the new . Had its principles been adhered to , we should never have been gratified with the wonderful results of such institutior ) s as Cornell and Michigan universities . Be the fact disguised as it may , it remains no less a fact that our older colleges were started simply as preparatory schools for the ministry , while the younger ones have been content to follow the lead of their predecessors . As such preparatory schools , then , it was but natural that they should have a limited range of study and an enforced curriculum . Every scientific study introduced in compliance with the spirit of the age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the classics , every infusion of a more liberal tone in method and in aim , has been a battlefield . Each successive step has been won , if won at all , only by hard fighting and at the price of much ill-will . Professor Porter gives , in his Historical and Introductory Chapter , a brief account of the various attempts at reform made since an early date in the present century , and points therewith his moral . It should be borne in mind , however , that failure proves nothing , unless it is also shown that the experiment was tried under proper conditions . To comoare an old and well-established classical course with a hurriedly engrafted scientific scl*ool , imperfectly equipped with professors and apparatus , is downright injustice . And even if the scientific school is well equipped , it does not follow that its pupils are well prepared . Let the experiment be tried of comparing a liberal scientific course , to which none shall be admitted who are not fully trained , with the ordinary classical department . lndeed , the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect results that it ceases to be an experiment . The scientific students in the universities rank equal with the classicists , and it never occurs to professors or outsiders to set relative values upon the performances of the two sets . Yet the scientific students are chiefly Realscliziler ; that is , they have passed through an elaborate preparatory course in which there is , it is true , little or no instruction in Greek , and not much more of Latin than is given by our average schools , but where the deficiency is compensated , made good by a large amount of mathematics and modern languages , and the elements of the descriptive sciences . Our view of the German universities and their students need not be too much *u1eur de rose . These seminaries of learning present in miniature the virtues and the vices of the German national character . The students are addicted to duelling , drinki *g , sexual immorality , and profanity . In all these particulars they are no worse , perhaps they are better , than the average Philister ; only their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reform will come-it is coming now ; but it will not come in the shape of a penal student-code ; rather with the general refinement , the higher toning of the national character . Besides , Germany , like every other land of privileged classes , contains a number of young men whose sole vocation in life is to idle away time . These frequent the university because it is the fashion , and because there is no other congenial placc in which to drone out the fag-end of a protracted minority . They can not be taken , however , as types of the average student . It may be said with truthfulness that a very small percentage of those who come to the university to study neglect its opportunities . The amount of intelligent , persistent work accomplished by the ordinary student is very large , while the man of genius accomplisl*es wonders . Hearing lectures is very far from constituting the sum of such activity . The amount of collateral reading is immense . The writer of this has known students-by no means the foremost  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large volumes from the university library and shut themselves up in hermit-like solitude for months , in the elaborate preparation of a doctoral dissertation . Men mall the departments study more or less in company , either reading authors and text-books or comparing notes and questioning one another . Nothing is more usual than a daily reunion of four or five congenial spirits , who read and correct alternately . Besides , nine out of ten that go up for examination in law and medicine have been members of a regular " quizz " for at least one semester . These quizzes are anything but a formal recitation . The Privatdocent , or the young professor , pu*rsues a most immethodical method , passing abruptly from subj*ct to subject , detecting flaws , giving hints to be followed up subsequently by independent investigation rather than didactic drilling . Furthermore , each department has public exercises , variously styled Seminaria , or Practica , or Repetitorien , which give abundant opportunity for questioning and answering , without degenerating at all into recitations . Every one who has enjoyed such privileges will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest sense manly and truth-loving , that it cultivates in sight and independence . Nowhere else in the world is so little value set upon Einj5ackerei , the mere drumming in of facts and names . How does it stand with our marking system ? On page 140 we read : " If this is not the way to treat the *ug5il as a man , it is the way to make Aim a man . " The italics are in the original . Whether the principle is correct may be best seen by its practical results . The pupils of the Law School of Columbia College are chiefly college graduates . The largest delegation comes from the institution with which Professor Porter is connected . The course consists in part of lectures , in part of recitations on such text-books as Blackstone , Parsons , Washburne , etc . These recitations are extremely informal , intended solely to guide the inexperienced and refresh the memory . There is no pretence of marking for them . Here then , if anywhere , must be a fair chance to test the manliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are marred in a measure by whispering and prompting  --  the two cardinal vices of American students ; and the wor*t offenders are , at least they were , the graduates of Yale . Not that they were evilly disposed . It might be said of every man that he was a gentIei*ian . But the naked truth is that they were all more or less demoralized by this so-called college discipline . It had become so much a matter of habit to save a fellow student from a low mark by a slight whisper that they were unable to refrain even where there was no such necessity . After all , there is but one way to make a person a man , and that way is to treat him as a man . If he has not yet attained to a certain degree of maturity , the proper place for him is the school . Between the school and the university there can not , in a scientific system of education , be found any half-way station . A point that is almost ignored by Professor Porter is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor admits that it is not reasonable to exact from all students an equal proficiency in every study . Yet this is the theory of the ordinary curriculum . The remedy that the Professor suggests consists in a complicated , one might say an impracticable system of lass and class studies . In the first place , the scheme would necessitate a very large personnel of instructors . In the next place , it would be but a feeble imitation of England , and our great mistake has always been that we imitate the mother country in precisely those features where successful imitation is impossible . An Oxford system of passes , classes , medals , fellowships , prizes , and the like , is beyond our power . It is the growth not merely of ages generally , but of ages that // have vanished forever . We have not the time , or the money , or the religious zeal that inspired the founders of Oxford and Cambridge trusts . We need no pageantry of learning and architecture . We do need centres of learning , graced with able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collections ; and , in the next place , we need a set of adequately prepared young men who shall work intelligently toward a goal of their selection . Just here it is that the scientific classification of studies becomes all-important . According to the German plan no option of study is allowed during the training period-at least no more option than that between the Gymnasium and the Reaischule . Up to a certain age all scholars shall pursue the same path ; otherwise they will not be liberally developed . The scientific classification of studies is fully acknowledged , but its practical application by the pupil himself is kept in abeyance . But after he has reached a certain degree of maturity this restraint is entirely removed , and the university gives him his choice . His mind has had opportunity to become acquainted with ifself ; its likes and its dislikes . Henceforward this set of the mind is to be cultivated . Each line of study is judged by its own criteria and on its own merits . The point may be best elucidated by mentioning , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university degrees. * The student who desires to become a Ph . D. for studies in geology must , in addition to that special branch , evince a good knowledge of zoology , botany , physiology , and so much of chemistry and physics as is necessary to the right understanding of geology . The historical sciences are not called for . If the degree is to be given for pure mathematics , scarcely any outside study is exacted except physics . ( Physics here includes physics proper , electricity , magnetism , etc . ) If for history , the requirements cover history proper , the outlines of the history of Roman law , the history of philosophy , and *sthetics . If the candidate has devoted himself to philology proper , the examination covers also general history , aesthetics , and philosophy . If the special study has been the so-called camera/ia , the extra requirements are substantially the same as for the candidate in history . In history , philology , and the camera/ia , no attention whatever is expected to be given to the exact or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrations . Enough has already been given to make it evident that the dividing lines between the historical and aesthetic , the descriptive and the exact sciences , are not arbitrarily broken down in behalf of imaginary general training . If now we examine the certificate of a gymasiast who applies for matriculation , we shall find that he has passed satisfactorily in Greek and Latin , German composition , German history , the history of German literature , French , English , general history , algebra , geometry , trigonometry , the rudiments of chemistry , and physics . The Realschuler , on the other hand , has studied much less Latin and very little Greek , but he has received as a substitute a much more thorou h course in French and English . He has also been drilled in the elements of nearly all the descriptive sciences , and has pursued the exact sciences much further than the gymnasiast proper . We thus see that in either case this general preliminary training is not excessive , but well rounded off ; such a disciplinary course as every American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nineteen . The university in its turn aims at imparting special knowledge . Each faculty in conferring its degrees exacts only such special knowledge The general requirements already alluded to are not based upon any traditional belief in It can he done only in a general way , since the requirements are slightly different in different universities , and are even variable in the same university . In all scientific studies , be it observed , the greatest stress is lad upon original investigation . // their absolute excellence as training hobby-horses , but solely upon the ground that they are essential to a full understanding of the respective specialties . They have no trace of a spirit of Zwangsuni'errickt . It is fully as fair , for instance , to exact some rfidimentary knowledge of law and legal history from the candidate in the camera/ia as to exact the elements of chemistry from a doctor mt'dicine* . But our American system is not reasonable when it persists in merely drilling the mind after it has reached a certain degree of maturity . Of what importance are analytics and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn Latin and Greek with facility can master any phonetic language ; but why vex them with physics as though they were to become opticians or astronomers ? An excellent geologist may be extremely backward in learning languages . After he has had a fair trial at them , why harass him further at a time of life when he is eager and ready to follow the natural drift of his mind ? With the plastic mind of boys we can accomplish much but after the eighteenth or nineteenth year has been passed we shall find the difficulties growing out of all proportion to the results attained . It is singularly incorrect to say , as Professor Porter has said on page 107 , that " in the theory of university instruction and administration there is no op/lox of studies ; the option is between several instructors in the same department of knowledge , and between a faithful and a careless use of its opportunities . " The German student has at the very outset the highest kind of option-namely , the liberty of selecting that line of study which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified . Moreover , there is nothing to prevent his taking studies outside of his own special line . The medical student can , if he sees fit , attend lectures on history or in the classics . He can study Hebrew , or Sanscrit , or anything else for which he has the time and the brains . All that the medical faculty expect of him when he applies for his degree is a substantial knowledge of the theory and practice of mcdicine . Reverting to our own country , we find a contrast that is anything but gratif ing . The average age of adi*ission to our colleges may be roughly estimated at seventeen . In all but a few there is an inflexible curriculum extending through fohmr years . The topics of that curriculum are too well known to demand citation here . The student receives a very patchwork of instruction , from which he may select here and there a scrap that is to his taste . Mental puberty , that age when the mind receives its life-set and becomes conscious of its capacity and its desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the change receives but a scanty recognition , if any at all , from the college administration . Even in those institutions which evince some liberality , the old difficulty already indicated will inevitably recur-namely , the impossibility of teaching the same set of youth in the same place and by the same instructors , first upon a system of drilling , and then upon a university plan . The Germans find that they are unable to get school-work done satisfactorily in any other place than the school-room ; but then we are so much more practical It may be safely asserted that ninety-nine young men out of every hundred who have had any education whatever , will evince in their twentieth year a decided preference for some special line of study . Some have the law in view ; others are given to philology ; others to history , or to political studies ; others to mathematics ; others still to natural history . Each is ready and willing to spend three or four years in mastering the subject . Yet each is kept waiting two years , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is forced to learn much for which he has no aptitude and to which he may have a // decided aversion ; and then he is turned loose to shift for himself . Setting aside Harvard , Cornell , Michigan , and Virginia universities , there is hardly an institution in the country where the student can so much as make the attempt to study what he wishes ; and even in these four the attempt will often be abortive . And the result ? To the American graduate no passage in that matchless book , " The Reveries of a Bachelor , " will come home with more directness than the following : " I went up at night and skulked around the building , where the . lights were blazing from all the windows , and they were busy with their tasksplain tasks , and easy tasks , because they were certain tasks . Happy fellowsthought 1-who have only to do what is set before you to be done ! But the time is coming , and that very fast , when you must not only do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do " is intended by the author to suggest the trials and temptations of after life . But we are at liberty to extend its application , making it stand for the problems of life gene rally , whether moral or intellectual . The crying *veakness , then , of our college education is that it does not fit its young men for grappling with the great problems of study . Each day , each hour , brings with it this or the other set task . The collegian is never expected to elaborate a principle or a truth by means of independent investigation . He never learns in college to collect materials , compare authorities , correct misstatements , arrive at an opinion of his own . Much sti*dy is done , more than is generally believed . But it is nearly all cram-work , forgotten after the next examination . To quote the words of Goethe , the student has no opportunity , Nach einem selbstgesteckten Ziel , Mit holdem Irren hinzuschweifen . Moreover , the system can not make allowance for differences in intellectual capacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both are expected to learn the same amount in the same time . In Germany a stuclenL who feels that he is backward may take his time and prepare himself carefully . But we are a practical people ; so we see to it that our young men of ability do not learn too rapidly , and the slow-pacers or the vicious we either lash unmercifully or else turn out to harmless rustication . These remarks have been directed , hitherto , at the American college as an educational institution . Something should be said , however , upon its character as a social organization . There is still prevalent in this country an incorrect view of college discipline and the relations between professors and students . According to this view , professors stand in Zoco karen/is . They are the temporary guardians of the intellectual and moral well-being of the youth committed to their charge , and are often held to a strict account by incensed parents . When a father learns that his son has been suspended or expelled , his first impulse perhaps is to discredit the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be done with a show of reason , he resorts to other relief . The head of the college or some one of the faculty is taken to task for having permitted the son to idle away his time , or to play cards , or to drink . Is it not the professor 's duty to see that each one of the three hundred or six hundred or thousand students is always and under all circumstances a scholar and a gentleman ? Disregarding high-pitched theoretical notions , let us look at this relationship from a common-sense , every-day point of view . The present faculty of Princeton College , for instance , professors and tutors , numbers fifteen or sixteen ; the students number a little over three hundred . We thus find an average of twenty students to one instructor . Now , what man among us , may it be asked , is willing // to make himself responsible for the conduct of twenty sons ? Let any professor who happens to be blessed with two or three sons of his own lay his hand on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those two or three have cost-him . Yet they are his own sons . We may reasonably assume that they have inherited somewhat of his peculiar disposition , and that he is therefore more familiar with their inmost character . Besides , he has their mother for his helpmate . They have all lived under the same roof and met around the family board for long years . Every surrounding is adapted to give him light and help in the path of his duty as a father . Yet , with all this in his favor , he alone knows the weight of the burden . How is it possible , then , that he should fill a father 's place to twenty young strangers coming he knows not whence , and going he cares not whither-young men whose character he has no opportunity of studying , or else who leave him before he has had time to finish the investigation ? This entire theory of professorial control and responsibility , be it said boldly , is a cruel delusion , and should be exploded as a theory . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it amounts to . Every student feels from matriculation to graduation that his professors , unless there is some special and personal reason to the contrary , can be to him nothing more than his instructors , his markers , or , if it comes to the worst , his judges . In Germany the relationship is not marked by any special feeling of friendship or aversion , but rather by a spirit of deference and politeness . A German student regards his professors somewhat as a New York merchant regards his lawyer or his doctor . In an American college not even this minimum of goodwill can be said to exist . In its place we shall find , to our regret , a decided feelingofmistru st , not to say aversion . Thanks to our admirable system of enforc .. ing and marking recitations and attendance at church and chapel , there has been developed in the normal American collegian a certain manly spirit , a disposi*. tion to regard the faculty , collectively and individually , as his natural enemies . How can it well be otherwise ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other thoroughly ; yet the one is expected to hold a rod over the back of the other for four years , and the quasi parental relationship degenerates only too often into a mutual trial of wits and temper . It is not a relationship of interest or of sympathy , but of law ; yet of law in its most dis .. agreeable phase-an absolute despotism . A legislator is not *er se a bad man . A judge we shall generally be safe in regarding as an upright and able man . A pastor should certainly be a good and kind man . Even a constable may be a good fellow , and a detective may have his good points . The legislator enacts his code , and the detective ferrets out the criminal ; the judge passes sentence , the parson shrives , the sheriff draws the fatal bolt . Each does his duty in turn , and each is entitled to respect or consideration . But an American professor is the only being in the civilized world that is supposed to unite equitably in one person the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , executioner , and detective . Need we wonder that the criminal looks upon such a procedure with mistrust ? Students know as well as professors themselves know that a faculty meeting is no place for the administration of sober-minded , even-handed justh*e . Each individual professor looks upon his enforced attendance as a bore , wasting his time and spoiling his temper . The inconsistency and tergiversation sometimes displayed border on the marvellous . Measures are taken , reconsidered , lost , revived , amended , and lost again , with a celerity that reminds one of the manner in which a certain New York city judge occasionally attempts to clear the caleadar . Two-thirds of the members present have not heard the evidence , // or have not had time to sift it , or are incapable of distinguishing between circumstantial evidence and mere hearsay . They take but little interest in the proceedings , and are glad if only some conclusion is arrived at , no matter what or how . The reform is simple enough , and is equally applicable to college or university . Let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely to a body of college police , who shall be held to the strict discharge of their duty . Let the preferment of charges be in the hands of one man , a member of the faculty , who shall thus act as a sort of prosecuting attorney , and shall have no voice in pronouncing ju ( lgment . The court itself should be composed of not more than four professors , selected because of their general experience and legal attainments , and presided over by the president . This court should be responsible directly to the trustees or the college corporation . As matters now stand , the administration is in the hands of an unwieldy and motley assemblage , so numerous that the members have no sense of consistency or individual responsibility . The cure lies in confining the labor to a few and making the responsibility well defined and direct . in any case , it should be clearly understood by all parties , professors , students , and parents  --  the sooner it is understood the better-that professors can not possibly exercise over students that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be in the least degree effective , such control must be guided by close personal knowledge , and such knowledge is not attainable . The professor who honestly seeks it will discover , only too soon , that his efforts are viewed with suspicion . The utmost that he can do is to show to the student-world by his bearing and actions that he is an upright , truth-loving man , one who wishes to influence by his exari*ple rather than awe by mere semblance of authority . Whenever a professor attempts more than this , especially when he lowers himself to the prevention or the detection of disorder , we can not do otherwise than apply to him the bitter reproach : C'es/ dtfroger comtldtement d son ti/re . If parents are unwilling to subject their sons to a system of freedom and personal responsibility , they lay themselves open to the charge of gross inconsistency . Where a few hundred young men , more or less disciplined and matured , leave their homes for the perils and pleasures of college life , the halfgrown boys who throng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbered by the ten thousand . The temptations of a college town are nothing in comparison with those of a centre of trade . The restraining influences of study , social intercourse with cultivated minds , and an intellectual atmosphere , are incalculable . Yet the college professor is expected to spend his time in supplementing what is of itself sufficient , while the merchant employer does absolutely Rothing . If a would-be young man has not enough energy of character to walk without leading-strings , the best plan will ever be to remand him to the only true leading-strings  --  the home fireside and the school . Every member of the collegiate world knows that the worst , the most hopelessly dissipated students , are the very ones in whose , behalf fond parents expect that the faculty shall evince special zeal and activity . Every system of university education presupposes good schools and careful preliminary training . A grave *rror , however , seems to exist in the application of this axiom to a country like America . It is universally assumed that reform , when or if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire school system must first be revised de *rofundis . Those who hold to such a view ( iverlook the patent fact that our collegians as a class do not come from // 1871. 381 public but from private schools . Massachusetts excepted , there is scarcely a State that pretends to make its common schools adequate to the preparation of young men for college . The work is done by a few private prepara:tory schools or academies , that know to a nicety the requirements of admission to the several colleges , and govern themselves accordingly . Should Harvard and Yale , for instance , raise the standard , Andover and Exeter would raise theirs to correspond . Let Harvard exact German for its entrance examination ; we may be confident that German will be taught ad hoc by every training school far and near . It follows , then , that the colleges have the initiation of reform in their own hands , and that the reform must be wrought from above downwards . As a matter of fact such has always been the procedure . The higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of to-day with those of thirty years ago , we shall find to be due , not to any self-reforming spirit in the schools themselves , but solely to the pressure exerted upon them by the colleges . The whole problem resolves itself into the simple question : Have the colleges the means and the nerve to enforce what they consider to be the only adequate preparation ? It is evident that in such a move the older and wealthier colleges must lead the way . The others will either follow or be distanced in the race . To all we may repeat the sound advice of honest lago : " Put money in thy purse ! " As long as a college is dependent upon its students for the bread and butter of its professors , so long will it be crippled in usefulness and servile in spirit . For a college at least , wealth is the only foundation of independence . Univers'ity education , as a matter both of principle and of discipline , should be nominally free . To a thoughtful mind the most unpleasant feature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge for tuition . It deters many a worthy man , and has the tendency to make the other general expenses of college life abnormally great . In this respect certainly , Michigan and Cornell universities have the advantage . The greatness of the German universities consists fully as much in their complete independence of student support , with its consequent vigor of discipline , as in their libraries and their lectures . At this moment the sons of Von Bismarck and Von Roon , were they students , would meet with no more favor at the hands of the university court in Berlin than the son of the humblest official in all Prussia . What would be the best preparatory curriculum for an American university ? How much of Latin and Greek , mathematics , history , natural history , literature , French , and German is necessary for the young man 's general outfit ? These are questions which need not and can not be settled here . They can be adjusted only after great deliberation and conference among the colleges themselves , and by the aid of thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still less one book alone , can pretend to dominating the situation . All that an article like the present can attempt is to call attention to what the writer truly believes to be a grave defect in American education , and to suggest the remedy in outline , without venturing upon details . Only let us be on our guard against two common mistakes . The first consists in attaching too much importance to any one set of studies , whether the classics or the mathematics , as mere mental discipline . Everything disciplines the mind that teaches it to work patiently and acutely . Intellectual gymnastics are as practically unprofitable as other tours deforce . The next error is to lay our plans as though whatever is desirable were therefore attainable . We can not teach everything , even in a university . We can not begin everything in a school . A selection must be made of such sciences as underlie the others , and that selection must be taught with all thoroughness // and zeal . In this , as in every stage of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be better to have only one ancient language well taught than two imperfectly taught ; better to impart a thorough knowledge of geometry than a half knowledge of geometry and trigonometry ; better to elaborate the history of Greece , or of Rome , or of England , than to superficialize in general history . Last and most important of all , may the minds of our schoolboys have time to mature slowly ! May this forcing process of preparation , whereby youths of fifteen are driven by steam and electricity through the mill in three or even two years , be done away with forever ! There is nothing in the programme of a German gymnasium that can not be learned in seven or eight years . The entire secret of success lies in method , patience , and uniformity . Even if a boy of seventeen-thanks to unusual quickness of intellecthas mastered all his school lessons , it will be for his advantage to keep him waiting another year or two , even should he do nothing more than review what he already knows . His character must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of experience knows that in university life character tells more than mere quickness . A university is no place for boys , however bright or well prepared they may be , but for young men set , so to speak , in brain and purpose ; men who see clearly a definite object of study and are determined to pursue it , all the more zealously for being spurred on by a sense of defective preparation . Experience shows us every day that the real work of the world is done by men who take what is called a late start in life ; that races are oftenest won by colts whose bone and muscle have had time to harden . And our consecrated system of classes , graded recitations , chapel attendance , dormitories , is to vanish from sight and be dear only to memory ? Germany once had its dormitories and its fagging system , Pennalismus , and both are now sleeping the sleep of ages . Presence of body does not imply presence of spirit at prayers or sermons . Butler 's " Analogy** or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of graded recitation , are not likely to evoke a Christian spirit in the unwilling young mind . But our class ? Whose heart will not beat in after years with a thrill of response to the half-forgotten , suddenly remembered football cry , " Go in ; it 's the last chance you 'll have " ? And the dignified seniors on the fence went in-not in vain . Yes ; there are sweet memQries of chums and classmates , the common strivings , the common joys and vexations of four years . But the picture has also its reverse  --  the remembrance of greased blackboards and tarred chapels , the blowing of horns , the fighting with firemen , the smashing of tutors ' windows , the publishing of squibs against the faculty . The initiated need not be informed thus publicly that the class organization lies at the root of all the evil . Private dissipation will never be eradicated . But the college reformer who would hew down public disorder by the roots must strike at the class systcm , and strike hard . This system has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instructor , and those of us who are not Yale men must be pardoned for looking at it with severely critical eyes ; for it is a monstrosity , a very dragon in the way of true progress . In all sober-mindedness , have not the social advantages of class organization been exaggerated ? In the leading colleges the classes are so large that they are divided into sections and subsections , and class unity , about which we hear so much , degenerates into a mere deus ex machim2 for college turbulence , or college politics , or college eloquence . After all , sympathy of character and similarity of pursuits constitute the truest bond of union . German students are not drilled in classes , but form voluntary social organizations ; yet the young Doctor 's emotion at starting // on the dreary journey into Phulistia is every whit as deep as that of a newlyfledged alumnus . Nay , deeper , if we are to judge of it by its fruits in after , life ; for Germany can boast of more genial romances and good poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined . With regard to the religious element in university training , may the read&amp; listen patiently to a few plain , well-meaning words . Both the American public and American professors themselves , Professor Porter with the others , appear to labor under an apprehension of their own creating . Religion has two sidesits intellectual and its emotional . The latter , the ever-present sense of and delight in what is good and noble , forms not and can never form a part of university instruction , which is necessarily intellectual in its objects and its discipline . There is no possible way of making college students or university students good . Every professor that has tried the experiment can verify the assertion by his own experience . In such a matter friends and social surroundings are all-powerful . Anything like pressure from above is viewed by students as inquisitorial or Jesuitical , and produces insubordination or hypocrisy . On the other hand , the intellectual side of religion is essentially dogmatic and consequently denominational . It is a mere waste of paper and ink to attempt to prove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not denominational . Are not Hobart and Columbia Episcopalian , Princeton Presbyterian , Yale Congregational , Wesleyan Methodist , Harvard Unitarian ? Does not each of these institutions , so far as it may enforce any religious instruction upon its pupils , thereby give their minds a twist or bias in the direction of its own tenets ? Parents know this much if professors do not , and are governed in the selection of a cob . lege almost exclusively by denominajional preferences . To this twisting or biasing , then , the friends of liberal education justly object . They do not , as Professor Porter maintains or insinuates , deny the importance of training in Christian doctrine . But , say they , the proper place for such training is the home circle , the Sunday-school , and the church . When a young man quits home for college , why do not his parents look for his spiritual guide in the pastor of the town rather than in the college professor ? It is that pastor 's duty to give spiritual aid and instruction ; he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the pulpit ; for exhortation or remonstrance , the prayer-meeting and the pastoral visit . Why expect of professors , men who are already overburdened with intellectual duties , that they shall also be the supervisors of morals and orthodoxy ? They could not , even if they would . No college ever yet controlled the morals or the religion of its students . It may elicit a show of faith , a certain hypocritical deference , but nothing real . All that the advocates of reform desire is that the college shall merely abandon what it is unable to accomplish , and leave the task to other and better hands , that our seats of learning may be at least as free as those of benighted , downtrodden Europe , where Jew , Catholic , Lutheran , and Reformed meet on a footing of equality , and are not catechised or proselyted . Let these facts be kept steadily in mind : that our colleges , with one or two conspicuous exceptions , are wholly dissevered from the State , and consequently from State aid and sympathy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid and sympathy is the abandonment of denominationalism . A few words may be said upon the university as viewed in the light of the inevitable woman question . As colleges our higher institutions of learning are closed to the female sex . So long as they maintain dormitories , chapel recitations , and the entire routine of college discipline , so long they will not be in a // position to teach women . It is exceeding the bounds of reasonableness to expect that a faculty whose shoulders are already bending beneath the burden of a school and boarding-house for boys should be willing to accept the additional load of a young ladies ' *eminary . A university , however , stands upon very different ground . Let it be once clearly understood that the sole duty of a professor is *o tell what he knows , and that the university is only responsible for th' quality of its instruction and its examinations for degrees , and the problem , how our women are to receive their higher education , will be but one degree removed from a satisfactory solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child as to the latter 's fitness for independence . In conclusion , let us not expect too much even from a university . True it is that a university is the place for imparting special knowledge . For all that , it does not produce finished lawyers , or doctors , or writers , or investigators . Practical ability is gained only by practice , and the great world will remain the great teacher . Th&amp; Germans acknowledge this truth as fully as we do . The German graduate has barely mastered the theory of his profession . Yet even this much gives him an immense superiority over his American colleague . He is well up in the bibliography of.his subject , can refer to authorities , sees instantaneously the general bearing of any novel point , and is able to study it intelligently . In a word , he has his professional outfit . Hence the certainty with which we can predict his subsequent success . He has learned something which in a year or two he will be able to put to a direct application . Whereas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or number fifty . His excellence is rather negative than positive , and only too often consists in passive docility and feverish cramn*ing . Originality of character , preference for any one branch of study , is almost certain to prove fatal to successful competition under the American system . The German public does not look with indifference or derision upon its promising young graduates , as we look upon ours . It knows that they are to be its future leaders of thought , its great scholars , and lawyers , and doctors , and teachers . Whereas our poor alumni are flouted by self-made editors , snulbed by self-made lawyers , and learn that their real education is not so much as begun - that they know nothing for which the busy world will ever pay one dollar . What more humiliating difference can we fii*d than that which exists between a young man who has learned the . principles of his vocation in a thorough manner , amid surroundings that are most favorable for mental development , and another of equally good parts , perhaps , who scarcely knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should read ? Yet this is the spectacle that we are yearly called upon to behold , and still we fondly call ourselves a practical people . " That the love of a special subject is a great spur to industry needs no proof , and it has never yet been shown that the mind is less exercised when it is exercised with pleasure . Every experienced student knows that the great secret of study is to read with appetite . Under the old system the University of Oxford relied mainly on the motive of ambition . Such ambition is manly and generous , and its contests here , conducted as they are , teach men to keep the rules of honor in the contests of after life . Study pursued under its influence generally makes an aspiring character ; but study pursued , in part at least , from love of the subject , makes a happier character ; and why should not this also be taken into account in choosing the subject of education ? But the grand and proved defect of ambition as a motive is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails especially with those , certainly not the least momentous part of our charge , // whose position as men of wealth and rank is already fixed for them in life . To make university education a more direct preparation for after life may be called utilitarianism . ... Utilitarianism in education is a bad thing . But the great places of national education may avoid utilitarianism till government is in the hands of ambitious ignorance , till the bench of justice is filled with pettifoggers , till coarse cupidity and empiricism stand beside the sick-bed , till all the great levers of opinion are in low , uneducated hands . Our care for the education of the middle classes , however it may be applauded in itself will ill compensate the country for our failure to perform thoroughly the task of educating our peculiar charge , the upper classes , and training them to do and teaching them how to do their duty to the people . . . . In choosing the subjects of a boy 's studies , you may use your own discretion ; in choosing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the world values and such as may win the allegiance of a manly mind . It has been said that six months ' study of the language of Schiller and Goethe will now open to the student more high enjoyment than six years ' study of the languages of Greece and Rome . It is certain that six months ' study of French will now open to the student more of Europe than six years ' study of that which was once the European tongue . These are changes in the circumstances and conditions of education which can not be left out of sight in dealing with the generality of minds . Great discoveries have been made by accident ; but it is an accidental discovery , and must be noted as such , if the studies which were first pursued as the sole key to wisdom and knowled * e , now that they have ceased not only to be the sole but the lsest key to wisdom and knowledge , are still the best instruments of education . " These remarks , taken from Professor Goldwin Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Oxford in 1859 , are fraught with significance . Although given here in a necessarily mangled form , and although originally aimed at another system and another nation , they may be directly applied to our own . We have not , it is true , a nobility ; we have scarcely even what might be termed a landed gentry . But we assuredly have an aristocracy of birth and an aristocracy of wealth ; and they have as much need of university education as any of the upper classes in England . There was a time in the history of our country when the old and well-known families took a prominent part in shaping national affairs ; but that time has long ago passed , and , as some believe or fear , forever . If so , our prospects for the future are indeed disheartening . For what the sober-minded professor has prophesied for England has already in America come to pass . Our seats of justice are rapidly filling with pettifoggers ; coarse cupidity and empiricism stand una.wed by the bedside of the sick and the dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rostrums , are in the hands of the low , vulgar , uneducated charlatans . If now we examine into the causes of the influence wielded by such men as Washington , Hanoock , Adams , Jefferson , Livingston , Reed , Kent , Pinckney , and our other illustrious dead , we shall find that it was mainly due to the simple fact that they represented the flower , not merely of the country 's manhood , but of the country 's education . But the times have changed , and we have not changed with them . What was a good education in those days , is now a mere pittance of learning . The gravest questions of finance , legislation , diplomacy , social life , have suddenly sprung up , and the best families are no longer equal to the emergency . They know no more on State matters than the vulgar multitude , and have not the same strength of lungs . The sceptre of political influence has been snatched from them by the demagogue and the wire-puller . By failing to raise we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platform of sham democracy . Where once there was no debt , we now see figures footing up by the *nil1iard . Where once every honest mechanic could send his son to school and his daughter to the seminary , we have now strikes , Ihe Chinese question , and proletarianism in its Protean forms . Where once our married life was straightforward as New England psalmody and fresh as an idyl , we have Indiana divorces and the shriekings of " The Revolution . " The time has been when the word " corporation " bore with it a taint to the American sense . To-day we see one railroad practically owning our neighbor State , another stretching from Philadelphia to Chicago and St. Louis , threatening to enwrap the upper Mississippi valley in its coils , and casting its glance across the mountains to San Francisco . When we wake up , one fine morning , and read complacently in the journals that there is a consolidated trunk line from the Atlantic to the Pacific , then we may also bid good-by to Congress . Where shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catch-penny brutality of the columns of the daily press , in the young gamblers of Wall street , in our country lawyers , and editors , and clergymen , our Congressmen , and our officials ? According to Professor Porter 's view , the American college is peculiarly adapted for fitting our young men of family for high social and political standing . How can that be , when there does not exist a single college that is capable of giving its pupils a first-rate , or even a secondrate training in any one of the social or political sciences ? We are informed that our wealthy young men can and do finish their education abroad . As a matter of fact not one out of five who go abroad finishes his education . Besides , for the five who go abroad there are five hundred who stay at home , young men of family but not of means . They , too , have aspirations and ability ; but for them are we to make no provision ? Again , what we desire for all our young men is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but American history and American sociology . There can be few more critical turning-points in the life of a Young man than when he returns from protracted study abroad and learns that he has much , very much to unlearn . He runs the risk either of being disheartened or of lapsing Into the r$le of a doctrinaire . Universities , then , and not colleges , are the country 's present need . A university is capable of unlimited expansion . It concentrates and at the same time diffnsesknowledge . It suits all grades ofmind ; it develops talent and imposes no fetters upon genius . It also suits all classes of character . The rich and aristocratic , those whose " position is already fixed for them in life , " and who rarely if ever work under compulsion , who derive a mere minimum of benefit from classical or general training , may here learn something which shall beof direct utility to them in their social position . They will become that " intelligent and discriminating public " for which the friends of reform clamor as the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the present system . We have only to try to imagine the results that might be attained by offering the young men of wealth in this State the opportunity of studying thoroughly such congenial subjects as finance , political history , economy , and statistics . On the other hand , those whose minds are bent in another direction , who. pursue what Professor Porter is pleas*d to call the " severer studies " classics , mathematics , metaphysics , natural science-will see opened before them the path to manly and independent research . They , in their turn , will become the country 's brightest jewels , its aristocracy of intellect .
