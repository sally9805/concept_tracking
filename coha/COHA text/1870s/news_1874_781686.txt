txt " Waiter , " said BRIYAIBIELL , when a wellmeaning gentleman , on joining a party , offered to resign to him his chair , " Waiter , give me a cool chair . " This was not pure gratuitous impertinence . In days like those which we are having , and are yet to have , nothing cool is superfluous . The train of ideas-sugrested by the story of some seaside fishingtackle tricks , when told inland hr such days , is eminently refreshing . Even the bills and cuts which announce races in the swimming baths impart a coolness to the imagination , and . keep one comfortable all the way down , though the sun beat with unbridled rays . First one thinks of Lord BYRON swimming the Hellespont . Then the fancy strays to our own BEN FRANKLIN ; " I taught , " writes the philosopher in his memoirs , " WYGATE to swim , and made him a good swimmer . Leaping once from our boat into the river , I swam from Chelsea to Blackfriars , performing many feats that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on THEVENOT 'S motions , and aiming at the graceful . " It seems funny to think of the philosophic statesman  --  of whom it was said , " eripuit ecelo fulmen , 8ceptrumque tyrannis " ? tumbling in the Thames like a porpoise taught to dance . The artificial waters in the Central Park would have equal attractions for our City youths , but the scholarly STEBBINS has not yet opened " the Lake " to the great unwashed . Yet the park has been the means of doing incalculable good , and is thought of with affection by everybody who is compelled to remain in town during the Summer . For thousands of our fellow-citizens there is no Newport , no White Mountains , no Adirondacks , no Long Branch . The park is the Newport , White Mountains , Adirondacks , and Long Branch of the million . Let the million see that its beauties are not debased , its strength not shrunk and stinted , by any niggardly hand . It is really , as now directed , a thing of beauty of which New-York may wellfeel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing as well as pride . Other and older parks may produce different beauties from our suburban Arcadia , but very few can show such a combination , not the smallest element of which is at this season its endless and most picturesque variety of color . If we do not find there the patriarchs of the grove , with their massive splendor of foliage , we have many of their descendants putting forth their light , and glowing with the charm of freshness and of youth . You may go and visit , at great discomfort and expense , the Rocky or the White Mountains , or steam , as thousands are now doing , to see the Lower Apennines , or the Alps themselves , and not see a I spot so piquant and so pleasant , where art contributes music , sculpture , zoology , under most refined and able direction , to make nature itself more beautiful . You can , on one side , view the beautiful panorama of the Harlem Valley and the Sound , and , turning to the other , see beneath you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as seen . from there a vast , smoky mystery , the busy hum of its ceaseless traffic ever haunting the fancy , if not the ear . And , standing on this spot , the enervated NewYorker may quaff air pouring as fresh and unsullied from the country as if he were twenty or fifty miles away . That the blessing thus conferred is duly estimated is shown by the great accession of visitors who avail themselves of it . An eminent writer has recently said it is the strong tendency of our times to diffuse among the many the advantages so long confined to the few . If this be true , the Park is eminently adapted to the spirit and circumstances of our time , and if it continues to be cared for with that intelligence , and that loving and untiring zeal which characterizes C01 . STEBBINS ' administration , heartily aided by his brother Commissioners , it will each year prove itself a more efficient instrument in promoting the moral and intellectual improvement of the many . " You take my life when you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of the Board of Apportionment . If this board persists in the indulgence of personal rancor at the expense of the public , the music in - the Park which formed so attractive a charm must soon be silent , and many other luxuries and . enjoyments cut altogether or curtailed . One might fancy that if any of our public institutions could be placed beyond the . reach of low political intrigues and . wheelwithin-wheel manoeuvres , it would be one like this , whose very air is full of peace and freedom from angry political wrangles , and whither men go to forget the struggles and the strifes of life . But the park is being drawn into the vortex  --  and this is the misfortune , not the fault ; of Col. Stebbins . We can only hope that the politicians will at least let this pleasure ground alone , although we should not like to guarantee its existence for ten years longer if the people do not occasionally interfere to protect it .               @ @ @ @ @ @
