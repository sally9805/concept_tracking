THE LITERARY AND THE ETHICAL QUALITY OF GEORGE ELIOT 'S NOVELS . GEORGE ELIOT is more than a brilliant novelist . She is a great writer . She is more than simply a great writer She is a prime elemental literary power . In literature such , she is scarcely less in ethics . She is a great ethical teacher-it may be not an original , but at least ahighly charged derivative , moral , living force . Perhaps even thus much is still too little to have said . For George Eliot seems already securely to belong to the very small number of those choice literary names which we jealously account our greatest . There have been admirable women in literary history whose chief praise justly was the exquisite womanliness of their genius . Mrs. Browning , when we succeed in forgetting her virile affectations , appears an illustrious example . There have been other admirable historic literary women who were strong distinctively as men are strong . Madame de Sta*l is , perhaps , an example . There is a third class , distinguishable in conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we thought of them , in instinctively forgetting to remember their sex at all . Of these women we should not , on the one hand , say , They carried the feminine quality to its height ; nor yet , on the other , They transcended the limitations of their sex . We should simply say , Here were rare human souls , nobly endowed individuals of the human race . We should at once exalt them to the glorious severity of comparison at large with whatever personages in literary history , male or female , might appear worthy to be reckoned their peers . In this third class , if there be such a class , belongs George Eliot . If there is no such class , then George Eliot stands alone in literary history , for she certainly is such a woman . There is , therefore , no question remaining to be raised resQecting George Eliot 's intellectual rank . That point is settled already , as well as a like point ever was settled concerning any author during his lifetime . To determine , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , but the kind , of her power in letters and in morals , is a problem upon which something , perhaps , may still profitably be said . Indeed , an inquiry , carefully and candidly conducted , into the quality of George Eliot 's influence as a novelist , ought , it seems to me , at this time , alike on literary and on ethical grounds , to enlist the serious attention of a wide circle of readers . This inquiry may properly enough be limited to her influence as a novelist , for the reason that although she has done noteworthy work as a poet , it is through her novels chiefly , or through her poems as novels , that she has hitherto wrought upon the taste and the conscience of her age . The present inquiry will seek to be strictly impersonal-that is to say , there will be no attempt to import an irrelevant interest into this paper , by any allusions , open or covert , to the circumstances of George Eliot 's personal history . The books that she has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no more influence admitted from the character , alleged or actual , of the writer , than if instead of being a woman 's productions , they were the foundling progeny of Dame Nature herself . " Adam Bede " was the first work of the author that attracted wide public attention . This was published in 1858 . Inseparably water-lined into its literary texture was a certaip element not literary , well calculated to raise among religious readers of the book two quite different opinions of its quality . One can , in fact , easily imagine that its early fortune in this respect may have been , in some degree , like what afterward befell " Ecce Homo , " when that stumbling-block to the theologians was first given to the world . There must , on the one hand , we should say , have been religious readers not a few to welcome " Adam Bede " as they had previously welcomed " The Wide , Wide World , " as they subsequently welcomed " The Sch*5nberg-Cotta Family . " Such readers would see in it gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  to fit it for a place in the Sunday school library , or for circulation by the evangelical propaganda . On the other hand , a different class of religious readers must as naturally have thought that they discovered a quite predominant literary and artistic interest in the author 's conduct of her story , which separated her , in her own individual sympathy , from the exquisitely represented religious spirit of some of her principal characters . These less credulous // readers would accordingly stand a little in doubt of their author . Freely acknowledging that the sanctities of the personal religious experience were always treated by her with the most decorous respect ,  --  unable to deny that at times this respect passed over into even the most seductively seeming-sympathetic homage and awe ,  - -  they would have their misgiving nevertheless . They would seem to themselves to perceive that this writer , after all , was mainly intent on what , if they could have anticipated her subsequent diction , they might , perhaps ,  --  applying her favorite word ,  --  have called an " egoistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " holy secrets " of the Christian consciousness subserve , if not an irreverent , at least an inferior and a personal purpose . She would weave them into her design , for help to character and dialogue and plot . They should minister to an artistic , more than to any religious motive . Beyond this , her novel seemed to contain an undisclosed , but discoverable , implication , somewhat discomposing to the simply believing mind , that the author , on her own part , regarded the mystery of the life of God in the human soul from another than the obvious evangelical point of view . To her apparently this was but one element among many of an exceedingly complex human psychology , in which any other element whatever was divine and supernatural in quite the same sense as that . It is curious , in the light of present knowledge , to glance from one to another among the chief periodicals of that day , and note the various conjectures hazarded by the puzzled , but admiring , reviewers as to the true theological position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life " and " Adam Bede . " The " Westminster Review " must , of course , have been in her secret , but that quarterly affected to be as ignorant as its compeers , and after rehearsing opinions that assigned her to different theological parties from the Evangelical to the Broad Church , astutely ventured , for itself , to guess that George Eliot , while no doubt sincerely and deeply religious , was , probably , not the adherent of any one of the recognized creeds , being rather , it believed , of that liberal comprehension in faith which embraced whatever was true in them all . One thing , however , at least was plain to every reader of discernment . We had here a new writer who was master , abso lute master , of a style of extraordinary beauty and power . Choice English , limpid phrase , charming simplicity , marvelous answerableness to the shifting mood , whether of thought or of feeling , the finished and assured repose of self-conscious art ,  - -  art self-conscious but not self-complacent ,  --  these traits made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror to the world of a large soul , if as could hardly fail to be the case , the owner of such a style turned out to have a large soul . Just what might be the inner truth of this writer 's private relation to religion was , of course , matter of the purest impertinence to her literary claims . To the zealous religionist indeed it made a great difference whether one who evidently had so much power was going to wield her power for religion or against it . But the candid literary critic had only one possible interest in even entertaining a question like this . It might affect somewhat his estimate of her genius , if he could decide whether her aim in dealing with the problems of religious experience was the aim of an advocate , friendly or hostil* , or merely the aim of an artist instead . This I say , was the sole alternative that could tempt the literary critic to undertake a solution of the doubt . " Adam Bede " itself contained evidence enough to satisfy the justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the facts . To such a mind it was sufficiently clear that the writer of " Adam Bede " had had the penetration to perceive that the phenomena of religious experience in human hearts presented a vein of material for the novel1st which no novelist had yet turned to any adequate account . Either as being herself ; through the conditions of her own situation in life , exceptionally well qualified to work this vein , or , it might be , as possessing unconsciously a certain Shakespearean capacity of universal knowledge , without universal experience , George Eliot had introduced the religious element into her novel because , apart from its inherent attractions for the moral earnestness that was natural to her , she felt the artist 's instinct of its adaptedness to help her produce her effects . It was further clear that she had the genuine artist 's conscience to be judicially fair , or else , what served as well , the genuine artist 's tact to be effectively faithful in her use of her religious material . Her reproduction of the Christian // religious experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of outward expression ,  --  and farther , of course , was impossible ,  - -  wanted nothing of being exquisitely true to the rarest reality . The most mystically minded evangelical Christian might find his finest moods of devotion reflected in the prayers and the discourses and the conversations of Dinah , the lovely Methodist woman preacher , who is the real heroine of " Adam Bede . " Nothing , not divinely inspired , in history or in fiction , could well surpass the sweet , the heavenly beauty of Dinah 's life . But side by side with this beautiful life , a life wholesomely and not morbidly beautiful , represented as believed by the liver of it to be a life drawn directly from a hidden spring in the heart of Christ , yet so represented in such a way that the writer is not once committed outright as either adhering or not adhering herself to that transcendent belief-side by side with a life like this , nay , in immediate contact with it day after day , without being affected by it , a life how different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carnal life , goes on , in the undisturbedly complacent portraiture of the impartial author , who never forgets the artist in the fellow-being to betray the slightest vicarious moral concern that a human soul should thus prove unheedful , and miss to know the day of its heavenly visitation . It is not that this contrast is not true to the occurrences of actual life . It . is that no yearning emotion , no Pauline travail of spirit , is elicited from the writer in witnessing the tragedy that she creates . There is , perhaps , manifest a certain tender relenting on her part  --  a gentle , half-stoical despair that relieves itself with a laugh of Democritus . What it lacks is the mother-anguish of that distinctively Christian sorrow which weeps because it would have saved . In short , with respect to the fortunes of the life beyond life , not Shakespeare himself could be more supremely neutral , not the Epicurean Jove more serenely indifferent , as a creator administering for the beings of his creation . Such is the conclusion at which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely critical literary point of view , might easily arrive . But before " Adam Bede " appeared , its author had furnished to the critic other means for learning her motive and method . She had published in " Blackwood 's - Magazine " a series of sketches afterwards collected under the common descriptive title of " Scenes of Clerical Life . " These pieces seem now , viewed in the retrospect , to bear somewhat the character of studies for her later more serious productions . With greater propriety , perhaps , they might be regarded as short essays in a kind of compoThion as to which it was more needful to the writer to try the taste of the public than it was to try her own powers . For the first sketch , " The Sad Fortunes of the Rev. Amos Barton , " exhibits almost as much assured and tranquil sense of mastery , on the part of the author , in mere style of composition and method of development , as is exhibited in " Middlemarch . " There is even more repose of style in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Middlemarch " would George Eliot have written , for example , this sentence : " Has any one ever pinched into its Jilulous smallness the cobweb of pre-matrimonial acquaintanceship ? " " Middlemarch , " vol . I , p. 26 , Harper 's Ed . A shrewd question , with pregnant implication  --  but not quite comfortably expressed . The ambition of high achievement seems to have been a subsequent growth with George Eliot . The trophies of George Eliot who had written , it was , perhaps , each time , that would not let George Eliot that was writing sleep . " Scenes of Clerical Life , " are , in fact , so quiet in tone that their quietness comes near being a mannerism . They are intensely realistic pictures of perfectly commonplace life and character . The style of the composition is admirable . It is admirable enough to make these sketches well worth reading for the sake of the style alone . But it is so completely admirable that it scarcely of itself attracts any attention at all . It is only the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how far off from the beginning of effort the end of effort is , in the attainment of such a style , that will bethink himself to notice the exquisite perfection of these pieces as mere composition . The chief merit , however , of these pieces was not the finish of their style . They possessed the equally unique and perhaps graver merit of being a revelation to most people of the more than dramatic interest of humor and of pathos lying hidden under the common and everyday life that their neighbors are living around them . The traits of shrewd observation and of wise reflection that these " Scenes " exhibited might well , even in that early // phase of the author 's crescent fame , embolden one of the great British quarterlies in a review perhaps it was of " Adam Bede , " to apply that almost awful epithet of supreme literary ascription , " Shakespearean . The felicity of expression , too , always corresponded . You read , and you smile , as you read , with pure pleasure of intellectual recognition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or conduct so exquisitely fitted with its happy phrase that it is like what you can imagine it might be if , by some magical good fortune , you had chanced upon a treasure-trove of a few original types of nature , easily perfect at once , and with no trace of any workmanship whatever upon them . How much character , for instance , is unfolded with a stroke of the pen when of a certain " thin woman with a chronic liver-complaint , " at a tea-party , it is quietly said : " She has brought her knitting-no frivolous fancy knitting , but a substantial woolen stocking ; the click-click of her knitting needles is the running accompaniment to all her conversation , and in her u/most enloyment of spoiling a friend 's selfsatisfaction , she was never known to spoil a stocking . " Again : " Mrs. Patten does not admire this excessive click-clicking activity . Quiescence in an easy-chair under the sense of compound interest perpetually accumulating has long seemed an ample function to her and ske does ker malevolence gently . " * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ katred for her niece , Janet Gibbs , who , she knows , expects a large legacy , and whom she is determined to disappoint . Her money shall go in a lump to a distant relation of her husband 's , and Janet shall be saved the trouble of pretending to cry by finding that she is left with a miserable pittance . " A manservant does double duty as groom and as table-waiter at the house of a certain gentleman whose sister , living with him , had inherited title without estate from a deceased Polish count , her husband , but nevertheless aspired to some style in her house-keeping : " John " is represented as " removing the tea things from the drawing-room and brushing the crumbs from the table-cloth with an accomjanying kiss , such as he was wont to encourage himself with in rubbing down Mr. Bridmain 's horse . " The members of a clerical party are described : " At Mr. Ely 's right hand you see a. very small man with a sallow and somewhat puffy face whose hair is brushed straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height somewhat less disproportionate to his sense of his own importance than the measure of five feet three accorded to him by an oversight of nature . " The Rev. Amos himself was " very full of plans whichwere something like his moves in chess-admirably well calculated sujposing the state of the case were otherwise . " One feels , of course , how inadequate an impression of the fertile observation , the pregnant insight , with which these pages abound , any such excerpts torn from their relief in the context must necessarily make . A volume was recently published in England ( it has since been re-published , with additions for " Middlemarcb , " in this country ) entitled " Wit and Wisdom of George Eliot . " It is a remarkable monument to the manifold fecundity , and to the invulnerable vitality no less , of her genius . But shreds from the woof ill represent a finished and continuous fabric of the loom . It is the exquisite fitness of the sentiment to the situation or to the character ,  --  say rather to the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuberant , though never too exuberant , wit and wisdom their consummate value and effect . She loves to be sententious . She is fonder of reflection than she is of narration . Her plot is for the sake of her dialogue , her dialogue is for the sake of her character , and her character is for the sake of the wit and the wisdom that her many-sided genius is consciously capable and therefore desirous of lavishing on the world . This statement needs some qualification , for her dialogue now and again runs on , self-moved by its delight in its own conscious felicity . But it is approximately true . Her natural bent is about equally dramatic and ethical . &gt;She experiences a great delight in mere life-like exhibition of character . In so far she is purely dramatic . But she experiences fully as great a delight in subsequent interpretative comment and reflection on the character that she exhibits . In this she goes beyond what is dramatic and becomes ethical or else psychological . The ethical seems , perhaps , to engage her most deeply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier than it has been in her later work . Not that she has ceased to betray an ethical interest in what she writes . Thisis far enoughfro 'm beingthe // case . But her ethical interest has grown somehow less practical and more theoretic . The pure artist used to have to compete with the moralist . Lately the artist 's competition has been rather with the doctrinaire , or with the speculative psychologist . George Eliot from the first has been consistently and earnestly moral , or religious even , as those who claim her for a chief ornament of their philosophical school would probably say . It was not , therefore , as not earnestly moral , but only as not properly and purposely Christian , in the ordinary orthodox sense of that word , that " Adam Bede , " a little way back , was meant to be characterized . There is an eager and intent moral earnestness in the hook . But , notwithstanding certain ambiguous superficial appearances , the moral earnestness is not clearly and narrowly Christian . The quality of the moral earnestness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of the moral influence which she is likely to exert , is reserved for examination in the concluding portion of this paper . The " Scenes of Clerical Life " contain the germs , or at least the promise , of a considerable part of all that is to be found in her maturer productions . Like these , though even in a greater degree , they depend for their interest on qualities in them separable , and in fact separate , from the narrative which they incidentally contain . The narrative is both meager and commonplace to a degree . The constructive , or rather the inventive , faculty might seem wanting to the author . Quite as probably , however , she set small value in comparison on the plot of her stories , feeling rather like a painter who should resolve to achieve his results , not by any masterly skill of composition , but by the endlessly minute Dutch life-likeness of his picture , and then by the fine interpretative light of sentiment that he would contrive to throw over the whole . George Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot , although she has evidently paid far more attention of late to the construction of her stories . Whether this relative weakness in her performance is to be referred to inherent defect of invention in her genius , or rather to the predominating influence of the pure dramatic and the pure didactic faculty in it taken together , is , perhaps , open to question . The fact certainly is , that plot with her is everywhere subordinate to what may be VOL . VJII. - 44 termed the motive of the story , and incident is always fain to wait patiently on dialogue , while dialogue itself , the evident favorite diversion of George Eliot 's genius , gives way full cheerfully to that which is her chief serious concern , the work of austere and subtle psychological analysis . We thus recur to the element in George Eliot 's novels which has always , upon the whole , constituted the leading motive of her work . Psychological analysis is her strength and her joy . She creates character , she devises incident and situation , chiefly that she may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hers , of laying bare to its ultimate microscopic secret the anatomy of the living human consciousness in play . This motive in her work is what gives to it its unity as a progressive development - it is the one germ which has steadily unfolded and grown from her first published writing to her last . Her novels are preeminently psychological novels . The psychological element contributes the greatest proportion of the whole bulk of her volumes . There is a good deal of landscape , and there are frequent bits of brilliant meteorology . These parts , by the way , are done with delicious felicity of descriptive words , so that as mere verbal effects they are a perpetual delight . The features of a landscape , however , are seldom , if ever , photographed , as with a single sudden stroke of the sun , on the reader 's imagination . A radiant haze of words is hung between your eyes and the scene . A little idealism of the right sort seems so much better here than any amount of the most conscientious realism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the necessary kind of imagination for this poet 's purpose . But it might easily surprise a reader oP George Eliot that had never before directed his attention to the point , to observe how large a proportion of the space occupied with the liveliest conversation , or with the most exciting incident , is usurped by the author for her own interspersed interpretation and comment . The unique characteristic interest too of the dialogue and the narrative is to a wonderful extent , for even the cursory reader , lodged in these interruptions from the author in her delightful character of well-informed and astute individual chorus . But George Eliot 's novels could not be l ) opular , as they are , if , at the same time that they are thus prevailingly psycholog // cal , they were not also something else than psychological . She is often subtle and refined , and removed from obvious apprehension ( in her sense-she is always perfectly plain in her expression ) to a degree scarcely surpassed in the case of any professed psychologist or metaphysician in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average human being that makes her , notwithstanding , as popular too as she is profound . Shakespeare s street conversations , for instance , of citizens , Nos. i , 2 , and 3 , on occasion of a popular commotion , are not more faithful to the vulgar life of the populace than are such remarks as these which follow , specimen fragments of surly humor , reported from individuals of the Florentine mob during the famine and plague in " Romola . " Romola , in her stately womanhood , is ministering to Baldassarre , found in a dying condition on the street . Some starving fellows watch her with envy tempered with awe : Do you keep your bread for those that ca n't swallow , Madonna ? ' said a roughlooking fellow in a red night-cap , who had elbowed his way into the inmost circle of spectators  --  a circle that was pressing rather closely on Romola . " If anybody is n't hungry , ' said another , I say let him alone . He 's better off than people who 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ; if a man 's a mind to die , it 's a time to encourage him , instead of making him come back to life against his will . Dead men want no trencher. ' * * * * * " Come Madonna , ' said he of the red night-cap , the old thief does n't eat the bread , you see ; you 'd better try us . We fast so much , we 're half saints already . ' " * * * Romola held out the basket of bread to the man in the night-cap , looking at him without any reproach in her glance , as she said , Hunger is hard to bear , I know , and you have the power to take this bread if you will . It was saved for sick women and children . You are strong men ; but if you do not choose to suffer because you are strong , you have the power to take everything from the weak . You can take the bread from the basket ; but I shall watch by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread from him . ' " For a few moments there was perfect silence , while Romola looked at the faces before her , and held out the basket of bread . * * The man in the night-cap looked rather silly , and backed , thrusting his elbow into his neighbor 's ribs with an air of moral rebuke . " ( " Romola , " pp. 334-5 , Harper 's Ed . ) It was impossible not to quote , in sequel to the remarks of the men in the crowd , so penetratively humorous a trait of observation in character as is contained in the clause distinguished above by italics . The very flesh and blood of universal human nature is in that exquisite stroke . No doubt at bottom it is the same faculty of mind that makes one writer psychological in his method , and another writer dramatic . It is in either case a faculty for intuition of human nature-intuition , not observation alone , for the knowledge given by the faculty in question is an endowment and not an acquirement . It takes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as George Eliot observes . But then observation , even like hers , must often fail from lack of opportunity . For these times of failure there is intuition , if one only possesses it , not less infallible than observation itself . Such intuition George Eliot possesses . Perhaps if we sought to be entirely scientific , we should find this faculty of intuition to be identical in essence with that power of the mind which mental philosophers have distinguished as the faculty of generalization . But , notwithstanding the substantial sameness of the faculty in the two cases , how different a face of the same faculty is the dramatic from the psychological . *The dramatic method exhibits human nature in action  --  the psychological explains the grounds and motives of the action . Evidently the dramatic is limited in its effects by the degree of responsive faculty for observation and appreciation possessed by the reader or the spectator . The dramatist can exhibit to you only so much as you are capable of perceiving . There is nothing in the dramatist 's art to make you percipient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eye of* his beholder . The psychological method , on the contrary , may disclose to you far more in an action than you would have been able to discover for yourself . The psychological method becomes thus the proper supplement of the dramatic . At the point where the dramatic of necessity fails the psychological may begin . This is the *dvanta*e of the novel over // the drama . The drama can only be dramatic . But the novel may be as dramatic as the drama , and then go on to be as psychological as if it were riot dramatic at all . There is , of course , no implication here intended that the novel is a higher kind of literature than the drama . The question of precedence between the two is not raised . It is simply maintained that the novel , from its mixed character , as in turn dramatic , narrative , or reflective , at choice , has certain manifest advantages at specific points over the drama . This very mixedness of its character is probably a mark of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more deeply and subtly psychological than the drama . The drama is , of course , equally with the novel , bound to obey the laws of a sound psychology . In this sense of being psychological , there is no difference between the two . In the case of both alike , the action must proceed according to the truth of human nature . But the novel , more than the drama , is free to make its underlying psychology plain by exposition . The drama might , to be sure , conceivably employ the awkward expedient of adopting and adapting from the ancient Greek tragedy its chorus of solemn observers to interpret for us the psychology , in place of the ethics , of the action represented . In this way we might have in the drama unlimited psychological disquisition . But the drama thus modified would no longer be fit for l ) opular representation . It would have to retire from the stage to the closet . In other words , it would , in just so far , have declined from the pure dramatic idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save in the incident of its formal construction , from the novel . Now George Eliot within her range-and her range , though , unlike Shakespeare 's , it may have definite determinable limits , is still very wide ,  --  George Eliot , I say , within her range is every whit as dramatic as Shakespeare . So natural is the dramatic method to her genius that her novels are often conceived in a succession of scenes , instead of in the continuity of narration . But when , ceasing for the moment to be dramatic , she uses the privilege of the novelist to be expressly psychological , her analysis of character and motive becomes so subtle and searching that mere dramatic exhibition seems almost vulgar in comparison . Hamlet 's soliloquy is greatly admired for the depth and subtlety of psychological implication which it contains . But there is many and many a passage of clairvoyant vision and revelation in the sphere of human character and motive to be found in George Eliot 's works that makes Hamlet 's soliloquy superficial and tame . George Eliot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , is hardly second to anything elsewhere exhibited in the whole realm of literature .. There are marks enough in her writing of varied and watchful observation . But the knowledge of the human heart that George Eliot displays is not an acquired knowledge . It was born with her and in her . It is genius . It is a gift which is Shakespearean in quality-one might , perhaps , as well be frankly true to himself and out with his thought-it is finer than Shakespeare . In quantity it is less , but in quality it is more . Take as an instance of the advantage in point of fine psychological implication that the novel possesses over the drama , the qualifying clause , " with an air of moral rebuke , " appended to the statement of fact that the fellow " in the red night-cap " falling back , on Romola 's words , into the crowd , made way for himself by thrusting his elbows into his neighbor 's ribs . Here the action is nothing compared with the manner of the action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province of the dramatist to give . The dramatist has here to depend on histrionism to interpret his thought . Another instance is supplied in a powerfully conceived scene that occurs elsewhere in " Romola . " Tito visits the hut in which his outraged adoptive father , Baldassarre , lies couched in his straw , awaiting the retarded hour of his vengeance . Tito has decided to ease his own mortgaged future by healing the immedicable breach between himself and Baldassarre . He will ask forgiveness for his unfilial desertion and resume the son 's affectionate care of his father . Baldassarre greets his visitor by making the abortive attempt on Tito 's life with his dagger , but Tito persists . It is as yet uncertain how Baldassarre will receive the unanticipated overture . " Presently Baldassarre began to move . He threw away the broken dagger , and slowly and gradually , still trembling , began to raise himself from the ground . Tito put out his hand to help him , and so strangely quick are men 's souls // that in this moment , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a darting thought of the irksome efforts it entailed . ( " Romola , " p. 279 , Harper 's Ed . ) It would be hard for the dramatic method to enter so shrewdly as this into the almost subconscious movements of the human soul . An aside would not answer , for the thought does not take shape in words even in the thinker 's mind . But George Eliot is not simply a dramatist and a psychologist in her novels . She is a profound and various thinker as well . The thought which goes to the production of valuable literary work is of two sorts . There is the thought which has preceded , and there is , besides , the thought which immediately accompanies the conception and execution of the work . The one sort enriches the production through having enriched the producing mind ; the other more directly enriches the production itself . The one sort is immanent thought , *hought subsisting as condition ; the other is active thought , thought working as cause . Or the difference might be likened to the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those geologic ages which are finished and extinct , and the elements contributed by that *ge which is now current and still incomlete . Of both these sorts of thought George Eliot 's novels aYe full . Her later and maturer productions presuppose an mount of arduous thinking on the hard *d high problems of human existence that S nothing short of astonishing . It would not be easy to name any other writing in recent literature that , bulk for bulk , registers a greater quantity of good , fresh , deep , clear , sound , sincere , and honest antecedent thought . ' e The " In Memoriam " is preeminently of such a character-that work is like the earth 's thronged crust for the record of finished elemental processes and secular energies now in repose , that it enfolds . But George Eliot 's novels are not inferior here to the " In Memoriam . " The writer of these has swept as large a part of the great diapason of possible human intellectual experience as has the writer of that . The novels are inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they give to the thought . In the form of expression they are inferior only as prose must be inferior to poetry-as even the most exquisite prose must still be inferior to poetry when the poetry too , happens to be equally exquisite in its superior kind . George Eliot 's prose is as nearly poetic as it ought to be-that is , as nearly poetic as it could be , and remain completely and homogeneously prose . Precisely the differentia of properly poetic expression George Eliot 's genius seems not to have at command. * It is a great denial to her from nature . But perfect * I hardly escape the pain of self-reproach in denying the supreme gift of poetry to a writer who produces such lines as , for instance , these from " The Spanish Gipsy : " " Nay , never falter : no great deed is done By falterers who ask for certainty . No good is certain , hut the steadfast mind , The undivided will to seek the good : T is that compels the elements and wrings A human music from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his race Is to have been a hero . Say we fail We feed the high tradition uf the world , And leave our spirits in Zincalo hreasts . " That is very noble verse . Something of a trsse Miltonic spirit throbs in it . " The steadfast mind , the undivided will to seek the good , " might almost he from the mouth of Satan himself , turned moral . The whole strain is kindred in motive with strophe IX of Mr. Lowell 's magnificent " Commemoration Ode . " That passage and this set in contrast and comparison , furnish a fine study of the diverse methods pursued respectively by writers , on the one hand that are essentially prose writers , and writers on the other banti that are essentially poets . George Eliot , according to her genius , had a perfectly palpable concrete thought to express . She refined it , she sublimated it , she did every thing in short but permanenit&gt; chan&amp;e it from its proper native state as prose . She found a solid . She purified it seven times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , with his different sense , found an impalpable , imponderable ether . His labor was to seize it and to hold it . There was no danger of his getting a precipitate for result . The danger was rather that the volatile quality of his object would be too much for him -- that he should lose his over expansile thought altogether . The process of the essential prose writer in writing verse is thus in some sort the precise opposite of that of the essential poet . The one seeks to etherealize  --  the other seeks to compress and contain . But certain it is that what does not come to you as poetry , you can never convert into poetry with all your pains . As to the mottoes in verse to the chapters in " Middlemareb " hearing quotation marks which hint no doubt that they were borrowed from George Eliot herself , it may without disparagement be said of them , dense with thought and wisdom as they often are , they still contain many equivalents more of truth than of poetry . Her recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many noble intellectual and moral qualities-of spectilation , of reflection , of feeling , of power-hut of poetry- ? One attributes an autobiographic interest to it in parts . * The words " began to " occurring here in each one of three consecutive sentences so short , present a trait of negligence in writing which , however venial , strikes me as decidedly unusual with George Eliot . // prose is as rare , if it is not quite so precious , as perfect poetry . Let George Eliot be content with her gift . It is a unique and high delight , second only to that supreme delight which poetry yields , to read page after page , nay , volume after volume , of pure and homogeneous prose , undisturbed with any fear of occasion to abate one s complacency in the choiceness of the diction , in the absolute fitness of the phrase to the thought , in the linked , liquid articulation of clauses , in the rich , interwoven , harmonious order of the rhythm . This delight George Eliot bestows upon her readers beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suggested antecedent thought with which George Eliot 's novels are endowed , there is evident in them the presence also of an immense amount of coetaneous thinking . There is thought , the still result , and there is thinking , the fervid process . No writer is less disposed to be self-indulgent than George Eliot . She gives us her best all the time . Her slack moods , if she has such , she keeps . She applies a principle of severe rejection to everything below the standard . She thinks a thought thoroughly out , and then she spares herself no pains necessary fairly to express it . Her style has , accordingly , a vitalitv ,  --  let us employ the less usual Saxon term , the better to match the unusual fact ,  --  an intense Zivingizess all its own . It is like a living organism , " vital in every part . " The syntax tingles to its utmost particle with the fine vibration of an omnipresent life . To take away a word would be vivisection . The lacerated sentence would bleed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tense and quivering pages of these books ! But nothing has been lost . The force lives and is immortal . It communicates itself in quickened thought and feeling forever to the mind and heart of the race . But behind the thought and the thinking in these novels there is a vast amount , too , of the power of passion . The brain has not wrought alone . The heart has wrought with it . The thought , indeed , is very often of the sort that is always first in the sensibility . The brain has wrought because the heart moved it to work . The capacity of emotion on the part of their author , imjlied in George Eliot 's novels , is prodigious . The marvel of the sensibility is as great as the marvel of the intellect . Not that George Eliot seems certainly to have lived in any painful sympathy with the various personages of her plots . On the contrary , there is nothing more remarkable in her demeanor thanthe perfectly wholesome alacrity and ease with which she turns from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even , a more difficult transition , to the neutral ground of mere humdrum commonplace life . This is much the same as to say that she is not a sentimentalist . Her passion is deeper than the sentiments . It bows itself against the pillars of the soul . It takes hold of the bases . It is elemental . It is no mere transient sympathy that relieves itself with ready tears over the sorrows of her fictive world . It is a part of the author 's own personal experience . It is a real passion on account of the real woes of the real world . George Eliot appears to her readers " crowned with attributes of woe " almost ( not quite ) " like glories . " It is evident that her life has not been idle ore , ** But iron dug from central gloom , And heated hot with burning fears , And dipped in baths of hissing tears , And battered with the shocks of doom . The prevailing pathos of her books affects one with a tender personal sympathy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is evident she wishes and aims to inculcate , on behalf of the whole pitiable world of mankind . The irony in which she indulges is sometimes looked upon as cynicism . There could hardly be a greater mistake . It is the sad smile that plays on the face of a rueful despair . Cynicism is earnestness soured by contempt . Thackeray , * who wielded a htimorous sarcasm superficially similar to George Eliot 's , was no more a cynic than is she . But Thackeray was saved from cynicism by lack of earnestness . George Eliot is saved from cynicism more noblyby the absence of contempt . She is seldom more sincerely humane , more yearningly tender , than when she is irradiating the gloom in which her philosophy seems to shroud the lot of men , with a beam , gentle , and but half-gladdening even to herself , of irony , like the " setting sun 's pathetic light . " Occasionally her irony * George Eliot , by the way , would perhaps be as willing to acknowledge a literary debt to Thackeray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her faculty of observation , and her faculty of humorous expression as well , must , I should say , have been consciously or unconsciously trained in the school of the author of " Vanity Fair . " // takes on the humor of an angry indignation inspired by moral earnestness that is always noble , if it is not always wise . Perhaps it is possible of late to gather some just apprehension of a danger threatening the healthful poise of George Eliot 's spirit at this point . It would be wonderful if her rest in herself ; unsupported by rest in the only unshaken stay of human souls , should prove morally sufficient for her permanent intellectual health and peace . Symptoms of what may in the end turn out to be decline toward the cynical spirit are discoverable here and there in her latest productions-her latest production , perhaps , it should be said . Of the wide reading , the ripe culture , the various knowledge , which her works betoken in their author , it may be said that they would seem justly remarkable if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in su*h happy subordination to higher qualities as hardly to make a distinct impression for themselves . Only once in a while , in " Middlemarch , " does her learning appear a little over-forward to announce itself . Even in these instances the reader may impute what did not belong to the writer . For example : " Signs are small measurable things , but interpretations are illimitable , and in girls of sweet ardent nature , every sign is apt to conjure up wonder , hope , belief ; vast as a sky , and colored by a diffused thimbleful of via//er in the shape of knowledge . " ( " Middlemarch , " Vol . II. , p. 29 , Harper 's Ed . ) The sense here is like George Eliot , fine and striking and true ; but the word " sky " acted as a spell upon her memory and she recalled the latest science on the subject . Her imagination , however , was not quite equal to the task of making the science happily and helpfully available . At least so it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and not " color , " which the " wonder , hope , belief ; " give to the sky , in George Eliot 's conception . And it is the " knowledge , " and not the " idealization , " which acts as Prof. Tyndall 's " scattering " medium to break the whiteness of the light into color . But it is so much more instinctive to imagine one 's knowledge colored by one 's wishes , than to imagine one 's wishes colored by one 's knowledge , that the new turn continues to have too much the air of effort . It may justify itself to the understanding , but to the imagination it is a stumbling-block . For another example : " In short , woman was a problem which , since Mr. Brooke 's mind felt blank before it , could be hardly less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid . " When , as in " Middlemarch , " not often , but too often , we are obliged to feel that conscious effort has taken the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer 's power is not quite boundless  --  the idea of limit and definition is suggested . In general , however , it has to be conceded , George Eliot 's accomplishments are well content to be the unobtrusive if not unapparent conditions of her power . A further trait of George Eliot 's style , as salient and as characteristic as any , is her humor . Humor sometimes , and sometimes wit , it is natural to call that vivacious play of her genius , which is the accompanying grateful relief and recreation to its more prevailing sad and serious mood . The effect of this faculty for seeing things on their ludicrous side is almost omnipresent in her writings . It is a constant leavening element to aerate and quicken what , without it , would often be somewhat tedious , however wise and weighty , moral or social disquisition . It lightens and brightens the long pages which it is a peculiarity of her method to occupy with elaborate preliminary accounts of personages introduced , or of states of society conditioning her story . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plot would be quite too serious reading for most persons . The compass of her humor is very great . Often it is so fine , so exquisite , as to be absolutely elusive , except to a sense not only delicate by nature , but prepared beforehand , by knowledge of her habit . to be alert and suspicious . Then , again , it is broad and substantial enough to appeal to the least ethereal appreciation . To give by instances any adequate notion of its abundance , its piquancy , and its variety , would be out of the question . One might quote almost at random whole pages , and even whole chapters . Incidentally the absurdity of classical education for a boy , with no taste and no aptitude for it , engages her satire , at one point , in " The Mill on the Floss . " ( We seem here to conjecture an influence from her patron and friend , the corypheus of the New Educa7 tion , so-called . But Herbert Spencer , for all that he knows so well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his practice equaled the Damascene temper and // edge of the weapon that is wielded by his pupil . ) " I only know , " George Eliot remarks , " it turned out as uncomfortably for Tom Tulliver , as if he had been plied with cheese to remedy a gastric weakness which prevented him from digesting it . " ( P. 125 , Harper 's Ed . ) The most ardent classicist can afford to smile at this , and admit besides that for the case to which it applies , it is demonstration . Some of George Eliot 's characters are of humor all compact . Mrs. Poyser , in " Adam Bede , " is likely to enjoy an immortality of fame . She is as substantive a creation as Falstaff . Her wisdom is almost always wit . Her wise saws , pungent with Attic salt , flow from her with every collision like a stream of *parks from steel held hard on a whirling emerywheel . Chapter XXXII. in " Adam Bede , " entitled " Mrs. Poyser has her say out , " affords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delight in consciously effective wagging of the tongue . Mrs. Poyser , by the way , could hardly in her time have known anything of the " brimstone match " which , nevertheless , is made to supply her with an odorous and odious comparison to the Squire 's disadvantage . As a rule , George Eliot is very careful and scholarly in her historical settings . Her success with Mrs. Poyser in this interview seems to have induced her to repeat the experiment in " Middlemarch , " where a duplicate of the original scene occurs . One would not willingly spare either of these scenes , but they resemble each other enough to suggest a sense of that limitation in the opulence of George Eliot 's genius , which , as before hinted , is the point of her most noticeable inferiority to Shakespeare . So " Bob " in " The Mill on the Floss " is something like a study for Bratti in " Romola . " Bratti , however , is a vast improvement on Bob , and is , by the way , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not forced to perceive any difference of facility in the author for the personation of the female over the male humorist . It would be easy to mention other examples of virtual repetition occurring in the series of these novels . Such repetition seems to imply a limitation to the fecundity of the author 's invention . But this implication is not a necessary one . And the lavish profusion with which she sometimes gratuitously creates perfectly individualized characters , ( take for instances her pauper audience in " Rev. Amos Barton , " and her Featherstone mourners in " Middlemarch " ) , as it were for the mere wanton joy that she experiences in the exercise of her creative power , should , perhaps , be accepted for proof that her repetitions of herself are accidental , or nobly careless , and not symptomatic of poverty , in general , too , her novels are extremely populous with characters , substantially conceived and sharply discriminated characters , quite as if the author were not at all straitened in her sense of ample resources at command . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her method , when , as in the case of Mr. Brooke in " Middlemarch , " she seizes some chance habit of a personage to label him for the recognition of the reader . This cheap trick of characterization is entirely alien from the high-toned and conscientious style of George Eliot 's workmanship . Mr. Charles Dickens is entitled to remain undisturbed in his renown as the triumphant " Cheap John " of this ticketing method in literary haberdashery . Commonplaceness is a fault into which it would be impossible for George Eliot to lapse . For , however often she might present a familiar thought , she would be sure to affect it with some novelty derived from the vigor of her conception and the consequent freshness of her mode of expressing it . And still it does happen in a few instances that she uses stock expedients for developing her plots , and in one notable instance , the trick which the monkey practised on the quack doctor , in " Romola , " she condescends to give classical form to a story which it required some temerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superscription of her own . But then we should quite misinterpret George Eliot if we admitted these things to modify , in any appreciable degree , our estimate of her genius . These things do not belong to the sphere of effort where she expends her strength . The plot and incident of her stories are the mere moulds into which she casts her sentiment or her humor . She sets no value on them in themselves . You might destroy the entire framework of plot which sustains the structure of her novels , and the true transcendent value of her work would remain unimpaired . This is not saying that greater technical skill in formal construction would not enhance her claim to admiration . It certainly would . But , on the other hand , her deficiency here is not in the nature of a deduction to be made from her merit . For , although she has // chosen fhe novel for her vehicle , it is not as a novelist strictly that she is to he judged . The form of her work is subordinate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content of her work ,  --  the character , the dialogue , the humor , the pathos , the thought , contained in it ,  --  that must fix our estimate of her success . For this reason it is not much to the purpose to criticize George Eliot 's books as novels . Submitted to technical tests they would be found wanting at many points . In short , you could easily , by a destructive process of criticism , eliminate from these novels , one after another , the several merits on which novels in general depend for their popularity , until scarcely a single ordinary element of success with readers would seem to remain . But the life of thought and of feeling , and the exquisite organ of speech that they use , would remain , and these would still suffice , as they have sufficed , to make George Eliot , in spite of technical faults , a popular novelist . " Romola " is perhaps , upon the whole , the most satisfactory among her books considered purely as a novel . It is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . Compared with the rest , it is inferior only to " Middlemarch " in the weight and value of its thought and of its moral inculcation . It has besides , beyond any other , claims to the dignity of being an historical novel . But its history , although admirably studied , is not wrought into any vital organic relation with the story . Savonarola is a stately and gracious figure in it , strikingly presented , but , except in that one encounter of his with Romola on her first flight from Tito , the action might easily have dispensed with him . Tito , by the way , hardly gets the poetic justice done him at last that the long suspended development of his doom has been leading us to expect on his behalf . He has his will of life as far as to the end , and at the end he escapes the catastrophe that he would most have dreaded ,  - -  conscious exposure to scorn ,  --  and dies a quick death . Poor Baldassarre-he gets his revenge , but the sweetness of revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insipid case of the perpetuated baby . But what do things like these signify weighted against the extraordinary wealth of learning , of wit , of humor , of wisdom , of passion , of thought , of psychological insight , of prophetic moral teaching , conveyed in full " answerable style , " - that " Romola " contains ? Each successive book of George Eliot is more densely thoughtful than its predecessor . It is as if the weight of all that go before were a superincumbent mass pressing the one that follows into still compacter form . " Middlemarch " accordingly , both absolutely and in proportion to its bulk , compresses more thought into its limits than does any other one of her books . It is , no doubt , considered as a novel , vastly over-freighted with thought . Technically this is , of course , a fault . But what a fault ! " Middlemarch " certainly is not easy reading . It is , indeed , a wonderful triumph that it should find readers at all . The beginning of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it of intellectual riches is so great that it is difficult to understand how it should entangle the average reader in interest enough to keep him reading . But the catastrophe , or the catastrophes ,  --  how they gain in power from the retarded progress with which thus they are approached ! But what has already been said must suffice for appreciation of the literary quality of these remarkable books . We come now to the more serious part of our task-an attempt to appreciate the moral or ethical quality of George Eliot 's novels . In the first place , we must begin by maintaining , without reserve and without qualification , that , as to purpose on the part of the author , the moral quality of these novels is not only beyond criticism ,  --  the criticism of censure ,  --  but almost beyond praise . The moral motive that animates George Eliot 's genius seems to me to be wholly pure and noble . She is complained of , not without some reason , for clinging too closely to the hard , the unredeemed realities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . She is , indeed , here a realist , in the extremest sense of that word-no , we must not say the extremest , for there is a sense of the word that puts a writer conforming to it outside the pale of true artists and makes him , while remaining it may be faithful to fact , still ,  --  we lack a single term to express it ,  --  somehow crude , gross , offensive to cultivated taste , destitute , in short , of tone . George Eliot , then , let us say , is realistic in the extremest sense that is strictly consistent with art . A true artist she is , but she will not idealize . We miss in her representations of human life precisely the light that never was on sea or land . The light in her novels is still the light that is , and that always was , // and that always xviii be . If this is praise , it is her just praise . If it is derogation , so much must justly be derogated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life to considering them as intimations of her own moral standard , and of the didactic moral aim that inspires her work , we find a very great difference . The morality of these novels , if we regard the conscious intention of the author alone , is quite ideal enough . The morality of them may , or may not be , practically safe and wise . But , at least , it is never low . The highest sentiments of devotion to conscience and to truth , implied inculcations of the most magnanimous , the most costly self-sacrifice abound . Egoism " - this word is her substitute for the too polarized term selfishness ( the polarization , the same polarization , would inevitably soon be transferred from the original to the substitute ) - " egoism " is to be sternly repressed-it is to be brought to the altar of sacrifice . In the dialect of a school , she preaches " altruism , " in antithesis to " egoism , " that is , devotion to others , in exclusion of devotion to self . I accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot 's novels immoral in anything like the ordinary sense of immorality . I find it , also , equally impossible to sympathize with those critics who have lately pronounced " Middlemarch " a cold book . To me it is warm and pulsing with the lifeblood of a most loving human heart . The great act of Dorothea in paying her visit to Rosamond to counsel and comfort her , and to save Lydgate , at the very moment when her own life seemed to have been left to her desolate-I confess that it affects me as a stroke of pathos hardly less than sublime . This is the true climax of the interest of the novel . And it is worth noting that the climax is a moral climax . Tears from the depths of some divine despaira despair just then smitten with hope , since such goodness lives-start at this incident to rightly reading eyes like the waters from the rock springing at the touch of Moses ' rod . Certainly George Eliot is no maudlin sentimentalist-no melodramatic emotion-monger like him of " Little Nell . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key of that magnanimity which , in a world like ours , fallen and in sore need of redemption , is always the highest and purest pathos ,  --  I should scarcely know where to look for anything finer than " Middlemarch " supplies . This is by no means to be regarded in the light of concession to George Eliot . It is hearty , ungrudged and grateful ascription . She is a writer of great and generous moral aims . It is her worthy ambition to breathe , if she may , into the hearts of men and women ,  --  her brothers and sisters ,  - -  an ampler breath of moral inspiration . She would fain do something toward releasing us all from our pettiness , our selfishness , our falseness , our convention . Her psalm of life lacks sadly the anticipative triumph , but it has all the moral elevation , of that strain in " The Two Voices : " Waiting to strive a happy strife , To war with falsehood to the knife , And not to lose the good of life ; Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prove , And mete the hounds of hate and love ; As far as might he to carve out Free space for every human doubt That the whole mind might orb aboutTo search through all I felt or saw , The springs of life , the depths of awe , And reach the law within the law . Such I find to be the moral spirit of George Eliot 's novels . The moral tendency of them is a different matter . The moral spirit of George Eliot 's novels , - their intentional influence ,  --  makes one way . It is favorable to nobleness , goodness , virtue . The tendency of them , their undesigned influence , makes another way . Not wholly by any means , for happily mere integrity of purpose is itself a force in morals that no falseness of fundamental l ) principle can entirely countervail ; not wTholly , therefore , but in just so far as tendency is separable from spirit in writing , the tendency is contrary to the spirit in George Eliot 's novels . She unconsciously hinders the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading ideas in her novels is fate-fate in the two-fold form of outward and inward necessity . The universe is hard , unyielding , compelling ; character is given , fixed , unchangeable . Not that character is , according to her , a finished result from the first . It is rather a process , in deed . But it is process under immutable law . Character changes , but it changes according to an unchangeable necessity incorporate // in its own original constitution . It was always that in germ which at any moment it has become in development . In this sense , it is not too much to say , and to say again , human character in George Eliot 's philosophy is given , fixed , unchangeable . This conception of human life dominates in her writing . There are not more than two or three instances , if indeed there are any , of exception to the rule that the personages of her plot develop in character along a rigid line self-determined by their own persistent original identity . Hardly thrice does it occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succumb to fate  --  to the themselves and the not themselves , as Mr. Arnold would say . Now , that the persistency of human character is an idea or a fact , verifiable enough from experience and from observation to be awful , to be appalling , to be everything dire indeed , short of being absolutely overwhelming , I have no disposition to deny . It is one of the most intimate , most constant , most controlling of my own personal convictions . It may well almost master any deeply self-conscious mind . This resilient , this indestructible spring of personal identity within us , by virtue of which we return resistlessly to the old self , that we always really remained , from whatever forced escape and change we may , for a time , fancy that we have achieved for ourselves forever-who of us is there that has not shuddered at the consciousness of it ? We live bound to a constant point by an elastic tether . We have some freedom of range . We may stretch our bond somewhat , and cheat ourselves into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds . We can not break it . We can not impair its perpetual strength . Beyond a certain limit we can not continue to stretch it . That limit reached , the bond resumes to itself its delusively yielded power of resistance to our efforts against it . One sudden contractile throe of its terrible elasticity , and we are brought sheer back to our center . This is what thoughtful men have habitually observed and experienced . It is something that is still more intensely , as more intimately , dreadful than what Dr. Holmes figured with his famous waterdrop in the heart of the crystal* to repre sent the human will vainly free in its enclosure of circumstance . He was seeking a symbol for the wall of external condition that surrounds and imprisons us . I seek an expression for the law of condition that is incorporated in us . But both these ideas , the inward and the outward fate that restrains or compels us , seem to have taken tyrannous possession of George Eliot 's mind . Destiny is hardly more to the pagan Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Christian now simply to note a condition of time and circumstance . And the tragedy of the idea is greater with the Christian than it is with the Greek . George Eliot has borrowed from Christianity for her novels , unconsciously perhaps , but beyond her power to help it at any rate , elements and conditions that make the struggle of the helpless human will with fate in her representation tenfold harder and more forlorn than it could by any possibility be under the undisturbed dominion of purely pagan ideas . To oppose a stoic resolution " not to be overcome , " against the impenetrable , inexorable breast of fate -- that was the comparatively simple and easy achievement that pagan tragedy in its loftiest moods could satisfy itself completely with letting its hard-pressed gods or heroes accomplish . But George Eliot , in her far different light , sees too deeply and too truly what is indeed the highest ideal of morality for her to be content with offering such a release of virtue to her characters . Her men and women must be more than stoics if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Christian stoics . They must do more than merely endure . They must overcome . Self-abnegation , self-sacrifice , - nothing less than this Christian virtue , - is the worthy stoicism for George Eliot . But to be self-denying , self-sacrificing , like Christ , not in imitation of Christto have the Christian spirit without the Christian motive-well , it is still noble and beautiful as a conception , but the impossibility makes it so infinitely pathetic ! And this to wisely thoughtful minds is the true pathos of George Eliot 's novels . Hope is the very element of the Christian life . It is an apostolic word , " We are saved by hope . " But George Eliot tries to save us without hope . A gentle , pitying , pitiful despair broods in her books with tear-laden eyelids and tearless eyes over a * " I see myself , but yet I can not apprehend it . It is a drop of dew shut up in the heart of a rock . " Auerbach 's " On the Heights . " ( Translation , Roberts Brothers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and unhappy , in . It is a " sad astrology . " I do not go behind the books themselves to find a light in which to read the books . What I have said lies written all over the noble and mournful pages of her novels . We read and we seem all the time to dwell in a world over which the crystal sky hangs like a hollow hemisphere of glass , emptied of the ambient element of hope , and with walls as of a mirror admitting no light from beyond , but only mocking us with wearisome reflections of the light that is here . It is like trying to breathe under an exhausted receiver . It is like trying to see through the plane of a mirror . We pray for air , we pray for light . We might , perhaps , dispense with breathing here , if indeed the world has no atmosphere of hope in which we may breathe . But if we are to gasp and to die we at least would wish to be comforted with some glimpses " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky slopes pitilessly down , the horizon never lifts . " 0 dark , dark , dark , irrecoverably dark To such a view of the moral atmosphere of George Eliot 's novels , some readers may object : " Why surely there is a good deal of wholesome cheerfulness in these books . " And surely , say I , there is . But their tone is somber . The lights of humor and gayety in them are foil only to the prevailing melancholy and gloom that overhang them , like a beclouded sky filling the world everywhere with shadow . What a sad life was poor Tulliver 's , and what a blank end of it came ! How Maggie toiled in the toils of her fate , to have her proud spirit ( juenched at last like the quenching of a candle ! And Tom ! And Romola ! And Lydgate ! Nay , and Dorothea herself ! " Ill matched , " all of them , " with the meanness of opportunity " here , and hereafter-nothing . One must succeed , beyond what I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be oppressed with a sense like this as he lives for a time in the world of George Eliot 's men and women and children . Another of my readers may say : " Yes , George Eliot 's novels are sad books , but the world is a sad world . Life is the tragedy George Eliot represents it . She is not to be blamed , or even to be criticised , but to be praised rather , that seeing deeply into the truth of things , as she does , she honestly shows us what she finds . " Well , I grant that the world is just the dark world-that human life is just the sorrowful riddle-that George Eliot makes them . It is the truth . The malignity of circumstances is indeed slow to give way , only a little , even before the singular pureness and simplicity and high-heartedness of a Dorothea . If it gives way at all , it is very , very little , and the chances are that then it only seems to give way . Rosamond it m*ty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by the impact of Dorothea 's " altruistic " nobleness-sufficiently to let Dorothea herself through the straits that had been grudging her passage into the farther sea of her fortunes . But Rosamond will remain the same yielding persistency of opposition and defeat to Lydgate as before . This is George Eliot 's representation , and this , I acknowledge , is human life . Lydgate may take the waves of adverse circumstance with as good heart of controversy as he will . The world will prove " too many " for him . Lydgate is as helpless as Tulliver . The same heavy hand of necessity is upon them both . A dreadful imminent defeat defeats them from the very beginning and throughout the whole continuance of the strife . They fight against a foregone conclusion of their fight . It is quite as if they contended in view of the celestial balance hung on high with the beam already inclined visibly against them .

I go further . I acknowledge that sin is just the malignant persistent immortality that she makes it . If Tito will choose his own will and pleasure , then Tito 's sin shall follow him like a Nemesis-hunt him through life and hunt him out of life .

Scarcely the most extravagant theodicies of those that exaggerate the self-reproducing , self-punishing power of sin could exceed the representations of George Eliot . In all this , I repeat once more , I am entirely at one with George Eliot . She sees deeply and she sees truly into the great mystery and the great tragedy of human life . More than even thus much . Her interest in dealing with the grave problems of our existence here is a sincerely and nobly moral interest . And still , and stfll , I am constrained to believe , notwithstanding all this truth in thought and pureness in purpose on her part , George Eliot is exerting an influence to hinder more than to help her brothers and sisters in their struggles against sin . There are some , no doubt , - there are many indeed ,  --  both men and women , who need to be taught through a Tito and a Bulstrode , * what a dreadful germ of development sin is . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if sin be what George Eliot makes it , and what I believe it , then the matter of present degree signifies nothing . The end is the same , whatever the present degree . In all , as in one , sin when it is finished bringeth * Buistrode is perhaps the least real , the most like an impersonated tendency , among the characters of George Eliot 's creation . But if there are no Bulstrodes in actual life , there is plenty of Bulstrode 's quality distributed in various measures to members of Christian communities almost ever* - where . For my own part , therefore , I find no fault with the author as guilty of any unfairness , intentional or otherwise , toward the Christian name in her delineation of Bulstrode . I believe I know , from experience , no less than from observation , the potentialities of human nature too well , there is no malignant glee manifested on the part of the novelist , as if she were glutting some long-famished grudge against evangelical Christianity . On the contrary , the severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleness of the narrative . forth death . We all , I say , are sinners , and what concerns us chiefly is not to know the consequence of this better than we now do , except as better knowledge may incite to keener desire of escape , if escape be anywise possible ; but what concerns us chiefly is to learn how the too certain and too dreadful consequence of sin may be avoided . If there be no salvation for us , then it can only make us still worse through despair to be taught that we are helplesstrue , horribly true , though it be . On the other hand , if there is salvation for us , then not to hint this , to write as if there were not , is to slay us with despair when we might have been succored and revived with hope . But hopelessness I find to be the prevailing moral tone of George Eliot 's novels . She writes with truth and with power for a world into which sin has entered , and death by sin . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no redemption from sin . Alas ! George Eliot seems not to have heard that once for all , some eighteen hundred years or more ago , death was swallowed up in victory ! There is nothing , however , consciously or purposely hostile to Christ in all her books. * There is nothing either , in her apparent attitude toward Christ , of offensive patronage or of easy , self-conceited comprehension . George Eliot contrasts strongly here with Auerbach , between whom and her there are , at other points , some traits of resemblance . Their use of psvchological analysis is similar , and both writers write rather for the sake of the thought that they wish to express than for the sake of any story that they have to tell . But Auerbach , if one does not mistake in identifying the author 's own sentiment , is a self-satisfied dogmatist where George Eliot far more nobly , *s well as far more wisely , is fain to remain in doubt . Auerbach , accordingly , has his plan of salvation for us  --  a plan which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would nevertheless be impracticable enough to dishearten us still more completely than does George * I do not forget that an unacknowledged translation of Strauss 's " Life of Jesus " is attributed with probable truth to the band of George Eliot . But that she should have chosen to engage in such literary work as translating Strauss and Feuerbach ( " Essence of Cbristianity " ) is , I prefer to trust , evidence rather of that fascination which she could not but feel in the Man of Calvary , than of any hostility to his claims . The fact that these translations remain unacknowledged confirms the more welcome presumption . // Eliot 's mournful shake of the head on the subject . Auerbach says , Save yourself ; George Eliot says , Save yourself you can not . Auerbach quotes Christ , and shelves him in a niche of his pantheon . George Eliot , on the contrary , scarcely once mentioning his name , seems to stand as in a suspense of doubt and awe toward Christ . She breathes no articulate syllable in derogation from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble spirit poised and pausing thus long in a. balance of indetermina ! iOn respecting the Man of Calvary . She seems half ready to exclaim , My Lord and my God . Her posture in his presence is a prolonged , still unready , reluctant , resisting , passionate perhaps . God knows , hut I desire to hope that if she persists in not reckoning herself among those who are openly for Christ , Christ himself , in the largeness of his wisdom and love , may include George Eliot among those who vet are not against him . At any rate , her books all read as if she took heed to her pen in this regard , lest haply she should be found fighting against God . There are points of interesting resemblance and contrast , both literary and ethical , between George Eliot and Hawthorne . The style of each is exquisite . Both depend for the interest of their novels on other elements than narrative and plot . Both are comparatively weak in invention and construction . Both are profoundly and , in their several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it George Eliot , that exposes to us the motive and method of his work when we read as follows in " Twice-told Tales " : " Then might I exemplify how an influence , beyond our control , lays its strong hand on every deed which we do , and weaves its consequences into an iron tissue of necessity . " Arthur Dimmesdale and Mr. Bulstrode are evident moral congeners . These specifications perhaps exhaust their points of mutual resemblance . The points of contrast between them are curious and striking . Hawthorne is perhaps no more subjective than George Eliot ; hut he is far less objective than she . George Eliot , accordingly , would seem to be the more amply endowed , the more evenly balanced nature of the two . Hawthorne is not so learned as George Eliot , nor so familiarly conversant with contemporary thought . Hawthorne is vastly less dramatic , less versatile in dialogue , than George Eliot . Hawthorne 's attitude toward the supernatural is in most suggestive and stimulating contrast to George Eliot 's . You feel all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wizard who possesses a strange power of imposing upon your imagination with the effect of a supernaturalism in which he does not believe himself . You are kept constantly on the wavering border that joins the world of sense with a world of superstitious fancy felt to be almost equally real . The conjurer that plays this trick upon your own imagination you seem to he aware has himself an imagination proof by skepticism against the reflex influence of his own woven measures and waving hands . On the contrary , George Eliot is a severe exorcist of superstition . Her world is a world of pure naturalism . Wierd is a word that is always on your lips to characterize Hawthorne 's quality . The word is never so much as once suggested in speaking of George Eliot . A bluff breeze blows her books clear of clinging mists-a broad light , equally diffused , dissipates all haunting supernatural shadows . At the same time , you can not help suspecting that toward the real supernatural , of which there is none in her books , George Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mock supernaturalism , suggested rather than expressed , of which his hooks are so full . I do not remember any instance in George Eliot 's books of allusion to the idea of human immortality , either to adopt it or to reject it , either to desire it or to deprecate it . There is , so far as I recall , absolutely no future for man beyond death even for a moment suggested to the reader , except by the author 's occasional most suggestive silence on the subject . You may peruse the whole horizon again and again throughout its three hundred and sixty degrees . There is never a point where it gives upon a prospect outside . This no doubt is in accordance with a conscientious purpose on the part of George Eliot . She is intellectually a positivist , in the sense of accepting nothing for certainly true that she can not submit to tests of experience . But to use one of her own recurring passionate expressions , her heart , I must believe , " gives a great leap , " now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . I can not hut trust that her heart will yet conquer and lead that great intellect captive to the foot of the Cross .. I detect no zeal and no cunning of proselytism // animating her books . I doubt if she believes the bald naturalism , the virtual materialism , of her reputed school in philossophy ardently enough to become a conscious propagandist of its doctrines . She has too much misgiving , if I should not rather say hope , that Christianity may be true . She is too noble a nature . She loves her kind too well . She would rather not lead than run the risk of misleading . But unintentionally she does mislead when she emphasizes the obstinate persistency of human character in a way to leave the impression that there is not a friendly power of help at hand stronger still than the strength of native depravity . She does mislead when she represents the world of natural condition around us , steeled itself , as it is , against human entreaty , to be also void of benignant supernatural invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men and w6men with effectual succor . She does mislead when she describes the malignant capacity of development which belongs to the nature of sin , as if there were nowhere a corresponding capacity of arrest and reversal I ) rovided , abundantly able to destroy both sin and its consequences . She does mislead when she nobly inculcates self-denial and self-sacrifice without mention of the only motive that hist&amp;rically ever enabled living men and women long to practice self-denial and self-sacrifice . She does mislead when she writes as if the doctrine of atonement , of vicarious suffering , of " altruism , " to use the term of a school , were but a doctrine , a hopeless doctrine , and not also , and much rather , a fact , a hope-inspiring fact . If George Eliot had forborne to " handle spiritual strife " at all , it might not have been incumbent on her to introduce so necessary a condition of any fruitful solution of the problem of sin as that condition which Jesus entered inseparably into human history eighteen luminous Christian centuries ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidelity to Jesus or to the souls that Jesus came to save , on the part of this great writer . But it is the truth , nevertheless , however conscienceclear she may have been in doing so , that she has left out of her scheme of human conditions the master-condition of all . Christ indeed , though obscurely under an anonym , is present here in almost everything , except only that which is chief in his character , his power to save . His life of devotion is accepted , without express ac knowledgement it is true , as the ideal of human conduct . But the miracles of supernatural intervention attending his life , that revealed an invisible sphere of spiritual power environing us round in sympathy and alliance with struggling goodness-there is no effect admitted from these . Gethsemane with its agony , Calvary with its passion , Joseph 's tomb with its shrouded dead-these are here in effect . But the empty tomb , the resurrection , the ascension , captivity led captive , the thanks be to God which giveth us the victory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any helpful influence in George Eliot 's books . I feel , as I have said , that George Eliot desires to be morally helpful to her fellow creatures . Her best characters she makes to be sources of exalting inspiration to all the susceptible souls that come within their reach . Goodness in her descriptions possesses a kind of magnetic virtue to communicate itself . There is a natural flow of the element from soul to soul . Janet receives it from Mr. Tryan-Romola receives it from Savonarola ; Dorothea , she possesses it , but hardly , in her illmatching conditions , finds to whom she may impart it . George Eliot does thus teach us that goodness is not alone in the world . She shows us how it stands always in a never-broken circuit of mutual electric sympathy and help . But the heavenly magnetism has , in her representations , no certain , unfailing , abiding source . It is natural only . Now it is not enough for us that we have help . We must have sufficient help . Janet , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tryan does not succeed in transferring her dependence from himself to a supernatural power . Janet 's repentance is really human love for a human object , converted into another form of its correlated existence , the form of renovated character . You are subtly made to feel that it is only a chance mould that into which Mr. Tryan 's own e*perience has fallen , the mould of evangelical religion . Mr. Tryan 's language is strictly orthodox , and it is used by him with absolute sincerity . But the author somehow causes you to perceive that according to her own conviction the orthodox phrase in which Mr. Tryan speaks is really nothing more than unconsciously provincial dialect , to express an experience that is purely natural , and therefore perfectly ca // pable of expression in the natural language of morals and philosophy . In Savonarola George Eliot makes her nearest approach to representing a character that truly receives himself from an invisible supernatural source the magnetic virtue of spiritual invigoration and help which he imparts to others . But Romola , having been braced by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet finds her faith in him left to her at last but the ghost of a loyalty that desired , and was denied the boon of being perfect . Precisely where the natural ceases , and the supernatural would begin , George Eliot halts . Oh , George Eliot , I know as well as you that natural men have their limitationstheir moral limitations . Savonarola was weak , perhaps was wicked . But was Jesus ? Had Jesus any moral limitations ? Was Jesus then a natural man ? Did not the supernatural become historical in Jesus ? Is there not a Saviour for us ? If not , we pray you cease tormenting us with the awakened consciousness of our helplessness under sentence of death by sin . If there is a Saviour , then at the moment of that sorest extremity to which you reduce us , pray whisper , as surely you might know how so well , the gospel of his name . A gospel of some sort , be sure , more than all things else , we need . And many of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our most effectual help against sin in believing the gospel that sin shall not have dominion over us , that we are not under law but under grace . I set out with saying that George Eliot makes no distinctive impression for herself of sex , either in her intellectual or in her moral quality . This , when I consider her , as I undertook to do , in her books alone , still seems to me to be true . But as often as I permit myself to consider her likewise in her reputed relation to that school in philosophy which teaches the ancient doctrine of necessity , under the modern name of development , I tend somehow to experience an almost contrary feeling . There is apparently a contrast here between George Eliot and her brethren in philosophical faith . Her attitude is not altogether the same as theirs toward the creed which they unite in confessing . Her brethren believe with the head , and , so far as appears , do not doubt with the heart . George Eliot assents , perhaps unquestioningly , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a woman 's voice after all that one hears crying that monotonous passionate cry throughout George Eliot 's works  --  a cry of helpless grief , of outraged implacable sense of wrong , against this great , deaf , impassible universe . Not that her mindis therefore less . It is only that therefore her heart is more . And our George Eliot is still by so much greatei than we found her , by how much she proves after all to be a woman .
