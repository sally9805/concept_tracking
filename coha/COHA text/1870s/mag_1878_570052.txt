ARTICLE VJI. - SHALL INCOMES BE TAXED ? WHEN that part of the internal revenue law taxing incomes was adopted , it was passed avowedly as a war tax . When it was repealed , the frauds of which it was the parent left it with no advocates . But recently the subject has been revived in Congress , and a discussion of some of the principles which govern taxation and some of the objections to an income tax is timely . All taxes are in fact paid from the income of the payer , except in those rare cases where the income is so small in proportion to the tax as to cause a diminution of capital . What do we mean then by an income tax ? It is a tax laid directly and specifically on incomes , requiring every person to pay some portion of his income for the support of the government , and by writers on the subject is classified as a direct tax . Such taxes have never been popular either with governments or people . The burden of the tax is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arouse his opposition ; while the benefits received in good government are too remote , and are neither tangible nor clearly discernible , and are therefore incapable of exerting a counteracting influence on the mind of the payer . Indirect taxes , on the other hand , are felt lightly and excite little or no prejudice ; no separate or distinct demand is made for them ; they are paid as an increased price of the article purchased ; and are not separated in fact nor in thought from the cost of production , the profit of the seller , or whatever else goes to make up the price of the article purchased . Indirect taxes are also paid gradually and in small amounts , and when the articles purchased are wanted for use , and are therefore paid in the most convenient manner and at the most convenient time for the payer . It is perhaps sufficiently evident that a direct tax , as the term is used by writers on political economy , is one laid directly on capital or income . An indirect tax is laid upon certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on leave to exercise certain privileges . // Before proceeding to consider the expediency of an income tax , it may be desirable to examine some of the advantages and disadvantages of direct and indirect taxation in general . Adam Smith has laid down four principles or maxims relating to taxation which have been generally regarded as both comprehensive and judicious . 1st . The subjects of every State ought to contribute towards the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities ; that is , in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the State . 2d . The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary . The time of payment , the manner of payment , the quantity to be paid , ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person . The certainty of what each individual ought to pay is , in taxation , of so great importance , that a very considerable degree of inequality , it appears , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty . 3d . Every tax ought to be levied at the time and in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it . A tax upon the rent of land , or of houses , payable at the same time as rents are usually paid , is levied at the time when it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay . Taxes upon consumable goods are all finally paid by the consumer , and generally in a manner that is very convenient for him . He pays them little by little , as he has occasion to buy the goods ; and as he is at liberty to buy or not to buy as he pleases , it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any serious inconvenience from such taxes . 4th . Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . Let us apply these principles to direct and indirect taxes . It may be said in general , as to the first principle , that the tendency of direct taxes is to require all persons to contribute towards the support of the government in proportion to the // revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the State . If it is necessary to collect taxes to support the government under whose protection all persons and property are placed , then it would seem just that each person so protected should pay a ratable share of the necessary amount of taxes , and it would seem as if this end could be secured in no way so fairly , and the burden of the tax could be distributed in no way so equally , as by a direct tax upon all the persons so benefited , in proportion to the amount of revenue they enjoy under the protection of the government . An indirect tax on the other hand , a tax on specific articles , for instance such as tobacco , spirits , or malt liquors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first maxim of Adam Smith . Persons who abstain from the use of these articles pay no part of the tax ; and if a tax upon these articles should constitute the whole revenue of the State , such persons would contribute nothing to the support of the government by which they are protected . It seems strange at this stage of our enquiries , that the great inequalities of indirect taxation have not prevented both governments and people from preferring it to the more equal and apparently just system of direct taxation . As to the second principle , whatever advantage subsists in the certainty either of the amount to be paid , or of the time and manner of payment , belongs to direct taxation . Where taxation is indirect no person can tell how much or what proportion of the taxes he himself pays ; and yet notwithstanding Adam Smith regards certainty as more important even than equality , indirect taxation is for the most part preferred and direct taxation is rejected . As to the third point it must be admitted that it is more convenient for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , little by little , as he buys this or the other article , and it would not be strange if governments desirous of keeping the amounts raised from taxes from the knowledge of the people , should prefer this mode of providing the sum they need ; but in a country where the people are the source of power it would appear that this reason should not prevail . It would seem rather an argument in its favor , for the reason that it would be for the interest of each tax payer to exert himself to secure an economical // administration of the government . There seems no good ground for supposing , as to the fourth principle , that the expense of collecting a direct tax would be greater than that of collecting an indirect tax . The army of officers of excise and customs will always be as large as the collectors of direct taxes . Let us now enquire briefly what is the effect of direct and indirect taxation upon the public good . The revenue of the subjects of a State is derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rents . A tax on profits would not interfere with the business of the community , for all profits being diminished alike , there would be no inducement in consequence of the tax for a capitalist to change his business , since all profits are affected in proportion . As the tax does not impair capital the means of producing is not diminished and consequently there need be no variation in the supply of commodities . If in consequence of the diminution of income by the amount of the tax , the demand for commodities should be diminished , this diminution would take place in the same pro . portion for all classes of business , and would be no greater than would be caused by the same amount of tax collected in any other way . A tax on wages would not interfere with the general business , for all wages being diminisbed proportion . ately there would be no inducement for those who are depend . ent on wages for a livelihood to change their employment . A tax on rents would not operate unfairly , because the propor. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirect taxation or taxation of commodities is in the first place , if the tax is laid on specific articles , to raise the price of the commodities taxed , and this increase may and generally would fall very unequally on the community . If the tax should be laid upon articles of the most general consumption , its amount so far as those articles should be used by the class receiving wages would be made up to them by an increase of wages , and their part of the tax would in this way be paid by the employers , but in all other cases the tax would be paid exclusively by the consumers of the articles taxed . This mode of taxation would tend to disturb the business of a community , for if the article taxed could not be produced with greater economy so as to save the amount of the tax in // the manufacture , the price of the article would be raised by a reduction of the supply , and a portion of the capital employed in the production of the taxed commodity would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly necessary to say that the taxing of particular commodities offers great temptation to dishonesty and fraud . Smuggling becomes common and whisky rings are formed in the great centers of trade . Perhaps no mode of taxation tempts men to be dishonest more than the taxing of particular commodities . If a uniform tax was placed on all commodities , the inequality would be equally great , for the reason that the rate of profit to the sellers varies very much with different commodities , and therefore the proportionate amount could not be added to the price of every article , and the tax would of necessity fall more heavily on some than on others . It appears from this review of the subject that indirect taxation does not and does not aim to fall equally or proportionately on the citizens of a State . Indirect taxes are favored because they are out of sight , are not felt by the tax payer , and are supposed to be more easily collected than direct taxes . Thus far our argument shows that a direct tax is to be preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more certain in amount , no more difficult or expensive to collect , and does not affect the wealth of a community or the general welfare unfavorably . Let us now enquire what are the objections to a specific tax on incomes . In the first place it is extremely difficult , we may say it is impossible , to ascertain incomes with accuracy . If it is admitted that the amount of incomes derived from rents , or invested funds can be arrived at with precision ; how is a farmer or a professional man to estimate his income ? How can a manufacturer compute his income for a given year when the manufactures of the previous year have gone into his sales , and the manufactures of the current year are largely unsold . Many professional men and manufacturers under the law taxing incomes , which was formerly in force in this country , undoubtedly guessed at the amount . If the amount of a tax payer 's income is to be learned from // the tax payer himself a strong ternptation is opened to dishonesty , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably greater than any temptation which could arise under a law taxing specific commodities . If the knowledge is to be obtained by the assessor from other sources than the tax payer himself , great injustice would be likely to be done , and an opportunity would be offered for favoritism beyond any thing now known . But a more serious difficulty remains to be mentioned . The impossibility of doing justice in view of the different sources from which incomes are derived . A man who has an abundant capital invested in bonds of the United States or of the solvent States or in bonds well secured by mortgage on real estate , has an income which may be regarded as perpetual ; but the man whose income is derived from land or from trading or from manufacturing is dependent on a variety of circumstances ; he can not always , perhaps not often , tell at the end of the year what his income has been . If a manufacturer or a trader , his goods may be on hand , those that he has sold may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these is incapable of estimate . If he is a farmer , the same or similar uncertainties embarrass his estimate . If he is a ship owner , his property is in some degree perishable , and a yearly profit of twenty per cent . or more may be needed to repair the annual waste and give him the cQrrent rate of interest upon his investment . What appears to be income in this case is really a return of capital . If he is a professional man dependent on his earnings , or if he is living on a salary , the case is one of great hardship ; for when his income is spent , he has nothing to rely on but his fresh exertions to gain a livelihood , while the capitalist has all his capital to yield him an income again and again with every fresh spending . An income from fixed capital and an income from earnings either of the hands or the head , although capable of being classed under the same category are entirely distinct in principle . A tax on earnings is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax on incomes , because there is no way of replacing it , and it necessarily by so much diminishes the purchasing power of the community and the increase of wealth . // The plan of exempting a certain amount of income from the operation of the law does not remedy the injustice , although it relieves persons of small incomes from their just share of the expense of the government . The question resolves itself into this . Is the difficulty , or if you so say , the impossibility of arriving at exactness in incomes ( modified in part , as it may be by liberal exemptions of small incomes ) , together with the opportunity afforded for frauds , since the imformation for the most part must come from the individual tax payer himself , sufficient to counterbalance the theoretical justness and equality of the tax ? There are few persons who were cognizant of the operation of our last tax law of this kind , who would not say that the opportunities given for fraud , and the fraud actually perpetrated should condemn it or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes has been much complained of in England . The first law taxing incomes was passed in that country in 1798 as a war measure , and was repealed in 1802 after the peace of Amiens , to be renewed again on the renewal of the war the next year . It was finally repealed at the close of the war in 1816 . In 1842 Sir Robert Peel revived the tax on incomes in the face of strong opposition and with great complaint of hardship for several years , but this system with some variation in details has continued to the present time . The exemption in England only applies to incomes of ? 100 and is graduated , the rate being higher on the larger incomes . At present it is 6* pence in the pound on incomes under ? 150 , and 8* pence on incomes over ? 150 . The complaint of the operation of the law has arisen in England of late , mainly with respect to the smaller incomes and most of the cheating , which is admitted to be considerable , is within this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were exempted there would be less complaint and less friction . In Germany this system of taxing incomes is in full force and extends to all incomes , however small . No one is exempt but there is no open complaint . An importnnt question remains to be considered . Is a tax upon incomes a constitutional tax ? The provisions of the constitution on the subject of taxes are four . // 1 . Representatives arid direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , in. eluding those bound to service for a term of years and excluding Indians not taxed , three-fifths of all other persons . 2 . The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States , but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States . 3 . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken . 4 . No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State . What is the meaning of direct taxes as used in the Constitution ? If the term means what it does in the treatises on political economy , there can be no question that the tax as formerly laid is unconstitutional , but this question has been the subject of judicial decision . The first decision made by the Supreme Court of the United States bearing on this question was pronounced in 1796 , in the case of ilylton vs. the United States . Congress had levied a tax on carriages , and ilylton contested the constitutionality of the law . His counsel quoted from Adam Smith , Ricardo , McCullough , and others to show that this was a direct tax , but the Court decided otherwise . At that time the Court was composed of five judges . Chief Justice Ellsworth took his seat on the bench on the day when the argument was concluded , and for the reason that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision . One of the associates also gave no opinion , so that the opinion of the Court was by three judges out of five . Mr. Justice Chase who pronounced the opinion said : " I am inclined to think , but of this I do not give a judicial opinion , that the direct taxes contemplated by the Constitution are only two , a capitation or poll tax and a tax upon laud . " Mr. Justice Patterson says , " I have no doubt " that this is so . The question was elaborately argued . Alexander Hamilton presented a // brief on the part of the government . We understand that his brief has been recently brought to light sustaining fully the views expressed by Justices Chase and Patterson , but we have not seen it . The Court argued that the direct tax intended by the Constitution must be such a one as could be apportioned according to the census . Now if two States , equal in census , were each to pay $80,000 , by a tax on carriages , and in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the owner of a carriage in one State would pay ten times the tax which would be paid by the owner of a carriage in another State . Chancellor Kent says in his Commentary , the better opinion seemed to be that the direct taxes contemplated by the Constitution were only two , a capitation tax and a tax on land . Judge Story in his Commentary on the Constitution adopts the same view . The Federalist , in the 36th chapter , gives countenance to this view , where it is said : " Though the objection ( which the writer combats ) be made to both ( direct and indirect taxes ) , yet the reasoning upon it seems to be confined to direct taxes . " Then having shown that the objection which he combats was not valid against indirect taxes , the writer says : " the objection when applied to real property , or to houses and lands , will not bear a close examination . " As if real property , or houses and lands , were synonymous with the subjects of direct taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constitution relating to direct taxes . Direct taxes are coupled with representatives , and are to be apportioned in the same way . Now slaves were held by the courts of the Southern States to be for some purposes persons and for some purposes real property , and it would seem as if it was the intention of the Constitution , a part of the representation being based on real property , that the same property , and only that which was represented , should be taxed . If a direct tax should be levied on real estate , it would in the Southern States cover the slave property . The framers of the Constitution did not know much about political economy , and the distinctions made by writers on this subject . A tax on income had not been laid at that time by any government , and could not have been in the intentious of the framers of the Constitution . // The question came before the Supreme Court again under the late Internal IRevenue law , in the case of the Pacific Insurance Co. vs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Insurance Co. was at issue . It was held , Mr. Justice Swayne pronouncing the opinion , that such profits were taxable by the United States , under the power given Congress to collect imposts , duties , and excises , and that the tax was not a direct tax in the meaning of the Constitution . The case of Hylton vs. the United States was relied on as authority . The subject came a third time before the Supreme Court , in the case of Yeazie Bank vs . Fenno . The question here was on the power of Congress to tax the circulation of State Banks ten per cent . per annum , virtually taxing it out of existence . The court held that this was not a direct tax , Chief Justice Chase pronouncing the opinion . These cases seem to cover the ground pretty thoroughly , and we have no expectation that the Supreme Court will ever decide that a tax upon incomes is a direct tax , within the meaning of the Constitution . The action of Congress in laying direct taxes confirms the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $2,000,000 was laid , in 1813 one of $3,000,000 , in 1815 one of $6,000,000 ; all these were laid on lands , and improvements , and dwelling houses , and slaves . Another direct tax was laid in 1861 of $20,000,000 , which was laid on lands , improvements , and dwelling houses . If Congress had regarded other property as coming within the constitutional meaning of a direct tax , they would undoubtedly have extended these acts to cover all property taxable in that way . We conclude , then , that the United States Congress may tax incomes , not under the power to lay direct taxes , but under the authority to collect duties , imposts , and excises.
