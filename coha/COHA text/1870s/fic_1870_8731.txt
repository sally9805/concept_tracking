CAST OF CHARACTERS . Table : 6Kb LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR . Mr. Publisher :  --  In reply to the question , " Are you willing to have your Drama of Moll Pitcher published ? " I answer , Yes , if you will also print , as a preface , a few explanatory sentences and general remarks . If a person writes and prints a book , he is supposed to challenge customary literary criticism , and should not complain of its severity , if just . But if a person writes a play , and presents it to the public on the stage of a theatre , he expects his work to be critically reviewed , by a different class of critics , and according to different rules . But two of my Dramatic Pieces , to my knowledge , have been printed  --  one of these two , " The Carpenter of Rouen , " without my consent . Among the numerous Dramas produced at the National Theatre , under the management of the late Mr. William Pelby , was one entitled " Moll Pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of performers of talent , liberal outlay in really " new scenery , " machinery , and appointments  --  accessories in these days usually only seen in the play bills , " Moll Pitcher " was successful . It has been played in every State of the Union in which theatrical exhibitions have been given ; and , with one or two honorable exceptions , from stolen and mutilated copies of the original . I have had objections to publishing my plays ; one , that they were written to be acted to the people , and not to be read by them ; another , that by the publication I lost my ownership , copyright giving no protection against representation upon the stage . As " Moll Pitcher " has been often acted without my leave , no doubt , in time , it would be printed without consent being asked . I therefore choose the least of two evils , accord my consent , and in this manner acquaint the critic that the construction of " Moll Pitcher " occupied but two or three days ; that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done , and the manner in which the business of the piece is done , than what is said ; that its merits , few or many , depend upon its effect in representation , and they will be readily discovered by those competent to decide , when ever a fair trial is given upon the stage . I can not forego , if you will permit the space , to refer to the fine acting of the late Mrs. Pelby in this Drama . Her delineation of the " Fortune Teller " was unique . Such of the members of the National company , engaged in its first representation , who still survive , will , even at this late day , receive a renewal of my grateful remembrance of the services rendered on the night of May 20th , 1839 . It is often asked why there is no standard American Drama . One of the best answers is , nobody will pay for it . Some managers of theatres , and some principal performers , while pursuing their vocations , and receiving large sums of money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of the brains of the dramatist , but do not consider it necessary to ask or pay for it . It is not esteemed dishonorable by all , in the way of trade , to use a pirated manuscript , if it can be obtained for less than a true copy from the author could be had . The American dramatic author has no control over his property if printed . The " Carpenter of Rouen " has not only been acted in nearly every theatre in America without consent , but also in many of the theatres in Great Britain . The author has never received one dollar of remuneration , except the sum stipulated in the contract for its original production at the National Theatre . If the law of copyright in plays , and the regulations of a society similar , in some respects , to the Dramatic Authors ' Society , in London , had force in America as well as in England , we might have a Home Drama which would become creditable to our literature , and profitable to authors , managers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now engaged . But for the benefit of a new race of dramatic writers , I hope the subject will receive the attention it merits , and that the works of their pens  --  the inventions of the play-wrights  --  may be secured to them as property by law , as are the rights of the inventors or improvers of " patent corkscrews " and " bottle stoppers .

William Gray Never do worse than I command you , and you will have no cause for regret . Jotham . Jotham Hook , Sr. ( L.

O , now I think of it , Mr. William , if you have any business with me again by letter , remember to put Esquire on besides Jotham Hook , and then my boy Jotham , who is Jotham Hook , Jr. , will not open it . Eh ! Mr. Gray , what 's that coming up the hill ? A ghost ? William . William Gray Ghost ! Nonsense ! Has Moll Pitcher turned your brain , too ?  --  you , her neighbor ! Jotham .

Rosalie Elliston Dear William , am I pursued ? William . William Gray Fear nothing . Tell me , was it by your father 's orders that you left your home and friends , to sojourn in this solitary place ? Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston It was . William . William Gray ( R. H. ) Have you gained from him the knowledge of any cause that could lead to his sudden revocation of our betrothal ? Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston I could not , dearest William ; he silenced all my questions with the same answer : I can not guess a cause . William . William Gray He knows my history ; knew it when he pronounced the happy words that gave me hope to see you mine . We have never spoken aught but truth to each other . Do you think me to be the son of the merchant whose name I bear ? Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts contain . If their motives are pure , why conceal the truth ? ' T is hypocrisy ! a crime which finds no welcome here . With none to hear but thee , William , why should I hesitate to speak what all my acts betray ? I love thee , not thy fortunes ! Now speak and I will listen . William . William Gray I am the child of a wreck  --  born on board a ship the property of the man whose name I bear . To his generosity do I owe my education and all my future hopes . My parents were lost with all the crew save a black man , a cook  --  washed by the sea from the vessel in the cabin of which I lay . Tell me , Rosalie , has not some suitor of name asked thee of thy father ? Does not my history now present a contrast too great for him to withstand ? Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston I can answer only for myself . My father 's will is my duty ; without his word I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , ' t is mine alone till death . William . William Gray I can not ask more from thee now . This meeting is against his wish , else he would not send thee from him ; ( a boat is seen to leave the schooner , R. H. C. , and go off , L. H. ) a boat from yonder vessel has reached the shore ; should the passengers land on this side we may be discovered . If this interview is known to your father it will anger him . Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston I hope he may not know it . William . William Gray Should he question you ? Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston No word that is not truth shall pass my lips , as I live . I would not tell a wilful lie for my life  --  for thee ! William . William Gray I do not doubt it : in a few days I shall leave thee . A prediction made by one to me unknown , in spite of reason , weighs upon my mind . Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Go not to sea , William Gray , until Rosalie Elliston is thine by the church 's rites . " Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston A dream , William ! or else a waking fancy . William . William Gray Near the Pirate 's Den , some time since , at midday , I heard the voice that spake the words . I know ' t was human ! whose I know not . Have I not cause to believe its meaning ? am I not already forbid to see thee ? Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston ( L. H. ) There must be a cause for this change in my father . I will not believe he will bring unhappiness upon one he loves . Mr. Elliston enters , L. H. 2 E. , down C. , Williamon R. H. , Rosalie on L. H. Elliston . Mr. Elliston ( C. ) Nor would I have thee , dear girl . Mr. Gray , did I not advise you to forego your intimacy with Rosalie ? Why are you here together ? William . William Gray ( R.

Rosalie Elliston ( L. H. ) I deserve the reproach ; I have disobeyed , I confess ; had I thought  --  Elliston . Mr. Elliston That I watched your steps , you would not have ventured here . I shall ever watch you  --  protect you from danger in whatever shape it assails you . William . William Gray Danger ? Elliston . Mr. Elliston Yes , sir , danger ! Every hour , every minute that you are near her , there is danger ; else why should I retract my promise made , the nature of which you both know ? William . William Gray Sir , my pride , by that promise broken , has been deeply wounded . My love for Rosalie has made me bear the smart , if not with humility , with silence . What have I done ? I demand to know . Elliston . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , why not forget the past ? Your child kneels to you ; remove the bar that separates her from her betrothed  --  her husband , but for thy words . Elliston . Mr. Elliston Young man , be content with such reason as I shall give , without further question , and you shall know the cause of my present position . William . William Gray I am ! I must be content . Elliston . Mr. Elliston ' T is contained in that letter . I have read it until its words are fixed in my memory , to last with life . Read it aloud ; the language will reach no ears but ours , and the secret must remain locked in your breasts as it will in mine . Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston ( Taking the letter , reads . ) " Let not the promised marriage be solemnized between William Gray and your daughter . If you heed not this warning , the day that follows their bridal night shall be your death-day . The bride and bridegroom , ere the honeymoon be old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character : fear the hand that traced it , and made this mark . " William . William Gray Now , Rosalie , what think you of the prediction ? It is accomplished . Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston Is it not some playful threat , father ? You do not fear it . Elliston . Mr. Elliston Alas ! I do know the character and the sign . I do fear the hand that traced it , though I thought it had no longer the power that in that scroll is seen . Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston Who is the person that you fear ? Elliston . Mr. Elliston Ask no more : time must develop what I can not speak . Would you marry now ? Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston To endanger your life , my father , never ! William . William Gray Have you no clew to bring to light this concealed enemy , and prevent the intended crime . Elliston . Mr. Elliston No ; I shall consult Mr. Maladine . I am not acquainted with him , but report speaks loudly of his wisdom and piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already I have privately undertaken . Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston Consult Moll Pitcher . Elliston . Mr. Elliston Are you , too , a votary of that superstition that leads the rich as well as poor , the wise and ignorant , to seek future knowledge of the fortune teller . Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston I have never visited her house of mystery .  --  ( Aside . ) But I will to-night . Elliston . Mr. Elliston There are men among the rocks ; we will go into the town . The carriage is ready ; come , Rosalie . ( Crosses over , L. H. ) William . William Gray I will meet you at your house . I have a friend waiting for me at the beach . Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston Ride with us , William . Elliston . Mr. Elliston You forget you must be separated until the writer of that sentence is discovered and your safety is certain . I tell you ' t is no idle threat ; come . Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston Farewell , William  --  good night ! we may meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Elliston . Mr. Elliston Come , Rosalie . Exeunt Elliston and Rosalie , L. H. 2 E. William . William Gray Am I deceived ? Is this some trick to take her from me , or is it some snare set to catch me in an evil toil ? Quiet as I may seem , something prompts me here to array myself against the scheme which would seem to hurry me from duty . I will not tamely give her up ! If any man dare come between me and my hopes , my life or his must decide the question which fate is busy with . Can she be a party to the deceit , if such there be ? I deserve to lose her for the thought ! I will follow her like her own shadow ; I will heed the prediction . I will not leave her till she is mine alone . Music . Exit William , L. H. 2 E.

Moll Pitcher A good night 's work . I knew it now ; I need not write it down , my memory is my book ; though it be covered with lines of events , I can read all clear . Why do I prowl around among these rocks in storms and calms , with my gray hairs clinging to my head , wet with the sea spray , or streaming out , the sport of the hurricane ? Men know it not  --  men ! fools ! they call me witch , and ask what devil it is that helps me . The same devil that builds cities and makes men rule as slaves their fellows  --  knowledge . When I tell these mortals the secrets they think the moon and earth alone have listened to , will they not join the cry  --  She deals with the devil ? What devil ?

Now this man preaches to ' em so fine , that even Moll herself has been to hear him . Well , ' bout this money ; he told me to give it where it was most wanted ; I do n't know any body wants it more than I do ! Hard money !

Elliston . Mr. Elliston I have good motives , my child ; the best of motives . Often have I heard you say how highly you prized an unsullied name : on that point is your mind changed ? Rosalie . Rosalie Elliston No ; nor can it ever change ; my thoughts by day , my dreams by night , my life itself , depend upon your reputation and mine . Elliston . Mr. Elliston I 'm glad to hear you say so .

Elliston . Mr. Elliston Speak not so loud . Maladine . Maladine Twenty years ago , two young men were suitors to the same lady  --  one named St. Clair , the other Hermond : St. Clair was the successful one , and gained the lady 's favor . Thus matters stood . A third was introduced by the lady 's father , and soon bade fair to eclipse the one already to the lady promised . A quarrel was the consequence . Two of the parties met for mortal combat . Hermond was slain . St. Clair witnessed the deed , but was sworn to keep the secret . The stranger promised never to seek to win the lady 's love . St. Clair made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false ! he had carried off the lady , and made her his wife . St. Clair then vowed to bring to justice the murderer of his friend . He traversed sea and land without success , till at last chance led him here . You know the rest . Elliston . Mr. Elliston I do . You know the truth ; how shall I avoid him ? how keep the secret still ? Maladine . Maladine Except to kill St. Clair , there is but one other way . Elliston . Mr. Elliston Name it : then advise me . Maladine . Maladine Give to me your daughter for my wife , St. Clair shall be removed . Elliston . Mr. Elliston Gracious Heaven ! she has heard all ! I must not proceed . Give me time . Maladine . Maladine No longer time . I have no time to spare . I am scarcely young enough for such a bride . ' T is an honor to wed a priest  --  one followed as I am , too . Elliston . Mr. Elliston How gained you the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; have twenty years taken from my face all traces of St. Clair ? The gibbet or your daughter ! For years I have toiled to meet you thus . Your answer now . Elliston . Mr. Elliston ( Rising . ) I know not what to say . I will not sacrifice her to a villain ! I did the murder in my own defence . I will not sacrifice my daughter 's peace for my life . I have not forgotten the use of arms , nor have you . Come , your life or mine . Maladine . Maladine ( L. H. ) I am content . First give me your written promise of your daughter 's hand , and all your wealth . If I survive not , ' t is of no use to me . If you fall beneath my weapon , I have a claim which no man dare oppose . Elliston . Mr. Elliston ( R. H. ) I will not give the promise . ( Rosalie appears at door . ) Maladine .

Do not think I mean to become your wife : I said I would sign a promise that I never did intend to keep . I never will .
