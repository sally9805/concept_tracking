Shillaber , B. P. ( Benjamin Penhallow ) , 1814-1890 : READING PROOF . from Reading proof ( 1875 ) A printer and his proof this thought suggest : That , though at first unblemished it appears , Subjected to the keen-eyed reader 's test , The proof full soon a different aspect wears . With errors marred and marked , the unskilled eye Looks on despairing , seeing no avail ; But , mark the change , when , printed , by and by , The blotched offences into order pale . So may some life , we , superficial , scan , Seem pure and true ; but , changing as we look , We read the uncorrected proof of man , And mark the margin as a page of book : Some more , some less ; but , ' neath correction wise , ' T will all read rightly in the last revise .
