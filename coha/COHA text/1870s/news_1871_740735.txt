txt We print elsewhere an account of a church proposed , if we may believe the gentleman who calls himself " Mark Twain , " to be erected in Elmira , according to the plans and wishes of Rev. THOMAS K. BEECHER . The writer of this account has on several occasions deluded a too credulous public with what appears to him practical jokes , and this tale of his may be only another joke ; but if it is , it is admirably conceived and worths , to be made a fact . Ho relates that Mr. BEECHER , who is a well-known and justly-esteemed clergyman in Elmira , proposes , and his congregation consents , to erect a series of buildings , in connection with the church proper , to include Sunday-school rooms , a lecture-room , an assembly room , where any member of the church may give a social " party " to his friends ; an infirmary , for the care of the sick poor belonging to the church , thoroughly fitted and supplied with attendants and with a kitchen ; a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have no such conveniences at home , may bathe free of charge , and a free library . In connection ' with the infirmary , the church is to keep a horse and carriage , to give its sick poor the air . To a good many people such a scheme as this would doubtless seem Quixotic and impracticable . To us , we confess , it appears not only practical , but eminently wise . What is the object of a church ? For what do a number of people unite together as a church organization ? Is it to erect , furnish , and maintain a showy building , and install therein and support a brilliant orator , to whom they shall listen once , or perhaps twice , in the week , and who shall reflect upon them much glory ? That appears undoubtedly the main object of most congregations . To be sure , they do something more . They support , if they are rich , missionary chapels for the accommodation of the poor ; they are benevolent in various ways ; but many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes , in the long run , mischievous , because they separate the rich from the poor . A church , to be complete and properly organized , ought to include poor and rich alike ; it ought to provide for the wants of both ; it ought to bring them together , to establish and maintain between them mutual relations of kindness and . brotherly interest ; it ought to provide for its sick poor ; it should see after the welfare of its members ; in short , it ought to do what , according to Mark Twain , Mr. BEECHER 'S Church proposes to try in Elmira . " Fewer psalms and more supper , " was what a little street urchin proposed , in London , as an amendment to the practice of some benevolent body which had taken him in charge ; and . he was right . Mr. BRACE 'S efforts among the poor children in this City have been successful , because he and those who have labored with him have been able to convince the children that they were interested , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welfare . A few years ago a well-known citizen of Brooklyn , now dead , but still remembered with gratitude by hundreds of young men in this City and elsewhere , was the Superintendent of a very popular and successful Sundayschool ; and it was his constant practice , not only to instruct and train the boys and girls  --  mostly poor and many friendless  --  on Sunday , but also to see that they were properly and usefully employed ; to look after their advancement in the workshops where they earned their living ; to seek employment for those who needed it ; in short , he was not only their teacher , he was their helper , their guide , their friend and ally . He was , to them , what , if we may believe Mark Twain , Mr. BEECHER 'S people in Elmira propose to be to all who are of their membership  --  a helper in the time of need , an encourager , a comforter . His friendship aided and strengthened many hundreds of youth to live upright lives , to resist the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopeful , and industrious . Thus to encourage and help , by contact , by familiar acquaintance , by example , and by Christian kindness , rather than by the gift of money , or old clothes , seems to us to be the true office of a Christian Church ; and we trust Mr. T. K. BEECHER , who has the reputation of being a persistent man , will be able to give his plan a fair trial .
