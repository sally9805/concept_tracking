txt The determination which has been shown during the past year by the decent citizens of Arkansas to bring muederers to justice will eventually result in making the State a desirable place of residence . For many years it has been heard of almost entirely in connection with the reports of dark deeds . The cold-blooded murder of a Judge by a youthful desperado seems to have been the means of arousing the people to a true sense of the danger before them . Before that time murder was looked upon as a sort of pastime , and murderers , instead of exciting horror , were set up by the young women as heroes , to be crowned with laurel wreaths and decked with roses . The murderer of Judge MEARS , a youth named SIDNEY WALLACE , was one of the most admired of these heroes . His father was a lineal descendant of the WALLACES , of North Carolina . He , however , was not a man of blood . Before his death he had been ordained a minister of the Gospel . SIDNEY and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his teachings , and their mother , although the wife of a clergyman , as will afterward be seen , was anything but a meek and pious woman . Judge MEARS was an earnest friend of the family . He undertook to make SIDNEY a lawyer , but the latter had too much of the old knightly blood in his veins to content himself among books and . parchment . He did . not intend to give up study entirely. , but thought it would be well to enliven it by heroic feats on the highway . In 1871 he made his first bold attempt to win his spurs . He fired several shots at a commercial traveler , who , in. company with one TURNER , went out for an airing hi a buggy . The failure exasperated him , as likewise did . the black ingratitude of TURNER , who had . him arrested for attempted . murder . In the beginning of 1873 , after having in the meantime greatly distinguished himself in feats of arms , SIDNEY , still cherishing hate for TURNER , went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a man to go unprepared for such possibilities . He had a good shot-gun , and a sure aim , and had no sooner been attacked than GEORGE fell dead . On the same evening SIDNEY , having failed to bring clown TURNER , was said to have taken his revenge . by killing another enemy named DAVIS . TURNER was arrested for the murder of GEORGE WALLACE , but was discharged by Judge MEAlts , the fact having been plainly established that he had acted in self-defense . This decision cost the Judge his life . SIDNEY immediately set himself upon his track , and having put a bullet through his heart , took to the woods . The Judge proved that he really loved the boy , notwithstanding his terrible career , for it is said that he declared with his last breath that SIDNEY was not his murderer . The State was , much shocked by this occurrence . The Governor offered a reward of $5,000 for the capture of SIDNEY . He was taken by a Sheriff and lodged in the Clarksville jail . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : Before many days had elapsed he set his wits to work , contrived to gain possession of arms , and , when the guard only consisted of one man , called for the surrender of that person on pain of death . The guard rushed down the stairs , gave the alarm , and in a moment the jail was surrounded by citizens , one of whom was shot dead by SIDNEY while leading the attack . Such was the state of feeling provoked by this circumstance , that three barrels of powder were promptly carried to the jail , and SIDNEY and his companions were informed that if . they did not surrender within thirty minutes , they would be blown to atoms . It was easily to be seen that this was not an idle threat . Young WALL ACE threw his arms away , and gave up the contest . He after : ward succeeded in once more gaining possession of the jail , but was compelled to surrender . Meanwhile , he had been sentenced to death .

There is one point in connection with this ' case which , for humanity 's sake , we would rather have not found in it . The mother of SIDNEY , although , as before remarked , the widow of a clergyman , seems to have rather gloried in his crimes than condemned them . The reporter of the Little Rock Republican states that , in her last interview with her son , she declared to him that she would do her utmost to induce his surviving brothers to follow in his footsteps ; that , in fact , " she wanted them to go the same road he had gone , and when they were dead she would come in . " It would be difficult to imagine anything more shocking than this , and it is to be hoped that the feeling which we are told now animates the advocates of law and order in Arkansas ; will make the exhibition of such blood-thirstiness on the part of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
