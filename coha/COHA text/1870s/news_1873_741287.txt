txt People in Wall street were glad when Saturday night came , shutting down for a day upon the excitement and suspense which have prevailed since Monday morning . The only glimmer of light , too , came just at the close of business , and men who had been on the verge of ruin for days were fain to believe that the silver lining of the financial cloud was at last visible . In the - whole history of Wall street there has been no week so pregnant ' with trouble for all , and so entirely unrelieved by occasional brightness as the one just past . But , late yesterday , a feeling of confidence ontamect possession of the Wall street bankers , and faces - which have been drawn down by misfortune suddenly looked hopeful . The events of yesterday combined to better the condition of affairs , and the street temper , always elastic and ready to accommodate itself to the situation , took on a differen  --  tshade . In the morning there seemed to be little going on in the street except the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the advices from abroad had a depressing effect . The European markets for American securities were unsettled and seemed likely to go lower . The reports of the suspension of several country banks , and the action of still solvent institutions similar to that of the Associated Banks of New-York , added to the general gloom . The meeting of the Governing Committee of the New-York Stock Exchange took place at 10:30A . M. , but the result was not satisfactory . The advices from Washington were to the effect that the Government would do nothing more to aid the banks . Gold became lovely , and the price was pushed up under the the manipulations of the Canadian bankers to 1151/2 . The first sign of a change in the situation came in the news of the sweeping action of the Associated Banks in deciding to issue their clearing certificates to any amount that may be required , instead of limiting the issue to t20,000,000 . The effect of this action was to inspire the public with the belief that the banks intended to leave no measures - untried which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions . It was a bold stand , and Wall street , keenly alive to the situation , indorsed it . Then it became known that a petition was in circulation urging that the Governing Committee open the Stock Exchange . This looked as if people believed that the worst was over , and that there were firms anxious to resume dealings . Then a telegram came from Washington , stating that the Government would anticipate the payment of the November interest , which would throw several millions of money into the street . As good luck always seems to come in a heap , it was reported that Commodore Vanderbilt had succeeded in borrowing about $2,000,000 from dealers in foreign exchange in this City , and that he was rapidly settling his stock contracts . and that the call loan of $1,500,000 of the Union Trust Company bad been repaid . Inquiry at the offices of his bankers verified the rumors . So far as could be learned , all difficulties in the way of settlements previously existing had been smoothed over , and the dead-lock which two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stock Exchange was at an end . Osgood &; Co. , Davis &; Freeman , and Osborn &; Chapin arranged all of their business satisfactorily , and left the Governing Committee free to set a time for opening the Exchange . The Committee was not slow to take advantage of the improved state of affairs , and at a meeting which was called at 1:30 it was resolved to open the Exchange for business at the usual time on Tuesday . When all of these facts became known the most coma fete revulsion in feeling and expression took place . Every one seemed relieved , and there was more laughing and joking in the different offices than during the entire week . The prices of stocks advanced suddenly in the Independent Board rooms from five to ten per cent . There were plenty of buyers , but no one wanted to sell . It was the common opinion that , in a short time after the Stock Exchange opens , prices will rule quite as high as previous to the panic , and that when another Saturday night drives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved , if not wholly mended .
