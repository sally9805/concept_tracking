txt The railroad managers , if we may judge from the reports of our correspondent , have virtually taken possession of the New-Jersey Legislature , and are clamoring for the passage of now bills , and amendments to old ones , with such vigor that business which has a greater interest for the tax-payers of the State stands a good chance of being neglected . In one day six railroad bills were introduced . the.first being a supplement to the charter of the Morris and Essex Company , authorizing the construction of a road from the Boonton branch to Paterson , and of other branches ; the second incorporates the Somerset and Atlantic Road , starting from a point at or near Sandy Hook , and running to some point in Somerset County , and from some other point in Monmouth County ; the third incorporates the Burlington and Atlantic Road , from Tuckerton to some point on the Camden and . Atlantic Road ; the fourth incorporates the New-York and Pennsylvania Company , with a capital of $2,000,000. and permits the building of a road from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New-Brunswick ; the fifth incorporates the Philadelphia Road . with a capital of $10,000,000 , to run from Camden to the Hudson River , and the sixth incorporates the Delaware and Atlantic Company , with a capital of $1,500,000 , and gives power to construct a road from some point ou the Delaware River , at or near Frenchtown , Hunterdon County , to some point near Sandy Hook , in Monmouth County . Now , we must be greatly mistaken in our opinion of the popular feeling in New-Jersey if it is not strongly opposed , on principle , to these several schemes , although . some of them may be admitted to be worthy of favorable consideration . The people have been so accustomed to look with suspicion upon all legislation for railroads that they can have no confidence in any measure that does not bear unmistakable evidence of good faith . It would be exceedingly difficult to frame a " special " railroad bill that would completely disarm suspicion . The bill which recently passed the lower House , and which provides for a road from New-York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's measure " that we have yet seen ; but , popular as it appears to be , little or no difficulty was experienced in gaining currency for a rumor that the incorporators are merely figure-beads for certain rapacious speculators in the background . Meetings have been held in various parts of the State , favoring its passage through the Senate . But , considering the ease with which such expressions of public sentiment are procured , the significance of those in question may easily be overrated . What the people really want , and what they will not be content without , is a general law that will permit any number of capitalists resident in the State to form companies and build.railroads with as much freedom as is allowed in every other enterprise . A measure of this nature was introduced in the Senate a few days ago . It provides that companies may be formed , of not less than fifteen persons , with power to construct and operate railroads throughout the State ; that each company shall be at liberty to make articles of association , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years it is to continue ; the places from and to which its road is to be constructed ; the length of the same ; the name of each county through which it is to pass ; the amount of capital stock , notiless than $20,000 for every mile ; the Dumber of shares ; the names and . residences of the President , and not less than six of the directors , and the names and residences of the subscribers ; that the articles shall he acknowledged in legal form , and . having been filed in the office of the Secretary of State , shall form a charter for the coanpany ; that the Secretary o State , before recording such -1 . articleet , shall require affidavits to be furnished : him from a majority of the directors setting forth that there has been paid to them in cash , $10,000 for every mile of the road ; that after the stock has alt been eubscribeet , and fifty per centum paid in , the company shall have all the powers . of a corporation . created by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owners by the company direct , . but in the event of a disagreement , . ' the ? price shale be determined by Commissioners appointed by the Supreme Court , ; that whenever a railroad crosses a public highway , it shall be , above , or below gra &; ; that the construction of all roads shall be commenced within six months from th  --  date ' of the recording of the articles ; that when a road is not to exceed fifty miles , on  --  track must be finished within two years ; that the : capital stock may be increased to the extent of.470,000 ner mile , by a vote of theatockholders ; that each oempany shall pay city . aud town taxes on all its property except7 one hundred  --  feet in width of the road-hod. ; theta State ; tax of . one-half per cent . shall ? be paid on the capital stock , and that the toll . shall not exceed two and a half cents per mile for passengers , three cents per ton for first-class freight . and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert that this measure has been introduced in the interest of the Pennsylvania Railroad , in order to " kill oft " the " people 's bill " before referred to . It is rather a crude production , it is true , and will admit of much alteration and amendment ; but for the present we see no reason to doubt the honesty of its author . A similar measure has been prepared by a member of the House , and . out of the two it is possible that one good one can be made . However , if there is any intention to " fight one against the other . " the object can be very plainly seen , and the members of both Houses will be held accountable by their constituents .
