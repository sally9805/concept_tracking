txt Among the historic questions destined to remain unanswered is obviously this : Who reduced the City laborers ' wages from $2 to $1 60 ? Mr. Ram KELLY is responsible for the revival of this political ghost . His friends in council the other night resolved to print , as a campaign document , Mayor Wicuum 's letter exonerating him from all complicity in this nefarious transaction . At times , Mr. KELLY courts the tax-payers with fair words and alleged reductions of expenses ; then , again , he wooes the laboring men with promises of wages without work and contrasts without labor . This is the week for taking off his hat to the working men who have votes . There was a time when Jotax KELLY was glad and proud to be esteemed the author of the reduction of laborers ' wanes . That was when he was taking off his hat and bowing respectfully to the tax-payers . Now , when he is a candidate for Governor , his personal newspaper organ says ( in large letters ) that Mayor WICKHAM0 " exonerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One can only be exonerated when he has committed an offense . Was the reduction of wages an offense ? But the reduction of wages , whether an offense or not , has been claimed and disclaimed by a great number of Democratic politicians . The reduction was made in 1875 , while FITZ JOHN PORTER , was Commissioner of Public Works , and the celebrated HENRY A. GUMBLETON was Deputy Commissioner . There was a terrific outcry when the reduction was announced . But Tammany , turning its face toward the taxpayers , declared that this was the right and proper thing to do . The working men called an indignation meeting to protest against this high-handed outrage upon the rights of American freemen who were entitled to receive 50 cents more for a day 's nominal work for the City than for a day 's real work for private individuals . JOHN MORRISSEY , then a member of the Tammany Society , subscribed $50 toward the expenses of the laborers ' mass-meeting , to the great rage of KELLY . Then began the famous Kelly-Morrissey fight , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall . So , up to that time , KELLY was the approver , if not the author , of the policy which favored the reduction of the City laborers ' wages . But the tempest grew apace , and KELLY found it necessary to back down from his position as an economist and reformer . Although he had claimed for Tammany Hall the credit of originating this and other measures of reform , he procured a letter from Mayor WICKHAM , in June , 1875 , in which that functionary declared that KELLY had nothing Whatever to do . with the reduction of wages , and that he had ineffectually protested against this heinous crime . This is the letter which Mr. KELLY now prints as a campaign document . In the local campaign of 1876 , HENRY A. GUMBLETON was Mr. KELLY 'S candidate for County Clerk . The World , then a friend and ally of KELLY , thought to do GUMBLETON a great kindness . It stated , with much solemnity , that while GUMBLETON was the real Commissioner of Public Works , ( FITZ JOHN PORTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reducing the wages of the City laborers , thereby saving a great sum to the public Treasury . And it complacently added that tax-payers ought to hold up both hands for the good GUMBLETON , who had done so much to lighten their burdens . To say that GUMBLETON , candidate for office , was horror-stricken when he saw this undesired praise of himself , would faintly describe his feelings . He burst into the office of the World , where , according to the local chronicler of the day , he found the author , of the paragraph " dividing his attention between DEBRETT 'S instructive work on the genealogy of the English nobility and the preparation of an omelette aux ehampignons . " Of course , it was in vain for the bewildered friend of GUMBLETON to cite the fact that KELLY had kicked MORRISSEY out of Tammany Hall for protesting against the reduction of wages . The afflicted candidate could only hold his bursting head in his hands and groan , " These confounded laborers will all vote against me if they knew I was the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too , too much . " So it was then settled that GUMBLETON was not the criminal who saved money to the City by reducing the wages of its laborers . At least , the World settled it , next day , by taking it all back , with a humble apology ; and it is worthy of remark that that paper did not dare to mention GUMBLETON 'S name for months afterward . We have already seen that JoHN KELLY was not the hardened offender ; at least , we have his word for it , and , since he said that he was not the man after he had said that he was the man , we are bound to believe him . KELLY 'S noblest utterance is his last . Nobody ever accused Commissioner PORTER of doing this dreadful thing . In fact , nobody ever accused PORTER of doing anything while he was Commissioner  --  except to draw his pay . And Mayor WICKHAM , in the exceedingly able letter in which he " exonerated " Mr. KELLY , said that none of the Democratic Aldermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mayor WicicaAm 's word is almost as good as anybody 's . The question , therefore , is yet unsettled , Who reduced the laborers ' wages from $2 to $1 60 per day ? As Mr. KELLY 'S friends have revived this old conundrum , they may as well furnish its solution . The laborers did not reduce their own wages , and the wages did not reduce themselves . If KELLY once claimed the credit of the reduction , he did it in a moment of enthusiastic ignorance . He took it all back as soon as he found it was not popular . And it should be added to his credit that he has been consistent ever since in his denial . He still thinks that he was not the man who reduced the wages . It has not been a popular act . When it is , he will think it was a wise thing to have done . Just now lie is going about , with his finger by the side of his nose , asking , " Who possibly could have reduced them wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
