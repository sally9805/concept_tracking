LILL 'S TRAVELS IN SANTA CLAUS LAND . AND OTHER STORIES . BY ELLIS TOWNE , SOPHIE MAY AND ELLA FARMAN . BOSTON : D. LOTHROP AND COMPANY , FRANKLIN ST. , CORNER OF HAWLEY . COPYRIGHT BY D. LOTHROP &; CO. 1878 . LILL 'S TRAVELS IN SANTA CLAUS LAND . Effie had been playing with her dolls one cold December morning , and Lill had been reading , until both were tired . But it stormed too hard to go out , and , as Mrs. Pelerine had said they need not do anything for two hours , their little jaws might have been dislocated by yawning before they would as much as pick up a pin . Presently Lill said , " Effie , shall I tell you a story . " " O yes ! do ! " said Effie , and she climbed up by Lill in the large rocking-chair in front of the grate . She kept very still , for she knew Lill 's stories were not to be interrupted by a sound , or even a motion . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , and rock backward and forward quite hard for a little while , and then she said , " Now I am going to tell you about my thought travels , and they are apt to be a little queerer , but O ! ever so much nicer , than the other kind ! " As Lill 's stories usually had a formal introduction she began : " Once upon a time , when I was taking a walk through the great field beyond the orchard , I went way on , ' round where the path turns behind the hill . And after I had walked a little way , I came to a high wall -- built right up into the sky . At first I thought I had discovered the ' ends of the earth , ' or perhaps I had somehow come to the great wall of China . But after walking a long way I came to a large gate , and over it was printed in beautiful gold letters , ' Santa Claus Land , ' and the letters were large enough for a baby to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stop to explain . " But the gate was shut tight , " she continued , " and though I knocked and knocked and knocked , as hard as I could , nobody came to open it . I was dreadfully disappointed , because I felt as if Santa Claus must live here all of the year except when he went out to pay Christmas visits , and it would be so lovely to see him in his own home , you know . But what was I to do ? The gate was entirely too high to climb over , and there was n't even a crack to peek through ! " Here Lill paused , and Effie drew a long breath , and looked greatly disappointed . Then Lill went on : " But you see , as I was poking about , I pressed a bell-spring , and in a moment -- jingle , jingle , jingle , the bells went ringing far and near , with such a merry sound as was never heard before . While they were still ringing the gate slowly opened and I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Claus was at home , for I forgot all about myself and my manners , it was so lovely . First there was a small paved square like a court ; it was surrounded by rows and rows of dark green trees , with several avenues opening between them . " In the centre of the court was a beautiful marble fountain , with streams of sugar plums and bon-bons tumbling out of it . Funny-looking little men were filling cornucopias at the fountain , and pretty little barefoot children , with chubby hands and dimpled shoulders , took them as soon as they were filled , and ran off with them . They were all too much occupied to speak to me , but as I came up to the fountain one of the funny little fellows gave me a cornucopia , and I marched on with the babies . " We went down one of the avenues , which would have been very dark only it was splendidly lighted up with Christmas candles . I saw the babies were slyly eating a candy or two , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After we had gone a little way , the trees were smaller and not so close together , and here there were other funny little fellows who were climbing up on ladders and tying toys and bon-bons to the trees . The children stopped and delivered their packages , but I walked on , for there was something in the distance that I was curious to see . I could see that it was a large garden , that looked as if it might be well cared for , and had many things growing in it . But even in the distance it did n't look natural , and when I reached it I found it was a very uncommon kind of a garden indeed . I could scarcely believe my eyes , but there were dolls and donkeys and drays and cars and croquet coming up in long , straight rows , and ever so many other things beside . In one place the wooden dolls had only just started ; their funny little heads were just above ground , and I thought they looked very much surprised at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked quite grown up , and I suppose were ready to pull ; and a gardener was hoeing a row of soldiers that did n't look in a very healthy condition , or as if they had done very well . " The gardener looked familiar , I thought , and as I approached him he stopped work and , leaning on his hoe he said , ' How do you do , Lilian ? I am very glad to see you . ' " The moment he raised his face I knew it was Santa Claus , for he looked exactly like the portrait we have of him . You can easily believe I was glad then ! I ran and put both of my hands in his , fairly shouting that I was so glad to find him . " He laughed and said : " ' Why , I am generally to be found here or hereabouts , for I work in the grounds every day . ' " And I laughed too , because his laugh sounded so funny ; like the brook going over stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times , when I thought he had done he would burst out again , laughing the vowels in this way : ' Ha , ha , ha , ha ! He , he , he , he , he ! Hi , hi , hi , hi , hi ! Ho , ho , ho , h-o-oo ! ' " Lill did it very well , and Effie laughed till the tears came to her eyes ; and she could quite believe Lill when she said , " It grew to be so funny that I could n't stand , but fell over into one of the little chairs that were growing in a bed just beyond the soldiers . " When Santa Claus saw that he stopped suddenly , saying : " ' There , that will do . I take a hearty laugh every day , for the sake of digestion . ' " Then he added , in a whisper , ' That is the reason I live so long and do n't grow old . I 've been the same age ever since the chroniclers began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judge think I 'll continue to be this way for about one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six years longer ,  - -  they probably took a new observation at the Centennial , and they know exactly . ' " I was greatly delighted to hear this , and I told him so . He nodded and winked and said it was ' all right , ' and then asked if I 'd like to see the place . I said I would , so he threw down the hoe with a sigh , saying , ' I do n't believe I shall have more than half a crop of soldiers this season . They came up well , but the arms and legs seem to be weak . When I get to town I 'll have to send out some girls with glue pots , to stick them fast . ' " The town was at some distance , and our path took us by flower-beds where some exquisite little toys were growing , and a hot-bed where new varieties were being prop -- propagated . Pretty soon we came to a plantation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ivory rings growing on the branches , and as we went past they rang and bounded about in the merriest sort of a way . " ' There 's a nice growth , ' said Santa Claus , and it was a nice growth for babies ; but just beyond I saw something so perfectly splendid that I did n't care about the plantation . " " Well , " said Lill impressively , seeing that Effie was sufficiently expectant , " It was a lovely grove . The trees were large , with long drooping branches , and the branches were just loaded with dolls ' clothes . There were elegant silk dresses , with lovely sashes of every color --  " Just here Effie could n't help saying " O ! " for she had a weakness for sashes . Lill looked stern , and put a warning hand over her mouth , and went on . " There was everything that the most fashionable doll could want , growing in the greatest profusion . Some of the clothes had fallen , and there were funny-looking girls picking them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' These are all ripe , ' said Santa Claus , stopping to shake a tree , and the clothes came tumbling down so fast that the workers were busier than ever . The grove was on a hill , so that we had a beautiful view of the country . First there was a park filled with reindeer , and beyond that was the town , and at one side a large farm-yard filled with animals of all sorts . " But as Santa Claus seemed in a hurry I did not stop long to look . Our path led through the park , and we stopped to call ' Prancer ' and ' Dancer ' and ' Donder ' and ' Blitzen , ' and Santa Claus fed them with lumps of sugar from his pocket . He pointed out ' Comet ' and ' Cupid ' in a distant part of the park ; ' Dasher ' and ' Vixen ' were nowhere to be seen . " Here I found most of the houses were Swiss cottages , but there were some fine churches and public buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped for a moment at a long depot , in which a locomotive was just smashing up . " Santa Claus ' house stood in the middle of the town . It was an old-fashioned looking house , very broad and low , with an enormous chimney . There was a wide step in front of the door , shaded by a fig-tree and grape-vine , and morning-glories and scarlet beans clambered by the side of the latticed windows ; and there were great round rose-bushes , with great , round roses , on either side of the walk leading to the door . " " O ! it must have smelled like a party , " said Effie , and then subsided , as she remembered that she was interrupting . " Inside , the house was just cozy and comfortable , a real grandfatherly sort of a place . A big chair was drawn up in front of the window , and a big book was open on a table in front of the chair . A great pack half made up was on the floor , and Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he went to the kitchen , and brought me a lunch of milk and strawberries and cookies , for he said I must be tired after my long walk . " After I had rested a little while , he said if I liked I might go with him to the observatory . But just as we were starting a funny little fellow stopped at the door with a wheelbarrow full of boxes of dishes . After Santa Claus had taken the boxes out and put them in the pack he said slowly ,  --  " ' Let me see ! ' " He laid his finger beside his nose as he said it , and looked at me attentively , as if I were a sum in addition , and he was adding me up . I guess I must have come out right , for he looked satisfied , and said I 'd better go to the mine first , and then join him in the observatory . Now I am afraid he was not exactly polite not to go with me himself , " added Lill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had some work to do . So I followed the little fellow with the wheelbarrow , and we soon came to what looked like the entrance of a cave , but I suppose it was the mine . I followed my guide to the interior without stopping to look at the boxes and piles of dishes outside . Here I found other funny little people , busily at work with picks and shovels , taking out wooden dishes from the bottom of the cave , and china and glass from the top and sides , for the dishes hung down just like stalactites in Mammoth Cave . " Here Lill opened the book she had been reading , and showed Effie a picture of the stalactites . " It was so curious and so pretty that I should have remained longer , " said Lill , " only I remembered the observatory and Santa Claus . " When I went outside I heard his voice calling out , ' Lilian ! Lilian ! ' It sounded a great way off , and yet somehow it seemed to fill the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for a moment , for very near by was a high tower . I wonder I did not see it before ; but in these queer countries you are sure to see something new every time you look about . Santa Claus was standing up at a window near the top , and I ran to the entrance and commenced climbing the stairs . It was a long journey , and I was quite out of breath when I came to the end of it . But here there was such a cozy , luxurious little room , full of stuffed chairs and lounges , bird cages and flowers in the windows , and pictures on the wall , that it was delightful to rest . There was a lady sitting by a golden desk , writing in a large book , and Santa Claus was looking through a great telescope , and every once in a while he stopped and put his ear to a large speaking-tube . While I was resting he went on with his observations . " Presently he said to the lady , ' Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is trying to conquer her quick temper . ' " ' Two bad ones for Isaac Clappertongue ; he 'll drive his mother to the insane asylum yet . ' " ' Bad ones all around for the Crossley children ,  - -  they quarrel too much . ' " ' A good one for Harry and Alice Pleasure , they are quick to mind . ' " ' And give Ruth Olive ten , for she is a peacemaker . ' " Just then he happened to look at me and saw I was rested , so he politely asked what I thought of the country . I said it was magnificent . He said he was sorry I did n't stop in the green-house , where he had wax dolls and other delicate things growing . I was very sorry about that , and then I said I thought he must be very happy to own so many delightful things . " ' Of course I 'm happy , ' said Santa Claus , and then he sighed . ' But it is an awful responsibility to reward so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations every day , and I know who is good and who is bad . ' " I was glad he told me about this , and now , if he would only tell me what time of day he took the observations , I would have obtained really valuable information . So I stood up and made my best courtesy and said ,  --  " ' Please , sir , would you tell me what time of day you usually look ? ' " ' O , ' he answered , carelessly , ' any time from seven in the morning till ten at night . I am not a bit particular about time . I often go without my own meals in order to make a record of table manners . For instance : last evening I saw you turn your spoon over in your mouth , and that 's very unmannerly for a girl nearly fourteen . ' " ' O , I did n't know you were looking , ' said I , very much ashamed ; ' and I 'll never do it again , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the telescope , and I looked right down into our house . There was mother very busy and very tired , and all of the children teasing . It was queer , for I was there , too , and the bad-est of any . Pretty soon I ran to a quiet corner with a book , and in a few minutes mamma had to leave her work and call , ' Lilian , Lilian , it 's time for you to practise . ' " ' Yes , mamma , ' I answered , ' I 'll come right away . ' " As soon as I said this Santa Claus whistled for ' Comet ' and ' Cupid , ' and they came tearing up the tower . He put me in a tiny sleigh , and away we went , over great snow-banks of clouds , and before I had time to think I was landed in the big chair , and mamma was calling ' Lilian , Lilian , it 's time for you to practise , ' just as she is doing now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , mamma , " and ran to the piano . Effie sank back in the chair to think . She wished Lill had found out how many black marks she had , and whether that lady was Mrs. Santa Claus -- and had , in fact , obtained more accurate information about many things . But when she asked about some of them afterwards , Lill said she did n't know , for the next time she had traveled in that direction she found Santa Claus Land had moved . WHAT HAPPENED TO KATHIE AND LU . It was a very great misfortune , and it must have been a sad affliction to the friends of the two children , for both were once pretty and charming . It came about in this way . Little Winnie Tennyson -- she was n't the daughter of Mr. Alfred Tennyson , the poet-laureate of England , but was as sweet as any one of that gentleman 's poems -- had been to the city ; and she had brought home so many wondrous improvements that her two little bosom friends , Lu Medway and Kathie Dysart , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said and what Winnie had . For one thing , there were some wooden blocks , all fluted and grooved , and Winnie could heat these blocks in the oven , and wet her hair , and lay it between them , and O ! how satin-smooth the waves would be ,  -- hair-pin-crimps and braid-crimps were nothing to this new and scientific way . Winnie also made it a matter of pride to display her overskirts . These were arranged with ever so many tapes on the inside , and would readily tie up into the most ravishing bunches and puffs -- how Lu and Kathie , wee-est mites of women though they were , did envy Winnie her tapes ! Their mammas did n't know how to loop a dress -- witness their little skirts pinned back into what Kathie called a " wopse . " She also had brought some tiny parlor skates , and , withal , many airs and graces which her two young-lady aunties had taught her , among others a funny little new accent on some of her words ,  - -  the word " pretty " in particular . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance ! " And I can show you , " Winnie said , eagerly , " ' cause it goes by ' steps , ' and uncle says I take them as pr-i-tty as Cousin Lily . " Now , in Connaut , little girls do n't dance -- not nice little girls , nor nice big girls either , for that matter . The dimpled mouths opened in astonishment . " That is wicked , Winnie Ten'son , do n't you know ? " " O , but ' tis n't , " said Winnie . " My aunties dance , and their mamma , my grandmamma , was at the party once . " " We shall tell our mothers , " said Lu . " I 'll bet you 've come home a proud , wicked girl , and you want us to be as bad as you are . " Illustration : " Winnie already had her class before her . " Now Winnie was only six years old , about the same age as her virtuous friends , and she did n't look very wicked . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood gazing at her accusers , first at one and then at the other . " Luie , " said Kathie , gravely , " we must n't call Winnie wicked till we ask our mothers if she is . " " No , I do n't think I would , " said Mrs. Tennyson , looking up from her sewing , her cheek flushing at the sight of tears in her little Winnie 's gentle eyes . On the way home , they chanced to see their own minister walking along . Lu stopped short . " Kathie , " said she , " I know it 's awful wicked now , or else we never should have met the minister right here . I 'm just going to tell him about Winnie . " She went up to him , Kathie following shyly . " Mr. Goodhue , Winnie Ten'son is a nawful wicked girl ! " " She is ! " said Mr. Goodhue , stopping , and looking down into the little eager face . " Yes , sir , she is . She wants us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , she does . She wanted us to learn the steps , right down in her garden this afternoon . Would you dance , Mr. Goodhue ? " " Would I ? Perhaps I might , were I as little and spry as you , and Winnie would teach me steps , and it was down in the garden . " The little girls looked up into his face searchingly . He walked on laughing , and they went on homeward , to ask further advice . At home , too , everyone seemed to think it a matter for smiles , and laughed at the two tender little consciences . So they both ran back after dinner to Mrs. Tennyson 's . But on the way Kathie said , " They let us , the minister and ev'ry body , but if it is wicked ever , how is n't it wicked now ? " " I s'pose ' cause we 're children , " Lu said wisely . The logical trouble thus laid , they tripped on . They were dressed in sweet pink , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-bonnets of dear little country school-girls ever can be . It was a most merry summer day ; all nature moving gladsomely to the full music of life . The leaves were fluttering to each other , the grasses sweeping up and down , the bobolinks hopping by the meadow path . Their friend Winnie came out to meet them , looking rather astonished . " We 're going to learn , " shouted Lu , " get on your bonnet . " " But you was n't good to me to-day , " said Winnie , thoughtfully . " We did n't da'st to be , " said Kathie , " till we 'd asked somebody that knew . " Mrs. Tennyson was half of the mind to call her little daughter in ; yet she felt it a pity to be less sweet and forgiving than the child . Winnie already had her class before her . " Now you must do just as I do . You must hold your dress back so , not grab it , but hold it back nice , and you must bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not stand flat . " Very graceful the little dancing-teacher looked , tip-toeing here , gliding there , twinkling through a series of pretty steps down the long garden walk . But the pupils ! Do the best she might , sturdy little Kathie could n't manage her dress . She grasped it tightly in either fat little fist . " Mother Bunch ! " Lu giggled behind her back . Kathie 's face got very red over that . It was well enough to be " Dumpling , " everybody loves a dumpling ; but " Mother Bunch ! " So she bounced and shuffled a little longer , and then she said she was going home . But Miss Lu was n't ready . She greatly liked the new fun , the hopping and whirling to Winnie 's steady " One , two , three ! One , two , three ! " There was a grown-up , affected smirk on her delicate little face , at which Mrs. Tennyson laughed every time she looked out . I think Lu would have hopped and minced up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't told them it was time to go . " I do n't like her old steps , " said Kathie . They were sitting on a daisy bank near Mr. Medway 's . " Well , I do , " said Lu . " And you would , too , if you was n't so chunked . You just bounced up and down . " Kathie burst out crying . " I 'll bet dancing steps is wicked , for you never was so mean before in your life , so ! And you did n't dance near so pretty as Winnie , and you need n't think you ever will , for you never will ! " " Oh ! I wo n't , wo n't I ? " said Lu , teasingly . " No , you wo n't . I wo n't be wicked and say you are nice , for you 're horrid . " " You 're wicked this minute , Kathie Dysart , for you 're mad . " And as she laughed a naughty laugh , and as Kathie glared back at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . Lu 's delicate , rosy mouth commenced drawing up at the corners in an ugly fashion , and her nose commenced drawing down , while her dimpled chin thrust itself out in a taunting manner ; but the horror of it was that she could n't straighten her lips , nor could she draw in her chin when she tried . " You dis'gree'ble thing ! " shrieked Kathie , looking at her and feeling dreadfully , her eyebrows knotting up like two little squirming snakes . " If I 'm a Mother Bunch , you 're a bean-pole , and you 'll be an ugly old witch some day , and you 'll dry up and you 'll blow away . " By this time the two little pink starched sun-bonnets fairly stood on end at each other . " Kathie Dysart , I 'll tell your Sunday-school teacher , see if I do n't . " " Tell her what ? you old , old , OLD thing ! " Illustration : " They grew older and uglier each moment . " Kathie Dysart loved her Sunday-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could n't begin to scowl as fiercely as she felt ; her cheeks sunk in , her lips drew down , her nose grew sharp and long in the effort . And , all at once , as the children say , her face " froze " so . Oh ! it was perfectly horrid , that which happened to the two little dears , it was indeed . They could not possibly look away from each other , and they grew older and uglier each moment ! Why , their very sun-bonnets -- those fresh little pink sun-bonnets -- shriveled into old women 's caps , and even in the hearts of the poor little old crones the hardening process was going on , a fierce fire of hate scorching the last central drop of dew , until nothing would ever , ever grow and bloom again . It was all over with Lu and Kathie forever and ever . All this was long ago , of course -- indeed , it happened " once upon a time . " It would be difficult now to verify each point in the account . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a mistake as to the transformation of the children 's clothes -- the change of the sun-bonnets into caps , for instance . But , as a whole , I see no reason to doubt the story . Often , and quite recently , too , I have seen little faces in danger of a similar transformation . Where anger , envy , spite , and some others of the ill-tempers , gain control of the nerves and muscles of the human countenance , they pull and twitch and knot and tie these nerves and muscles , until it is almost impossible to recognize the face . Sometimes this change has passed off in a minute ; but at other times it has lasted for hours , and there is always danger that the face will fail to recover its pleasantness wholly , that traces will remain , like wrinkles in a ribbon that has been tied , and that , at last , the transformation will be final and fatal , and the fair child become and remain " a horrid old witch . " Of one thing we all are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a fair and innocent child ; so who shall say that this which I have related did not happen to Lu and Kathie ? FLAXIE FRIZZLE . Her name was Mary Gray , but they called her Flaxie Frizzle . She had light curly hair , and a curly nose . That is , her nose curled up at the end a wee bit , just enough to make it look cunning . What kind of a child was she ? Well , I do n't want to tell ; but I suppose I shall have to . She was n't gentle and timid and sweet like you little darlings , oh , no ! not like you . And Mrs. Willard , who was there visiting from Boston , said she was " dreadful . " She was always talking at the table , for one thing . " Mamma , " said she , one day , from her high chair , " your littlest one does n't like fish ; what makes you cook him ? " Mamma shook her head , but Flaxie would n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go to ride this afternoon we can stop at the slate-quarry . " Who was going to ride ? And would they take the " littlest one " too ? Flaxie meant to find out . Illustration : Flaxie Frizzle . " Do you love me , mamma ? " said she , beating her mug against her red waiter . " When you are a good girl , Flaxie . " " Well , look right in my eyes , mamma . Do n't you see I are a good girl ? And may n't I go a-riding ? " " Eat your dinner , Mary Gray , and do n't talk . " Her mother never called her Mary Gray except when she was troublesome . " I want to tell you sumpin , mamma , " whispered she , bending forward and almost scalding herself against the teapot , " I wo n't talk ; I wo n't talk a tall . " But it was of no use . Mrs. Willard was not fond of little girls , and Mrs. Gray would not take Flaxie ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Ninny -- or Julia -- was almost ten years old , a dear , good , patient little girl , who bore with Flaxie 's naughtiness , and hardly ever complained . But this afternoon , at four o'clock , her best friend , Eva Snow , was coming , and Ninny did hope that by that time her mamma would be at home again ! Mrs. Gray and Mrs. Willard rode off in the carriage ; and the moment they were gone , Flaxie began to frisk like a wild creature . First she ran out to the gate , and screamed to a man going by ,  --  " How d'ye do , Mr. Man ? You must n't smoke ! My mamma do n't like it ! " " Oh , why did you do that ? " said Ninny , her face covered with blushes , as she darted after Flaxie , and brought her into the house . " Well , then , show me your new picture-book , and I wo n't . " As long as she was looking at pictures she was out of mischief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cat came into the room with the new kitten in her mouth , and then Flaxie screamed with terror . She thought the cat was eating it up for a mouse ; but instead of that she dropped it gently on the sofa , purring , and looking at the two little girls as if to say ,  --  " Is n't it a nice baby ? " Flaxie thought it was ; you could see that by the way she kissed it . But when she picked it up and marched about with it , the old cat mewed fearfully . " Put it down , " said Ninny . " Do n't you see how bad you make its mother feel ? " " No . I 's goin ' to carry it over the bridge , and show it to my grandma ; she wants to see this kitty . " Ninny looked troubled . She hardly dared say Flaxie must not go , for fear that would make her want to go all the more . " What a funny spot kitty has on its face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a yellow star on its forehead . " " Well , " said Flaxie , " I 'll wash it off . " And away she flew to the kitchen sink . " What are you up to now ? " said Dora , the housemaid , who stood there with her bonnet on . " You 'll drown that poor little creetur , and squeeze it to death too ! Miss Ninny , why do n't you attend to your little sister ? " Dear Ninny ! as if she were not doing her best ! And here it was half-past three , and Eva Snow coming at four ! " O Dodo ! " said she , " you 're not going off ? " " Only just round the corner , Miss Ninny . I 'll be right back . " But it was a pity she should go out at all . Mrs. Gray did not suppose she would leave the house while she was gone . As soon as " Dodo " was out of sight , Flaxie thought she could have her own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , " said she , with a very sweet smile . " Will you lem me carry my kitty over to grandma 's ? " " Why , no indeed ! You must n't go ' way over the bridge . " " Yes I mus ' . ' Two n't hurt me a tall ! " " But I ca n't let you , Flaxie Frizzle ; truly I ca n't ; so do n't ask me again . " Flaxie 's lip curled as well as her nose . " Poh ! I have n't got so good a sister as I fought I had . Laugh to me , Ninny , and get me my pretty new hat , or I 'll shut you up in the closet ! " Ninny did laugh , it was so funny to hear that speck of a child talk of punishing a big girl like her ! " Will you lem me go ? " repeated Flaxie . " No , indeed ! What an idea ! " " I 've got fi-ive cents , Ninny . I 'll buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Two n't hurt me a tall ! " Ninny shook her head , and kept shaking it ; and Flaxie began to push her toward the closet door . " Will you get my hat , Ninny ? ' Cause when I die ' n ' go to hebben , then you wo n't have no little sister . " " No , I will not get your hat , miss , so there ! " All this while Flaxie was pushing , and Ninny was shaking her head . The closet-door stood open , and , before Ninny thought much about it , she was inside . " There you is ! " laughed the baby . Then rising on her " tippy-toes , " Flaxie began to fumble with the key . Ninny smiled to hear her breathe so hard , but never thought the wee , wee fingers could do any harm . At last the key , after clicking for a good while , turned round in the lock ; yes , fairly turned . The door was fastened . " Let me out ! out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Flaxie was perfectly delighted . She had not known till then that the door was locked , and if Ninny had been quiet she would probably have kept fumbling away till she opened it . But now she would n't so much as touch the key , you may be sure . O , Flaxie Frizzle was a big rogue , as big as she could be , and be so little ! There she stood , hopping up and down , and laughing , with the blind kitty hugged close to her bosom . " Laugh to me , Ninny ! " " What do I want to laugh for ? Let me out , you naughty girl ! " " Well , you need n't laugh , but I shall . Now I 's goin ' to grandma 's , and carry my white kitty . " " No , no , you must n't , you must n't ! " " You ca n't help it ! I is a goin ' ! " " Flaxie ! Flax-ee ! " Oh ! where was Eva Snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wall above the middle shelf , and Ninny climbed up and pushed it back . It opened into the parlor-closet , where the china dishes stood . If she could only crawl through that sliding door she might get out by way of the parlor , if she did break the dishes . But , oh dear ! it was n't half big enough . She could only put her head in , and part of one shoulder . What should she do ? It was of no use screaming to that witch of a Frizzle ; but she did scream . She threatened to " whip her , " and " tie her , " and " box her ears , " and " burn up her dollies . " But Flaxie knew she would n't ; so she calmly pulled off her boots and put on her rubbers . Then Ninny coaxed . She promised candy and oranges and even wedding-cake , for she forgot she had n't a speck of wedding-cake in the world . But , while she was still screaming , Flaxie was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat ; but , with her new rubbers on her feet , and the blind kitty still hugged to her bosom , she was " going to grandma 's . " She ran with all her might ; for what if somebody should catch her before she got there ! " The faster I hurry the quicker I ca n't go , " said she , puffing for breath . It was a beautiful day . The wind blew over the grass , and the grass moved in green waves ; Flaxie thought it was running away like herself . It was half a mile to the bridge . By the time she reached Mr. Pratt 's store , which was half way , she thought she would stop to rest . " ' Cause he 'll give me some candy , " said she , and walked right into the store , though it was half full of men ,  - -  oh fie ! Flaxie Frizzle ! Mr. Jones , a lame man , was sitting next the door , and she walked boldly up to him . " Mr. Lame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He laughed , and took it in his hands ; and another man pinched its tail . Flaxie screamed out : " You must n't hold it by the handle , Mr. Man ! " Then they all laughed more than ever , and clapped their hands ; and Mr. Jones said : " You 're a cunning baby ! " " Well , " replied Flaxie , quickly , " what makes you have turn-about feet ? " This was n't a proper thing to say , and it made Mr. Jones look sober , for he was sorry to have such feet . Mr. Pratt was afraid Flaxie would talk more about them ; so he frowned at her and said : " Good little girls do n't run away bare-headed , Miss Frizzle ! Is your mamma at home ? " " Guess I 'll go now , " said Flaxie ; " some more folks will want to see my kitty . " Mr. Pratt 's boy ran after her with a stick of candy , but could not catch her . She called now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so furiously that people rushed to the doors , afraid something dreadful had happened . " I fought you 'd want to see my kitty , " said the runaway , holding up the little blind bundle ; and they always laughed then ; how could they help it ? But somehow nobody thought of sending her home . When she reached the bridge she was hungry , and told the " bridge-man " she was " fond of cookies . " His wife gave her a caraway-cake shaped like a leaf . " I 'm fond o ' that one , " said she , with her mouth full . " Please give me two ones . " Just fancy it ! Begging food at people 's houses ! Yet her mamma had tried to teach her good manners , little as you may think it . " I do n't believe she has had any supper . It must be she is running away , " said the bridge-man 's wife , as Flaxie left her door . " I ought to have stopped her ; but somebody will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only laughed at her kitty , and then passed on . Soon the sun set , and the new moon shone white against the blue sky . Flaxie had often seen the moon , but it looked larger and rounder than this . What ailed it now ? " Oh , I know , " said she , " God has doubled it up . " She had changed her mind , and did not want to go to her grandmother 's . " Mr. Pratt fought I was bare-headed , and grandma 'll fink I 'm bare-headed . Guess I wo n't go to g'andma 's , kitty , I 'll go to preach-man 's house ; preach-man will want to see you . " On she went till she came to the church . Then she sat down on the big steps , dreadfully tired . " Oh , my yubbers ache so ! Now go s'eep , Kitty ; and when you want to wake up , call me , and I 'll wake you . " This was the last Flaxie remembered . When the postmaster found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her little tow head against the door , and the kitty in her arms . The kitty was still alive . Eva Snow had come and let Ninny out of the closet long ago ; and lots of people had been hunting ever since for Flaxie Frizzle . When the postmaster and the minister brought her home between them , Mrs. Gray was so very glad that she laughed and cried . Still she thought Flaxie ought to be punished . " O mamma , " said Miss Frizzle next morning , very much surprised to find herself tied by the clothes-line to a knob in the bay-window . " The men laughed to me , they did ! Mr. Lame Jones , he said I was very cunning ! " But for all that , her mamma did not untie her till afternoon ; and then Flaxie promised " honestly , " not to run away again . Would you trust her ? FIVE POUNDS OF CINNAMON . They do n't name girls " Roxy , " and " Polly , " and " Patty , " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is my heroine was a lady , those short , funny old names were not at all old-fashioned . " Roxy , " especially , was considered a very sweet name indeed . All these new names , " Eva , " and " Ada , " and " Sadie , " and " Lillie , " and the rest of the fanciful " ies " were not in vogue . Then , if a romantic , highflown young mamma wished to give her tiny girl-baby an unusually fine name , she selected such as " Sophronia , " " Matilda , " " Lucretia , " or " Ophelia . " In extreme cases , the baby could be called " Victoria Adelaide . " In this instance baby 's mother was a plain , quiet woman ; and she thought baby 's grandmother 's name was quite fine enough for baby ; and so baby was called " Roxy , " and , when she was ten years old , you would have thought little Roxy fully as old-fashioned as her name . I think it is her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises up before me . She herself had brown hair and eyes , and a good country complexion of milk and roses -- such a nice complexion , girls ! You see she had plenty of bread and milk to eat ; and a big chamber , big as the sitting-room down stairs , to sleep in -- all windows -- and her bed stood , neat and cool , in the middle of the floor ; and she had to walk ever so far to get anywhere -- it was a respectable little run even out to the barn for the hens ' eggs ; and it was half a mile to her cousin Hannah 's , and it was three quarters to school , and just a mile to the very nearest stick of candy or cluster of raisins . Nuts were a little nearer ; for Roxy 's father had a noble butternut orchard , and it was as much a part of the regular farm-work in the fall to gather the " but'nuts " as it was to gather the apples . Do n't you see , now , why she had such a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for such plump , rosy cheeks , why , then , she had to chase ever so many ways for the strawberries . Not a strawberry was raised in common folks ' gardens in those days . They grew mostly in farmers ' meadows ; and very angry those farmers used to be at such girls as Roxy in " strawberry time "  --  " strawberry time " comes before " mowing , " you know -- for how they did wallow and trample the grass ! Besides , the raspberries and blackberries , instead of being Doolittle Blackcaps , and Kittatinnies , and tied up to nice stakes in civilized little plantations , grew away off upon steep hill-sides , and in the edges of woods , by old logs , and around stumps ; and it took at least three girls , and half a day , and a lunch-basket , and torn dresses , and such clambering , and such fun , to get them ! Of course Roxy had red cheeks , and a sweet breath , and plump , firm white flesh -- so white wherever it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned , almost quaint . Her hair was braided tight in two long braids , crossed on her neck , and tied with a bit of black thread ; there was a pair of precious little blue ribbons in the drawer for Sundays and high days . Roxy 's mother would have been awfully shocked at the wavy , flowing hair of you Wide Awake girls , I assure you ! And Roxy 's dress . You never saw a " tow and linen " dress , I dare say . Roxy 's dresses were all " home-made " not merely cut and sewed at home ; but Roxy 's father raised the flax in the field north of the house , and Roxy 's mother spun the flax and tow into thread upon funny little wheels . Then she colored the thread , part of it indigo blue , and part of " copperas color , " and after that wove it into cloth -- not just enough for a dress , but enough for two dresses for Roxy , two for herself , and some for the men folks ' shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " trousers ; " and perhaps there was a fine white piece for sheets and pillowcases . Bless me ! how the farmers ' wives did work eighty years ago ! And how that " blue and copperas check " did wear , and how it did shine when it was freshly washed and ironed ! Only it was made up so ungracefully -- just a plain , full skirt , plain , straight waist , and plain straight sleeves . You never saw a dress made so , because children 's clothes have been cut pretty and cunning for a great many years . Roxy 's dresses were short , and she wore straight , full " pantalets , " that came down to the tops of her shoes ; for Mrs. Thomas Gildersleeve would have thought it dreadful to allow her daughter to show the shape of her round little legs , as all children do nowadays . To finish up , Roxy wore a " tie-apron . " This was simply a straight breadth of " store calico , " gathered upon a band with long ends , and tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when allowed to leave off the high apron and don the " tie-apron . " The first day she came to school with it on , her mates would stand one side and look at her . " O , dear ! you feel big -- do n't you ? " they would say to her . Maybe she would be obliged to " associate by herself " for a day or so , until they became accustomed to the sight of the " tie-apron , " or until her own good nature got the better of their envy . A " slat sun-bonnet , " made of calico and pasteboard , completed Roxy 's costume on the summer morning of an eventful day in her life . It was drawn just as far on as could be . It hid her face completely . She was pacing along slowly , head bent down , to school . It was only eight o'clock . Why was Roxy so early ? Well , this morning she preferred to be away from her mother . She was " mad " at both her father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a great , angry sob . About that time of every year , June , the children were forbidden to go indiscriminately any more to the " maple sugar tub . " The sweet store would begin to lessen alarmingly by that time , and the indulgent mother would begin to economize . Every day since they " made sugar , " Roxy had had the felicity of carrying a great , brown , irregular , tempting chunk of maple sugar to school . She had always divided with the girls generously . Her father did not often give her pennies to buy cinnamon , candy , raisins , and cloves with ; so she used to " treat " with maple sugar in the summer , and with " but'nut meats " in the winter , in return for the " store goodies " other girls had . For a week now she had been prohibited the sugar-tub . This morning she had asked her father for sixpence , to buy cinnamon . She had been refused . " Stingy things ! " she sobbed . " They think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not . O , I am so ashamed ! I 'd like to see how mother would like to be invited to tea by the neighbors , and never ask any of them to her house . I guess she 'd feel mean ! But they think because I am a little girl , there 's no need of my being polite and free-hearted ! Polly Stedman has given me cinnamon three times , and I know the girls think I 'm stingy ! I 'm so ashamed ! " And Roxy 's red cheeks and shining brown eyes brimmed up and overflowed with tears . Poor little Roxy ! she herself had such a big sweet tooth ! It was absolutely impossible for her to refuse a piece of stick cinnamon or a peppermint drop . Yesterday she had told the girls she should certainly bring maple sugar to-day . She meant to , too , even if she " took " it . But there her mother had stood at the broad shelf all the morning , making pies and ginger snaps , and the sugar-tub set under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally had asked her mother . " No , Roxy ; the sugar will be gone in less than a month . You children eat more sugar every year than I use in cooking . It 's a wonder you have any stomachs left . " " I promised the girls some , " pleaded Roxy . " Promised the girls ! You 've fed these girls ever since the sugar was made . Off with you ! What do you suppose your father 'd say ? " Roxy would n't have dared tell her father . He was a stirring , hard-working man , that gave his family all the luxuries and comforts that could be " raised " on the farm ; but bought few , and growled over what he did buy , and made no " store debts . " It was high time , in fact , that Roxy 's indulgent mother should begin to husband the sugar . Roxy saw there would be no chance to " take " the sugar ; so she had mournfully started off . Is it strange that so generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , children , I have seen many a man do mean , wrong , dishonest deeds , in order to be thought generous , and a " royal good fellow , " by his own particular friends ; and Roxy would a thousand times rather have " stolen " than to have faced her mates empty-handed this morning . She walked on in sorrowful meditation . She thought once of going back , to see if there were eggs at the barn -- she might take them down to the store , and get candy . But she remembered they were all brought in last night , and it was too early for the hens to have laid this morning . As she pondered ways and means in her little brain , a daring thought struck her . That thought took away her breath . She turned white and cold . Then she turned burning red all over . Her little feet shook under her . But , my ! What riches ! What a supply to go to ! How they would envy her ! " I do n't care -- so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Reub uses so much such things I do n't believe it will ever be noticed in the ' account '  - -  and , any way , it 'll be six months before he settles up . Nobody will know it till then , and maybe -- maybe I shall be dead by that time , or the world will burn up ! " With these comforting reflections , Roxy straightened up her little sun-bonneted head , doubled her little brown fists , and ran as hard as she could -- and Roxy could outrun most of the boys . On she ran , past the school-house -- it was not yet unlocked -- right on down to the village . She slacked up as she struck the sidewalks . She walked slower and slower , to cool her bounding pulses and burning skin . Still her cheeks were like two blood-red roses as she walked into the cool , dark , old stone store ; but for some reason , mental , moral , or physical , while her cheeks remained red , her little legs and arms grew stone cold and stiff , and spots like blood came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , as Mr. Hampshire , the merchant himself , instead of his clerk , came to wait upon her . " And what will you have , Miss Roxy -- some peppermints ? " " No , sir . If you please , Mrs. Reuben Markham wants two pounds of raisins , and five pounds of cinnamon , and you are to charge it to Mr. Markham . " It was strange , but her voice never faltered after she got well begun . However , for all that , Mr. Hampshire stared at her . " Five pounds of cinnamon , did you say , sis ? " " Yes , sir , if you please , " answered Roxy , quietly , " and two pounds of raisins . " So Mr. Hampshire went back , and weighed out the cinnamon and raisins , and gave them to her . She was a little startled at the mighty bundle five pounds of stick cinnamon made ; but she took them and went out , and Mr. Hampshire went back and charged the things to Mr. Reuben Markham . Miss Roxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her face was fairly radiant . She had no idea five pounds of cinnamon were so much . O , such a lot ! She had made up her mind what to do with it . She could n't , of course , carry it home . She had no trunk that would lock , or any place safe from her mother 's eyes . But in the grove , back of the school-house , there was a tree with a hollow in it . By hard running she got there before any of the scholars came . She put her fragrant packages in , first filling her pocket , and then stopped the remaining space with a couple of innocent-looking stones . Such a happy day as it was ! She found herself a perfect princess among her mates . She " treated " them royally , I assure you . Everybody was so obliging to her all day , and it was so nice to be able to make everybody pleased and grateful ! Both the day of judgment and the dying day were put afar off -- at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hampshire kept referring to the idea that any one could want five pounds of cinnamon at one time . Still , little Roxy was Mrs. Reub Markham 's next neighbor , and it was perfectly probable that she should send by her . Some time in the afternoon Mr. Reuben Markham came down to the store . He was a wealthy man , jolly , but quick-tempered . Mr. Hampshire and he were on excellent terms . " How are you , Markham ? and what 's your wife baking to-day ? " " My wife baking ? " " Yes . I concluded you were going to have something extra spicy . Five pounds of cinnamon look rather suspicious . Miss Janet 's not going to step off -- is she . " " I 'm not in that young person 's confidence . I should say not , however . But what do you mean by your five pounds of cinnamon ? " " Why , Mrs. Gildersleeve 's little girl was in here this morning , and said Mrs. Markham sent for five pounds of cinnamon and two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Mrs. Markham never sent for no such things . She knew I was coming down myself this afternoon . " He followed Mr. Hampshire down the store to the desk . There it was in the day-book :  --  " Reub Markham , Dr. , per Roxy Gildersleeve . To 5 pounds cinnamon , 40c. , $2 00 " 2 " raisins ( layer ) , 20c. , 40 That Mr. Reub Markham swore , must also be set down against him . He drove home in a red rage . Through the open school-house door , little Roxy Gildersleeve saw him pass ; but her merry young heart boded no ill . Her mouth was tingling pungently with the fine cinnamon , and in her pocket yet were eight moist , fat , sugary raisins , to be slipped in her mouth one by one , four during the geography lesson , four during the spelling lesson . As it happened , Mr. Gildersleeve was cultivating corn in a field that fronted the highway . He and his wealthier neighbor were not on the best of terms . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gildersleeve had sued Mr. Markham , and beat him ; and Mr. Gildersleeve did n't take any pains now to look up as he saw who was coming . But Mr. Markham drew up his horses . " Hello , Gildersleeve ! " " Hello yourself , Mr. Markham ! " " I say , what you sending your young uns down to the store after things , and charging them to me for ? Mighty creditable that , Tom Gildersleeve ! " " Getting things and charging them to you ! " Gildersleeve stopped his horse . " What do you mean , Markham ? " " You better go down and ask Hampshire . If you do n't , you may get it explained in a way you wo n't fancy ! " He whipped up his horses and drove off , leaving Mr. Gildersleeve standing there , gazing after him as if he had lost his senses . After a moment he unhitched his horse from the cultivator , mounted him , and rode off toward the village . School was out . Roxy had reached home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blackbird . Things had gone so happily at school ! Everything was so neat , and pleasant , and cosy at home ! She saw her father ride into the yard , and go to the barn . She whistled on . She sat in the big rocking-chair , stoning cherries , and smelling the roses by the window , when he came into the kitchen . " Where 's Roxy ? " she heard him ask . " In the other room , I guess , " said mother . He came in where she was . She looked up ; and her little stained hands fell back into the pan . She knew the day of judgment had come . O , she wished it was that other day , the day of death , instead ! Her mouth dropped open , the room turned dark . Mr. Gildersleeve sank down on a chair . His child 's face was too much for him . He groaned aloud . " That one of my children should ever be talked about as a thief ! What possessed you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not at the prospect of punishment . But she saw her father 's eyes filling up with tears . " Do n't , father , " she said , hurriedly , trying not to cry . " I 've only eaten a little , and I will carry it all back . If you will pay for what is gone , I 'll sell berries or something , and pay you back the money . Mr. Hampshire is a good man ; he wo n't tell , father , if you ask him not . " " You poor , ignorant child ! " He got up and went out , shutting the door after him . Not one word of punishment ; but he left Roxy trembling with a strange terror . She shook with a presentiment of some unendurable public disgrace . Setting down the pan of cherries , she crept to the door . She heard her father 's voice , her mother 's sharp exclamations . Then her father said , " To think our girl should sin in such a high-handed way ! Mother , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That hot-headed Markham will not rest until he 's published it from Dan to Beersheba . She 's only a child , but this thing will stick to her as long as she lives . " Her mother sobbed . " Our poor Roxy ! Tom , if the school children get hold of it , she will never go another day . The child is so sensitive ! I do n't know how to punish her as I ought . I can only think how to save her from what is before her . " O , how Roxy , standing at the key-hole , trembled to see her mother lean her head on her father 's shoulder and sob , and to see tears on her father 's cheeks ! O , what a wicked , wicked girl ! It was thieving ; in some way it was even worse than that ; as if she had committed a -- a forgery , maybe , Roxy thought . She was conscious she had done something unusually daring and dreadful . She stole off up stairs , shut herself in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little brain began to busy itself in many directions . She tried to fancy herself shamed and pointed at , afraid to go to school , afraid to go down to the store , ashamed to go to the table , with no right to laugh , and play , and stay around near her mother , never again to dare ask her father to ride when he was going off with the horses . So lonely and gloomy , she tried to think what it was possible to do . At last , as in the morning , a daring thought occurred to her suddenly . She made up her mind in just one minute to do it . When her mother called , she went down to supper at once . The boys were gone . Nobody but she and father and mother ; and the three had very red eyes , and said nothing , but passed things to each other in a kind , quiet way , that seemed to Roxy like folks after a funeral -- perhaps it did to the rest of them . Roxy was fanciful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my funeral . We have just buried my good name . " Silently , one with a white face , the other with a red one , Roxy and her mother did up the work . Then Roxy went up to her room again . She took a sheet of foolscap , and made it into four sheets of note paper . She wrote and printed something on each sheet , and folded all the sheets into letters . Then she went down stairs . Two of the little letters she handed to her mother . Then , bonnet in hand , she stole out the front door . At the gate she looked down the road toward the village , up the road toward Mr. Markham 's . She started toward Mr. Markham 's . She got over the road marvelously ; for the child was wild to get the thing over with . She was going up the path to the house when she saw Mr. Markham hoeing in the garden . She went to him , thrust a note into his hand , and was off like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely run down to the village . How lonely in the grove at the hollow tree ! How like a thief , with the bundles openly on her arm ! No little girl 's pocket would hold them , nothing but a great Judas-bag . She went straight to the stone store . It was just sunset . How thankful she was to find nobody in the store but Mr. Hampshire himself , reading the evening paper . He looked up , and recognized the red little face . He glanced at the bundles as she threw them , with a letter , down on the counter , and whisked out through the door . He called after her , " Here , here , Roxy ; here , my dear ! Come back . I have some figs for you ! " But no Roxy came back . He heard her little heels clattering down the sidewalk fast as they could go . So he got up and read the letter , for it was directed to himself . Here are the four notes Roxy wrote :  --  " Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Live . I shall always be a Good Girl , and never hanker after Only what I have Got . Please forgive Me , and Not Talk It Over with Mother . It will make her Sick . Roxy . " " Dear Mother : Please love me until I am Bad once More . If I ever , Ever , should be Bad again , then you may give me Up . Do n't get Sick . Roxy . " " Mr. MarkHam : I have been Very Wicked . I have made father and Mother wretched . I am sorry . Please do n't be Hard on Me , and Set every body against me , because My Mother would settle right down and be very Sick . I am only a Little girl , and a Big Man might let me go . I have taken the Things back to the Store . Also father has Paid for them . You may Want something some day , and do Wrong to get it , and Then you will know How good it is . R. Gildersleeve . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into the Store what I did . I want a Chance to be good . If you Ever hear of my stealing again , Then you can tell , of course . R. Gildersleeve . " And here is what they said :  --  Mr. Gildersleeve ( crying ) . " Here , mother , put this away . Never speak of it to her . Poor child , I did mean to whip her ! " Mrs. Gildersleeve ( crying ) . " Bless her heart , Tom , this is true repentance ! Our child will not soon forget this lesson . Let us be very good to her . " Mr. Markham ( laughing ) . " Young saucebox ! But there 's true grit for you ! Well , I do n't think I shall stoop to injure a child . Let it go . I 'm quits with Tom now , and we 'll begin again even . " Mr. Hampshire ( laughing ) . " She 's a nice little dot , after all . I do n't see what possessed her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't , though , for it is partly my business to keep the little name white . " And none of them ever told . When Roxy was an old woman , she related to me the story herself . The name was kept white through life . Such a scrupulous , kindly , charitable old lady ! The only strange thing about her was , that she never could eat anything flavored with cinnamon , or which had raisins in it .
