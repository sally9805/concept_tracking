txt A bill entitled an " Act to establish the Central New-York Industrial School " has seen presented . to the Senate by Mr. WoonIN , and though it is prompted by the best intentions , it needs some changes in committee before it becomes a law . If we are not mistaken , this proposed act was caused by a ' necessity felt in Auburn and other interior towns for some place of confinement for truants in the execution of the Compulsory law . The first section of the bill explains the purpose of the school as being for the reformation of boys who may be committed to it between the ages of eight and ' sixteen . By other sections , six Trustees , without salary , are to be appointed by the Governor and Senate , divided into classes , whose terms shall expire on given dates . These Trustees are to fix a site for the school in Central NewYork , and purchase the necessary lands and buildings for the purpose , and are to cause the boys to be instructed in some manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usefulness , " and to hold the general supervision of the school . The lads who are the subjects of this Reformatory , are " truant , idle , and disorderly , " and none are to be committed for any charge greater than petit larceny . No one can be committed for a smaller term than two years , though he may be , discharged after one year for good conduct , and after giving satisfactory evidence of reformation . Boys may , however , be committed to this institution till they are twenty-one . Any that prove incorrigible may be returned to the Sheriff of their county , and there proceeded against as - if they appeared before the court for the first time , but in no case can they be returned to the Industrial School . The counties are to be charged only $50 per annum for the expenses of each of those committed . There is no question that a place of temporary detention for truants is needed in the interior of the State . Each town or village will always contribute a considerable number of Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to execute the Compulsory law . In towns like Auburn or Yonkers the . officials , however desirous of executing this law , have absolutely no ' place in which to confine truants . For each town to open a " Truant Home " would be an intolerable expense . But Mr. WOODIN2S " Industrial School " does not fill this much-needed place . ' It confines its subjects at least one year , and only receives those committed for two years . Now the experience of all the reformatories of the United States shows that the average expense per capita of such a school , taking all expenditures , is $140 per annum . A considerable cost is thus thrown on the State for the detention of truants , when in all probability a short imprisonment would be sufficient . It , on the other hand , Mr. WooDIN merely Intends to found a mew reformatory or House of Refuge for younger and less hard-ened criminals than such as are in the institutions at Rochester and on Randall 's Island , this plan is not framed on the most advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth in one grand asylum , such as is seen in our Roman Catholic Protectory or Protestant House of Refuge , is not the best mode of securing , genuine reformation . The secret of all modern efforts at reform , whether in prisons , reformatories , or missions , is individual influence . By far the most successful reformatory in this co'uutry is the Ohio Farm School , which is founded on the " . family , " as.opposed to the " congregated " system . Mr. WooDix , if he intends to found a successful and permanent reformatory for young criminals , should provide in his act that the youthful subjects should be divided into small companies , and . placed in separate cottages , with not more than twenty-five in a house , each household being under the supervision of one instructor or superintendent . The . great object of this and similar arrangements is to bring the personal influence of the teacher or official to bear on each child 's mind and character , and to prevent that corrupting influence which numbers of criminal children , crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be established in the act of incorporation that the great occupation of the children should he gardening and farming . Experience shows this to be by far the most salutary to the child 's character , and in this country will be the most useful in after life . We do not need in this State any more Houses of Refuge after the model of Rochester and New-York . But we do need a family reformatory for young and criminal children .
