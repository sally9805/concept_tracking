txt The joint discussions of the financial issues of the Ohio canvass between Gen. Stewart L. Woodford and Gen. Tom Ewing deserve more than than the brief mention that has been made of them , and more attention than can be given them in this letter . Fortunately a competent stenographer has taken full notes at the meetings , and a verbatim report of all the speeches of both speakers is to be published . All who take sufficient interest in the subject or the speakers to read the published debates when the book appears , will be able to judge as to ; the truthfulness of the various reports , which have been colored more or less by the political prejudices of both Republican and Democratic papers . It is not strange that the Boston Advertiser was unable to discover from the reports which speaker had gained the advantage , especially if it sought for information in the Ohio papers . The debates have been marked by great courtesy and an observance of the strictest decorum by both speakers . and . each has treated the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Cary had occupied the place of Ewing . The newspaper reports have preserved something of the tone of the debates , and generally , Democratic and Republican , they have , complimented their opponent while extolling their favorite . Here is a specimen of the Enquirer 's way of saying neat things , though it claims in its report that Woodford 's speech was without influence , and that his argument was utterly demolished by Ewing .. It is from an account of the Wilmington meeting : " Woodford followed in a speech of an honr ; and a half , and showed that be had been smoked out by Ewmg in confining himself mare closely to the q -- estion than he has done yet . But hell must be holding a jollification meeting over Woodford 's masterly , cunning , and skillful powers , and the devil himself must tremble at the aptness of such a pupil in seeming to be what he is not . Ho ( - Woodford ! omitted mach of his blue-light business and fire-work display . In closing he took up Ewing 's questions and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Democratic papers have sought to convey the idea to their readers that Gen. Woodford , while undoubtedly a fine speaker  --  indeed , an orator  --  is simply imaginative , rhetorical , and fluent , or " smart , " as they say , and not at . all logical . They talk about his sky-rockets. and fireworks , and colored lights , but represent Ewing as the logical , reasoning , argumentative man . They profess to be entertained by Woodford , but instructed by Ewing . Now nothing could be more absurd than such a pretense , and the publication of the speeches will bear - witness to what I say . Gen. Woodford 's arguments have been logical , clear , and strong . They have been unanswerable , and unanswered . " blue fights " have not been displayed to attract attention to them , but to illustrate and show off his arguments , and statement of facts , and he has impressed many of the great truths that underlie the financial issues of the day , when less brilliant and rhetorical speakers have been hammering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited all the time a notable superiority over Ewing in skill , tact , and readiness , and generally in fullness of information . Each tame the former has opened the debate he has led his opponent upon new ground , which had not been anticipated or prepared for . On the other hand , all Ewing 's published speeches Woodford had studied , and had prepared himself to answer instantly every point in them . Sooner or later Ewing brought them all into the debate , and every time found an ambuscade arranged , which was sprung with sure result . An example is a quotation from Jefferson in 1813 , favoring , it was claimed , the issue of paper money by the Government . Woodford had the same correspondence of Jefferson , known as the John W. Eppes correspondence , and read a strong argument from it against any issue of paper money that could not be kept at par with gold , and also showed that Jefferson 's idea was an issue of money through banks authorized by the General Government instead of the States . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening speech discussed the effects of inflation upon the Government , the second its effects on the business of the country , the third its effects upon the laborer , and the fourth the uses and functions of money . Each time that Ewing had the opening he made nearly the same speech as the one at Lancaster , of which a previous letter gave a brief sketch . He . persisted in discussing the Resumption act , but in its discussion he was driven from point to point , so that a comparison of his fourth speech with the first will show that he was forced to abandon many of the positions which he had first maintained . Some of his positions he refused to leave , even after they were rendered untenable . Woodford 's closing speech was invariably stronger than his opening , upon which Ewing could make no impression . Ewing 's opening a speech was always so fully answered that he did not attempt to strengthen it in closing , and Ins last speech in the last meeting was mostly written and committed beforehand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The absence of any attempt to meet Woodford 's argument was so conspicuous that a gentleman in the audience last night says he heard several Democrats remark , " Why do n't he answer what Woodtord said , " and words of similar import . But still , like loyal party Men as they were , they applauded furiously whenever the signal was given . As tor applause , it was manufactured extensively by both sides , but there could be no mistaking the fact that there was much more heartiness and spontaneity in the cheering of Woodford 's strongest arguments and best sentiments . When Ewing 's speeches come to be coolly read it must be the universal judgment that he made many appeals to the passions of ignorant and vicious men . calculated to provoke class distinctions and hostilities and awaken class prejudices ; to excite ruffianism and disorder ; to kindle sectional prejudice and encourage sectional strife  --  appeals unworthy of his own character and position , and which brought his discussions sometimes down to tile level of Sam Cary 's demagogism . This is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time be ashamed of it . The last meeting of the series was held in this city last night , and the telegraph has given e brief notice of it , to which little can be profitably added , unless a ' verbatim report were printed . Columbus is a Democratic city in a Democratic county . Probably a majority of the audience were Democrats . The interest was so great that some people came forty or fifty miles to hear the debate . The Opera-house was crowded full with an unusually fine audience for a political meeting . The State Committees of both parties were in attendance , and more people who were really anxious about the result of the contest were prSsent than were at any previous meeting . Ewing had . the opening and the closing speeches . He began by stating the issue of the campaign not to be whether the people shall have gold money . It was a fight between the greenback and . the grayback . And then he proceeded to figure out the addition to the interest-bearing debt which the enforcement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which allusion has been made , from the John W. Epps correspondence . He said the money power at that time ( 1S13 ) had both parties in its grasp . just as it now had the Republican party . Then , in the beginning , the necessities of the Government rose above that newer , and the greenbacks , as a national currency , were issued . Next followed a series of insidious steps by the money power to destroy the people 's money . First , the " infamous law " declaring the five-twenty bonds payable in coin . Second , the taking up of the ** interest-bearing Treasury notes . Third , the passage of the Resumption act . And having reached this point , lie went into a long discussion of the Resumption act , not far different from the Lancaster speech reported . His discussion was more general and pointless , and he seemed to avoid . specific statements lest he might by making them fall into a trap . Gen. Woodford began by quoting Jefferson in reply to Ewing's- quotation , showing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had advocated a gradual contraction of paper money , and an issue , of paper through national instead of State banks . Jefferson 's letter was also exceedingly strong in its delineation of the evils of an irredeemable paper curs ency . The rubbish in Ewing 's speech preceding the discussion of the Resumption act having thus been cleared away , Woodford proceeded to discuss that bill , taking up his opponent 's speech point by point , and making answer to each . While speaking he took pains to declare in a very eloquent passage his personal independence of fealty to party , except when party was right , and in another place to resent sharply Ewing 's sectional thrusts at Eastern capitalists and bondholders . His sentiments on both these subjects were greeted with tremendous applause from both parties in the audience . Ewing 's closing speech will hardly be satisfactory to himself when lie comes to see it in print . It partly consisted in an attempt to ridicule Woodford 's style of argument , and Ewing not being a humorous manll this effort was rather painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expectation that Woodford would exhibit a coin of the Dutch Republic , a Confederate note , a Continental note , &e.,; as he had done before . This exhibition having been omitted , Ewing 's speech was ridiculously inappropriate . Then he spent about ten minutes in hastily commenting on  --  not answering  --  Woodford 's speech , and closed with an appeal to the prejudices of the laboring men against capital and the money power . It was a speech which its author will some time wish were blotted out , but it is more indelibly recorded than Uncle Toby 's kindly oath that poor Le Fevre should not die , and in politics there are no pitying tears of angels nor of men . The discussion has been of the greatest service to the Republicans . In the first place it has aroused attention and increased the interest in the canvass , and will help to bring out the vote . It has given great prominence to the financial issues , and more than anything else has forced those issues to the front as the most important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Carl Schurz , is due the credit of driving the Democrats from the aggressive advocacy of inflation to an attack on the Resumption law and an outcry against contraction . It is a discussion that will deservedly add to the reputation of Gen. Woodford as a logical speaker and a strong debater.
