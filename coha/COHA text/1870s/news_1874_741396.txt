txt The office of Coroner in Hudson County , N. J. , was once so profitable that the candidates for it - were said to be almost as numerous as flies at harvest-time . The fees were rim up to such a good round sum , year after year , that the tax-payers at length grew restive , and appealed to the Legislature for relief . In 1871 , a law was passed . which removed jurisdiction , in cases of sudden and violent deaths , from the hands of the Coroners , and gave it to the County Physician . Among the charges against the Coroners was one to the effect that they had caused post-mortem examinations to be made , and had held inquests , in hundreds of instances in which the ends of justice - would have been served fully as well by simply granting permits for burial . The new law on the subject empowered the County Physician to investigate all cases of the nature referred to , to give permits for burial , to consult with other physicians whenever the circumstances seemed to warrant it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under like contingencies . For this increase of labor , the County Physician had his salary increased from $1,200 to $4,000 . As a consequence , the Coroner 's office immediately became so insignificant that , save for the nominal honor of the position , it was not worth the trouble of an election . The new system worked in a most satisfactory manner , until the election of Mr. JACOB REINHARDT . Whether he had . been misled . by the politicians as to the emoluments , or had . an opinion of his own on the matter , we can not tell . But , however that may be , lie had no sooner mastered the duties , than he set about the task of mastering the difficulties of the situation likewise . The County Physician , Dr. BECK , - was his special aversion from the start . To the machinations of that innocent functionary , he attributed the baldness of his office , so that when an opportunity seemed to offer for " getting even " - with him he eagerly embraced it . The first " battle " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident which caused the death of a man . The Coroner got wind of it before the County Physician , held an inquest , and disposed of the body without notifying the former . He then carried the " war " into the Legislature , and . endeavored to have a bill passed abolishing the office of County Physician . The effort did not succeed . Indeed , it met with such little favor that the Coroner must have seen at once that in that direction he had nothing to hope for . Henceforth , it was evident he would have to rely on himself to effect the reform ho desired . On Saturday last there arose another opportunity to strike a blow for freedom . Through an accident on the railroad , in Jersey City , two men were killed . County Physician BUCK promptly took charge of the case , and , for reasons which are obvious , instead of inviting Mr. REINHARDT , the Coroner of the district , to hold an inquest , sent over to Hoboken for a Coroner . This evidence of resentment roused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge . He went to the Morgue , and demanded the custody of the bodies . The keeper refused to comply . This opposition did not deter him from his purpose . He summoned a jury . Presently he was reinforced by an undertaker 's wagon and a constable . Meanwhile , the County Physician arrived , and exerted his influence - to put a stop to further proceedings . REINHARDT 'S blood was at boiling heat . He dared his antagonist to do his utmost . By his direction the constable , aided by the undertaker 's clerk , seized one of the bodies , placed it in the wagon , and with the Coroner rode proudly away . It was now the County Physician 's hum to be indignant . He secured . the services of a policeman , jumped into his carriage , and gave chase . The Coroner was finally overhauled and compelled to surrender his prize . There Were of course a good many threats used on both sides before the surrender . The Covner , apparently , did not suspect that his acts made him amenable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished officer . The County Physician , on the other hand , knowing that he had right on his side , was not willing to let slip so good a chance for punishing the Coroner . After having returned the body to the Morgue , he went to the Police station and secured a squad of men to mount guard . over it . His next step was to go to a Justice of the Peace , from whom he obtained a warrant for the arrest of Mr. REINHARDT . On Tuesday the latter was taken into custody , and had to give bail to appear before the Grand Jury . Naturally expectation is on tip-toe to know , not the result of the criminal proceedings , but what device the Coroner will next try to evade the law , and " get square " with the County Physician . Carrying off corpses in daylight will not do as things stand . at present , but as Mr. REINHARDT is a person who has considerable pluck , and not a small share of ingenuity , it is probable that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
