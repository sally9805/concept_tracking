txt There is nothing that an Army officer dislikes more than he dislikes to be cashiered . Whether he is guilty or innocent makes no difference . In either case he loses his commission , and is disgraced in the eyes of the public . Naturally , the cashiered officer is indignant , and cherishes a bitter hostility to the courtmartial which convicted him and the commander who approved his sentence . He is thus an admirable subject for conciliation . The President who overrules the finding of the court-martial , and reinstates him with back pay , rarely fails to thoroughly conciliate him , and in case his sentence was approv'edby a former President , it is still always possible to conciliate him by ordering his case to be reopened and reviewed . As to the propriety of thus conciliating cashiered officers there can be , at the present time , no difference of opinion . If it is a wise and Christian act to conciliate ex-rebel soldiers , it is equally wise awl Christian to conciliate ex-Federal officers who have been guilty of nothing worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This principle is fully recognized by our conciliatory President . It is only a little while ago that he commuted the sentence of dismissal from the service which was imposed upon Lieut . WETHERILL , for various acts of dishonesty , to a brief suspension from command ; and at nearly the same time he entirely set aside the sentence of Capt . CAMPBELL , arid rein . stated that larcenous officer without even a reprimand . Thus , two officers who were undoubtedly cherishing un-Christian feelings toward those who had found them guilty , were conciliated to such an extent that they would probably have joined in singing hymns at the White House every Sunday night had Mr. HAY ES invited them to do s o . Mr. FITZ JOHN PORTER , who was cashiered many years ago after having been found guilty of disobedience of orders on the battle-field , and of refusal to march his corps to the support of his commanding officer and the rest of the Army of the Potomac , would not be the intelligent man that he unquestionably h ; if he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President to procure a reversal of his sentence and his restoration to his former rank . Mr. HAYES having clearly shown that the restoration of cashiered officers is an important part of his policy , Mr. PORTER hastens to give him a new opportunity tor carrying this beneficent policy into effect , and the President has already issued an order directing a board to examine the new evidence which Mr. PORTER asserts that he is ready to offer in his defense . It is difficult to imagine how any new evidence is to affect the justice of Mr. PORTER 'S sentence . That he disobeyed his commanding officer 's orders has been thoroughly established , and even if he is able to show that a larger force of the enemy vas. in his front than Gen. POPE imagined , he can not thereby alter the fact that he disobeyed POPE 'S orders to go into action . It is the first duty of a soldier to obey orders . Mr. PORTER was ordered , to engage the enemy . - He claims that had he obeyed the order his corps would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobeyed . Gen. POPE 'S order because he thought that it was an unwise one . It is understood that his " new evidence " is introduced to prove that the order wee unwise , but if he is successful in so proving he will not justify his disobedience ot : his superior officer 's orders . Very possibly he believes thatGen . POPE , Secretary STANTON , President LINCOLN , and all the members of the court-martial which convicted him , were actuated by personal hostility to him . Nevertheless , the . fact of his disobedience of orders on the battle-field remains , and he is ? well aware that in any European Army in officer found guilty of the offense with which he was charged . would have been shot . All this , however , will not injure Mr. PORTER 'S case , now that lie has succeeded . in having it reopened . Mr. HAVES ' policy of conciliation is intended not for the innocent but for the guilty : He did not commute the sentence of Lieut . IVETHERILL , nor set aside the findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because these officers- were innocent . The kind , good President doubtless said to himself that the very fact that these men were guilty must increase their mental suffering and their need of conciliation . What Mr. PORTER should do in order to prove how much he needs the soothing effects of Conciliation , , arid to awaken the Presidential sympathies in his behalf , is to admit that he was guilty of all the charges that were made against him and to make his guilt appear in the most glaring light . His object is to be reinstated , with or without back pay . The simplest and surest way to gain this end . is to convince the President that he was justly cashiered and that he can not feel kindly toward all men unless the findings of the original court-martial are set aside . If Congress was really anxious to give a hearty support to the Presidential policy , it would promptly pass a law reinstating all cashiered officers .
