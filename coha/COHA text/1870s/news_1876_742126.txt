txt In completing a tour of the State of Newfork , made during the last six weeks , and comprising iu its scope all but four of its sixty counties , it may , perhaps , be of interest to the readers a THE TIMES to have a general summary of the situation and prospects as viewed by its correspondent . And yet so great a change has taken place in the aspects of the canvass during the last ten days , as well as in the comparative importance attached to the issues discussed , that observations made four weeks ago , or even two weeks ago , may now be regarded as comparatively worthless . It has several times been stated in this correspondence that , in computing the Republican majorities of the various counties in the interior , the lowest estimates of the least sanguine Reppbhenna have generally been given . It is also to be remarked that these estimates , for the most part , were made at a time when the Republican outlook in the State appeared less hopeful than at any period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small success in Indiana as though it were a tremendous and unexpected victory , instead of being an actual defeat on all the issues involved in the national contest . The largely increased registry of voters in New-York City , indicating as it did then that the total would reach 200,000 and over ; a similar increase in Brooklyn with the evidences of a deep-laid scheme to swell the Democratic majorities by fraud  --  all these things were calculated . to dishearten the Republicans of the interior , and to revive in a corresponding ratio the hopes of the Demo-. crats . As a part of the system the game of brag which the Democrats were then playing , and with a view to aid them in their bar-room bluster , bogus reports of pool betting on the result were daily issued from New-York , and telegraphed to all the Democratic papers and placarded on all the bulletins in the interior of the State . Rural Democrats , who never owned $25 in their lives , and Democratic bummers , who could not command the price of a drink , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500 that ? Tilden would Carry the State of New-York . All this has now ceased . The registry in New-York and Brooklyn , though large and fraudulent , is not so formidable as was at first anticipated , and has lost its terrors for the Republicans of the rural districts . The pools have ceased to frighten ens-body. for when they are put to the test in the country districts they are found to have no money to back them . A thousand dollars , even bet , on Hayes and Wheeler carrying this State , has been lying at a , pool-room in this City of Albany for the last five days waiting in vain to be covered by Democratic money . Republicans are no longer despondent but jubilant . Since the Tilden letter on the rebel war claims , Democrats of the latter class are abandoning the ticket by hundreds . They never had any confidence in their candidate as a man , and now they have none in him as a politician . They always called him an " old fraud , " and now they.eall him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are running for local offices in Republican counties are ready to sell him out if they can make votes for themselves , and their followers are willing to ratify the bargain . By , conceding the Assemblymen , and County Clerks , and Sheriffs , the Republicans , if they chose , could scoop in half of the Democratic vote for their Electoral ticket in most of the Republican counties of the ' trite . Such is the situation now , compared with what it was two weeks ago . And yet , even then , the estimated majorities , low as they were , that were given to TEE Tints ' correspondent , were sufficient to carry the State for Hayes and Wheeler against 50,000 opposing majority in New-York and Brooklyn . It would be a safe calculation to add twenty-five Per cent . to those majorities in most of the Republican counties embraced in the estimates as published . It is not necessary to recapitulate these majorities , corrected in the ? light of recent events , or to give a table of estimated majorities by counties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as certain , in the opinion of your correspondent , to give a majority for Hayes and Wheeler on Tuesday Pest , as any future event which can be made the subject of human foresight and calculation . This prediction is based mainly on four propositions , thef accuracy of which has been verified by personal observation and diligent inquiry : First  --  The Republicans are going to . poll their full vote at this election , which they have not done in four years . If the weather is passable , it will be the largest vote ever polled in the State . Second  --  There are no changes , or next to none , from the Republican to the Democratic Party . Third  --  The Liberals are almost all  --  certain ly nineteen-twentieths of them  --  back in the Republican ranks , and are among . she most zealous workers for Hayes and Wheeler . . Fourth  --  There are hundreds of disaffected Democrats who from the first have refused to acquiesce in the nomination of Tilden for President , and they are now being joined by thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who have become alarmed at the tendencies of the party as developed during the canvass , and at the inevitable results that mould follow its success . ? Now , if there is anything , beyond mere assertions and vague speculations , unsupported by facts , to offset these propositions and inditate a Democratic victory in this State , they have entirely escaped observation . In looking back ! leeu the way this campaign has been conducted on the Democratic side , or rather on the side of Tilden  --  for it has been Tilden 's campaign all through in this State , his organs and his orators having done nothing but ' echo him and his " literary bureau " ? abundant material can be found for comment , and not a little tor amusement , mingled with disgust . In the fiat public utterance of Tilden , after his nomination at St. Louis , he startled the public and delighted the Democracy with the announcement that he was give them an " aggressive campaign . " Now , an open and aggressive campaign by Samuel J. Tilden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most trivial information to any one , without first seizing . his listener by the lapel of his coat , leading him into a Corner , and whispering in his ear , , was certain to be a novelty , and these who know the luau wore curious to see how he would go about it . But they never had an opportunity . The " aggressive campaign " immediately relapsed into the " still hunt . " If he ever intended such a thing , he coon discovered that he would have all be could do . and all his clerks could do , to defend himself and , straighten out the crooked paths in his personal and professional career , without assuming the aggressive . But he never did intend it . It was entirely foreign to his nature . What he did do was to immediately set about inaugurating a campaign of fraud , falsehood and cant . His first move was to plaster the State all over with handbills , claiming credit , for himself that he knew belonged to the Republicans . This combination of fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people in the matter ot taxation . It took six weeks of the campaign on the part of Republican speakers and newspapers to expose this lie , which had been sneakingly circulated in every variety of form among the people in the remotest hamlets of the State . The other great card of the Tilden campaign was the cant phrase " Reform . " With this catchword ho expected to captivate every unsophisticated farmer in the State and nation . He put it at the beginning and end of every plank in the St. Louis platform , which was the joint product of Dorsheimer and Tilden here in Albany . Tilden is said to be , even yet , laboring under the delusion that this " reform " dodge is. the great issue of the campaign among the farmers . But they long since saw through that hypocritical cant , and , on examining Tilden 's record , they have learned that the reform that is really " needed " is in the Democratic candidate for the Presidency . The farmers are not so easily deluded as Tilden imagines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a boy and used to dispense spuermint and paregoric on the hills of Columbia County . And , while he imagines they are diligently poring over his " reform " tracts and lying handbills , the truth is they have cast them into the fire long ago , and are now giving their attention to the live issues of the campaign . The clap-trap issues on which Tilden tried to run the canvass. and did run it for the first two months , are now regarded as the merest rubbish . The real issues , and the only issues , on which the minds of the Northern people are fixed to-day are the rebel war claims and the expediency of turning over the Federal Government to the hands of the people who but yesterday were trying to destroy it . On thee() issues Mr. Tilden is en ? tirely unprepared , either with the doeumenta or the personal record . His tracts and handbills are worthless and of no more account now than the fallen leaves , hardly more numerous , that are strewn over the fields in the rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing a letter on the eve of election promising , in advance , to veto the claims of the men from whom he expects three-fourths of his votes , was a desperate attempt to recover the ground that was fast slitting from under him , but it has proved utterly futile , The people see that , if he keeps his promise , he must cheat the " solid South " as he has attempted to hoodwink the solid North . In either case he is a cheat . On the ouesdon of surrendering the control of the Government to the South , the people have found , on examining Tilden 's record , that he sympathized with them when they were rebels , justified their secession on . constitutional grounds , and refused to pay his legitimate taxes to help conquer them and preserve the Union . In fact he is found wanting in every line of his past record that has any connection with the issues to be , decided next Tuesday . And these are the reasons why he will not be permitted to receive the electoral vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelf , , as he will be next Tuesday , the hunsiliat -- ing and disgusting features of the campaign may be left for the contemplation of those Democratic editors and orators throughout the State who have seen themselves ignored , and their legitimate work usurped during the canvass by a " literary bureau " and printing-shop conducted by " nincompoops , " who have run a candidate for President of the United States after the manner that quack nostrums , patent trusses , and itch ointment are pushed before the people .
