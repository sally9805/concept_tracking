txt We drew attention some weeks ago to the decline of the class of country gentlemen , and the remarkable tendency , on the part of all who could , to gravitate toward towns . A few days later we happened upon the returns issued by a London newspaper , the organ of the real estate auctioneers , giving details of the sales made in England during the past year . From this it seems that a condition precisely the reverse of that existing hero prevails in that country . Never was rural property more in demand . Taken as a whole , the last sixty years have been the most prosperous that England has ever known , and a natural sequence has been the rise of real estate . In this country the result of similar prosperity has been the increased value of urban and . suburban property , but in . England the ' number of railroads , and the peculiar characteristics of Englishmen , have spread the rise more or less over the whole island . The rents of London , Brighton , Torquay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns of residence , although greatly increased , have not risen in anything like the proportion of rents in the principal towns hero , while the general rise in value within a hundred miles of London , of two or three of the fashionable watering-places , and where there are first-rate hunting and shooting , has been very considerable . There can bo no doubt that the custom of primogeniture , combined with the love of sports , has been the means of preserving a remarkable evenness in values and in civilization as well throughout the country . It may safely be asserted that it is owing to these that there are probably not twenty places in the whole of England where a man could . not procure within five miles a good bed and a comfortable meal . This equality of civilization is not found in France , where life iu the remote districts is a widely different affair to what it is within twenty miles of a few of the greatest cities . Still less is it the case in even the old settled parts of this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there were persons living in the secluded mountainous parts of Virginia who had not become aware that the civil war had broken out more than twelve Mouths after the first battle . What reconciles persons of moderate means to live in the country iu England is the circumstance that , while it is decidedly cheaper than life in London , it does not entail a sacrifice of town comforts . This , again , is in agricultural districts at least , and a very large part of England is agricultural , indirectly the effect ofthe custom of primogeniture . Although many of the very large proprietors may not spend more than four months of the year at their country seats , more or less of an establishment is always maintained . The agent , the land steward , the head gardener , all must have their wants supplied from the town eight miles away , and so must half a dozen Squires , men with from ? 2,000 to ? 6,000 a year , who live within a radius of five miles . It becomes , therefore , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , to keep a cart and horse to send his fish round to these houses , and thus it comes about that the Rector , the old maid sisters of the former clergyman , and the half-pay officer , are able to get their " bit o ' fish " for dinner . Perhaps the fishmonger would demur about sending over his cart so often , if the road was bad between Broaddale and Barchester ; but the Squire would make it a deal too hot for the Waywarden , if that functionary did n't keep the parish lanes in first-rate order . Ali this makes the country side comfortable to live in , which the country here is not . Hence people like to live in it there , and do n't like to live in it here ; even though the saving of rent may in most oases be a desideratum . The overwhelming tendency to gravitate to great cities has a bad side to it , which we shall more and more feel . It makes the chances of comfortable success in life fewer for men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as regards a different class , those who in the country would he principals are here servants ; for in great cities trade becomes more and more of a monopoly . Those who in the country might be doctors , lawyers , shop-keepers , dwelling in snug , roomy houses , with gardens , and breeding a healthy , happy race of children , must here be content to remain assistants , cooped in narrow apartments , where children rarely get tastes of country air , and with , generally , no future for their sons . The ever-recurring ' body of impecunious clerks , living up to or beyond their means . is thus constantly increased by the decline of country life . Very good roads to and from railroad stations might do something  --  more , perhaps , than anything else  --  to reconcile many to living in the country ; but we do not expeat that rural life will ever find favor here , or that the population will cease to gravitate to great cities , unless , as time goes on , that fancy should seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and .

One of these may be seen in a delicious , rolling , park-like country some sixteen miles from Baltimore . The handsome entrance and lodge , the approach through beautiful woods , over the smoothest road , to the mansion , the glorious old timber , the exquisitely-kept gardens , the historic associations , and , lastly , the refined though profuse hospitality , recall to the visitor at Doboreagar Manor the deseriptiong by IRVING of Bracebridge Hall ; while , if he goes out of Baltimore in another direction toward Towsontown , he will find himself well repaid , by the permission , always courteously accorded . to any decent visitor , to survey the exquisitelykept , old-fashioned terrace-garden , with its beautiful grassy slopes , of Hampton , the last entailed property in the State .
