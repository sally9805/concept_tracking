BEDS AND TABLES , STOOLS AND CANDLESTICKS . IV . MANTEL-PIECES , CORNER CUPBOARDS , HANGING SHELVES , ETC. qwq people with short purses by showing them Mr. Lathrop 's charming drawings of the prettiest and costliest furniture to be found . Now , while admitting that his critics have a show of reason in their charges , the writer pleads in extenuation that he is really misunderstood , and that he does not mean any harm ! He stands by all he has said about economy and simplicity , and the possibility of making our houses attractive without , at the same time , making ourselves uncomfortable by spending more money than we can afford in furnishing and decorating . But when it comes to giving illustrations that will support his propositions , he is met by a difficulty . Many of the pieces of furniture that in design and purpose answer to his notions are , in fact , expensive pieces . He takes them where he finds them , and has them copied as faithfully as he can , and without any attempt to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANTEL-PIECE , SIMPLY TREATED . than they really are . But whoever will Shakers , or the Vienna bent-wood chairs , be at the pains to look over the pictures I cost as much as some to be found in the in the articles thus far published will j fashionable shops that make a good deal of admit that , wherever the money goes to , j show . People are slow to learn , it would it does not go to carving , and flourish , seem , especially women , that the reverse of VOL . XI. - 52. // the rule which holds true of their dresses is true of most of the furniture called fashionable nowadays . In the case of their dresses , women know that the " trimming , " the ornament , often costs more than the body of the dress , and the more elaborate the dress , the truer this proposition . But in our fashionable furniture the reverse is true . The main cost is in the wood and the labor ; the ornament is almost always cheap . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of furniture that made a great display of seeming steel hinges , key-plates , and handles , with inlaid tiles , carving of an ultraGothic type , and an appearance of the most ingenuous truth-telling in the construction . The chairs , tables , and bedsteads looked as if they had been on the dissecting table and flayed alive , their joints and tendons displayed to an arch*eologic and unfeeling world . One particular firm introduced this style of furniture , and , for a time , had almost the monopoly of it . It had a great run , for the purchaser'was made to feel that in buying it he got an immense deal more for his money than he could get in any other style of furniture . Perhaps in another shop he would have to pay as much for the same piece of furniture without the so-called ornament-as much , or more than he was asked to pay for the showy piece . And in nine cases out of ten the showy piece carried the day . The reason of the difference in cost would be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place by an educated architect ,  --  a man with notions of utility and with good taste ,  --  and then was well made out of good material by a trained workman . The cost of the piece represented good stuff and skill in designer and in maker , but it did not represent sham of any kind . The piece would last a life-time , would always be a good servant or friend , and would improve in looks with time and use . The showy piece would be designed , not for use , but to make a display , and all the ornament was contrived , like a player-queen 's regalia , to get as much glitter and look of cost as tinsel and frippery can give . Now , in the writer 's experience , it is the people who are taken in by this sort of thing , and who , to tell truth , like to be taken in by it , who complain of the cost of many of the things shown in the illustrations to these articles . They will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if they can not have real elegance , they will take sham elegance , and thank the gods there are places where people are not too nice to give it to them . But , granted that many of the things pictured in these articles are costly , the reader is begged to notice that it is not their costliness that is brought to the fore by the writer , . but the beauty of the design , or the utility of the things themselves . Their costliness is always kept out of sight , not " tortuously , " as . has been politely said , but really because the cost of these particular pieces was not our concern . The design is our concern , the usefulness of the object portrayed , its suitability to our needs . Take the table and chair figured in the article for January ( No. 5 ) , which one person singles out as being doubtless more expensive than they look . Why were these objects chosen as illustrations ? Was it because they were costly ? ' Most certainly not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know . But he does think them both extremely pretty , and he chose them to show his readers because he thought them so , and for no other reason . The chair can not be more expensive than others of its now common family , and the table no more expensive than tables usually found in drawing-rooms . But , supposing them both to be as costly as the critic suggests , this consideration does not affect us , because their costliness is in their material ,  --  in the wood the table is made of , in the stuff the chair is covered with . And it was not their material , but their forms , that was the subject of praise . If a person should take a fancy to either chair or table , and if he should find on inquiry that the cost , as the piece stands in the shop , was beyond his means , let him have the table made out of pine , and the chair covered with chintz ; they will give a different pleasure from that they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neW pleasure as good as the old . The book-case which led off the illustration in the February ScRIBNER ( No. r ) would be very little handsomer than it is if , instead of being made of plain pine , it were made of black walnut , or mahogany , or ebony . Its owner think* it a very agreeable piece of furniture to look at , and finds it very convenient , both as a case for books and as a shelf . But he could only afford to have it made of pine , and he gets as much pleasure out of it , he thinks , as if , instead of costing fifty dollars , it had cost five hundred dollars , as it might easily have been made to . So , if he were bent on having the chair and table ( No. * January ScRIBNER ) , and could not afford ebonized walnut , with mahogany top and sides , for the table , he would have it // made of pine , and have the chair covered with some one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stamped velvets and gilt leather . It seems to me that by showing many handsome things more may be done to educate people 's taste than by deforming our page with ugly things . People are taught very little by warnings , either in morals or in art . Good example goes farther , and Mr. Ruskin has so much show of reason when he refuses to let his pupil see ugly things or read ugly books . It is wasted time , and only negative results can come from the contemplation of negation . The objects figured in these articles are , in the writer 's esteem , beautiful , or handsome , or useful , and as such he shows them . The reader is asked to accept them as standards , and to use them as such in fitting up his own house , or in judging the way in which other people have fitted up theirs . A suggestion may be offered to young married people who find themselves in " a whole house , " as the saying is , that they should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that they should take the matter easily , furnishing only the rooms they actually need . I can not in conscience recommend the example of a couple I once heard of who found themselves in Paris in possession of a pretty but unfurnished flat . Intending to remain in the city several years , they concluded to get only things that pleased them ; and as there was not money enough to do this all at once , they secured the few absolutely essential pieces , and then looked for the rest . But the wife , who lived to laugh at this afterward , always declared that for six months they sat on their two trunks , because her fastidious better-half could n't find chairs he thought " the thing , " while , as they had only a cup and saucer apiece , waiting till the right thing in ceramics turned up , they were obliged , having in an impulsive moment asked friends to tea , to go out and ransack the bric-It-brac shop for the old blue for that particular evening . I believe they enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been what is called " better ofI7 ' and could have No. 2 . ANOTHER WAY OF DEALING WITH COMMONPLACE . // gone to a fashionable shop , and ordered was taken by his wife into the parlor to see their whole flat furnished at once . her new chairs and . sofas that had been A young couple may get a great deal of brought in only that afternoon , delighted as innocent recreation by keeping one of the she was with her achievement , she did not parlors of an ordinary New York house , and relish seeing the weary man good-naturedly one or two of the bedrooms , empty for a year sit down on the floor , saying that white or so , and visiting them often in company to discuss how they shall be fitted up when times are a little easier . Besides the pleasure of anticipation , there 's the consideration that , with experience , our tastes change , and probably improve ; and we may reflect that it is much easier to change pieces of furniniture that we never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , and mean to have some day , than it is to change or modify the real things that have been bought and paid for and brought home . When Udoipho came home tired one night , and satin embroidered with gold butterflies was too fine for him to sit on . Adelaide wished at that moment that she had not believed everything the upholsterer told her , but had used her own sense and judgment . And if ever she should read this , which is n't likely , she will perhaps agree that it would have been as well to let her ideas of what is suitable to a parlor ripen a year or so before giving them shape . Then there 's the pleasure of " picking up " things . In my humble opinion , this is the only way to furnish a house ; produces the No. 3 . MUCH IN LITTLE SPACE . // prettiest result and is cheapest in the end . I should n't like , for my own part , to be able to go into Maherter 's or Hercott 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad /zbiturn . That might do for some people , and , I dare say , when one considers the awful waste of precious time implied in the way I am recommending , it is much to be preferred by serious persons who do n't like that particular way of wasting time . But it has its disadvantages , nevertheless . The main things must be searched for first , and it would n't be a bad notion to try the Paris plan of hiring furnitur* ( you can hire it there of any quality for a month , or a year , or a life-time ) , and clear it out by degrees . But , in default of such a provision so suited to our human needs , let the young folks try getting the cheapest things that will hold , and using them till they can be one by one replaced , the new installed for a long voyage and the old ones going to some poor neighbor . This suggestion is not whimsical : it has been tried and found very satisfactory . " Picking up " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that has been carried off as spoils , there is still an immense deal of old furniture to be bought : some of it splendid , some handsome , and some only curious , but all of it useful . The getting it home is the difficulty , and unless one is well prepared to submit to all the petty vexations and small swindles of our Custom-House , and to bear the expense cheerfully , it is seldom worth while-never , perhaps , except in the case of some very lucky find . " Picking up* ' at home is a much pleasanter , if it be a more difficult task , and a lady the other 4ay hit , with a woman 's tact , upon the reason . She was talking , to be sure , of china , and not of furniture ; but the argument applies as well to one as the other . She said the things we come upon in our own country are soon at home in our houses , because they were used by our own ancestors or our own people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected , nor strange , nor pretentious , but native and natural . And one reason why it is not so easy to pick up the furniture of by-gone times in America is , that those who have inherited it are learning to value it , and are less and less willing to part with it . As our readers know , old furniture is " the fashion " in some parts of our country . In Boston a polite internecine warfare has for some time raged between rival searchers after " old pieces , " and the back country is scoured by young couples in chaises on the trail of old sideboards and brass andirons . It is a pursuit highly to be commended , but it is apt to become fanatically fascinating , and in their blind admiration the young things buy many articles that even Mr. Toodles would have had the judgment to resist . It is surprising to learn to what strange uses things may come at last ! In the suburbs of Boston , the best places in which to look for Jacobean sideboards and cupboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the hen-yard , the closets and drawers having been for years given over in fee-simple to the fowt . Several handsome oak cupboards that now adorn pretty Boston dining-rooms had to be feathered and singed before they could be made presentable . The way in which they haVe stood this usage is creditable to their makers ; so far from being hurt by it , they are really improved by their adventures . Experience of the mutabilities of fortune has been good for them , as it is good for everybody . They are well seasoned ; they have a good healthy color , and their angles are enough rubbed down to take away the disagreeable look of newness which troul ) les us in things just out of the shop . Besides , in most cases this newness has to be . rubbed off by human beings , and its loss represents just so much wear and tear of our muscle and heart-strings ; but with these latest treasure-troves of Boston , all this has been done for them by proxyby the hens . Jn the new rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " grandmothers , "  --  a kind of thing till very lately ignored , if not despised , in the bumptious arrogance of our social youthfulness ,  --  it adds inestimably to the value of sideboards , andirons , and old china , if they have come to us by descent and have n't had to be hunted up in a chaise . But everybody ca n't have a grandfather , nor things that came over in the " Mayflower , " and those of us who have not drawn these prizes in life 's lottery must do the best we can under the circumstances . We must go to Hawkins 's , or Sypher 's , or Drake 's , or scour our own back country , where , perhaps , we may light upon a mine of unexpected richness , with owners who can not conceal their wonder at people who are willing to pay hard cash for chairs , and tables , and sideboards , and china , that seem to them not worth taking as a gift . I have lately known of some very handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to make in these days , which were found in a house lived in by people who // were in squalid poverty , but who had seen better days , and were glad to sell their birthright for a little more than a mess of pottage . This mania , as it is called by the scoffers , for old furniture , is one of the best signs of returning good taste in a community that has long been the victim to the whims and impositions of foreign fashions . The furniture which was in use in this country in the time of our grandfathers ( of the great-grandfathers of the girls who , I please myself with thinking , sometimes look over these papers for the sake of the pictures ) , was almost always well designed and perfectly fitted for the uses it was to be put to . The wardrobes , or clothes-presses , as they were called , the dressing-tables , the tea-tables , and the chairs were often extremely handsomethe hard wood-on which labor had not been spared to work moldings on the solid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with brass handles and keyplates serviceably designed . I have before me now , as I write , two chairs , both belonging to the time of our Revolution . They are both hinted at in cut No. 8 , but the detail is not dwelt upon , as Mr. Lathrop wanted us to look rather at the shelves on the table between the chairs . The one at the right is backed and seated with cane ; the other has the back and seat stuff*1 . The cane-seated chair is more delicately made and designed than the stuffed one ; the carving upon it is as well done as need be , and the proportions are so good , it takes the eye of almost everybody . This was no doubt a city-made chair , and out of some stylish shop . The other chair came with three others from up country somewhere ; when they were bought it was said they had been given by the Indians to a certain famous New Yorker who made his millions in trading in many things ,  --  among others , in furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , manufacturers nor designers of furniture , this story of their origin has always thrown about these chairs a little flavor of massacre and scalp . They are every bit as well designed as the finer chairs , but they have been made with the rudest tools , and all the apparent turned-work upon them has been done with the knife . Yet , notwithstanding all their rudeness , they are much more artistic and effective than the chairs covered with carving which we were all admiring as antique a few years ago . It is to be hoped that no one will let himself be laughed out of his fancy for a good piece of " old furniture , " to the extent of letting it slip out of his hands when once he has the opportunity of buying it . If it be even an ordinarily good piece , it will be money well invested to buy it ; for , besides its usefulness and the pleasure of looking at it ,  --  elements of " interest " not often enough computed ,  --  it will any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " picked up , " but not , perhaps , if it were bought from a dealer . To the eye of one whose liking for our Revolutionary furniture is not a new thing , the charm of it consists , apart from its usefulness , which is evident to everybody , in the color given to it by age , and in the simplicity with whic* alr its ornament is obtained . Jts moldings are always good and quiet ; just what is needed , and no more , to round an angle with elegance , and to catch the light agreeably , and whenever any carving is attempted , or paneling , there is a certain moderation in it that is very refreshing in these loud times . Yet they are not too tame either , but their spirit is the spirit of high-bred people , and not of folks who like to be conspicuous . Even the architectural details in bureaus and clothespresses that these old people were so fond of , a little too fond , perhaps ,  --  were often very delicately and adroitly managed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in keeping they are with the effect of any piece as a whole . Yet , much as these articles of furniture deserve to be praised , I would not counsel that they should be copied . In fact , I do not believe in copies , whether of furniture , of pictures , or of men and women . Nothing ever can be copied exactly , and we ought never to try to do it , unless it be for purposes of instruction , and even then its desitableness may be disputed . The least thing from a master 's hand is pretty sure to be better worth studying , if we would know something about the master 's method of working , or his way of thinking , than the best copy . And it may be said that the better artist the copyist is , the less his copy is apt to resemble his original . The French have carried the copying of old work-in furnture , in jewelry , in pottery , to great perfection ; but an artist would rather have a square foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole l ) iece that even the skill of R6capp% produced . So with old American or English furniture ( for how much was made here , or how much imported , we do not know ) ; no matter how superficially resembling the copies may be , they will always be wanting in something ; in proportion , in delicacy , or // in spirit . And even if copies could be cast in a mold , it is not good to wish for them , for we can put all their merits into original pieces made for ourselves to-day , that may not only give us pleasure , but may show our children that we know how to profit by what our fathers taught us . In the January number of ScRIBNER some designs for mantel-pieces were given which were intended as hints for people who might be fitting up new houses of their own , or who might wish to get something better in the place of the mantel-pieces imposed upon them in houses taken on a comfortably long lease . The writer knows of one case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel-piece that was in the principal room to the cellar and put up in its place a welldesigned wooden one . This would certainly be worth doing under some circumstances ; but , as a rule , we , New Yorkers , live in any one house too short a time to make any considerable improvement , the cost of which comes out of our own pockets , seem worth while . The best is to try what can be done with the mantel-pieces we have , and the two designs ( Nos. i and 2 ) that lead off as illustrations of our present article are intended to give some help in this direction . No. x is much the simpler of the two , and , in spite of doubting Thomases , shows an inexpensive way of treating an ordinary fire-place , one no uglier than is to be found in almost every respectable dwelling-house in our city . These two cuts are engraved by Mr. Marsh after drawings on the block by Miss Oakey , and they are both taken from actual objects . In No. i we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly on the mantel-shelf , but secured to the wall in some easily detachable way . I'his frame incloses three mirrors , a large one ( but not large ) in the No. 4 . HANGING SIIELP AND CABINET . // middle , and a smaller one on each side . Above the mirror is a projecting shelf with a railing , supported on brackets . This shelf is to hold a few pretty plates , bits of glass , or table trinkets of any kind which the owners of the mantel may happen to be possessed of and which are worth putting where they can be seen and not meddled with . On the marble shelf of the mantel-piece is laid a board , covered with velvet or plush , and having a narrow valance of the same material over the edge . This valance should not be more than six inches deep , and it ought to avoid any very pronounced ornaments-one of the beautiful new English gimps , or " laces , " as they are called , makes the best decoration . The effect of these laces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern , which is always one of the elementary patterns , alternate squares of dark and light , or round spots of gold on a ground of black or dull red . Of course the woman 's deft fingers and quick eye can weave or embroider these for herself ; but if she will buy them , the English make them more beautifully , as well as more substantially , than any one else . The owners of this mantel-piece have substituted a brass fender for the foolish black dust-pan that comes with our common grates . It is much easier to take up the ashes from the actual hearth than to try to keep the grate-pan clean , which plays the part of make-believe hearth . Besides , a brass grate is forever a handsome addition to the belongings of the fire-place . The other mantel-piece , No. 2 , is more expensive than No . I ; it is handsome and different ; but No. i is handsome too . This . mantel ornament serves as frame to one of the circular mirrors , which , a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desponding way to the garret , or the auctionroom , when the new fashion set in , and some one with an eye pulled them by the sleeve and encouraged them to come back again . They are now much sought for , and fetch high prices ; large ones , with all their ornaments , of spread eagles , chains , and candle-branches , have sold for two and three hundred dollars . But they may be picked up now and then , and , as they are easily made , we already begin to see the manufacture reviving . As mirrors , they are not of any use , their only object being to give pleasure by the queer distorted reflections they make , and by the clever way in which they give back a view of the whole room . A very pretty mantel wainscot , of the kind shown in No. 2 , has been made by a person who found himself in possession of an old-fashioned cabinet , or chest of drawers , the most of which was past revamping . The pediment at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , - in short , the whole front of the upper part of the bureau set against the wall made , in hands skillful at adaptation , a combination and a form indeed . I said a few words in the February number about getting rid of as many as possible of the pieces of furniture that now stand upon the floor . Even when we happen to find ourselves in a house with large rooms , I , for one , should prefer to keep as much space as possible to move about in ; but the rule is , for us in New York at least , small rooms , and generally of an inconvenient shape , long and narrow . I gave a few lines to describing a Turkish shelf with a gunrack below it , and should have explained myself further if the cuts Nos. 3 and 4 in the present article could have been ready in time for that part of my discourse . No. 5 . GRANDMOTHER 'S CUPBOARD . // qwq would be a pity to give up would be the carving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough things to put on such a shelf , it would be they , and not the shelf , we should look at ; and there. - fore , if the general form and the proportions are found pleasing , it would be easy for Mr. Sandier to devise one that could be compassed by a slenderer purse than must , no doubt , be drawn upon for this . Besides the hanging-shelf and the sofa , of which something is said further on , Mr. Sandier has cleverly brought into this cheerful drawing of his , several other objects ; which may furnish useful hints to our readers . The pedestal in the corner is an ingenious provision for a much felt need ,  --  a pedestal for a statue , vase , or cast , being one of the pieces of furniture most difficult to find . This pedestal ; made of wood , and having a small cloth laid over the top , has one shelf near the bottom , but may have another near the top , or even a little closet in the upper part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Minerva , " one of the great sculptor 's studies of the human figure seldom seen . A nude Minerva would have shocked a Greek , and , perhaps , puzzled him ; he would have wondered what incident in the goddess 's story could have given him an excuse But the shelf which , with all the other pieces , the sofa , the writing-table , and the pedestal , he has designed himself ; is certainly a very pretty one . It has three shelves , counting the top , and will hold a number of goodsized objects . Mr. Sandier has made his drawing from the original , which he designed for Mr. Herter . In that the sides were pierced with carved open-work , the back was paneled , and the panels decorated with figure subjects , painted by Mr. Sandier him " To twitch the nymph 's last garment off . " As I take it , Minerva has disrobed for the contest of beauty with Juno and Venus ; there being nothing else left , she is taking off her sword . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bookshelf above and drawers at the side , and on No. 6 . A CUPBOARD OF TO-DAY . // the wall over it , Mr. Sandier has hung one of the Japanese scrolls , which we find nowadays in the shops that devote themselves to Eastern products ,  --  Mr. Vantine 's , in Broadway ; Mr. Drake 's , in Chambers street ; or Mr. Rowland Johnson 's , in Beaver street . Mr. Jarves describes some beautiful ones he owns in his late book about Japanese Art , and they are not seldom far more beautiful than any pictures by our own men , we with the short purses can lay hands upon . Besides the screens , there are the Japanese paintings on silk gauze , or on paper , of men and women , birds and flowers . There is hardly anything with which we can produce prettier effect in rooms where we want to break up the wall , and yet have nothing particularly good , as engraving or picture , to hang upon it , than these Japanese paintings of birds and flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauze , and with which the Japs themselves ornament their screens . Secured to the wall by a drawing-pin at each of the four corners , they give a bright and cheerful look to a dull room , and are always pleasant to see , even when they are of the cheaper sort . The best ones are often much better worth having for spirited design , and the mastery of their painting , than any picture most of us can afford to buy ; indeed , for their flowers and birds there is no decorative work of our day that can at all compare with it . One of the prettiest modern rooms I ever saw was in the house of a distinguished artist in one of the London suburbs , and the sole decoration on the walls was one of these screen pictures in each of the wall divisions ; but then they were of very rare beauty , both in design and execution , and the tone of the room had their color for its key . Mr. Herter has been kind enough to second my request to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these articles , and has generously allowed some of his own work to be deferred until a few drawings for whith I was pressed could be made for me . None of Mr. Sandier 's work , neither his own designs , nor his drawings upon the wood , have appeared here since last June , when the first of these articles was published , until now ; but several more have been engraved , and will appear , and still others are promised . If I have not drawn more on Mr. Herter 's amiable offer to place anything in his establishment at my disposal , in the way of illustration to these papers , it has only been because the world he purveys for is one that has too much money to be pleased with anything that does not minister to luxury and to the taste for splendor . Mr. Herter ' s own taste leads him to simplicity in design , and to a certain severity ; but he gets no credit for this , since his clients do not care for furNo. 7 . A FRIENDLY LOUNGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wishes to suit his customers . For myself , therefore , I seldom see anything in his rich apartments that takes my fancy , a reticence which a manufacturer could well afford to smile at , and even to pity , who is shepherd to such a flock of Crcesuses as Mr. Herter . But , on the contrary , Mr. Herter neither smiles nor pities , but has taken pains to prove how much he has in common with me in matters of taste by offering to execute any piece for me in which I might wish to illustrate my own notions . Mr. Herter is doing practically what " The Nation " lately suggesfed that I might do theoretically : he is trying to make the rich people who will have luxury and splendor spend their money for tasteful luxury and splendor . Some one must do this , I uppose , but I had rather it were Mr. Herter than I. And yet I wish heartily he would come to my help , and to the help of those who think with me , and show us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to love elegance and serenity rather than costly display . But it is most probable they will have to work out their own salvatiQn . Cut No. 4 is another design for a Hanging // Cabinet , designed by Cottier &amp; Co . This has a closet with plate-glass doors , surrounded by shelves above , below , and on each side . As seen in the cut , it is so much foreshortened , that the rails on either side of the top seem much higher than they do in reality . The little shelves at the sides are backed with mirrors , the edges of the squares of plate-glass in the doors are beveled , and as the wood is stained a rich black , the effect of the whole , as seen filled with India porcelain and Venice glass , with a great platter of old blue a-top is brilliant enough . Yet , here again , as in the case of Mr. Sandier 's shelves , much that goes to make this actual piece of furniture too costly for any one of moderate means to so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the design . The main elements of the design are independent of the mirror , and of the beveling of the glass in the doors . These add splendor , but splendor not of a sort to please a true taste . An artist 's eye would leave all for the color of the pots and the bits of glass that are arranged on the shelves . Such a cabinet might be made a museum for the preservation of all the curiosities and pretty things gathered in the family walks and travels . The bubble bottle of old Roman glass stirred in walking by one 's own foot in the ruined palace of the C*esars , and not bought in a shop ; the Dutch drinking glass , with the crest of William of Orange ; the trilobites found in a Newburgh stonewall , or the box of Indian arrow-heads , jasper , and feldspar , and quartz , picked up in a Westchester County field ; bits of nature 's craft and man 's , gathered in one of these pendent museums , may make a collection of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little intrinsic value , and of small regard to see to , will often find its use in a house of wide-awake children . And here one might put in a word for that heterogeneous catalogue of things for which the word bric4z-brac has been invented . These objects , which are coming to play the part in our external life that they have played these many years in Europe and Asia , have really , if one wishes to find a.side on which to regard them that shall commend itself to more serious consideration than trifling , however sanctified by fashion , can deserve-these objects , when they are well chosen , and have some beauty of form or color , or workmanship , to recommend them , have a distinct use and value , as educators of certain senses  --  the sense of color , the sense of touch , the sense of sight . One need not have many of these pretty things within reach of hands and eyes , but money is well spent on really good bits of Japanese workmanship , or upon good bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hand and an exquisite perception to the making of what are in reality toys . A Japanese ivory carving or wood carving of the best kind  --  and there is a wide field for choice in these remarkable productions-one of their studies of animal life , or of the human figure , or of their playful , sociable divinities , pixie , or goblin , or monkey-man , has a great deal in it that lifts it above the notion of a toy . It is a toy , a button , a useless thing , or nearly useless , but it is often as poetically or wittily conceived , as if the artist had a commission from the State . Then it is sure to be pleasant and soothing to the touch ; it was made to be clasped by the fingers , felt with the fingertips , rolled in the palm ; for the general use to which they are put is being fastened to the pipe-case to serve as a button to keep it from slipping from the belt , and in this place they offer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been developed by necessity . A child 's taste and delicacy of perception will be more surely fed by the constant habit of seeing and playing with a few of the best bits of ivory carving his parents can procure  --  and very nice pieces are often to be had for a small sum of money-than by a room fuJl of figures like those of Mr. Rogers , for example , or the great majority of French bronzes . Of course a bronze by Barye , or by Fremiet , would do as much or more for the child 's taste , and by all means let the money go for that if it can be afforded ; but I am speaking now of trifles that , in a serious consideration of art , have no place perhaps , and which yet do nothing but help us in learning to know and admire the best art . Perhaps t is fanciful ; but suppose a child to have had as fine a specimen of a polished Japanese sphere put within his daily reach , and were pleased enough with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the eye sink into its pellucid deeps , as from time to time he stopped in his reading of Froissart or King Arthur . Would n't the incommunicable purity and light of the toy make a severe test for the heroes and the heroines in the boy 's mind ; or could his eye , cooled in such a bath of dew , get pleasure any more from discordant color or awkward form ? Our senses are educated more by these slight impressions than we are apt // to think ; and bric-5-brac , so much despised by certain people , and often justly so , may have a use that they themselves might not unwillingly admit . Another way to keep our floors more free of furniture is to make use of the corners . This was a favorite way in old-fashioned days , " In tea-cup times of hood and hoop , And when the patch was worn . " The corner cupboard , cut No. 5 , is not a movable piece , but is a part of the construction of the room . It has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than would perhaps appear on seeing how much room is taken up by the " architecture "  --  the pilasters , cornices , and friezes of this bit of New England Renaissance . I asked Mr. Lathrop to draw this one for its picturesqueness , but it is not , of course , recommended that it should be exactly copied . It affords a good hint as to how the end is to be gained by making a corner useful , which it very rarely is in our houses , the little shaky 6tagI*res we are so fond of ; or were so fond of ? , for they are a little gone off in these days , serving no real use but only to put futile bits of glass and china on for the housemaid to break . A corner cupboard , however , like this one , is useful either in dining-room or living-room . In the dining-room it holds the prettiest pieces of china and glass for use upon the table ; keeping it where it will make a cheerful show of glinting light and color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books that are too bright and good for human nature 's daily food ; or it may be a cabinet for minerals , or shells , or birds , or for those " curios and " objects " that the bewitched collector is often glad to hide away from the critical friendly snubs and slurs of the unappreciative members of his family . No. 6 is a design for a movable cupboard made by Cottier &amp; Co. after their own design , mainly to serve as a frame to the two painted panels in the doors with which Mr. Lathrop enriched it . The cupboard itself is plain enough , and its ornamentation , which is kept down as much as possible so as not to interfere with the painting , is only of arabesques painted in gold color , not in gold , on the black ground . It will be seen that there is a good deal of room in such a piece as this-two cupboards , three drawers , and four shelves , counting the top and the one that runs round the middle compartment at the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would certainly be a cheerful object in the living-room . Cut No. 7 is a drawing of a piece of furniture , the like of which used to be common in France , and which they called a chaise Zongue . It has no back , except at one end , as an Irishman might say , and it seems narrower than it is , on account of its length , which admits of a person lying upon it as comfortably as in a narrow bed . The mattress is movable , and the cushion , or cushions , at the end are movable also ; the affair is simply a frame , with either skins of sole leather stretched across for a sacking , or with straps of leather or surcingle crossed and recrossed into a stout webbing . In some good examples I have seen these straps passed through slots in the edge of the frame , and the ends were riveted together with flat copper rivets , as is done with leather belting and hose-pipe . If the sacking is made of skins of leather , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brassheaded nails . Once well done , and it is done forever . The end of the lounge is set into the frame-work of the seat at a little slant , and in some cases is carved with a good deal of spirit ; the legs and braces are also turned , and so a simple piece of furniture takes on quite an air , while keeping its ornamentation strictly within bounds . This particular chaise longue , or lounge , is said to be the one on which George Fox slept at the time a convention , or " meetinn " of Friends was held in the house where it now is , and it stands where it has always stood . The house has been in the possession of one family for over two hundred years-an uncommon thing in our North country , though by no means unusual in the South . The Chinese chair shown in the February SCRIBNER , Cut No. 8 , serves mainly the same need as this lounge , the need of a seat on which one can sit and " put the feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleep-provoking as the common sofa . The chaise Zongiie only serves one turn , and , as I have shown , the Chinese serves several ; but it is easy to see that in small rooms the Chinese chair would take up too much space . But where there is room and verge enough , it will be found a good family friend . It seems to me a great deal better to have pieces of furniture look to be what they are , rather than to try to disguise them . In the case of the turn-over table shown in the June number , and a variation of which is in the drawing by Mr. Sandier in the present article , no disguise is intended ; it is // only a convenient union of two uses intended for an occasional emergency . The sofa on which the lady is sitting reading , cut No. 3 , is really a sofa , and would probably be used for that purpose twenty days in a month . But , if a large table be unexpectedly needed for cutting out work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large prints , or photographs , the back of the sofa turns down , carrying its cushions with it , and we have the needed table at once . As its main use is to serve as a low , broad , comfortable seat , the table is always ready , never gets littered with books or work , and should never be allowed to get so , because it ought not to be made troublesome , which it is sure to become , if it be not principally used as a seat . But these sofas that can be made into beds , and beds that can be shut up into wardrobes are not to be commended-chiefly because bedding that is in use ought never to be shut up . The French peasantry and German peasantry have a detestable custom of sleeping in closets that are often closed with doors , though sometimes only a curtain covers the opening , and no care-taking can make such a plan healthy or sweet . After watching the gymnastic young man manipulate his chair in a Broadway window , the reader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see another man who spends the whole day in turning a crank that turns down the front of a sham wardrobe and reveals an uncomfortable crib . Another turn slams up the wardrobe front and hides bed and bedding from view . Perhaps it is mostly because it is a bed that this seems to us so disagreeable ; but there is also the notion that we ought not to be so cramped for room that the absolutely necessary pieces of furniture can not be provided with ground to stand on . Then , again , t is almost impossible to make two things with separate and different uses agree to look like one . In the case of this Broadway bed and sham wardrobe-front , the union is not at all complete , and when it is closed the wardrobe seems to stand up on a low bench or seat , as if it were a cat that had jumped up there to take refuge from the housedog . Cut No. 8 is of a piece of Chinese furniture in use in a dining-room which will recommend itself by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the drawers and the pretty handles . For purpoes of every-day use , it was thought best to take out the sliding panels , eight in number , which run in grooves before the two main divisions . These panels are orna - mented with figures of birds and flowers cut out of soap-stone , which are stuck by some futile kind of Chinese glue on to the polished wood from which they were all the time falling and getting themselves broken . These being taken out and laid aside , there remained a square box with shelves and two handy drawers , the lacquered cranes and shrubs on these drawers giving just enough ornament to relieve the plainness of the cabinet . For the present , this cabinet rests upon a table , a copy made in Paris from a table of Louis XIII . ' s time , of which it seemed worth while bringing home a model , as the original could not be bought . But the cabinet and the table are not altogether harmonious , and it would be better to have a plain stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as it is , it might be copied in a No. 8 . A CHINESE SHELF . // way to get all its advantages , which have been found in practice to be many , and the cost could not be senous . Suppose a carpenter with some feeling for his business were asked to make just such a case , arranging the shelves as they are in the original , one dividing the space into two equal parts , and the lower half divided by a shelf at one side . The drawing shows this shelf a little too high up ; it divides its half of the lower division exactly into halves , and it also does not come out to a line with the front of the cabinet , but only half way , so that a tallnecked cruet , or a drinking-glass , can stand in front of it . This way of arranging shelves is peculiar to these Orientals , Chinese and Japanese alike , and if looked into it will be found to be grounded in common sense , as are many of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the formal look of shelves all alike running from side to side , and , for accommodation , it allows us to give the small things perches to their mind , as well as to look out for the large things . Just as I am closing this article , I read in a New York journal a paper headed " Furniture and Art , " in which one or two things are said that I hope I may notice without fearing to be thought egotistical . One of these touches the spirit in which these papers of mine are written , the writer giving me credit for not wishing to play Sir Oracle , while , at the same time , he says I am far from conciliatory in my general tone . He then goes on to give some very sensible advice to young married couples , which , seems to me , to be in peffect harmony with what I have been preaching from my house-top all along . Now , all that is written here is written by one who has gone through , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and , having had a world of happiness in his home and in his various houses , and taken great delight in altering , improving , and decorating , he was moved to talk about it in this informal way , as most of us like to talk about what we take pleasure in . He is as far as possible from wishing to dictate , and does not like the look of even giving advice . He has made too many mistakes , wasted too much money , lost too much time , and pleased himself so seldom with the results achieved , that if he is dogmatic and disagreeable in his writing about these subjects , it must be because he is so by nature and ca n't help it . He certainly does not want to put on any such tone as the writer deprecates . Some of the people he loves best and would be the last to wound , are people who have not any taste , if he knows what taste is , and who are just as happy , and cheerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed as if they had all the taste and " culture " that are thought A No. 9 . SOLID * indispensable nowadays . The truth is that at the bottom the writer of these articles and his critic are in full agreement . The writer has gained his experience by his penny of observation ; he has fairly earned* by hard work , and thinking , and practice , all he knows , and he is trying to offer in a friendly , unpretending way , what he has gained , to others . He has done for himself just what his critic advises others to do for themselves . And if the aim of these papers has seemed to be to persuade people , or to drive people into extravagance and moneyspending for display , or into giving up their own taste , and their own right to learn for themselves , and to find a solution of their little troubles in housekeeping that shall be in harmony with their own individuality , their author has , indeed , made a mess of it , and , like another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say .
