DEMOCRATIC VISTAS . America , filling the present with greatest deeds and problems , cheerfully accepting the past , including Feudalism , ( as , indeed , the present is but the legitimate birth of the past , including feudalism , ) counts , as I reckon , for her justification and success , ( for who , as yet , dare claim success ? ) almost entirely on the future . Nor is that hope unwarranted . To-day , ahead , though dimly yet , we see , in vistas , a copious , sane , gigantic offspring . For our New World I consider far less important for what it has done , or what it is , than for results to come . Sole among nationalities , These States have assumed the task to put in forms of lasting power and practicality , on areas of amplitude rivaling the operations of the physical kosmos , the moral and political speculations of ages , long , long deferred , the Democratic Republican principle , and the theory of development and perfection by voluntary standards , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , in history , so far , have accepted in unwitting faith , and , as we now see , stand , act upon , and go security for , these things ? But let me strike at once the key-note of my purpose in the following strain . First premising that , though passages of it have been written at widely different times , ( it is , in fact , a collection of memoranda , perhaps for future designers , comprehenders , ) and though it may be open to the charge of one part contradicting another  --  for there are opposite sides to the great question of Democracy , as to every great question  --  I feel the parts harmoniously blended in my own realization and convictions , and present them to be read only in such oneness , each page modified and tempered by the others . Bear in mind , too , that they are not the result of studying up in political economy , but of the ordinary sense , observing , wandering among men , These States , these stirring years of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers of universal suffrage in the United States . In fact , it is to admit and face these dangers I am writing . To him or her within whose thought rages the battle , advancing , retreating , between Democracy 's convictions , aspirations , and the People 's crudeness , vice , caprices , I mainly write this book . I shall use the words America and Democracy as convertible terms . Not an ordinary one is the issue . The United States are destined either to surmount the gorgeous history of Feudalism , or else prove the most tremendous failure of time . Not the least doubtful am I on any prospects of their material success . The triumphant future of their business , geographic , and productive departments , on larger scales and in more varieties than ever , is certain . In those respects the Republic must soon ( if she does not already ) outstrip all examples hitherto afforded , and dominate the world . Footnote : 2Kb Admitting all this , with the priceless value of our political institutions , general suffrage ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) I say that , far deeper than these , what finally and only is to make of our Western World a Nationality superior to any hitherto known , and outtopping the past , must be vigorous , yet unsuspected Literatures , perfect personalities and sociologies , original , transcendental , and expressing ( what , in highest sense , are not yet expressed at all , ) Democracy and the Modern . With these , and out of these , I promulge new races of Teachers , and of perfect Women , indispensable to endow the birth-stock of a New World . For Feudalism , caste , the Ecclesiastic traditions , though palpably retreating from political institutions , still hold essentially , by their spirit , even in this country , entire possession of the more important fields , indeed the very subsoil , of education , and of social standards and Literature . I say that Democracy can never prove itself beyond cavil , until it founds and luxuriantly grows its own forms of arts , poems , schools , theology , displacing all that exists , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite influences . It is curious to me that while so many voices , pens , minds , in the press , lecture-rooms , in our Congress , &c.,; are discussing intellectual topics , pecuniary dangers , legislative problems , the suffrage , tariff and labor questions , and the various business and benevolent needs of America , with propositions , remedies , often worth deep attention , there is one need , a hiatus , and the profoundest , that no eye seems to perceive , no voice to state . Our fundamental want to-day in the United States , with closest , amplest reference to present conditions , and to the future , is of a class , and the clear idea of a class , of native Authors , Literatuses , far different , far higher in grade than any yet known , sacerdotal , modern , fit to cope with our occasions , lands , permeating the whole mass of American mentality , taste , belief , breathing into it a new breath of life , giving it decision , affecting politics far more than the popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Presidents or Congresses , radiating , begetting appropriate teachers and schools , manners , costumes , and , as its grandest result , accomplishing , ( what neither the schools nor the churches and their clergy have hitherto accomplished , and without which this nation will no more stand , permanently , soundly , than a house will stand without a substratum , ) a religious and moral character beneath the political and productive and intellectual bases of The States . For know you not , dear , earnest reader , that the people of our land may all know how to read and write , and may all possess the right to vote  --  and yet the main things may be entirely lacking ?  --  ( and this to supply or suggest them . ) Viewed , to-day , from a point of view sufficiently overarching , the problem of humanity all over the civilized world is social and religious , and is to be finally met and treated by literature . The priest departs , the divine Literatus comes . Never was anything more wanted than , to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Modern is wanted , or the great Literatus of the Modern . At all times , perhaps , the central point in any nation , and that whence it is itself really swayed the most , and whence it sways others , is its national literature , especially its archetypal poems . Above all previous lands , a great original literature is surely to become the justification and reliance , ( in some respects the sole reliance , ) of American Democracy . Few are aware how the great literature penetrates all , gives hue to all , shapes aggregates and individuals , and , after subtle ways , with irresistible power , constructs , sustains , demolishes at will . Why tower , in reminiscence , above all the old nations of the earth , two special lands , petty in themselves , yet inexpressibly gigantic , beautiful , columnar ? Immortal Judah lives , and Greece immortal lives , in a couple of poems . Nearer than this . It is not generally realized , but it is true , as the genius of Greece , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful states , resided in their literature or esthetics , that what was afterwards the main support of European chivalry , the feudal , ecclesiastical , dynastic world over there , forming its osseous structure , holding it together for hundreds , thousands of years , preserving its flesh and bloom , giving it form , decision , rounding it out , and so saturating it in the conscious and unconscious blood , breed , belief , and intuitions of men , that it still prevails powerfully to this day , in defiance of the mighty changes of time , was its literature , permeating to the very marrow , especially that major part , its enchanting songs , ballads , and poems . Footnote : 1Kb To the ostent of the senses and eyes , I know , the influences which stamp the world 's history are wars , uprisings or downfalls of dynasties , changeful movements of trade , important inventions , navigation , military or civil governments , advent of powerful personalities , conquerors , &c.; These of course play their part ; yet , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even literary style , fit for the time , put in shape by some great Literatus , and projected among mankind , may duly cause changes , growths , removals , greater than the longest and bloodiest war , or the most stupendous merely political , dynastic , or commercial overturn . In short , as , though it may not be realized , it is strictly true , that a few first-class poets , philosophs , and authors , have substantially settled and given status to the entire religion , education , law , sociology , &c.,; of the hitherto civilized world , by tinging and often creating the atmospheres out of which they have arisen , such also must stamp , and more than ever stamp , the interior and real Democratic construction of this American continent , to-day , and days to come . Remember also this fact of difference , that , while through the antique and through the medival ages , highest thoughts and ideals realized themselves , and their expression made its way by other arts , as much as , or even more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of persons , nor even to the majority of eminent persons , ) such literature in our day and for current purposes , is not only more eligible than all the other arts put together , but has become the only general means of morally influencing the world . Painting , sculpture , and the dramatic theatre , it would seem , no longer play an indispensable or even important part in the workings and mediumship of intellect , utility , or even high esthetics . Architecture remains , doubtless with capacities , and a real future . Then music , the combiner , nothing more spiritual , nothing more sensuous , a god , yet completely human , advances , prevails , holds highest place ; supplying in certain wants and quarters what nothing else could supply . Yet , in the civilization of to-day it is undeniable that , over all the arts , literature dominates , serves beyond all  --  shapes the character of church and school  --  or , at any rate , is capable of doing so . Including the literature of science , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were perhaps well to discriminate on certain points . Literature tills its crops in many fields , and some may flourish , while others lag . What I say in these Vistas has its main bearing on Imaginative Literature , especially Poetry , the stock of all . In the department of Science , and the specialty of Journalism , there appear , in These States , promises , perhaps fulfilments , of highest earnestness , reality , and life . These , of course , are modern . But in the region of imaginative , spinal and essential attributes , something equivalent to creation is imperatively demanded . For not only is it not enough that the new blood , new frame of Democracy shall be vivified and held together merely by political means , superficial suffrage , legislation , &c.,; but it is clear to me that , unless it goes deeper , gets at least as firm and as warm a hold in men 's hearts , emotions and belief , as , in their days , Feudalism or Ecclesiasticism , and inaugurates its own perennial sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defective , its growth doubtful , and its main charm wanting . I suggest , therefore , the possibility , should some two or three really original American poets , ( perhaps artists or lecturers , ) arise , mounting the horizon like planets , stars of the first magnitude , that , from their eminence , fusing contributions , races , far localities , &c.,; together , they would give more compaction and more moral identity , ( the quality to-day most needed , ) to These States , than all its Constitutions , legislative and judicial ties , and all its hitherto political , warlike , or materialistic experiences . As , for instance , there could hardly happen anything that would more serve The States , with all their variety of origins , their diverse climes , cities , standards , &c.,; than possessing an aggregate of heroes , characters , exploits , sufferings , prosperity or misfortune , glory or disgrace , common to all , typical of all  --  no less , but even greater would it be to possess the aggregation of a cluster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , national expressers , comprehending and effusing for the men and women of The States , what is universal , native , common to all , inland and seaboard , northern and southern . The historians say of ancient Greece , with her ever-jealous autonomies , cities , and states , that the only positive unity she ever owned or received , was the sad unity of a common subjection , at the last , to foreign conquerors . Subjection , aggregation of that sort , is impossible to America ; but the fear of conflicting and irreconcilable interiors , and the lack of a common skeleton , knitting all close , continually haunts me . Or , if it does not , nothing is plainer than the need , a long period to come , of a fusion of The States into the only reliable identity , the moral and artistic one . For , I say , the true nationality of The States , the genuine union , when we come to a mortal crisis , is , and is to be , after all , neither the written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) either self-interest , or common pecuniary or material objects  --  but the fervid and tremendous Idea , melting everything else with resistless heat , and solving all lesser and definite distinctions in vast , indefinite , spiritual , emotional power . It may be claimed , ( and I admit the weight of the claim , ) that common and general worldly prosperity , and a populace well-to-do , and with all life 's material comforts , is the main thing , and is enough . It may be argued that our Republic is , in performance , really enacting to-day the grandest arts , poems , &c.,; by beating up the wilderness into fertile farms , and in her railroads , ships , machinery , &c.; And it may be asked , Are these not better , indeed , for America , than any utterances even of greatest rhapsode , artist , or literatus ? I too hail those achievements with pride and joy : then answer that the soul of man will not with such only  --  nay , not with such at all  --  be finally satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all things , as the feet stand on the ground , ) is addressed to the loftiest , to itself alone . Out of such considerations , such truths , arises for treatment in these Vistas the important question of Character , of an American stock-personality , with Literatures and Arts for outlets and return-expressions , and , of course , to correspond , within outlines common to all . To these , the main affair , the thinkers of the United States , in general so acute , have either given feeblest attention , or have remained , and remain , in a state of somnolence . For my part , I would alarm and caution even the political and business reader , and to the utmost extent , against the prevailing delusion that the establishment of free political institutions , and plentiful intellectual smartness , with general good order , physical plenty , industry , &c.,; ( desirable and precious advantages as they all are , ) do , of themselves , determine and yield to our experiment of Democracy the fruitage of success . With such advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union just issued , victorious , from the struggle with the only foes it need ever fear , ( namely , those within itself , the interior ones , ) and with unprecedented materialistic advancement  --  Society , in These States , is cankered , crude , superstitious , and rotten . Political , or law-made society is , and private , or voluntary society , is also . In any vigor , the element of the moral conscience , the most important , the vertebr , to State or man , seems to me either entirely lacking or seriously enfeebled or ungrown . I say we had best look our time and lands searchingly in the face , like a physician diagnosing some deep disease . Never was there , perhaps , more hollowness at heart than at present , and here in the United States . Genuine belief seems to have left us . The underlying principles of The States are not honestly believed in , ( for all this hectic glow , and these melo-dramatic screamings , ) nor is Humanity itself believed in . What penetrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle is appalling . We live in an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout . The men believe not in the women , nor the women in the men . A scornful superciliousness rules in literature . The aim of all the litterateurs is to find something to make fun of . A lot of churches , sects , &c.,; the most dismal phantasms I know , usurp the name of religion . Conversation is a mass of badinage . From deceit in the spirit , the mother of all false deeds , the offspring is already incalculable . An acute and candid person , in the Revenue Department in Washington , who is led by the course of his employment to regularly visit the cities , North , South , and West , to investigate frauds , has talked much with me ( 1869-70 ) about his discoveries . The depravity of the business classes of our country is not less than has been supposed , but infinitely greater . The whole of the official services of America , National , State , and Municipal , in all their branches and departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption , bribery , falsehood , mal-administration ; and the Judiciary is tainted . The great cities reek with respectable as much as non-respectable robbery and scoundrelism . In fashionable life , flippancy , tepid amours , weak infidelism , small aims , or no aims at all , only to kill time . In business , ( this all-devouring modern word , business , ) the one sole object is , by any means , pecuniary gain . The magician 's serpent in the fable ate up all the other serpents ; and money-making is our magician 's serpent , remaining to-day sole master of the field . The best class we show , is but a mob of fashionably-dressed speculators and vulgarians . True , indeed , behind this fantastic farce , enacted on the visible stage of society , solid things and stupendous labors are to be discovered , existing crudely and going on in the background , to advance and tell themselves in time . Yet the truths are none the less terrible . I say that our New World Democracy , however great a success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , products , and in a certain highly-deceptive superficial popular intellectuality , is , so far , an almost complete failure in its social aspects , in any superb general personal character , and in really grand religious , moral , literary , and esthetic results . In vain do we march with unprecedented strides to empire so colossal , outvying the antique , beyond Alexander 's , beyond the proudest sway of Rome . In vain do we annex Texas , California , Alaska , and reach north for Canada and south for Cuba . It is as if we were somehow being endowed with a vast and more and more thoroughly-appointed body , and then left with little or no soul . Let me illustrate further , as I write , with current observations , localities , &c.; The subject is important , and will bear repetition . After an absence , I am now ( September , 1870 , ) again in New York City and Brooklyn , on a few weeks ' vacation . The splendor , picturesqueness ; and oceanic amplitude and rush of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sparkling seatides , costly and lofty new buildings , the facades of marble and iron , of original grandeur and elegance of design , with the masses of gay color , the preponderance of white and blue , the flags flying , the endless ships , the tumultuous streets , Broadway , the heavy , low , musical roar , hardly ever intermitted , even at night ; the jobbers ' houses , the rich shops , the wharves , the great Central Park , and the Brooklyn Park of Hills , ( as I wander among them this beautiful fall weather , musing , watching , absorbing , )  --  the assemblages of the citizens in their groups , conversations , trade , evening amusements , or along the by-quarters  --  these , I say , and the like of these , completely satisfy my senses of power , fulness , motion , &.,; and give me , through such senses and appetites , and through my esthetic conscience , a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment . Always , and more and more , as I cross the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots in their pilot-houses , or pass an hour in Wall street , or the gold exchange , I realize , ( if we must admit such partialisms , ) that not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom and the open air , in her storms , the shows of night and day , the mountains , forests , seas  --  but in the artificial , the work of man too is equally great  --  in this profusion of teeming humanity , in these ingenuities , streets , goods , houses , ships  --  these seething , hurrying , feverish crowds of men , their complicated business genius , ( not least among the geniuses , ) and all this mighty , many-threaded wealth and industry concentrated here . But sternly discarding , shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of the general effect , coming down to what is of the only real importance , Personalities , and examining minutely , we question , we ask , Are there , indeed , Men here worthy the name ? Are there athletes ? Are there perfect women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners ? Are there crops of fine youths , and majestic old persons ? Are there arts worthy Freedom , and a rich people ? Is there a great moral and religious civilization  --  the only justification of a great material one ? Confess that rather to severe eyes , using the moral microscope upon humanity , a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears , these cities , crowded with petty grotesques , malformations , phantoms , playing meaningless antics . Confess that everywhere , in shop , street , church , theatre , bar-room , official chair , are pervading flippancy and vulgarity , low cunning , infidelity  --  everywhere , the youth puny , impudent , foppish , prematurely ripe  --  everywhere an abnormal libidinousness , unhealthy forms , male , female , painted , padded , dyed , chignoned , muddy complexions , bad blood , the capacity for good motherhood deceasing or deceased , shallow notions of beauty , with a range of manners , or rather lack of manners , ( considering the advantages enjoyed , ) probably the meanest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of all this , and these lamentable conditions , to breathe into them the breath recuperative of sane and heroic life , I say a new founded Literature , not merely to copy and reflect existing surfaces , or pander to what is called taste  --  not only to amuse , pass away time , celebrate the beautiful , the refined , the past , or exhibit technical , rhythmic , or grammatical dexterity  --  but a Literature underlying life , religious , consistent with science , handling the elements and forces with competent power , teaching and training men  --  and , as perhaps the most precious of its results , achieving the entire redemption of woman out of these incredible holds and webs of silliness , millinery , and every kind of dyspeptic depletion  --  and thus insuring to The States a strong and sweet Female Race , a race of perfect Mothers  --  is what is needed . And now , in the full conception of these facts and points , and all that they infer , pro and con  --  with yet unshaken faith in the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexes , and even considered as individuals  --  and ever recognizing in them the broadest bases of the best literary and esthetic appreciation  --  I proceed with my speculations , Vistas . First , let us see what we can make out of a brief , general , sentimental consideration of political Democracy , and whence it has arisen , with regard to some of its current features , as an aggregate , and as the basic structure of our future literature and authorship . We shall , it is true , quickly and continually find the origin-idea of the singleness of man , individualism , asserting itself , and cropping forth , even from the opposite ideas . But the mass , or lump character , for imperative reasons , is to be ever carefully weighed , borne in mind , and provided for . Only from it , and from its proper regulation and potency , comes the other , comes the chance of Individualism . The two are contradictory , but our task is to reconcile them . Footnote : 1Kb The political history of the past may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words Order , Safety , Caste , and especially out of the need of some prompt deciding Authority , and of Cohesion , at all cost . Leaping time , we come to the period within the memory of people now living , when , as from some lair where they had slumbered long , accumulating wrath , sprang up and are yet active , ( 1790 , and on even to the present , 1870 , ) those noisy eructations , destructive iconoclasms , a fierce sense of wrongs , and amid which moves the Form , well known in modern history , in the old world , stained with much blood , and marked by savage reactionary clamors and demands . These bear , mostly , as on one enclosing point of need . For after the rest is said  --  after the many time-honored and really true things for subordination , experience , rights of property , &c.,; have been listened to and acquiesced in  --  after the valuable and well-settled statement of our duties and relations in society is thoroughly conned over and exhausted  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of that Something a man is , ( last precious consolation of the drudging poor , ) standing apart from all else , divine in his own right , and a woman in hers , sole and untouchable by any canons of authority , or any rule derived from precedent , state-safety , the acts of legislatures , or even from what is called religion , modesty , or art . The radiation of this truth is the key of the most significant doings of our immediately preceding three centuries , and has been the political genesis and life of America . Advancing visibly , it still more advances invisibly . Underneath the fluctuations of the expressions of society , as well as the movements of the politics of the leading nations of the world , we see steadily pressing ahead , and strengthening itself , even in the midst of immense tendencies toward aggregation , this image of completeness in separatism , of individual personal dignity , of a single person , either male or female , characterized in the main , not from extrinsic acquirements or position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as an eventual conclusion and summing up , ( or else the entire scheme of things is aimless , a cheat , a crash , ) the simple idea that the last , best dependence is to be upon Humanity itself , and its own inherent , normal , full-grown qualities , without any superstitious support whatever . This idea of perfect individualism it is indeed that deepest tinges and gives character to the idea of the Aggregate . For it is mainly or altogether to serve independent separatism that we favor a strong generalization , consolidation . As it is to give the best vitality and freedom to the rights of the States , ( every bit as important as the right of Nationality , the union , ) that we insist on the identity of the Union at all hazards . The purpose of Democracy  --  supplanting old belief in the necessary absoluteness of established dynastic rulership , temporal , ecclesiastical , and scholastic , as furnishing the only security against chaos , crime , and ignorance  --  is , through many transmigrations , and amid endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at all hazards , this doctrine or theory that man , properly trained in sanest , highest freedom , may and must become a law , and series of laws , unto himself , surrounding and providing for , not only his own personal control , but all his relations to other individuals , and to the State ; and that , while other theories , as in the past histories of nations , have proved wise enough , and indispensable perhaps for their conditions , this , as matters now stand in our civilized world , is the only Scheme worth working from , as warranting results like those of Nature 's laws , reliable , when once established , to carry on themselves . The argument of the matter is extensive , and , we admit , by no means all on one side . What we shall offer will be far , far from sufficient . But while leaving unsaid much that should properly even prepare the way for the treatment of this many-sided question of political liberty , equality , or republicanism  --  leaving the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embodying Humanity , its politics and civilization , through the retrospect of past time , ( which Plan and products , indeed , make up all of the past , and a major part of the present )  --  Leaving unanswered , at least by any specific and local answer , many a well-wrought argument and instance , and many a conscientious declamatory cry and warning  --  as , very lately , from an eminent and venerable person abroad Footnote : 1Kb  --  things , problems , full of doubt , dread , suspense , ( not new to me , but old occupiers of many an anxious hour in city 's din , or night 's silence , ) we still may give a page or so , whose drift is opportune . Time alone can finally answer these things . But as a substitute in passing , let us , even if fragmentarily , throw forth a short direct or indirect suggestion of the premises of that other Plan , in the new spirit , under the new forms , started here in our America . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground for further and vaster sections , few probably are the minds , even in These Republican States , that fully comprehend the aptness of that phrase , " the Government of the People , by the People , for the People , " which we inherit from the lips of Abraham Lincoln ; a formula whose verbal shape is homely wit , but whose scope includes both the totality and all minuti of the lesson . The People ! Like our huge earth itself , which , to ordinary scansion , is full of vulgar contradictions and offence , Man , viewed in the lump , displeases , and is a constant puzzle and affront to the merely educated classes . The rare , cosmical , artist-mind , lit with the Infinite , alone confronts his manifold and oceanic qualities , but taste , intelligence and culture , ( so-called , ) have been against the masses , and remain so . There is plenty of glamour about the most damnable crimes and hoggish meannesses , special and general , of the Feudal and dynastic world over there , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-dressed and so handsome . But the People are ungrammatical , untidy , and their sins gaunt and ill-bred . Literature , strictly considered , has never recognized the People , and , whatever may be said , does not to-day . Speaking generally , the tendencies of literature , as hitherto pursued , have been to make mostly critical and querulous men . It seems as if , so far , there were some natural repugnance between a literary and professional life , and the rude rank spirit of the Democracies . There is , in later literature , a treatment of benevolence , a charity business , rife enough it is true ; but I know nothing more rare , even in this country , than a fit scientific estimate and reverent appreciation of the People  --  of their measureless wealth of latent power and capacity , their vast , artistic contrasts of lights and shades  --  with , in America , their entire reliability in emergencies , and a certain breadth of historic grandeur , of peace or war , far suspassing all the vaunted samples of book-heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records of the world . The movements of the late Secession war , and their results , to any sense that studies well and comprehends them , show that Popular Democracy , whatever its faults and dangers , practically justifies itself beyond the proudest claims and wildest hopes of its enthusiasts . Probably no future age can know , but I well know , how the gist of this fiercest and most resolute of the world 's warlike contentions resided exclusively in the unnamed , unknown rank and file ; and how the brunt of its labor of death was , to all essential purposes , Volunteered . The People , of their own choice , fighting , dying for their own idea , insolently attacked by the Secession-Slave-Power , and its very existence imperiled . Descending to detail , entering any of the armies , and mixing with the private soldiers , we see and have seen august spectacles . We have seen the alacrity with which the American-born populace , the peaceablest and most good-natured race in the world , and the most personally independent and intelligent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regimental discipline , sprang , at the first tap of the drum , to arms  --  not for gain , nor even glory , nor to repel invasion  --  but for an emblem , a mere abstraction  --  for the life , the safety of the Flag . We have seen the unequaled docility and obedience of these soldiers . We have seen them tried long and long by hopelessness , mismanagement , and by defeat ; have seen the incredible slaughter toward or through which the armies , ( as at first Fredericksburg , and afterward at the Wilderness , ) still unhesitatingly obeyed orders to advance . We have seen them in trench , or crouching behind breastwork , or tramping in deep mud , or amid pouring rain or thick-falling snow , or under forced marches in hottest summer ( as on the road to get to Gettysburg )  --  vast suffocating swarms , divisions , corps , with every single man so grimed and black with sweat and dust , his own mother would not have known him  --  his clothes all dirty , stained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a comrade , perhaps a brother , sun-struck , staggering out , dying , by the roadside , of exhaustion  --  yet the great bulk bearing steadily on , cheery enough , hollow-bellied from hunger , but sineway with unconquerable resolution . We have seen this race proved by wholesale by drearier , yet more fearful tests  --  the wound , the amputation , the shattered face or limb , the slow , hot fever , long , impatient anchorage in bed , and all the forms of maiming , operation and disease . Alas ! America have we seen , though only in her early youth , already to hospital brought . There have we watched these soldiers , many of them only boys in years  --  marked their decorum , their religious nature and fortitude , and their sweet affection . Wholesale , truly . For at the front , and through the camps , in countless tents , stood the regimental , brigade and division hospitals ; while everywhere amid the land , in or near cities , rose clusters of huge , white-washed , crowded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its suburbs , at one period , containing in her Army hospitals of this kind , 50,000 wounded and sick men )  --  and there ruled Agony with bitter scourge , yet seldom brought a cry ; and there stalked Death by day and night along the narrow aisles between the rows of cots , or by the blankets on the ground , and touched lightly many a poor sufferer , often with blessed , welcome touch . I know not whether I shall be understood , but I realize that it is finally from what I learned personally mixing in such scenes that I am now penning these pages . One night in the gloomiest period of the war , in the Patent Office Hospital in Washington City , as I stood by the bedside of a Pennsylvania soldier , who lay , conscious of quick approaching death , yet perfectly calm , and with noble , spiritual manner , the veteran surgeon , turning aside , said to me , that though he had witnessed many , many deaths of soldiers , and had been a worker at Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen yet the first case of man or boy that met the approach of dissolution with cowardly qualms or terror . My own observation fully bears out the remark . What have we here , if not , towering above all talk and argument , the plentifully-supplied , last-needed proof of Democracy , in its personalities ? Curiously enough , too , the proof on this point comes , I should say , every bit as much from the South , as from the North . Although I have spoken only of the latter , yet I deliberately include all . Grand , common stock ! to me the accomplished and convincing growth , prophetic of the future ; proof undeniable to sharpest sense , of perfect beauty , tenderness and pluck , that never Feudal lord , nor Greek , nor Roman breed , yet rivaled . Let no tongue ever speak in disparagement of the American races , North or South , to one who has been through the war in the great army hospitals . Meantime , general Humanity , ( for to that we return , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear in mind , ) has always , in every department , been full of perverse maleficence , and is so yet . In downcast hours the Soul thinks it always will be  --  but soon recovers from such sickly moods . I , as Democrat , see clearly enough , ( as already illustrated , ) the crude , defective streaks in all the strata of the common people ; the specimens and vast collections of the ignorant , the credulous , the unfit and uncouth , the incapable , and the very low and poor . The eminent person just mentioned , sneeringly asks whether we expect to elevate and improve a Nation 's politics by absorbing such morbid collections and qualities therein . The point is a formidable one , and there will doubtless always be numbers of solid and reflective citizens who will never get over it . Our answer is general , and is involved in the scope and letter of this essay . We believe the ulterior object of political and all other government , ( having , of course , provided for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the basic statute and common law , and their administration , always first in order , ) to be , among the rest , not merely to rule , to repress disorder , &c.,; but to develop , to open up to cultivation , to encourage the possibilities of all beneficent and manly outcroppage , and of that aspiration for independence , and the pride and self-respect latent in all characters . ( Or , if there be exceptions , we can not , fixing our eyes on them alone , make theirs the rule for all . ) I say the mission of government , henceforth , in civilized lands , is not repression alone , and not authority alone , not even of law , nor by that favorite standard of the eminent writer , the rule of the best men , the born heroes and captains of the race , ( as if such ever , or one time out of a hundred , got into the big places , elective or dynastic ! )  --  but , higher than the highest arbitrary rule , to train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending there again , to rule themselves . What Christ appeared for in the moral-spiritual field for Human-kind , namely , that in respect to the absolute Soul , there is in the possession of such by each single individual , something so transcendent , so incapable of gradations , ( like life , ) that , to that extent , it places all beings on a common level , utterly regardless of the distinctions of intellect , virtue , station , or any height or lowliness whatever  --  is tallied in like manner , in this other field , by Democracy 's rule that men , the Nation , as a common aggregate of living identities , affording in each a separate and complete subject for freedom , worldly thrift and happiness , and for a fair chance for growth , and for protection in citizenship , &c.,; must , to the political extent of the suffrage or vote , if no further , be placed , in each and in the whole , on one broad , primary , universal , common platform . The purpose is not altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not that Democracy is of exhaustive account , in itself . Perhaps , indeed , it is , ( like Nature , ) of no account in itself . It is that , as we see , it is the best , perhaps only , fit and full means , formulater , general caller-forth , trainer , for the million , not for grand material personalities only , but for immortal souls . To be a voter with the rest is not so much ; and this , like every institute , will have its imperfections . But to become an enfranchised man , and now , impediments removed , to stand and start without humiliation , and equal with the rest ; to commence , or have the road cleared to commence , the grand experiment of development , whose end , ( perhaps requiring several generations , ) may be the forming of a full-grown man or woman  --  that is something . To ballast the State is also secured , and in our times is to be secured , in no other way . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it either on the ground that the People , the masses , even the best of them , are , in their latent or exhibited qualities , essentially sensible and good  --  nor on the ground of their rights ; but that , good or bad , rights or no rights , the Democratic formula is the only safe and preservative one for coming times . We endow the masses with the suffrage for their own sake , no doubt ; then , perhaps still more , from another point of view , for community 's sake . Leaving the rest to the sentimentalists , we present Freedom as sufficient in its scientific aspects , cold as ice , reasoning , deductive , clear and passionless as crystal . Democracy too is law , and of the strictest , amplest kind . Many suppose , ( and often in its own ranks the error , ) that it means a throwing aside of law , and running riot . But , briefly , it is the superior law , not alone that of physical force , the body , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . Law is the unshakable order of the universe forever ; and the law over all , and law of laws , is the law of successions ; that of the superior law , in time , gradually supplanting and over-whelming the inferior one . ( While , for myself , I would cheerfully agree  --  first covenanting that the formative tendencies shall be administered in favor , or , at least not against it , and that this reservation be closely construed  --  that until the individual or community show due signs , or be so minor and fractional as not to endanger the State , the condition of authoritative tuteage may continue , and self-government must abide it 's time. )  --  Nor is the esthetic point , always an important one without fascination for highest aiming souls . The common ambition strains for elevations , to become some privileged exclusive . The master sees greatness and health in being part of the mass . Nothing will do as well as common ground . Would you have in yourself the divine , vast , general law ? Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this most alluring record , that it alone can bind , and ever seeks to bind , all nations , all men , of however various and distant lands , into a brotherhood , a family . It is the old , yet ever-modern dream of Earth , out of her eldest and her youngest , her fond philosophers and poets . Not that half only , Individualism , which isolates . There is another half , which is Adhesiveness or Love , that fuses , ties and aggregates , making the races comrades , and fraternizing all . Both are to be vitalized by Religion ( sole worthiest elevator of man or State , ) breathing into the proud , material tissues , the breath of life . For I say at the core of Democracy , finally , is the Religious element . All the Religions , old and new , are there . Nor may the Scheme step forth , clothed in resplendent beauty and command , till these , bearing the best , the latest fruit , the Spiritual , the aspirational , shall fully appear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Europe , especially the British part of it , more than our own land , and thus , perhaps not absolutely needed for the home reader . But the whole question hangs together , and fastens and links all peoples . The Liberalist of to-day has this advantage over antique or medieval times , that his doctrine seeks not only to universalize , but to individualize . Then the great word Solidarity has arisen . I say of all dangers to a Nation , as things exist in our day , there can be no greater one than having certain portions of the people set off from the rest by a line drawn  --  they not privileged as others , but degraded , humiliated , made of no account . Much quackery teems , of course , even on Democracy 's side , yet does not really affect the orbic quality of the matter . To work in , if we may so term it , and justify God , his divine aggregate , the People , ( or , the veritable horned and sharptailed Devil , his aggregate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this , I say , is what Democracy is for ; and this is what our America means , and is doing  --  may I not say , has done ? If not , she means nothing more , and does nothing more , than any other land . And as , by virtue of its kosmical , antiseptic power , Nature 's stomach is fully strong enough not only to digest the morbific matter always presented , not to be turned aside , and perhaps , indeed , intuitively gravitating thither  --  but even to change such contributions into nutriment for highest use and life  --  so American Democracy 's . That is the lesson we , these days , send over to European lands by every western breeze . And , truly , whatever may be said in the way of abstract argument , for or against the theory of a wider democratizing of institutions in any civilized country , much trouble might well be saved to all European lands by recognizing this palpable fact , ( for a palpable fact it is , ) that some form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That , or chronic dissatisfaction continued , mutterings which grow annually louder and louder , till , in due course , and pretty swiftly in most cases , the inevitable crisis , crash , dynastic ruin . Anything worthy to be called statesmanship in the Old World , I should say , among the advanced students , adepts , or men of any brains , does not debate to-day whether to hold on , attempting to lean back and monarchize , or to look forward and democratize  --  but how , and in what degree and part , most prudently to democratize . The difficulties of the transfer may be fearful ; perhaps none here in our America can truly know them . I , for one , fully acknowledge them , and sympathize deeply . But there is Time , and must be Faith ; and Opportunities , though gradual and slow , will every-where abroad be born . There is ( turning home again , ) a thought , or fact , I must not forget  --  subtle and vast , dear to America , twin-sister of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death , if not the other 's also , would make that other live out life , dragging a corpse , a loathsome horrid tag and burden forever at its feet . What the idea of Messiah was to the ancient race of Israel , through storm and calm , through public glory and their name 's humiliation , tenacious , refusing to be argued with , shedding all shafts of ridicule and disbelief , undestroyed by captivities , battles , deaths  --  for neither the scalding blood of war , nor the rotted ichor of peace could ever wash it out , nor has yet  --  a great Idea , bedded in Judah 's heart  --  source of the loftiest Poetry the world yet knows  --  continuing on the same , though all else varies  --  the spinal thread of the incredible romance of that people 's career along five thousand years ,  --  So runs this thought , this fact , amid our own land 's race and history . It is the thought of Oneness , averaging , including all ; of Identity  --  the indissoluble sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals of reformers and revolutionists are indispensable to counter-balance the inertness and fossilism making so large a part of human institutions . The latter will always take care of themselves  --  the danger being that they rapidly tend to ossify us . The former is to be treated with indulgence , and even respect . As circulation to air , so is agitation and a plentiful degree of speculative license to political and moral sanity . Indirectly , but surely , goodness , virtue , law , ( of the very best , ) follow Freedom . These , to Democracy , are what the keel is to the ship , or saltness to the ocean . The true gravitation-hold of Liberalism in the United States will be a more universal ownership of property , general homesteads , general comfort  --  a vast , intertwining reticulation of wealth . As the human frame , or , indeed , any object in this manifold Universe , is best kept together by the simple miracle of its own cohesion , and the necessity , exercise and profit thereof , so a great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmest held and knit by the principle of the safety and endurance of the aggregate of its middling property owners . So that , from another point of view , ungracious as it may sound , and a paradox after what we have been saying , Democracy looks with suspicious , ill-satisfied eye upon the very poor , the ignorant , and on those out of business . She asks for men and women with occupations , well-off , owners of houses and acres , and with cash in the bank  --  and with some cravings for literature , too ; and must have them , and hastens to make them . Luckily , the seed is already well-sown , and has taken ineradicable root . Footnote : 1Kb  --  Huge and mighty are our Days , our republican lands  --  and most in their rapid shiftings , their changes , all in the interest of the Cause . As I write this passage , ( November , 1868 , ) the din of disputation rages around me . Acrid the temper of the parties , vital the pending questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still in abeyance ; the nominations and the contest for the twenty-first Presidentiad draw close , with loudest threat and bustle . Of these , and all the like of these , the eventuations I know not ; but well I know that behind them , and whatever their eventuations , the really vital things remain safe and certain , and all the needed work goes on . Time , with soon or later superciliousness , disposes of Presidents , Congressmen , party platforms , and such . Anon , it clears the stage of each and any mortal shred that thinks itself so potent to its day ; and at and after which , ( with precious , golden exceptions once or twice in a century , ) all that relates to sir potency is flung to moulder in a burial-vault , and no one bothers himself the least bit about it afterward . But the People ever remains , tendencies continue , and all the idiocratic transfers in unbroken chain go on . In a few years the dominion-heart of America will be far inland , toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present one is . It is possible , nay likely , that in less than fifty years , it will migrate a thousand or two miles , will be re-founded , and every thing belonging to it made on a different plan , original , far more superb . The main social , political spine-character of The States will probably run along the Ohio , Missouri and Mississippi Rivers , and west and north of them , including Canada . Those regions , with the group of powerful brothers toward the Pacific , ( destined to the mastership of that sea and its countless Paradises of islands , ) will compact and settle the traits of America , with all the old retained , but more expanded , grafted on newer , hardier , purely native stock . A giant growth , composite from the rest , getting their contribution , absorbing it , to make it more illustrious . From the North , Intellect , the sun of things  --  also the idea of unswayable Justice , anchor amid the last , the wildest tempests . From the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , haughtily admitting no demonstration but its own . While from the West itself comes solid Personality , with blood and brawn , and the deep quality of all-accepting fusion . Political Democracy , as it exists and practically works in America , with all its threatening evils , supplies a training-school for making grand young men . It is life 's gymnasium , not of good only , but of all . We try often , though we fall back often . A brave delight , fit for freedom 's athletes , fills these arenas , and fully satisfies , out of the action in them , irrespective of success . Whatever we do not attain , we at any rate attain the experiences of the fight , the hardening of the strong campaign , and throb with currents of attempt at least . Time is ample . Let the victors come after us . Not for nothing does evil play its part among men . Judging from the main portions of the history of the world , so far , justice is always in jeopardy , peace walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanness , the craft of tyrants and the credulity of the populace , in some of their protean forms , no voice can at any time say , They are not . The clouds break a little , and the sun shines out  --  but soon and certain the lowering darkness falls again , as if to last forever . Yet is there an immortal courage and prophecy in every sane soul that can not , must not , under any circumstances , capitulate . Vive , the attack  --  the perennial assault ! Vive , the unpopular cause  --  the spirit that audaciously aims  --  the never-abandoned efforts , pursued the same amid opposing proofs and precedents .  --  Once , before the war , ( Alas ! I dare not say how many times the mood has come ! ) I , too , was filled with doubt and gloom . A foreigner , an acute and good man , had impressively said to me , that day  --  putting in form , indeed , my own observations : I have traveled much in the United States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candidates , and read the journals , and gone into the public houses , and heard the unguarded talk of men . And I have found your vaunted America honey-combed from top to too with infidelism , even to itself and its own programme . I have marked the brazen hell-faces of secession and slavery gazing defiantly from all the windows and doorways . I have everywhere found , primarily , thieves and scalliwags arranging the nominations to offices , and sometimes filling the offices themselves . I have found the North just as full of bad stuff as the South . Of the holders of public office in the Nation , or in the States , or their municipalities , I have found that not one in a hundred has been chosen by any spontaneous selection of the outsiders , the people , but all have been nominated and put through by little or large caucuses of the politicians , and have got in by corrupt rings and electioneering , not capacity or desert . I have noticed how the millions of sturdy farmers and mechanics are thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed more and more , the alarming spectacle of parties usurping the Government , and openly and shamelessly wielding it for party purposes . Sad , serious , deep truths . Yet are there other , still deeper , amply confronting , dominating truths . Over those politicians and great and little rings , and over all their insolence and wiles , and over the powerfulest parties , looms a Power , too sluggish may-be , but ever holding decisions and decrees in hand , ready , with stern process , to execute them as soon as plainly needed , and at times , indeed , summarily crushing to atoms the mightiest parties , oven in the hour of their pride . In saner hours far different are the amounts of these things from what , at first sight , they appear . Though it is no doubt important who is elected President or Governor , Mayor or Legislator , ( and full of dismay when incompetent or vile ones get elected , as they sometimes do , ) there are other , quieter contingencies , infinitely more important . Shams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's scum ; enough , if waters deep and clear make up the rest . Enough , that while the piled embroidered shoddy gaud and fraud spreads to the superficial eye , the hidden warp and weft are genuine , and will wear forever . Enough , in short , that the race , the land which could raise such as the late Rebellion , could also put it down . The average man of a land at last only is important . He , in These States , remains immortal owner and boss , deriving good uses , somehow , out of any sort of servant in office , even the basest ; because , ( certain universal requisites , and their settled regularity and protection , being first secured , ) a Nation like ours , in a sort of geological formation state , trying continually new experiments , choosing new delegations , is not served by the best men only , but sometimes more by those that provoke it  --  by the combats they arouse . Thus national rage , fury , discussion , &c.,; better than content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for after times . What is more dramatic than the spectacle we have seen repeated , and doubtless long shall see  --  the popular judgment taking the successful candidates on trial in the offices  --  standing off , as it were , and observing them and their doings for a while , and always giving , finally , the fit , exactly due reward ? I think , after all , the sublimest part of political history , and its culmination , is currently issuing from the American people . I know nothing grander , better exercise , better digestion , more positive proof of the past , the triumphant result of faith in humankind , than a well-contested American national election . Then still the thought returns , ( like the thread-passage in overtures , ) giving the key and echo to these pages . When I pass to and fro , different latitudes , different seasons , beholding the crowds of the great cities , New York , Boston , Philadelphia , Cincinnati , Chicago , St. Louis , San Francisco , New Orleans , Baltimore  --  when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-natured , independent citizens , mechanics , clerks , young persons  --  at the idea of this mass of men , so fresh and free , so loving and so proud , a singular awe falls upon me . I feel , with dejection and amazement , that among our geniuses and talented writers or speakers , few or none have yet really spoken to this people , or created a single image-making work that could be called for them  --  or absorbed the central spirit and the idiosyncrasies which are theirs , and which , thus , in highest ranges , so far remain entirely uncelebrated , unexpressed . Dominion strong is the body 's ; dominion stronger is the mind 's . What has filled , and fills to-day our intellect , our fancy , furnishing the standards therein , is yet foreign . The great poems , Shakespeare included , are poisonous to the idea of the pride and dignity of the common people , the life-blood of Democracy . The models of our literature , as we get it from other lands , ultramarine , have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle sunshine ; all smells of princes ' favors . Of workers of a certain sort , we have , indeed , plenty , contributing after their kind ; many elegant , many learned , all complacent . But , touched by the National test , or tried by the standards of Democratic personality , they wither to ashes . I say I have not seen a single writer , artist , lecturer , or what not , that has confronted the voiceless but ever erect and active , pervading , underlying will and typic Aspiration of the land , in a spirit kindred to itself . Do you call those genteel little creatures American poets ? Do you term that perpetual , pistareen , paste-pot work , American art , American drama , taste , verse ? I think I hear , echoed as from some mountain-top afar in the West , the scornful laugh of the Genius of These States .  --  Democracy , in silence , biding its time , ponders its own ideals , not of Literature and Art only  --  not of men only , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( extricated from this daze , this fossil and unhealthy air which hangs about the word Lady , ) developed , raised to become the robust equals , workers , and , it may be , even practical and political deciders with the men  --  greater than man , we may admit , through their divine maternity , always their towering , emblematical attribute  --  but great , at any rate , as man , in all departments ; or , rather , capable of being so , soon as they realize it , and can bring themselves to give up toys and fictions , and launch forth , as men do , amid real , independent , stormy life .  --  Then , as toward our thought 's finale , ( and , in that , overarching the true scholar 's lesson , ) we have to say there can be no complete or epical presentation of Democracy in the aggregate , or any thing like it , at this day , because its doctrines will only be effectually incarnated in any one branch , when , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far , far , indeed , stretch , in distance , our vistas ! How much is still to be disentangled , freed ! How long it takes to make this world see that it is , in itself , the final authority and reliance ! Did you , too , O friend , suppose Democracy was only for elections , for politics , and for a party name ? I say Democracy is only of use there that it may pass on and came to its flower and fruits in manners , in the highest forms of interaction between men , and their beliefs  --  in Religion , Literature , colleges , and schools  --  Democracy in all public and private life , and in the Army and Navy . Footnote : 1Kb I have intimated that , as a paramount scheme , it has yet few or no full realizers and believers . I do not see , either , that it owes any serious thanks to noted propagandists or champions , or has been essentially helped , though often harmed , by them . It has been and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by trade , finance , machinery , intercommunications , and , in fact , by all the developments of history , and can no more be stopped than the tides , or the earth in its orbit . Doubtless , also , it resides , crude and latent , well down in the hearts of the fair average of the American-born people , mainly in the agricultural regions . But it is not yet , there or anywhere , the fully-received , the fervid , the absolute faith . I submit , therefore , that the fruition of Democracy , on aught like a grand scale , resides altogether in the future . As , under any profound and comprehensive view of the gorgeous-composite Feudal world , we see in it , through the long ages and cycles of ages , the results of a deep , integral , human and divine principle , or fountain , from which issued laws , ecclesia , manners , institutes , costumes , personalities , poems , ( hitherto unequaled , ) faithfully partaking of their source , and indeed only arising either to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display , whose centre was one and absolute  --  so , long ages hence , shall the due historian or critic make at least an equal retrospect , an equal History for the Democratic principle . It , too , must be adorned , credited with its results  --  then , when it , with imperial power , through amplest time , has dominated mankind  --  has been the source and test of all the moral , esthetic , social , political , and religious expressions and institutes of the civilized world  --  has begotten them in spirit and in form , and carried them to its own unprecedented heights  --  has had , ( it is possible , ) monastics and ascetics , more numerous , more devout than the monks and priests of all previous creeds  --  has swayed the ages with a breadth and rectitude tallying Nature 's own  --  has fashioned , systematized , and triumphantly finished and carried out , in its own interest , and with unparalleled success , a New Earth and a New Man .  --  Thus we presume to write , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel by maps yet unmade , and a blank . But the throes of birth are upon us ; and we have something of this advantage in seasons of strong formations , doubts , suspense  --  for then the afflatus of such themes haply may fall upon us , more or less ; and then , hot from surrounding war and revolution , our speech , though without polished coherence , and a failure by the standard called criticism , comes forth , real at least , as the lightnings . And may-be we , these days , have , too , our own reward  --  ( for there are yet some , in all lands , worthy to be so encouraged . ) Though not for us the joy of entering at the last the conquered city  --  nor ours the chance ever to see with our own eyes the peerless power and splendid eclat of the Democratic principle , arrived at meridian , filling the world with effulgence and majesty far beyond those of past history 's kings , or all dynastic sway  --  there is yet , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joy of being tossed in the brave turmoil of these times  --  the promulgation and the path , obedient , lowly reverent to the voice , the gesture of the god , or holy ghost , which others see not , hear not  --  with the proud consciousness that amid whatever clouds , seductions , or heart-wearying postponements , we have never deserted , never despaired , never abandoned the Faith . So much contributed , to be conned well , to help prepare and brace our edifice , our plann 'd Idea  --  we still proceed to give it in another of its aspects  --  perhaps the main , the high facade of all . For to Democracy , the leveler , the unyielding principle of the average , is surely joined another principle , equally unyielding , closely tracking the first , indispensable to it , opposite , ( as the sexes are opposite , ) and whose existence , confronting and ever modifying the other , often clashing , paradoxical , yet neither of highest avail without the other , plainly supplies to these grand cosmic politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Republicanism , to-day or any day , the counterpart and offset , whereby Nature restrains the deadly original relentlessness of all her first-class laws . This second principle is Individuality , the pride and centripetal isolation of a human being in himself ,  --  Identity  --  Personalism . Whatever the name , its acceptance and thorough infusion through the organizations of political commonalty now shooting Aurora-like about the world , are of utmost importance , as the principle itself is needed for very life 's sake . It forms , in a sort , or is to form , the compensating balance-wheel of the successful working machinery of aggregate America .  --  And , if we think of it , what does civilization itself rest upon  --  and what object has it , with its religions , arts , schools , &c.,; but rich , luxuriant , varied Personalism ? To that , all bends ; and it is because toward such result Democracy alone , on anything like Nature 's scale , breaks up the limitless fallows of humankind , and plants the seed , and gives fair play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Literature , Songs , Esthetics , &c.,; of a country are of importance principally because they furnish the materials and suggestions of Personality for the women and men of that country , and enforce them in a thousand effective ways . Footnote : 2Kb As the topmost claim of a strong consolidating of the Nationality of These States , is , that only by such powerful compaction can the separate States secure that full and free swing within their spheres , which is becoming to them , each after its kind , so will Individuality , with unimpeded branchings , flourish best under imperial Republican forms .  --  Assuming Democracy to be at present in its embryo condition , and that the only large and satisfactory justification of it resides in the future , mainly through the copious production of perfect characters among the people , and through the advent of a sane and pervading Religiousness , it is with regard to the atmosphere and spaciousness fit for such characters , and of certain nutriment and cartoon-draftings proper for them , and indicating them , for New World purposes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new ground , wherein , like other primitive surveyors , I must do the best I can , leaving it to those who come after me to do much better . The service , in fact , if any , must be to merely break a sort of first path or track , no matter how rude and ungeometrical . We have frequently printed the word Democracy . Yet I can not too often repeat that it is a word the real gist of which still sleeps , quite unawakened , notwithstanding the resonance and the many angry tempests , out of which its syllables have come , from pen or tongue . It is a great word , whose history , I suppose , remains unwritten , because that history has yet to be enacted . It is , in some sort , younger brother of another great and often-used word , Nature , whose history also waits unwritten . As I perceive , the tendencies of our day , in The States , ( and I entirely respect them , ) are toward those vast and sweeping movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and always current over the planet , on the scale of the impulses of the elements . Then it is also good to reduce the whole matter to the consideration of a single self , a man , a woman , on permanent grounds . Even for the treatment of the universal , in politics , metaphysics , or anything , sooner or later we come down to one single , solitary Soul . There is , in sanest hours , a consciousness , a thought that rises , independent , lifted out from all else , calm , like the stars , shining eternal . This is the thought of Identity  --  yours for you , whoever you are , as mine for me . Miracle of miracles , beyond statement , most spiritual and vaguest of earth 's dreams , yet hardest basic fact , and only entrance to all facts . In such devout hours , in the midst of the significant wonders of heaven and earth , ( significant only because of the Me in the centre , ) creeds , conventions , fall away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luminousness of real vision , it alone takes possession , takes value . Like the shadowy dwarf in the fable , once liberated and looked upon , it expands over the whole earth , and spreads to the roof of heaven . The quality of Being , in the object 's self , according to its own central idea and purpose , and of growing therefrom and thereto  --  not criticism by other standards , and adjustments thereto  --  is the lesson of Nature . True , the full man wisely gathers , culls , absorbs ; but if , engaged disproportionately in that , he slights or overlays the precious idiocrasy and special nativity and intention that he is , the man 's self , the main thing , is a failure , however wide his general cultivation . Thus , in our times , refinement and delicatesse are not only attended to sufficiently , but threaten to eat us up , like a cancer . Already , the Democratic genius watches , ill-pleased , these tendencies . Provision for a little healthy rudeness , savage virtue , justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , is demanded . Negative qualities , even deficiencies , would be a relief . Singleness and normal simplicity , and separation , amid this more and more complex , more and more artificialized , state of society  --  how pensively we yearn for them ! how we would welcome their return ! In some such direction , then  --  at any rate enough to preserve the balance  --  we feel called upon to throw what weight we can , not for absolute reasons , but current ones . To prune , gather , trim , conform , and ever cram and stuff , is the pressure of our days . While aware that much can be said even in behalf of all this , we perceive that we have not now to consider the question of what is demanded to serve a half-starved and barbarous nation , or set of nations , but what is most applicable , most pertinent , for numerous congeries of conventional , over-corpulent societies already becoming stifled and rotten with flatulent , infidelistic literature , and polite conformity and art . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of healthy average Personalism , on original-universal grounds , the object of which should be to raise up and supply through The States a copious race of superb American men and women , cheerful , religious , ahead of any yet known . America , leaving out her politics , has yet morally originated nothing . She seems singularly unaware that the models of persons , books , manners , &c.,; appropriate for former conditions and for European lands , are but exiles and exotics here . No current of her life , as shown on the surfaces of what is authoritatively called her Society , accepts or runs into moral , social , or esthetic Democracy ; but all the currents set squarely against it . Never , in the Old World , was thoroughly upholstered Exterior Appearance and show , mental and other , built entirely on the idea of caste , and on the sufficiency of mere outside Acquisition  --  never were Glibness , verbal Intellect , more the test , the emulation  --  more loftily elevated as head and sample  --  than they are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a time hint the mottoes of its gods . The word of the modern , say these voices , is the word Culture . We find ourselves abruptly in close quarters with the enemy . This word Culture , or what it has come to represent , involves , by contrast , our whole theme , and has been , indeed , the spur , urging us to engagement . Certain questions arise . As now taught , accepted and carried out , are not the processes of Culture rapidly creating a class of supercilious infidels , who believe in nothing ? Shall a man lose himself in countless masses of adjustments , and be so shaped with reference to this , that , and the other , that the simply good and healthy and brave parts of him are reduced and clipped away , like the bordering of box in a garden ? You can cultivate corn and roses and orchards  --  but who shall cultivate the primval forests , the mountain peaks , the ocean , and the tumbling gorgeousness of the clouds ? Lastly  --  Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put in attitude , the elements of fertility and power , a conclusive reply ? I do not so much object to the name , or word , but I should certainly insist , for the purposes of These States , on a radical change of category , in the distribution of precedence . I should demand a programme of Culture , drawn out , not for a single class alone , or for the parlors or lecture-rooms , but with an eye to practical life , the West , the working-men , the facts of farms and jackplanes and engineers , and of the broad range of the women also of the middle and working strata , and with reference to the perfect equality of women , and of a grand and powerful motherhood . I should demand of this programme or theory a scope generous enough to include the widest human area . It must have for its spinal meaning the formation of a typical . Personality of character , eligible to the uses of the high average of men  --  and not restricted by conditions ineligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the manly and courageous instincts , and loving perceptions , and of self-respect  --  aiming to form , over this continent , an Idiocrasy of Universalism , which , true child of America , will bring joy to its mother , returning to her in her own spirit , recruiting myriads of men , able , natural , perceptive , tolerant , devout , real men , alive and full , believers in her , America , and with some definite instinct why and for what she has arisen , most vast , most formidable of historic births , and is , now and here , with wonderful step , journeying through Time . The problem , as it seems to me , presented to the New World , is , under permanent law and order , and after preserving cohesion , ( ensemble-Individuality , ) at all hazards , to vitalize man 's free play of special Personalism , recognizing in it something that calls ever more to be considered , fed , and adopted as the substratum for the best that belongs to us , ( government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our future . To formulate beyond this present vagueness  --  to help line and put before us , the species , or a specimen of the species , of the Democratic ethnology of the future , is a work toward which the Genius of our land , with peculiar encouragement , invites her well-wishers . Already , certain limnings , more or less grotesque , more or less fading and watery , have appeared . We too , ( repressing doubts and qualms , ) will try our hand . Attempting then , however crudely , a basic model or portrait of Personality , for general use for the manliness of The States , ( and doubtless that is most useful which is most simple , comprehensive for all , and toned low enough , ) we should prepare the canvas well beforehand . Parentage must consider itself in advance . ( Will the time hasten when fatherhood and motherhood shall become a science  --  and the noblest science ? ) To our model a clear-blooded , strong-fibred physique , in indispensable ; the questions of food , drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be intermitted . Out of these we descry a well-begotten Selfhood  --  in youth , fresh , ardent , emotional , aspiring , full of adventure ; at maturity , brave , perceptive , under control , neither too talkative nor too reticent , neither flippant nor sombre ; of the bodily figure , the movements easy , the complexion showing the best blood , somewhat flushed , breast expanded , an erect attitude , a voice whose sound outvies music , eyes of calm and steady gaze , yet capable also of flashing  --  and a general presence that holds its own in the company of the highest . For it is native Personality , and that alone , that endows a man to stand before Presidents or Generals , or in any distinguished collection , with aplomb ; and not Culture , or any knowledge or intellect whatever . With regard to the mental-educational part of our model , enlargement of intellect , stores of cephalic knowledge , &c.,; the concentration thitherward of all the customs of our age , especially in America , is so overweening , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and necessary as it is , it really needs nothing from us here  --  except , indeed , a phrase of warning and restraint . Manners , costumes , too , though important , we need not dwell upon here . Like beauty , grace of motion , &c.,; they are results . Causes , original things , being attended to , the right manners unerringly follow . Much is said , among artists , of the grand style , as if it were a thing by itself . When a man , artist or whoever , has health , pride , acuteness , noble aspirations , he has the motive-elements of the grandest style . The rest is but manipulation , ( yet that is no small matter. )  --  Leaving still unspecified several sterling parts of any model fit for the future Personality of America , I must not fail , again and ever , to pronounce myself on one , probably the least attended to in modern times  --  a hiatus , indeed , threatening its gloomiest consequences after us . I mean the simple , unsophisticated Conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to specify in what quarter lie the grounds of darkest dread , respecting the America of our hopes , I should have to point to this particular . I should demand the invariable application to Individuality , this day , and any day , of that old , ever-true plumb-rule of persons , eras , nations . Our triumphant modern Civilizee , with his all-schooling and his wondrous appliances , will still show himself but an amputation while this deficiency remains . Beyond , ( assuming a more hopeful tone , ) the vertebration of the manly and womanly Personalism of our Western World , can only be , and is , indeed , to be , ( I hope , ) its all penetrating Religiousness . The architecture of Individuality will ever prove various , with countless different combinations ; but here they rise as into common pinnacles , some higher , some less high , only all pointing upward . Indeed , the ripeness of Religion is doubtless to be looked for in this field of Individuality , and is a result that no organization or church can ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technists call history , and is not given out from their pages , except the learner has in himself the sense of the well-wrapt , never yet written , perhaps impossible to be written , history  --  so Religion , although casually arrested , and , after a fashion , preserved in the churches and creeds , does not depend at all upon them , but is a part of the identified Soul , which , when greatest , knows not Bibles in the old way , but in new ways  --  the identified Soul , which can really confront Religion when it extricates itself entirely from the churches , and not before . Personalism fuses this , and favors it . I should say , indeed , that only in the perfect uncontamination and solitariness of Individuality may the spirituality of Religion positively come forth at all . Only here , and on such terms , the meditation , the devout ecstasy , the soaring flight . Only here , communion with the mysteries , the eternal problems , Whence ? whither ? Alone , and identity , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , churches , sermons , melt away like vapors . Alone , and silent thought , and awe , and aspiration  --  and then the interior consciousness , like a hitherto unseen inscription , in magic ink , beams out its wondrous lines to the sense . Bibles may convey , and priests expound , but it is exclusively for the noiseless operation of one 's isolated Self , to enter the pure ether of veneration , reach the divine levels , and commune with the unutterable . To practically enter into Politics is an important part of American personalism . To every young man , North and South , earnestly studying these things , I should here , as an offset to what I have said in former pages , now also say , that may-be to views of very largest scope , after all , perhaps the political , ( and perhaps literary and sociological , ) America goes best about its development its own way  --  sometimes , to temporary sight , appalling enough . It is the fashion among dillettants and fops to decry the whole formulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond redemption , and to be carefully kept away from . See you that you do not fall into this error . America , it may be , is doing very well , upon the whole , notwithstanding these antics of the parties and their leaders , these half-brained nominees , and the many ignorant ballots , and many elected failures and blatherers . It is the dillettants , and all who shirk their duty , who are not doing well . As for you , I advise you to enter more strongly yet into politics . I advise every young man to do so . Always inform yourself ; always do the best you can ; always vote . Disengage yourself from parties . They have been useful , and to some extent remain so ; but the floating , uncommitted electors , farmers , clerks , mechanics , the masters of parties  --  watching aloof , inclining victory this side or that side  --  such are the ones most needed , present and future . For America , if eligible at all to downfall and ruin , is eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the combined foreign world could not beat her down . But these savage , wolfish parties alarm me . Owning no law but their own will , more and more combative , less and less tolerant of the idea of ensemble and of equal brotherhood , the perfect equality of the States , the ever-overarching American ideas , it behooves you to convey yourself implicitly to no party , nor submit blindly to their dictators , but steadily hold yourself judge and master over all of them .  --  So much , ( hastily tossed together , and leaving far more unsaid , ) for an ideal , or intimations of an ideal , toward American manhood . But the other sex , in our land , requires at least a basis of suggestion . I have seen a young American woman , one of a large family of daughters , who , some years since , migrated from her meagre country home to one of the northern cities , to gain her own support . She soon became an expert seamstress , but finding the employment too confining for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for others , to house-keep , cook , clean , &c.; After trying several places , she fell upon one where she was suited . She has told me that she finds nothing degrading in her position ; it is not inconsistent with personal dignity , self-respect , and the respect of others . She confers benefits and receives them . She has good health ; her presence itself is healthy and bracing ; her character is unstained ; she has made herself understood , and preserves her independence , and has been able to help her parents and educate and get places for her sisters ; and her course of life is not without opportunities for mental improvement , and of much quiet , uncosting happiness and love . I have seen another woman who , from taste and necessity conjoined , has gone into practical affairs , carries on a mechanical business , partly works at it herself , dashes out more and more into real hardy life , is not abashed by the coarseness of the contact , knows how to be firm and silent at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorum , and will compare , any day , with superior carpenters , farmers , and even boatmen and drivers . For all that , she has not lost the charm of the womanly nature , but preserves and bears it fully , though through such rugged presentation . Then there is the wife of a mechanic , mother of two children , a woman of merely passable English education , but of fine wit , with all her sex 's grace and intuitions , who exhibits , indeed , such a noble female Personality , that I am fain to record it here . Never abnegating her own proper independence , but always genially preserving it , and what belongs to it  --  cooking , washing , child-nursing , house-tending , she beams sunshine out of all these duties , and makes them illustrious . Physiologically sweet and sound , loving work . practical , she yet knows that there are intervals , however few , devoted to recreation , music , leisure , hospitality  --  and affords such intervals . Whatever she does , and wherever she is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attends her , goes with her , exhales from her , which belongs of right to all the sex , and is , or ought to be , the invariable atmosphere and common aureola of old as well as young . My mother has described to me a resplendent person , down on Long Island , whom she knew years ago , in early days . She was known by the name of the Peacemaker . She was well toward eighty years old , of happy and sunny temperament , had always lived on a farm , was very neighborly , sensible and discreet , an invariable and welcomed favorite , especially with young married women . She had numerous children and grandchildren . She was uneducated , but possessed a native dignity . She had come to be a tacitly agreed upon domestic regulator , judge , settler of difficulties , shepherdess , and reconciler in the land . She was a sight to draw near and look upon , with her large figure , her profuse snow-white hair , dark eyes , clear complexion , sweet breath , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are frightfully out of line from these imported models of womanly Personality  --  the stock feminine characters of the current novelists , or of the foreign court poems , ( Ophelias , Enids , Princesses , or Ladies of one thing or another , ) which fill the envying dreams of so many poor girls , and are accepted by our young men , too , as supreme ideals of feminine excellence to be sought after . But I present mine just for a change . Then there are mutterings , ( we will not now stop to heed them here , but they must be heeded , ) of something more revolutionary . The day is coming when the deep questions of woman 's entrance amid the arenas of practical life , politics , trades , &c.,; will not only be argued all around us , but may be put to decision , and real experiment .  --  Of course , in These States , for both man and woman , we must entirely recast the types of highest Personality from what the Oriental , Feudal , Ecclesiastical worlds bequeath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esthetic fields of the United States , pictorial and melodramatic , not without use as studies , but making sad work , and forming a strange anachronism upon the scenes and exigencies around us . Of course , the old , undying elements remain . The task is , to successfully adjust them to new combinations , our own days . Nor is this so incredible . I can conceive a community , to-day and here , in which , on a sufficient scale , the perfect Personalities , without noise , meet ; say in some pleasant Western settlement or town , where a couple of hundred best men and women , of ordinary worldly status , have by luck been drawn together , with nothing extra of genius or wealth , but virtuous , chaste , industrious , cheerful , resolute , friendly , and devout . I can conceive such a community organized in running order , powers judiciously delegated , farming , building , trade , courts , mails , schools , elections , all attended to ; and then the rest of life , the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bearing golden fruit . I can see there , in every young and old man , after his kind , and in every woman after hers , a true Personality , developed , exercised proportionately in body , mind , and spirit . I can imagine this case as one not necessarily rare or difficult , but in buoyant accordance with the municipal and general requirements of our times . And I can realize in it the culmination of something better than any stereotyped eclat of history or poems . Perhaps , unsung , undramatized , unput in essays or biographies  --  perhaps even some such community already exists , in Ohio , Illinois , Missouri , or somewhere , practically fulfilling itself , and thus outvying , in cheapest vulgar life , all that has been hitherto shown in best ideal pictures . In short , and to sum up , America , betaking herself to formative action , ( as it is about time for more solid achievement and less windy promise , ) must , for her purposes , cease to recognize a theory of character grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary standards , or from any ultramarine , full-dress formulas of culture , polish , caste , &c.,; and must sternly promulgate her own new standard , yet old enough , and accepting the old , the perennial , elements , and combining them into groups , unities , appropriate to the modern , the democratic , the West , and to the practical occasions and needs of our own cities , and of the agricultural regions . Ever the most precious in the common . Ever the fresh breeze of field , or hill , or lake , is more than any palpitation of fans , though of ivory , and redolent with perfume ; and the air is more than the costliest perfumes . And now , for fear of mistake , we may not intermit to beg our absolution from all that genuinely is , or goes along with , even Culture . Pardon us , venerable shade ! if we have seemed to speak lightly of your office . The whole civilization of the earth , we know , is yours , with all the glory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own spirit , and seeking to tally the loftiest teachings of it , that we aim these poor utterances . For you , too , mighty minister ! know that there is something greater than you , namely , the fresh , eternal qualities of Being . From them , and by them , as you , at your best , we , too , after our fashion , when art and conventions fail , evoke the last , the needed help , to vitalize our country and our days . Thus we pronounce not so much against the principle of Culture ; we only supervise it , and promulge along with it , as deep , perhaps a deeper , principle . As we have shown , the New World , including in itself the all- leveling aggregate of Democracy , we show it also including the all-varied , all-permitting , all-free theorem of Individuality , and erecting therefor a lofty and hitherto unoccupied framework or platform , broad enough for all , eligible to every farmer and mechanic  --  to the female equally with the male  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mere mind 's and learning 's stores , but Religious , possessing the idea of the Infinite , ( rudder and compass sure amid this troublous voyage , o'er darkest , wildest wave , through stormiest wind , of man 's or nation 's progress , )  --  realizing , above the rest , that known humanity , in deepest sense , is fair adhesion to Itself , for purposes beyond  --  and that , finally , the Personality of mortal life is most important with reference to the immortal , the Unknown , the Spiritual , the only permanently real , which , as the ocean waits for and receives the rivers , waits for us each and all . Much is there , yet demanding line and outline in our Vistas , not only on these topics , but others quite unwritten . Indeed , we could talk the matter , and expand it , through lifetime . But it is necessary to return to our original premises . In view of them , we have again pointedly to confess that all the objective grandeurs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depend on mentality alone . Here , and here only , all balances , all rests . For the mind , which alone builds the permanent edifice , haughtily builds it to itself . By it , with what follows it , are conveyed to mortal sense the culminations of the materialistic , the known , and a prophecy of the unknown . To take expression , to incarnate , to endow a Literature with grand and archetypal models  --  to fill with pride and love the utmost capacity , and to achieve spiritual meanings , and suggest the future  --  these , and these only , satisfy the soul . We must not say one word against real materials ; but the wise know that they do not become real till touched by emotions , the mind . Did we call the latter imponderable ? Ah , let us rather proclaim that the slightest song-tune , the countless ephemera of passions aroused by orators and tale-tellers , are more dense , more weighty than the engines there in the great factories , or the granite blocks in their foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference to a new and greater Personalism , the needs and possibilities of American imaginative literature , through the medium-light of what we have already broached , it will at once be appreciated that a vast gulf of difference separates the present accepted condition of these spaces , inclusive of what is floating in them , from any condition adjusted to , or fit for , the world , the America , there sought to be indicated , and the copious races of complete men and women , down along these Vistas crudely outlined . It is , in some sort , no less a difference than lies between that long-continued nebular state and vagueness of the astronomical worlds , compared with the subsequent state , the definitely-formed worlds themselves , duly compacted , clustering in systems , hung up there , chandeliers of the universe , beholding and mutually lit by each other 's lights , serving for ground of all substantial foothold , all vulgar uses  --  yet serving still more as an undying chain and echelon of spiritual proofs and shows . A boundless field to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth , to revolve in free and lawful circuits  --  to move , self-poised , through the ether , and shine , like heaven 's own suns ! With such , and nothing less , we suggest that New World Literature , fit to rise upon , cohere , and signalize , in time , These States . What , however , do we more definitely mean by New World Literature ? Are we not doing well enough here already ? Are not the United States this day busily using , working , more printer 's type , more presses , than any other country ? uttering and absorbing more publications than any other ? Do not our publishers fatten quicker and deeper ? ( helping themselves , under shelter of a delusive and sneaking law , or rather absence of law , to most of their forage , poetical , pictorial , historical , romantic , even comic , without money and without price  --  and fiercely resisting even the timidest proposal to pay for it . ) Many will come under this delusion  --  but my purpose is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circulate rivers and oceans of very readable print , journals , magazines , novels , library-books , " poetry , " &c.;  --  such as The States to-day possess and circulate  --  of unquestionable aid and value  --  hundreds of new volumes annually composed and brought out here , respectable enough , indeed unsurpassed in smartness and erudition  --  with further hundreds , or rather millions , ( as by free forage , or theft , aforementioned , ) also thrown into the market ,  --  And yet , all the while , the said nation , land , strictly speaking , may possess no literature at all . Repeating our inquiry , What , then , do we mean by real literature ? especially , the American literature of the future ? Hard questions to meet . The clues are inferential , and turn us to the past . At best , we can only offer suggestions , comparisons , circuits .  --  It must still be reiterated , as , for the purpose of these Memoranda , the deep lesson of History and Time , that all else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its politics , materials , heroic personalities , military eclat , &c.,; remains crude , and defers , in any close and thorough-going estimate , until vitalized by national , original archetypes in literature . They only put the nation in form , finally tell anything , prove , complete anything  --  perpetuate anything . Without doubt , some of the richest and most powerful and populous communities of the antique world , and some of the grandest personalities and events , have , to after and present times , left themselves entirely unbequeathed . Doubtless , greater than any that have come down to us , were among those lands , heroisms , persons , that have not come down to us at all , even by name , date , or location . Others have arrived safely , as from voyages over wide , centuries-stretching seas . The little ships , the miracles that have buoyed them , and by incredible chances safely conveyed them , ( or the best of them , their meaning and essence , ) over long wastes , darkness , lethargy , ignorance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compositions , small in size , yet compassing what measureless values of reminiscence , contemporary portraitures , manners , idioms and beliefs , with deepest inference , hint and thought , to tie and touch forever the old , new body , and the old , new soul . These ! and still these ! bearing the freight so dear  --  dearer than pride  --  dearer than love . All the best experience of humanity , folded , saved , freighted to us here ! Some of these tiny ships we call Old and New Testament , Homer , Eschylus , Plato , Juvenal , &c.; Precious minims ! I think , if we were forced to choose , rather than have you , and the likes of you , and what belongs to , and has grown of you , blotted out and gone , we could better afford , appalling as that would be , to lose all actual ships , this day fastened by wharf , or floating on wave , and see them , with all their cargoes , scuttled and sent to the bottom . Gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put by them in highest of art 's forms , namely , the literary form , the peculiar combinations , and the outshows of that city , age , or race , its particular modes of the universal attributes and passions , its faiths , heroes , lovers and gods , wars , traditions , struggles , crimes , emotions , joys , ( or the subtle spirit of these , ) having been passed on to us to illumine our own selfhood , and its experiences  --  what they supply , indispensable and highest , if taken away , nothing else in all the world 's boundless store-houses could make up to us , or ever again return . For us , along the great highways of time , those monuments stand  --  those forms of majesty and beauty . For us those beacons burn through all the nights . Unknown Egyptians , graving hieroglyphs ; Hindus , with hymn and apothegm and endless epic ; Hebrew prophet , with spirituality , as in flashes of lightning , conscience , like red-hot iron , plaintive songs and screams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , brooding love and peace , like a dove ; Greek , creating eternal shapes of physical and esthetic proportion ; Roman , lord of satire , the sword , and the codex ;  --  of the figures , some far-off and veiled , others nearer and visible ; Dante , stalking with lean form , nothing but fibre , not a grain of superfluous flesh ; Angelo , and the great painters , architects , musicians ; rich Shakespeare , luxuriant as the sun , artist and singer of Feudalism in its sunset , with all the gorgeous colors , owner thereof , and using them at will ;  --  and so to such as German Kant and Hegel , where they , though near us , leaping over the ages , sit again , impassive , imperturbable , like the Egyptian gods . Of these , and the like of these , is it too much , indeed , to return to our favorite figure , and view them as orbs and systems of orbs , moving in free paths in the spaces of that other heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resplendent ones ! ye were , in your atmospheres , grown not for America , but rather for her foes , the Feudal and the old  --  while our genius is Democratic and modern .

On your plane , and no less , but even higher and wider , will I mete and measure for our wants to-day and here . I demand races of orbic bards , with unconditional , uncompromising sway . Come forth , sweet democratic despots of the west ! By points and specimens like these we , in reflection , token what we mean by any land 's or people 's genuine literature . And thus compared and tested , judging amid the influence of loftiest products only , what do our current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the United States , better , for an analogy , present , than , as in certain regions of the sea , those spreading , undulating masses of squid , through which the whale , swimming with head half out , feeds ? Not but that doubtless our current so-called literature , ( like an endless supply of small coin , ) performs a certain service , and may-be , too , the service needed for the time , ( the preparation service , as children learn to spell . ) Everybody reads , and truly nearly everybody writes , either books , or for the magazines or journals . The matter has magnitude , too , after a sort . There is something impressive about the huge editions of the dailies and weeklies , the mountain-stacks of white paper piled in the press-vaults , and the proud , crashing , ten- cylinder presses , which I can stand and watch any time by the half hour . Then , ( though The States in the field of Imagination present not a single first-class work , not a single great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to titillate , to pass away time , to circulate the news and rumors of news , to rhyme and read rhyme , are yet attained , and on a scale of infinity .

To such , or the luckiest of them , as we see , the audiences are limitless and profitable ; but they cease presently . While , this day or any day , to workmen , portraying interior or spiritual life , the audiences were limited , and often laggard  --  but they last forever .  --  Compared with the past , our modern science soars , and our journals serve ; but ideal and even ordinary romantic literature does not , I think , substantially advance .

But always , instead , a parcel of dandies and ennuyees , dapper little gentlemen from abroad , who flood us with their thin sentiment of parlors , parasols , piano-songs , tinkling rhymes , the five-hundredth importation , or whimpering and crying about something , chasing one aborted conceit after another , and forever occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and novel , the grandest events and revolutions , and stormiest passions of history , are crossing to-day with unparalleled rapidity and magnificence over the stages of our own and all the continents , offering new materials , opening new vistas , with largest needs , inviting the daring launching forth of conceptions in Literature , inspired by them , soaring in highest regions , serving Art in its highest , ( which is only the other name for serving God , and serving Humanity , ) where is the man of letters , where is the book , with any nobler aim than to follow in the old track , repeat what has been said before  --  and , as its utmost triumph , sell well , and be erudite or elegant ?

Their politics the United States have , in my opinion , with all their faults , already substantially established , for good , on their own native , sound , long-vista 'd principles , never to be overturned , offering a sure basis for all the rest .

The Second Stage relates to material prosperity , wealth , produce , labor-saving machines , iron , cotton , local , State and continental railways , intercommunication and trade with all lands , steamships , mining , general employment , organization of great cities , cheap appliances for comfort , numberless technical schools , books , newspapers , a currency for money circulation , &c.; The Third Stage , rising out of the previous ones , to make them and all illustrious , I , now , for one , promulge , announcing a native Expression Spirit , getting into form , adult , and through mentality , for These States , self-contained , different from others , more expansive , more rich and free , to be evidenced by original authors and poets to come , by American personalities , plenty of them , male and female , traversing the States , none excepted  --  and by native superber tableaux and growths of language , songs , operas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serious Religious Democracy sternly taking command , dissolving the old , sloughing off surfaces , and from its own interior and vital principles , entirely reconstructing Society .  --  For America , type of progress , and of essential faith in Man  --  above all his errors and wickedness  --  few suspect how deep , how deep it really strikes . The world evidently supposes , and we have evidently supposed so too , that The States are merely to achieve the equal franchise , an elective government  --  to inaugurate the respectability of labor , and become a nation of practical operatives , law-abiding , orderly and well-off . Yes , those are indeed parts of the tasks of America ; but they not only do not exhaust the progressive conception , but rather arise , teeming with it , as the mediums of deeper , higher progress . Daughter of a physical revolution  --  Mother of the true revolutions , which are of the interior life , and of the arts . For so long as the spirit is not changed , any change of appearance is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a boy , were always talking of American Independence . What is independence ? Freedom from all laws or bonds except those of one 's own being , controlled by the universal ones . To lands , to man , to woman , what is there at last to each , but the inherent soul , nativity , idiocrasy , free , highest- poised , soaring its own flight , following out itself ?  --  At present , These States , in their theology and social standards , &c.,; ( of greater importance than their political institutions , ) are entirely held possession of by foreign lands . We see the sons and daughters of the New World , ignorant of its genius , not yet inaugurating the native , the universal , and the near , still importing the distant , the partial , and the dead . We see London , Paris , Italy  --  not original , superb , as where they belong  --  but second-hand here where they do not belong . We see the shreds of Hebrews , Romans , Greeks ; but where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any faithful , highest , proud expression , America herself ? I sometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house . Not but that in one sense , and a very grand one , good theology , good Art , or good Literature , has certain features shared in common . The combination fraternizes , ties the races  --  is , in many particulars , under laws applicable indifferently to all , irrespective of climate or date , and , from whatever source , appeals to emotions , pride , love , spirituality , common to humankind . Nevertheless , they touch a man closest , ( perhaps only actually touch him , ) even in these , in their expression through autochthonic lights and shades , flavors , fondnesses , aversions , specific incidents , illustrations , out of his own nationality , geography , surroundings , antecedents , &c.; The spirit and the form are one , and depend far more on association , identity and place , than is supposed . Subtly interwoven with the materiality and personality of a land , a race  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is always something  --  I can hardly tell what it is ,  --  History but describes the results of it ,  --  it is the same as the untellable look of some human faces . Nature , too , in her stolid forms , is full of it  --  but to most it is there a secret . This something is rooted in the invisible roots , the profoundest meanings of that place , race , or nationality ; and to absorb and again effuse it , uttering words and products as from its midst , and carrying it into highest regions , is the work , or a main part of the work , of any country 's true author , poet , historian , lecturer , and perhaps even priest and philosoph . Here , and here only , are the foundations for our really valuable and permanent verse , drama , &c.; But at present , ( judged by any higher scale than that which finds the chief ends of existence to be to feverishly make money during one-half of it , and by some " amusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other half , ) and considered with reference to purposes of patriotism , health , a noble Personality , religion , and the democratic adjustments , all these swarms of poems , dramatic plays , resultant so far from American intellect , and the formulation of our best ideas , are useless and a mockery . They strengthen and nourish no one , express nothing characteristic , give decision and purpose to no one , and suffice only the lowest level of vacant minds . Of the question , indeed , of what is called the Drama , or dramatic presentation in the United States , as now put forth at the theatres , I should say it deserves to be treated with the same gravity , and on a par with the questions of ornamental confectionery at public dinners , or the arrangement of curtains and hangings in a ballroom  --  nor more , nor less . Of the other , I will not insult the reader 's intelligence , ( once really entering into the atmosphere of these Vistas , ) by supposing it necessary to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our little or well-known rhymesters , does not fulfil , in any respect , the needs and august occasions of this land . America demands a Poetry that is bold , modern , and all-surrounding and kosmical , as she is herself . It must in no respect ignore science or the modern , but inspire itself with science and the modern . It must bend its vision toward the future , more than the past . Like America , it must extricate itself from even the greatest models of the past , and , while courteous to them , must have entire faith in itself and products out of its own original spirit only . Like her , it must place in the van , and hold up at all hazards , the banner of the divine pride of man in himself , ( the radical foundation of the new religion . ) Long enough have the People been listening to poems in which common Humanity , deferential , bends low , humiliated , acknowledging superiors . But America listens to no such poems . Erect , inflated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will listen with pleased ears .  --  Nor may the genuine gold , the gems , when brought to light at last , be probably ushered forth from any of the quarters currently counted on . To-day , doubtless , the infant Genius of American poetic expression , ( eluding those highly-refined imported and gilt-edged themes , and sentimental and butterfly flights , pleasant to New York , Boston , and Philadelphia publishers  --  causing tender spasms in the coteries , and warranted not to chafe the sensitive cuticle of the most exquisitely artificial gossamer delicacy , ) lies sleeping far away , happily unrecognized and uninjured by the coteries , the art-writers , the talkers and critics of the saloons , or the lecturers in the colleges  --  lies sleeping , aside , unrecking itself , in some Western idiom , or native Michigan or Tennessee repartee , or stump-speech  --  or in Kentucky or Georgia or the Carolinas  --  or in some slang or local song or allusion of the Manhattan , Boston , Philadelphia or Baltimore mechanic  --  or up in the Maine woods  --  or off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocky mountains , or along the Pacific rail-road  --  or on the breasts of the young farmers of the Northwest , or Canada , or boatmen of the lakes . Rude and coarse nursing-beds these ; but only from such beginnings and stocks , indigenous here , may haply arrive , be grafted , and sprout , in time , flowers of genuine American aroma , and fruits truly and fully our own .  --  I say it were a standing disgrace to These States  --  I say it were a disgrace to any nation , distinguished above others by the variety and vastness of its territories , its materials , its inventive activity , and the splendid practicality of its people , not to rise and soar above others also in its original styles in literature and art , and its own supply of intellectual and esthetic masterpieces , archetypal , and consistent with itself . I know not a land except ours that has not , to some extent , however small , made its title clear . The Scotch have their born ballads , tunes subtly expressing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have theirs . England , Italy , France , Spain , theirs . What has America ? With exhaustless mines of the richest ore of epic , lyric , tale , tune , picture , &c.,; in the Four Years ' War ; with , indeed , I sometimes think , the richest masses of material ever afforded a nation , more variegated , and on a larger scale  --  the first sign of proportionate , native , imaginative Soul , and first-class works to match , is , ( I can not too often repeat , ) so far wanting . When the hundredth year of this Union arrives , there will be some Forty to Fifty great States , among them Canada and Cuba . The population will be sixty or seventy millions . The Pacific will be ours , and the Atlantic mainly ours . There will be daily electric communication with every part of the globe . What an age ! What a land ! Where , elsewhere , one so great ? The Individuality of one nation must then , as always , lead the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ? Bear in mind , though , that nothing less than the mightiest original non-subordinated Soul has ever really , gloriously led , or ever can lead . ( This Soul  --  its other name , in these Vistas , is Literature . ) In fond fancy leaping those hundred years ahead , let us survey America 's works , poems , philosophies , fulfilling prophecies , and giving form and decision to best ideals . Much that is now undreamed of , we might then perhaps see established , luxuriantly cropping forth , richness , vigor of letters and of artistic expression , in whose products character will be a main requirement , and not merely erudition or elegance . Intense and loving comradeship , the personal and passionate attachment of man to man  --  which , hard to define , underlies the lessons and ideals of the profound saviours of every land and age , and which seems to promise , when thoroughly developed , cultivated and recognized in manners and Literature , the most substantial hope and safety of the future of These States , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joyousness , and Faith , and the sense of Health al fresco , may well enter into the preparation of future noble American authorship . Part of the test of a great Literatus shall be the absence in him of the idea of the covert , the artificial , the lurid , the maleficent , the devil , the grim estimates inherited from the Puritans , hell , natural depravity , and the like . The great Literatus will be known , among the rest , by his cheerful simplicity , his adherence to natural standards , his limitless faith in God , his reverence , and by the absence in him of doubt , ennui , burlesque , persiflage , or any strained and temporary fashion . Nor must I fail , again and yet again , to clinch , reiterate more plainly still , ( O that indeed such survey as we fancy , may show in time this part completed also ! ) the lofty aim , surely the proudest and the purest , in whose service the future Literatus , of whatever field , may gladly labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our race , our Nationality , its wealth , territories , factories , population , luxuries , products , trade , and military and naval strength , and breathing breath of life into all these , and more , must be its Moral Civilization  --  the formulation , expression , and aidancy whereof , is the very highest height of literature . And still within this wheel , revolves another wheel . The climax of this loftiest range of modern civilization , giving finish and hue , and rising above all the gorgeous shows and results of wealth , intellect , power , and art , as such  --  above even theology and religious fervor  --  is to be its development , from the eternal bases , and the fit expression , of absolute Conscience , moral soundness , Justice . I say there is nothing else higher , for Nation , Individual , or for Literature , than the idea , and practical realization and expression of the idea , of Conscience , kept at topmost mark , absolute in itself , well cultivated , uncontaminated by the manifold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fashions of the world . Even in religious fervor there is a touch of animal heat . But moral conscientiousness , crystalline , without flaw , not Godlike only , entirely Human , awes and enchants me forever . Great is emotional Love , even in the order of the rational universe . But , if we must make gradations , I am clear there is something greater . Power , love , veneration , products , genius , esthetics , tried by subtlest comparisons , analyses , and in serenest moods , somewhere fail , somehow become vain . Then noiseless , with flowing steps , the lord , the sun , the last Ideal comes . By the names Right , Justice , Truth , we suggest , but do not describe it . To the world of men it remains a dream , an idea as they call it . But no dream is it to the wise  --  but the proudest , almost only solid lasting thing of all . I say , again and forever , the triumph of America 's democratic formules is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy among individuals , cities , States , and the Nation , of moral Conscience . Its analogy in the material universe is what holds together this world , and every object upon it , and carries its dynamics on forever sure and safe . Its lack , and the persistent shirking of it , as in life , sociology , literature , politics , business , and even sermonizing , these times , or any times , still leaves the abysm , the mortal flaw and smutch , mocking civilization to-day , with all its unquestioned triumphs , and all the civilization so far known . Such is the thought I would especially bequeath to any earnest persons , students of these Vistas , and following after me . Footnote : 2Kb Present Literature , while magnificently fulfilling certain popular demands , with plenteous knowledge and verbal smartness , is profoundly sophisticated , insane , and its very joy is morbid . It needs retain the knowledge , and fulfil the demands , but needs to purge itself ; or rather needs to be born again , become unsophisticated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the spirit of Nature , and to know and obey the standards . I say the question of Nature , largely considered , involves the questions of the esthetic , the emotional , and the religious  --  and involves happiness . A fitly born and bred race , growing up in right conditions of out-door as much as in-door harmony , activity , and development , would probably , from and in those conditions , find it enough merely to live  --  and would , in their relations to the sky , air , water , trees , &c.,; and to the countless common shows , and in the fact of Life itself , discover and achieve happiness  --  with Being suffused night and day by wholesome extasy , surpassing all the pleasures that wealth , amusement , and even gratified intellect , erudition , or the sense of art , can give . In the prophetic literature of These States , Nature , true Nature , and the true idea of Nature , long absent , must , above all , become fully restored , enlarged , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of all high literary and esthetic compositions . I do not mean the smooth walks , trimm 'd hedges , butterflies , poseys and nightingales of the English poets , but the whole Orb , with its geologic history , the Kosmos , carrying fire and snow , that rolls through the illimitable areas , light as a feather , though weighing billions of tons . Furthermore , as by what we now partially call Nature is intended , at most , only what is entertainable by the physical conscience , the lessons of the esthetic , the sense of matter , and of good animal health  --  on these it must be distinctly accumulated , incorporated , that man , comprehending these , has , in towering super- addition , the Moral and Spiritual Consciences , indicating his destination beyond the ostensible , the mortal . To the heights of such estimate of Nature indeed ascending , we proceed to make observations for our Vistas , breathing rarest air . What is , I believe called Idealism seems to me to suggest , ( guarding against extravagance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inquiry and desert of favor for our New World metaphysics , their foundation of and in literature , giving hue to all . Footnote : 4Kb The elevating and etherealizing ideas of the Unknown and of Unreality must be brought forward with authority , as they are the legitimate heirs of the known , and of reality , and at least as great as their parents . Fearless of scoffing , and of the ostent , let us take our stand , our ground , and never desert it , to confront the growing excess and arrogance of Realism . To the cry , now victorious  --  the cry of Sense , science , flesh , incomes , farms , merchandise , logic , intellect , demonstrations , solid perpetuities , buildings of brick and iron , or even the facts of the shows of trees , earth , rocks , &c.,; fear not my brethren , my sisters , to sound out with equally determined voice , that conviction brooding within the recesses of every envisioned soul  --  Illusions ! apparitions ! figments all ! True , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the indispensability of its meanings ; but how clearly we see that , migrate in soul to what we can already conceive of superior and spiritual points of view , and , palpable as it seems under present relations , it all and several might , nay certainly would , fall apart and vanish .  --  I hail with joy the oceanic , variegated , intense practical energy , the demand for facts , even the business materialism of the current age , Our States . But wo to the age or land in which these things , movements , stopping at themselves , do not tend to ideas . As fuel to flame , and flame to the heavens , so must wealth , science , materialism , unerringly feed the highest mind , the soul . Infinitude the flight : fathomless the mystery . Man , so diminutive , dilates beyond the sensible universe , competes with , outcopes Space and Time , meditating even one great idea . Thus and thus only , does a human being , his spirit , ascend above , and justify , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incredibly and divinely serviceable , indispensable , real , here . And as the purport of objective Nature is doubtless folded , hidden , somewhere here  --  As somewhero here is what this globe and its manifold forms , and the light of day , and night 's darkness , and life itself , with all its experiences , are for  --  it is here the great Literature , especially verse , must get its inspiration and throbbing blood . Then may we attain to a poetry worthy the immortal soul of man , and which while absorbing materials , and , in their own sense , the shows of Nature , will , above all , have , both directly and indirectly , a freeing , fluidizing , expanding , religious character , exulting with science , fructifying the moral elements , and stimulating aspirations , and meditations on the unknown . The process , so far , is indirect and peculiar , and though it may be suggested , can not be defined . Observing , rapport , and with intuition , the shows and forms presented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women , the actual play of passions , in history and life  --  and , above all , from those developments either in Nature or human personality in which power , ( dearest of all to the sense of the artist , ) transacts itself  --  Out of these , and seizing what is in them , the poet , the esthetic worker in any field , by the divine magic of his genius , projects them , their analogies , by curious removes , indirections , in Literature and Art . ( No useless attempt to repeat the material creation , by daguerreotyping the exact likeness by mortal mental means . ) This is the image-making faculty , coping with material creation , and rivaling , almost triumphing over it . This alone , when all the other parts of a specimen of literature or art are ready and waiting , can breathe into it the breath of life , and endow it with Identity . " The true question to ask , " says the Librarian of Congress in a paper read before the Social Science Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true question to ask respecting a book , is , Has it helped any human Soul ? " This is the hint , statement , not only of the great Literatus , his book , but of every great Artist . It may be that all works of art are to be first tried by their art qualities , their image-forming talent , and their dramatic , pictorial , plot-constructing , euphonious and other talents . Then , whenever claiming to be first-class works , they are to be strictly and sternly tried by their foundation in , and radiation , in the highest sense , and always indirectly , of the ethic principles , and eligibility to free , arouse , dilate . As within the purposes of the Kosmos , and vivifying all meteorology , and all the congeries of the mineral , vegetable and animal worlds  --  all the physical growth and development of man , and all the history of the race in politics , religions , wars , &c.,; there is a moral purpose , a visible or invisible intention , certainly underlying all  --  its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needing intuition , faith , idiosyncrasy , to its realization , which many , and especially the intellectual , do not have  --  so in the product , or congeries of the product , of the greatest Literatus . This is the last , profoundest measure and test of a first-class literary or esthetic achievement , and when understood and put in force must fain , I say , lead to works , books , nobler than any hitherto known . Lo ! Nature , ( the only complete , actual poem , ) existing calmly in the divine scheme , containing all , content , careless of the criticisms of a day , or these endless and wordy chatterers . And lo ! to the consciousness of the soul , the permanent Identity , the thought , the something , before which the magnitude even of Democracy , Art , Literature , &c.,; dwindles , becomes partial , measurable  --  something that fully satisfies , ( which those do not . ) That something is the All , and the idea of All , with the accompanying idea of Eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indestructible , sailing space forever , visiting every region , as a ship the sea . And again lo ! the pulsations in all matter , all spirit , throbbing forever  --  the eternal beats , eternal systole and diastole of life in things  --  where- from I feel and know that death is not the ending , as was thought , but rather the real beginning  --  and that nothing ever is or can be lost , nor ever die , nor soul , nor matter .  --  I say in the future of These States must therefore arise Poets immenser far , and make great poems of Death . The poems of Life are great , but there must be the poems of the purports of life , not only in itself , but beyond itself . I have eulogized Homer , the sacred bards of Jewry , Eschylus , Juvenal , Shakespeare , &c.,; and acknowledged their inestimable value . But , ( with perhaps the exception , in some , not all respects , of the second mentioned , ) I say there must , for future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say so ? ) of higher class even than any of those  --  poets not only possessed of the religious fire and abandon of Isaiah , luxuriant in the epic talent of Homer , or for characters as Shakespeare , but consistent with the Hegelian formulas , and consistent with modern science . America needs , and the world needs , a class of bards who will , now and ever , so link and tally the rational physical being of man , with the ensembles of Time and Space , and with this vast and multiform show , Nature , surrounding him , ever tantalizing him , equally a part , and yet not a part of him , as to essentially harmonize , satisfy , and put at rest . Faith , very old , now scared away by science , must be restored , brought back , by the same power that caused her departure  --  restored with new sway , deeper , wider , higher than ever . Surely , this universal ennui , this coward fear , this shuddering at death , these low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervading future society , as it has the past , and does the present . What the Roman Lucretius sought most nobly , yet all too blindly , negatively to do for his age and its successors , must be done positively by some great coming Literatus , especially Poet , who , while remaining fully poet , will absorb whatever science indicates , with spiritualism , and out of them , and out of his own genius , will compose the great Poem of Death . Then will man indeed confront Nature , and confront Time and Space , both with science and con amore , and take his right place , prepared for life , master of fortune and misfortune . And then that which was long wanted will be supplied , and the ship that had it not before in all her voyages , will have an anchor . There are still other standards , suggestions , for products of high literatuses . That which really balances and conserves the social and political world is not so much legislation , police , treaties , and dread of punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of fairness , manliness , decorum , &c.; Indeed , the perennial regulation , control and oversight , by self-suppliance , is sine qua non to Democracy ; and a highest , widest aim of Democratic literature may well be to bring forth , cultivate , brace and strengthen this sense in individuals and society . A strong mastership of the general inferior self by the superior self , is to be aided , secured , indirectly but surely , by the literatus , in his works , shaping , for individual or aggregate Democracy , a great passionate Body , in and along with which goes a great masterful Spirit . And still , providing for contingencies , I fain confront the fact , the need of powerful native philosophs and orators and bards , These States , as rallying points to come , in times of danger , and to fend off ruin and defection .

Who now is ready to begin that work for America , of composing music fit for us  --  songs , choruses , symphonies , operas , oratorios , fully identified with the body and soul of The States ? music complete in all its appointments , but in some fresh , courageous , melodious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanently satisfy us must be . The composers to make such music are to learn everything that can be possibly learned in the schools and traditions of their art , and then calmly dismiss all traditions from them . Also , a great breed of orators will one day spread over The United States , and be continued . Blessed are the people where , ( the nation 's Unity and Identity preserved at all hazards , ) strong emergencies , throes , occur . Strong emergencies will continually occur in America , and will be provided for . Such orators are wanted as have never yet been heard upon the earth . What specimen have we had where even the physical capacities of the voice have been fully accomplished ? I think there would be in the human voice , thoroughly practised and brought out , more seductive pathos than in any organ or any orchestra of stringed instruments , and a ring more impressive than that of artillery . Also , in a few years , there will be , in the cities of These States , immense Museums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all the places and peoples of the earth , old and new . In these halls , in the presence of these illustrations , the noblest savans will deliver lectures to thousands of young men and women , on history , natural history , the sciences , &c.; History itself will get released from being that false and distant thing , that fetish it has been . It will become a friend , a venerable teacher , a live being , with hands , voice , presence . It will be disgraceful to a young person not to know chronology , geography , poems , heroes , deeds , and all the former nations , and present ones also  --  and it will be disgraceful in a teacher to teach any less or more than he believes .  --  We see , fore-indicated , amid these prospects and hopes , new law-forces of spoken and written language  --  not merely the pedagogue-forms , correct , regular , familiar with precedents , made for matters of outside propriety , fine words , thoughts definitely told out  --  but a language fanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares mostly for impetus and effects , and for what it plants and invigorates to grow  --  tallies life and character , and seldomer tells a thing than suggests or necessitates it . In fact , a new theory of literary composition for imaginative works of the very first class , and especially for highest poems , is the sole course open to These States . Books are to be called for , and supplied , on the assumption that the process of reading is not a half-sleep , but , in highest sense , an exercise , a gymnast 's struggle ; that the reader is to do something for himself , must be on the alert , must himself or herself construct indeed the poem , argument , history , metaphysical essay  --  the text furnishing the hints , the clue , the start or framework . Not the book needs so much to be the complete thing , but the reader of the book does . That were to make a nation of supple and athletic minds , welltrained , intuitive , used to depend on themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investigating here , we see , not that it is a little thing we have , in having the bequeathed libraries , countless shelves of volumes , records , &c.; yet how serious the danger , depending entirely on them , of the bloodless vein , the nerveless arm , the false application , at second or third hand . After all , we see Life , not bred , ( at least in its more modern and essential parts , ) in those great old Libraries , nor America nor Democracy favored nor applauded there . We see that the real interest of this People of ours in the Theology , History , Poetry , Politics , and Personal Models of the past , ( of British islands , for instance , and indeed all the past , ) is not necessarily to mould ourselves or our literature upon them , but to attain fuller , more definite comparisons , warnings , and the insight to ourselves , our own present , and our own far grander , different ; future history , Religion , social customs , &c.;  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sung , or stated , of old , with reference to humanity under the Feudal and Oriental institutes , religions , and for other lands , needs to be re-written , re-sung , re-stated , in terms consistent with the institution of These States , and to come in range and obedient uniformity with them . We see , as in the universes of the material Kosmos , after meteorological , vegetable , and animal cycles , man at last arises , born through them , to prove them , concentrate them , to turn upon them with wonder and love  --  to command them , adorn them , and carry them upward into superior realms  --  so out of the series of the preceding social and political universes , now arise These States  --  their main purport being not in the newness and importance of their politics or inventions , but in new , grander , more advanced Religions , Literatures , and Art . We see that while many were supposing things established and completed , really the grandest things always remain ; and discover that the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun . We see our land , America , her Literature , Esthetics , &c.,; as , substantially , the getting in form , or effusement and statement , of deepest basic elements and loftiest final meanings , of History and Man  --  and the portrayal , ( under the eternal laws and conditions of beauty , ) of our own physiognomy , the subjective tie and expression of the objective , as from our own combination , continuation and points of view  --  and the deposit and record of the national mentality , character , appeals , heroism , wars , and even liberties  --  where these , and all , culminate in native formulation , to be perpetuated ;  --  and not having which native , first-class formulation , she will flounder about , and her other , however imposing , eminent greatness , prove merely a passing gleam ; but truly having which , she will understand herself , live nobly , nobly , contribute , emanate , and , swinging , poised safely on herself , illumined and illuming , become a fullformed world , and divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceaseless succession through Time . Finally , we have to admit , we see , even to-day , and in all these things , the born Democratic taste and will of The United States , regardless of precedent , or of any authority but their own , beginning to arrive , seeking place  --  which , in due time , they will fully occupy . At first , of course , under current prevalences of theology , conventions , criticism , &c.,; all appears impracticable  --  takes chances to be denied and misunderstood . Therewith , of course , murmurers , puzzled persons , supercilious inquirers , ( with a mighty stir and noise among these windy little gentlemen that swarm in literature , in the magazines . ) But America , advancing steadily , evil as well as good , penetrating deep , without one thought of retraction , ascending , expanding , keeps her course , hundreds , thousands of years . GENERAL NOTES . " Society . "  --  I have myself little or no hope from what is technically called " Society " in our American cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sharply , still promises something , in time , out of its tremendous and varied materials , with a certain superiority of intuitions , and the advantage of constant agitation , and ever new and rapid dealings of the cards . Of Boston , with its circles of social mummies , swathed in cerements harder than brass  --  its bloodless religion , ( Unitarianism , ) its complacent vanity of scientism and literature , lots of grammatical correctness , mere knowledge , ( always wearisome , in itself )  --  its zealous abstractions , ghosts of reforms  --  I should say , ( ever admitting its business powers , its sharp , almost demoniac , intellect , and no lack , in its own way , of courage and generosity )  --  there is , at present , little of cheering , satisfying sign . In the West , California , &c.,; " society " is yet unformed , peurile , seemingly unconscious of anything above a driving business , or to liberally spend the money made by it in the usual rounds and shows . Then there is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the models of foreign courts and saloons , quite a comic side  --  particularly visible at Washington City ,  --  a sort of high life below stairs business . As if any farce could be funnier , for instance , than the scenes of the crowds , winter nights , meandering around our Presidents and their wives , Cabinet officers , western or other Senators , Representatives , &c.; born of good laboring , mechanic , or farmer stock and antecedents , attempting those full-dress receptions , finesse of parlors , foreign ceremonies , etiquettes , &c.; Indeed , considered with any sense of propriety , or any sense at all , the whole of this illy-played fashionable play and display , with their absorption of the best part of our wealthier citizens ' time , money , energies , &c.,; is ridiculously out of place in the United States . As if our proper man and woman , ( far , far greater words than " gentleman " and " lady , " ) could still fail to see , and presently achieve , not this spectral business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American  --  by modes , perfections of character , manners , costumes , social relations , &c.,; adjusted to standards , far , far different from those !  --  Eminent and liberal foreigners , British or continental , must at times have their faith fearfully tried by what they see of our New World personalities . The shallowest and least American persons seem surest to push abroad and call without fail on well- known foreigners , who are doubtless affected with indescribable qualms by these queer ones . Then , more than half of our authors and writers evidently think it a great thing to be " aristocratic , " and sneer at progress , democracy , revolution , &c.; If some international literary Snobs ' Gallery were established , it is certain that American could contribute at least her full share of the portraits , and some very distinguished ones . Observe that the most impudent slanders , low insults , &c.,; on the great revolutionary authors , leaders , poets , &c.,; of Europe , have their origin and main circulation in certain circles here . The treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both deserving so well of America ; and both persistently attempted to be soiled here by unclean birds , male and female .  --  Meanwhile , I must still offset the like of the foregoing , and all it infers , by the recognition of the fact , that while the surfaces of current society here show so much that is dismal , noisome and vapory , there are , beyond question , inexhaustible supplies , as of true gold ore , in the mines of America 's general humanity . Let us , not ignoring the dross , give fit stress to these precious , immortal values also . Let it be distinctly admitted , that  --  whatever may be said of our fashionable society , and of any foul fractions and episodes  --  only here in America , out of the long history , and manifold presentations of the ages , has at last arisen , and now stands , what never before took positive form and sway , The People  --  and that , viewed en-masse , and while fully acknowledging deficiencies , dangers , faults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to majority , nor to its own religious , literary or esthetic expression , yet affords , to-day , an exultant justification of all the faith , all the hopes and prayers and prophecies of good men through the past  --  the stablest , solidest-based government of the world  --  the most assured in a future  --  the beaming Pharos to whose perennial light all earnest eyes , the world over , are tending  --  And that already , in and from it , the Democratic principle ; having been mortally tried by severest tests , fatalities , of war and peace , now issues from the trial , unharmed , trebly-invigorated , perhaps to commence forthwith its finally triumphant march around the globe . British Literature .  --  To avoid mistake , I would say that I not only commend the study of this literature , but wish our sources of supply and comparison vastly enlarged . American students may well derive from all former lands  --  from forenoon Greece and Rome , down to the perturbed medieval times , the Crusades , and so to Italy , the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer ones  --  from witty and warlike France , and markedly , and in many ways , and at many different periods , from the enterprise and soul of the great Spanish race  --  bearing ourselves always courteous , always deferential , indebted beyond measure to the mother-world , to all its nations dead , as all its nations living  --  the offspring , this America of ours , the Daughter , not by any means of the British isles exclusively , but of the Continent , and all continents . Indeed , it is time we should realize and fully fructify those germs we also hold from Italy , France , Spain , especially in the best imaginative productions of those lands , which are , in many ways , loftier and subtler than the English , or British , and indispensable to complete our service , proportions , education , reminiscences , &c.; ...  --  The British element These States hold , and have always held , enormously beyond its fit proportions . I have already spoken of Shakespeare . He seems to me of astral genius , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially to the literature of the passions , are immense , forever dear to humanity  --  and his name is always to be reverenced in America . But there is much in him that is offensive to Democracy . He is not only the tally of Feudalism , but I should say Shakespeare is incarnated , uncompromising Feudalism , in literature . Then one seems to detect something in him  --  I hardly know how to describe it  --  even amid the dazzle of his genius ; and , in inferior manifestations , it is found in nearly all leading British authors . ( Perhaps we will have to import the words Snob , Snobbish , &c.,; after all . ) While of the great poems of Asian antiquity , the Indian epics , the Book of Job , the Ionian Iliad , the unsurpassedly simple , loving , perfect idyls of the life and death of Christ , in the New Testament , ( indeed Homer and the Biblical utterances intertwine familiarly with us , in the main , ) and along down , of most of the characteristic imaginative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cervantes Don Quixote , &c.,; I should say they substantially adjust themselves to us , and , far off as they are , accord curiously with our bed and board , today , in 1870 , in Brooklyn , Washington , Canada , Ohio , Texas , California  --  and with our notions , both of seriousness and of fun , and our standards of heroism , manliness , and even the Democratic requirements  --  those requirements are not only not fulfilled in the Shakesperean productions , but are insulted on every page . I add that  --  while England is among the greatest of lands in political freedom , or the idea of it , and in stalwart personal character , &c.;  --  the spirit of English literature is not great , at least is not greatest  --  and its products are no models for us . With the exception of Shakespeare , there is no first-class genius , or approaching to first-class , in that literature  --  which , with a truly vast amount of value , and of artificial beauty , ( largely from the classics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  almost always congests , makes plethoric , not frees , expands , dilates  --  is cold , anti-Democratic , loves to be sluggish and stately , and shows much of that characteristic of vulgar persons , the dread of saying or doing something not at all improper in itself , but unconventional , and that may be laughed at . In its best , the sombre pervades it ;  --  it is moody , melancholy , and , to give it its due , expresses , In characters and plots , those qualities , in an unrivaled manner . Yet not as the black thunderstorms , and in great normal , crashing passions , as of the Greek dramatists  --  clearing the air , refreshing afterward , bracing with power ; but as in Hamlet , moping , sick , uncertain , and leaving ever after a secret taste for the blues , the morbid fascination , the luxury of wo ... ( I can not dismiss English , or British imaginative literature without the cheerful name of Walter Scott . In my opinion he deserves to stand next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality , continental , not British  --  both teeming , luxuriant , true to their lands and origin , namely feudality , yet ascending into universalism . Then , I should say , both deserve to be finally considered and construed as shining suns , whom it were ungracious to pick spots upon . ) I strongly recommend all the young men and young women of the United States to whom it may be eligible , to overhaul the well-freighted fleets , the literatures of Italy , Spain , France , Germany , so full of those elements of freedom , self-possession , gayheartedness , subtlety , dilation , needed in preparations for the future of The States . I only wish we could have really good translations . I rejoice at the feeling for Oriental researches and poetry , and hope it will go on . The Late War .  --  The Secession War in the United States appears to me as the last great material and military outcropping of the Feudal spirit , in our New World history , society , &c.; Though it was not certain , hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by breaking up the Union , should be successful , it was urged on by indomitable passion , pride and will . The signal downfall of this effort , the abolition of Slavery , and , the extirpation of the Slaveholding Class , ( cut out and thrown away like a tumor by surgical operation , ) makes incomparably the longest advance for Radical Democracy , utterly removing its only really dangerous impediment , and insuring its progress in the United States  --  and thence , of course , over the world ... ( Our immediate years witness the solution of three vast , life-threatening calculi , in different parts of the world  --  the removal of serfdom in Russia , slavery in the United States , and of the meanest of Imperialisms in France . ) Of the Secession War itself , we know , in the ostent , what has been done . The numbers of the dead and wounded can be told , or approximated , the debt posted and put on record , the material events narrated , &c.; Meantime , the war being over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle , issue their platforms , &c.,; just the same as before . But immensest results of the War  --  not only in Politics , but in Literature , Poems , and Sociology  --  are doubtless waiting yet unformed , in the future . How long they will wait I can not tell . The pageant of History 's retrospect shows us , ages since , all Europe marching on the Crusades , those wondrous armed uprisings of the People , stirred by a mere idea , to grandest attempt  --  and , when once baffled in it , returning , at intervals , twice , thrice , and again . An unsurpassed series of revolutionary events , influences . Yet it took over two hundred years for the seeds of the Crusades to germinate before beginning even to sprout . Two hundred years they lay , sleeping , not dead , but dormant in the ground . Then , out of them , uncrringly , arts , travel , navigation , politics , literature , freedom , inventions , the spirit of adventure ; inquiry , all arose , grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . Far back there , that huge agitation-struggle of the Crusades , stands , as undoubtedly the embryo , the start , of the high preminence of experiment , civilization and enterprise which the European nations have since sustained , and of which These States are the heirs . General Suffrage , Elections , &c.;  --  It still remains doubtful to me whether these will ever secure , officially , the best wit and capacity  --  whether , through them , the first-class genius of America will ever personally appear in the high political stations , the Presidency , Congress , the leading State offices , &c.; Those offices , or the candidacy for them , arranged , won , by caucusing , money , the favoritism or pecuniary interest of rings , the superior manipulation of the ins over the outs , or the outs over the ins , are , indeed , at best , the mere business agencies of the people , are useful as formulating , neither the best and highest , but the average of the public judgment , sense , justice , ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We elect Presidents , Congressmen , &c.,; not so much to have them consider and decide for us , but as surest practical means of expressing the will of majorities on mooted questions , measures , &c.; As to general suffrage , after all , since we have gone so far , the more general it is , the better . I favor the widest opening of the doors . Let the ventilation and area be wide enough , and all is safe . We can never have a born penitentiary-bird , or panel-thief , or lowest gambling-hell or groggery keeper , for President  --  though such may not only emulate , but get , high offices from localities  --  even from the proud and wealthy city of New York . State Rights .  --  Freedom , ( under the universal laws , ) and the fair and uncramped play of Individuality , can only be had at all through strong-knit cohesion , identity . There are , who , talking of the rights of The States , as in separatism and independence , condemn a rigid nationality , centrality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence at all , of The States , pre-necessitates such a Nationality , an imperial Union . Thus , it is to serve separatism that we favor generalization , consolidation . It is to give , under the compaction of potent general law , an independent vitality and sway within their spheres , to The States singly , ( really just as important a part of our scheme as the sacred Union itself , ) that we insist on the preservation of our Nationality forever , and at all hazards . I say neither States , nor any thing like State Rights , could permanently exist on any other terms . Latest from Europe .  --  As I send my last pages to press , ( Sept. 19 , 1870 , ) the ocean-cable , continuing its daily budget of Franco-German war-news  --  Louis Napoleon a prisoner , ( his ratcunning at an end )  --  the conquerors advanced on Paris  --  the French , assuming Republican forms  --  seeking to negotiate with the King of Prussia , at the head of his armies  --  " his Majesty , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , with a government risen out of Democracy . " Let us note the words , and not forget them . The official relations of Our States , we know , are with the reigning kings , queens , &c.,; of the Old World . But the only deep , vast , emotional , real affinity of America is with the cause of Popular Government there  --  and especially in France . O that I could express , in my printed lines , the passionate yearnings , the pulses of sympathy , forever throbbing in the heart of These States , for sake of that  --  the eager eyes forever turned to that  --  watching it , struggling , appearing and disappearing , often apparently gone under , yet never to be abandoned , in France , Italy , Spain , Germany , and in the British Islands .
