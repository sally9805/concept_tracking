Hayne , Paul Hamilton , 1830-1886 : THE WHY OF A BLUSH . from The why of a blush ( 1878 ) 1 Two maples by the cottage porch 2 Grew crimson in the sunset light ; 3 Was it their leaves ' reflected glow 4 Which made her perfect face so bright ? 5 I led her gently down the steps , 6 And down the pathway 's flickering shade , 7 But still o'er tender cheek and brow 8 The same deep radiance warmly play'd. 9 " Enough , O Sweet ! " I whisper 'd low ; 10 " That heart is mine I yearn 'd to win : 11 No sunset flush , but love 's pure dawn , 12 Breaks from the kindled soul within ! "
