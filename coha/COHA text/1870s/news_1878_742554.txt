txt The composition of the present Assembly is so peculiar that no discriminating observer is surprised to find that its acts are , and are likely to be , as odu as its composition . It is a house quite up to the average in ability  --  indeed somewhat above it , and in the opinion of many is a stronger body than the new Senate , but the number of new members in it is unusually large . They are very evenly distributed through both parties , . ani there are a few Independents , who are all new members . The House seems laudably desirous to cut down its expendithres , to be economical in all things , and to sweep away some small but long-standing and peculiarly unblushing abuses . Yet there has not been an Assembly since 1872 which appeared to be so completely under the control of the notorious gang of lobbyists who make their head-quarters at the Delavan , and concoct their " strikes " there . There is not a New-York man among them . They come from the central and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are residents of Albany . They are all veterans in their profession ; they know the vulnerable spots in our State corporations at which to strike ; they know which of them can be most easily bled , and which of them bleeds most freely ; they are perpetually on the watch to find newpl a ces which a judiciously aimed resolution , or the timely introduction of a bill , will cause to bleed . From the gang of Edwardses , Phelpses , Wileys . Wards , Van Valhenbergs , Van Vechtens , and others of less note , come the resolutions which appear in the House making this , that , and the other inquiry into the affairs of State corporations . The famous Barber , of Utica , is not to be classed with these small sharks . He does not condescend , as a general rule . to small things , but comes down on special service . and when something big is to be done . The mennamed compose the school of inferior sharks who perpetually crubta around the Legislature , and pick up anything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the latter does not come very often , especially in these times . Last session they grew lean from starvation . There certainly were not half a dozen bills with any money in them which they were permitted to handle . This session . they seem to be making a raid upon the House with the eagerness of starved wolves , and , so far , they have been successful , mainly , it may be said , owing to the ignorance of the new members . It matters little or nothing that the Assembly votes in good faith for these " striking " resolutions . The lobby men will make money out of them , either on pretence ? of buying votes enough to purchase a committee , or if this pretence is taken from , them , then of buying votes to beat inquiry or prevent the passage of a bill on the floor of the House . The resolution which Mr. Fitzgerald offered in the Assembly on Monday evening . last he doubtless offered in good faith ; but there was no one acquainted with Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old lobby acquaintance . Such persons might have suspected at the time that it was a " feeler " thrown out to try the temper of the House , and would be followed by another resolution more specific in its inquiries . Such a one appeared this morning , offered by an Albany member , and , strange to say , it passed the House as soon as offered without the yeas and nays being called upon it , or even a standing vote being taken . It , too , is an ' old acquaintance , and was last session offered by- a Brooklyn member , who never moved it afterward . The resolution , after a long preamble alleging abuses , is as follows : Resolved , That the said Hudson River Bridge Company at Albany be and is hereby directed to report to this Legislature , within 10 days , the amount of tolls received by said bridge company since their lest report to the Canal Board , which ( sic ) statements to be verified under oath by the President and secretary of said company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocketing a larger amount of profit than their charter permits them to do , the pockets of the lobbyists will be well lined before the matter referred to in the resolution is finally disposed cf. Whether the public will be the better off is quite another matter . A crowd of bills were introduced this morning . Mr. Gilbert , of Franklin , put in one which briefly and emphatically forbids , under severe penalties , the sale or manufacture of intoxicating liquor by any but licensed druggists ; they are not to sell it as a beverage , but for medicinal purposes , and all sales are to be entered in a book , with the name of the purchaser . Dr. Hayes put in two bills , striking at Tammany Hall ; one repeals the act of 1805 , incorporating the Columbian Society , and the other repeals the act of 1867 , empowering that society to hold real estate . This is not the first time that both bills have been introduced into the Legislature . Mr. , of the Eighteenth City District , put in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuisances outside of the city limits , upon the order of a Judge of the Supreme Court . This bill is aimed at the Hunter 's Point nuisances ; and similar bills have been here before . Mr. Willers , of Seneca , introduced a bill relating to elections , which is sure to cause warm dispute . It provides chat the State and County tickets shall he printed as separate ballots , and deposited in different boxes . It is hard to say which party in the State would gain most by- this change . Mr. James Daly introduced a bill providing that arrears of taxes in New-York may at any time be paid , with interest , calculated from the . time they became due , at 8 ' per cent . The present law provides for 12 per cent . Senator Morrissey obtained the passage of a bill which gave a similar indulgence to property-owners in arrears for one year . That period has now expired , and Mr. Daly seeks to make the reduction permanent . Mr. Daly also offered the following concurrent resolution : Resolved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and hereby is authorized to appoint a commission , of not more than three persons , to consider the subject of the present system of taxation of real and personal property in the City of Now-York , and to report ( within one month afterthoir appointment ) to the present Legislature what changes , if any , are desirable therein . Mr. Meade , of Schenectady , offered a short resolution , preceded by an enormously long preamble , which recited the history of the railroad strikes , instructing the Judiciary Committee to inquire if additional legislation was needed to prevent such things in the future . Mr. Gilbert , Chairman of the Judiciary Committee , rose to debate it , and it went over ; but the House adopted without dissent a resolution offered by Mr. Beard , the Labor Reformer , requesting the Committee on Expenditures of the House " to ascertain the number of useless attendants in this House , and report the same within 10 days .
