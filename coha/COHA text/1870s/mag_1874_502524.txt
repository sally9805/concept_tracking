txt @ // - SOME attention seems to have been attracted this year to the fact that Christmas has passed away rather more quietly than it was formerly in the habit of passing away . We have been reminded less this year than formerly of our fraternal relations with the rest of mankind , of our unselfish devotion to one another 's interests , and of the year 's marking one more milestone passed in the millennial race . Not , indeed , that this indifference to the traditions of the season has reached the point of hostility , as might be inferred is the case in England , where we noticed a year or two ago an article on the approaching feast , beginning " Now is come the gloomiest season of all the year . " It is not hostility to Christmas so much as indifference that we notice in this country ; and without going into the matter very deeply , there are one or two superficial reasons for the fact , which certainly may explain it in some measure . In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years become a national instead of ' a local holiday . It may be declared without fear of contradiction that if Thanksgiving day is to be , as heretofore , the last Thursday in November , and Christmas to come , as usual , on the 25th of December , one or other holiday will go to the wall ; for bpth are days of religious festival , both are days of family reunion ( it is for this reason that in the English review to which we just alluded , Christmas was called the gloomiest season of the year ) ; besides this , they both occur in a country of magnificent distances . It is impossible to imagine that the American people will go on in secula seculorum keeping up two rather formal and half-solemn holidays , which each requires a great deal of travelling to be done , within a month of each other . One or the other must give way , and if , as we have been doing for the last few years , we continue to give more and more prominence to Thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominence to Christmas . We have , of course , no desire to raise our voice against either . The great want of the American people is not fewer , but more holidays ; and if there could be a fhmily reunion and Christmas dinner every month in the year , for every citizen of the United States , we should none of us be the worse for it . But there are natural limits to holidays of a certain kind . With regard to New Year 's day there is no difficulty of any kind . The holiday is local ; and the oh . servances being merely social , there is none of that solemnity which makes the proximity of Christmas to Thanksgiving out of place . However , we may as well congratulate ourselves-those of us who live in New York-that the atmosphere of this part of the country is a hospitable one as regards foreign customs , and that all the holidays which can by possibility be made part of the life of the city will be adopted . It is not so very long since New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three we have mentioned ; and we may almost say that not only Thanksgiving but Christmas itself is , in New York , an adopted rather than a natural holiday-if any one can distinguish in New York between what is natural and what is unnatural . - AMONG the many observances which annually recur at the holiday season , is that of compiling the necrological record of the year that is gone  --  a task which we are glad to say is no part of the recognized duty of the editors of magazines . It must have struck many persons within the last few years that the number of distinguished persons who died in a year was increasing at an alarming rate , and we certainly do not remember any year which has been so prolific in this way as the year 1873 . No one , we believe , has endeavored to trace this curious fact to its true cause , and yet it certainly is a fact which deserves serious attention . If it is true that with each succeeding year we are losing a larger and larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and distinguished physicians , divines , journalists , and statesmen , it would be well to consider the danger we are in of death so thinning the // ranks of the distinguished , that we shall have but a mediocre company left alive . But we are inclined to think that there is no real danger , and on the contrary that there are now living in the world a larger number of eminent lawyers , divines , politicians , artists , actors , authors , contractors , financiers , journalists , iaventors , bibliopolists , scientists , operators , speculators  --  to say nothing of kings , queens , emperors , ex-kings , ex-qucens , and ex-emperors , or of pretending kings , queens , emperors-than it ever possessed before ; and if the enterprising gentlemen who compile the necrolo*y of the year were not only to give us the names of the eminent dead , but of the eminent and distinguished survivors , confining themselves even to those who may be shortly expected to decease , we should have a list which in length at least would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact the number of distinguished and eminent men living and dying is perpetually on the increase , and we do not despair of seeing the time when the present annual record shall seem ridiculously diminutive . This startling and interesting tendency of our times is to be explained ( to compare great things with small ) in the same way that the feasibility of minority representation is explained by Mr. Hare in his work on electoral reform-by the great increase of intercommunication among the people of distant parts of the world , brought about by the railroad , the tele*raph , and the press . It is very clear that if there was no communication between one country and another , the distinguished inca who succeeded in getting their names-if we may express it so-inserted in the necrological record of each country , would be confined to the number of the natives . Besides this , even with the steam and the telegraph , necrology would be very local still if it were not for a growing familiarity of the natives of each country with the languages of others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession , to which it will not do to allow distant and small places to make exclusive claim . When Rachel died , for instance , it was difficult to say what civilized country considered the loss a foreign one . But necrology had hardly begun in Rachel 's time , and the list of distinguished actors which will appear at the end of this year of grace 1874 will probably be one which would have made Rachel 's contemporaries hide their heads in shame . The growth of necrology is one more illustration of the power of the press . Eminence and distinction , which formerly meant success in life of a rather public kind , now means continual mention in the newspapers ; and as persons who are continuolly mentioned in the newspapers may receive notice for their crimes and failures as well as for their virtues or success , there is now and then a slight confusion in the necrological mind between what is notorious and what is distinguished . There is also the professional desire of the earnest necrologist to include all possible names , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals  --  a fact which leads him to include in it names which are known to be those of eminent and distinguished men only to himself and to a few of his personal friends . From all these causes , and many more besides , the list goes on increasing ; and it is in no cavilling spirit that we call attention to this fact . There are many persons now living who believe themselves unjustly classed by a cold world among the mediocrities of the day , who will welcome any well-directed effort towards elevating from the rank of mediocrity into that of eminence and distinction an oppressed class . - IT is a pleasing proof of the universality of moral ideas that dramatic authors should resent , in general , no charge so much as that their plays have an immoral tendency or are indecent . Drumatic authors certainly have a much keener sensitiveness on the subject than the audiences they write for ; a fact which is perhaps the result of a more general sensitiveness to blame of any kind , or perhaps of some deeper feeeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause , there can be little doubt of the fact itself ; and as an illustration of it we could hardly have a better instance than an action of libel brought against an En*lish newspaper by the author of some well-known plays , which have been much acted both in London and New York . The newspaper in question had published a letter setting forth that in the opinion of the writer one of these plays , known // as the " Wicked World , " was hardly decent , or using words to that effect , givin the public to understand that in his opinion the play was not fit to be represented . Mr. Gilbert , the author of the play , and alsoauthor , we believe , of the " Bab " ballads , a collection of verses which he gave the public to understand were humorous , and which were certainly ridiculous , immediately brought an action . The plaintiff undertook to prove two very serious things : first , that the charge of immorality was false ; and second , that it was actuated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great part of the play was read to the jury ; or , to be more accurate , a great part of the play was read to the jury in order to disprove the first ; and as for the second , the plaintiff introduced evidence to show a systematic persecution of him on the part of the defendant , which went to such a length that in any criticisms of his plays which were of an unfavorable character the defendant was in the habit of mentioning him by name , while in the case of a favorable criticism his name had been always suppressed . The defendant of course gained the suit , and there was nothing in it of a very interesting nature , except , if we may say so , the suit itself . It is no doubt sound law and hood morals , that a newspaper may in the spirit of fair criticism denounce a play which it thinks contra bonos mores . But then what is contra bonos mores ? Is there any rule , any dividing line , by which we can mark off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If , for instance , the Wicked World " is a play of a corrupting sort , what is tobe said of *ie " Merry Wives of Windsor " or of " The School for Scandal " ? - two plays of a very different sort , certainly , but neither of them likely to stimulate the audience to deeds of selfsacrifice or heroism . If the true function of the stage is to elevate and purify , certainly there are a great many English plays which have long held the stage . to siy nothing of plays taken from the French , which should be interdicted . But , probably , the truth of the matter is that the stage regarded as a purifier and elevator is rather a myth than a reality . When we take into account not merely the multitude of plays which do very little for the advancement of the race , but of the very slight assistance the traditions of histrionic life give to private morals , we cnnnot help feeling that the drama itself , without any discrimination as to separate plays , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community which was deprived of it . In truth , the stage is merely a representation of human life , and what shall be its moral character in any age or country will depend very much on the moral character of the age and country themselves . If they are bad , the stage will be bad ; if they are good , the stage will be good . We have very little doubt that , with all their merits , neither the " School for Scandal " nor the " Merry Wives of Windsor " would be tolerated on the stage as new plays to-day ; and this is because we are more refined and modest than they were three or even one hundred years ago . The question changes with every age , and the only thing which can be decided as an established fact is , that we shall never know what an absolutely immoral play is , though we shall always be able to say that a particular play shocks our sense of morality , and that we will not see it acted . - ALTHOUGh " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Galaxy , " every now and then questions arise and bits of information are furnished us which suggest how convenient a branch of literature it is . We observed the other day , in noticing the " Cross of Berny , " that the name was a mystery to us ; and we fancy that to ninety-nine out of a hundred English or American readers , the allusion was obscure . We have received information from a gentleman who has every opportunity of knowing , that the name was taken from that of a place near Paris where steeple-chase races were and perhaps are now held , and the intention of the name is to suggest the chase of the three macn in the book after one woman , who runs off in the beginning . Another question relating to French literature of a rather obscure kind , is one as to the reference in the poem which we give be .. low . The poem is an English translation of verses written by one of the two or three French Bohemian poets who could really write poetry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it refers is some actual air , and not an imagination . It may be at any rate , and if so it would be interesting , the verses are so // pleasing and graceful , to know what the air is , who composed it , and whether it is known nowadays to Americans : There is an air for which I would disown Mozart 's , Rossini 's , Weher 's melodies ; A sad sweet air that languishes and sighs , And keeps its secret charm for me alone Whene'er I hear that music vague and oldTwo hundred years are " mist that rolls away The thirteenth Louis reigns , and I behold A green land , golden in the dyiug day ; An old red castle , strong with stony towers , The windows bright with many-colored glass ; Wide plains , and streamlets flowing among flowers , That wash the castle basement as they pass . In antique weed , with dark eyes and gold hair , A lady looks forth from her casement high : It may be that I knew and found her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - IN Washington there has been much complaint that the night-blooming young gentlemen who had grown and flowered on the native soil , have not exactly wilted , but they have not blown to blooming loveliness . They have paled in comparison with exotics from Europe and even South America , in the estimation of the young American woman  --  and what is life without the love and admiration of this gentle bein , , ? In vain has the young American endeavored to win her away from the exotic attraction , and he hangs his head like a morning-glory that encounters the sun ; his hands droop to his sides like withered petals . In a word , she prefers the foreign attachds and secretaries of legation to our ornamental young gentlemen born and bred on American soil . Hence the grievance in the mind of one of our most useful members of society , for which there is cause . Some people can learn to be cooks , but men are born r6tisseurs . The same thing may be *aid of the young man of society-he is born to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attainment of the years of discretion , his life is one of devotion . He pays court at operas , concerts , and theatres , to the young woman in " his set . " At her nod he is used like a walking-stick . For her he has whirled consecutive nights of the season till three or four of the morning , like a teetotum , and she for whom he has done all this , proves ungrateful . She is neither true to him nor to herself . If he asks her into supper she is not hungry , but immediately after , when a Metternich in swaddling clothes asks the same question , she is famished for something to eat . He approaches her as she sits in an obscure corner of the stairway with the same party , to remind her that the coming waltz is his , when she calmly and deliberately says that he is mistaken-that she is engaged to some one else . If he gently chides her for dancing with another when she was engaged to dance with him , she coolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , this gentle being fibs . He tells her one of his best anecdotes , on which he has practised for weeks : her eyes indicate a growing interest , and he thinks at last he holds her , when the attach6 appears , and she transfers her entire interest to him . If he is one of a group where there is one foreigner , she persistently speaks in a foreign language which he does not understand . She pronounces his name-say Brown-quickly and almost inaudibly , but dwells unctuously and sweetly , as the bee upon the flower , on that of the Baron de Cri*vecoenr . Brown has noted all her delinquencies and preferences , and gathered bile both against her and De Cr*vecoeur . If possible , let us pour balm into his wounded soul by telling him that the young woman is silly , snobbish , and unpatriotic - that if she desires to be the Baroness de Cr*vecceur she shows that her love of title is stronger than her republicanism , and that if De Cri*vecoeur is a good-for-nothing dangler , who pays court only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , that she is lacking in common sense . That if she is dazzled by what she conceives to be a new and gorgeous swell to the point of deserting an old and tried friend , this is worst of all , and in English it is called snobbery . In a word , let Brown console himself with the reflection that she is unworthy of him , and let him resolve to give up the pursuit of such a vain butterfly . This may be good advice , but it is hardly likely that Brown will avail himself of it . He may be disposed to do so when smarting under the victories of De Cr*vecoeur , but afterwards he will attach himself anew to the siren whenever she deigns to smile upon him-as her sex says , men are such boobies.
