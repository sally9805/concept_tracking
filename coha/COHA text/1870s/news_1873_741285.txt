txt The merchants and bankers stood firmly frr each other yesterday , and the disasters hich many had anticipated on . Saturday id Sunday were happily averted . If the ablic will now only give the banks fair Lay for a day or two , the danger which ireatens us will pass away . But if country aalers and . everybody else are going to deLaud their deposits on sight , it is quite : ear bat will happen . No bank in the ' arid could stand such an attack . People a distance need not be afraid that we are Ding to " cave in " in New-York . Our only . ouble is that a partial dead-lock has ocirred , and country correspondents of banks ad. other mercantile houses have it , no oubt , within their power I to make this cad-lock complete . The circulating mecum has to a great extent disappearedtany people are hoarding it ; a great deal fit has " gone West ; " one cause or another as combined to render it a scarce article . ' his can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little forbearance from the general dealers and the public . The cable tells us that much sympathy is felt in London for the branch firm there of JAY COOKE &; Co . The sympathy and support which English houses are extending to an American firm ought not to be denied to American firms in their own country . The strongest bank in the world might be placed in a desperate condition by a systematic run upon it ; and it would have been no discredit to many of our banks if they had temporarily suspended operations yesterday . Such a suspension would . not have been in any sense a failure , but it would have put many persons to great inconvenience . It is Rot to the interest of any class in the community to bring about such a condition of affairs . People at a distance who do business with New-York firms have uo cause for alarm . The tmerchants are all safe enough . Such houses as JAFFRAY &; CO. , CLAFLIN &; CO. , or A. T. STEWART , are not going to break . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some brokers may be in jeopardy , although we sincerely hope that they will all pull through , for we have no sympathy with those who say " it serves them right . " They may have done reckless things , but it is no use preaching to them now . Let us all stand shoulder to shoulder , and help each other out of the present difficulty . If , after that , anybody is in. the mood to deliver a lecture , let him lecture and welcome . What we want is confidence , and that can only be regained by every man imparting confidence to his neighbor . We have got over one bad day . Monday was to ruin everybody , and yet nobody was ruined : If we can give the same account to-morrow of Tuesday , we may safely feel that the strength of the tempest is spent . The Stock Exchange remains closed  --  a very extreme measure , no doubt , but we are not disposed to call in question the expedients which are taken by experienced men to keep the torrent back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular step ; it may give rise to the impression that affairs are in a worse state than they really are . But it is done , and , we have no doubt , it was done for the best . It is not for any section of the community to weaken any other section , or to stand nagging at each other while danger is still confronting us . We confess that we - wish the circulating medium could be set free again by a quicker method than the mere purchase of bonds . The Government has , however , done all that it could . legally do . The proposition that it should lend money on bonds , the bonds to be afterward redeemed . by the holders , ' was well considered on Sunday , although yesterday it was brought forward in some quarters as a totally original idea . The Secretary of the Treasury is of opinion that the law does not warrant the Government in adopting any such measure . It has gone as far as it safely can . We trust that the improved state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more marked degree today , and that no attempt will be made to run down any bank , merchant , or broke ; whatever its or his supposed position may be .
