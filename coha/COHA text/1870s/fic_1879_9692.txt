PRELIMINARY . IT may not be inappropriate to preface this edition of Knowles 's familiar old play with the remarks printed in two of the leading New York papers on the morning after its recent revival in Daly 's Theatre . From William Winter 's article in the Tribune , reminiscent as well as pertinent , we may quote : " The time has been when ' The Hunchback ' was viewed as a classic . That time began sixty years ago , when the comedy was first made known here , and was presented with Mrs. Sharpe , Mrs. Barnes , and Fanny Kemble successively , in the character of its heroine . From that time , during a period of at least one generation , that piece occupied a place of the first eminence in public esteem . Within the last thirty years , although it has served the ambitious purpose of several beautiful and brilliant women  --  notably of Kate Bateman , Adelaide Neilson , Ada Cavendish , and Mary Anderson  --  it has gradually declined in publicity and faded out of fashion ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have passed away with the generation by which it was entertained . " A drastic method of theatrical comment upon social life , and of theatrical admonition as to morality and conduct , has taken the place of the gentler system of such writers as Sheridan Knowles and Bulwer and Douglas Jerrold . " In the period of ' The Hunchback , ' notwithstanding all its deficiencies , dramatic art could still deal with the auspicious aspects of human nature and social life , and it does not seem then to have been considered true that all men are licentious and all women frail . In that comedy the observer sees the image of a pure girl in the freshness and the glory of her youth , and in the experience  --  which is as nearly celestial as any human experience can be  --  of her first love . Momentarily she is bewildered and beguiled by the dazzling pleasures of sudden social success and popularity , and temporarily  --  having been piqued into wayward action and hateful entanglement  --  she is convulsed with grief , and pride , and passion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last , her integrity of character and her stability of principle assert themselves , and she stands forth the ideal of that incarnate excellence which is all that redeems human life from meanness , sterility , and the blight of the commonplace  --  a noble woman ! " All simple and trite , no doubt , alike in subject and treatment ! No cantharides in the draught . No absinthe on the rim of the beaker . The appeal of ' The Hunchback ' is to elemental instincts of good taste and good feeling . Its blank verse may be antiquated and artificial ; its episodes of playfulness , with Modus and Helen , are , doubtless , a little insipid ; its plot is slender ; but it is a play that shows a fine dramatic ability  --  the talent to evolve dramatic effects from a rational and coherent treatment of characters and incidents that are essentially true and absolutely simple , and to do that in a romantic method of poetry and not in the hard , commonplace method of photographic prose . The contemporary public may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a shadowy relic than as a veritable substance ; yet surely it is well that the present generation should sometimes have an opportunity of seeing the comedies that its forefathers admired and enjoyed ; and even if there were nothing but the historical element in Mr. Daly 's revival of ' The Hunchback , ' the revival would still be important . " From Edward Dithmar 's article in the Times we quote : " The production of ' The Hunchback ' at Daly 's Theatre , is a revival in the best sense . The play is done anew , not without all needful regard to tradition , for such a work can not be separated from the conventional forms to which it was written , but with many long-since tiresome encrustations of mere ' stage business ' discarded in favor of action and by-play suggested by an unprejudiced re-studying of the text , with a rich and splendid pictorial setting and a distribution of the parts that insured , beforehand , a representation powerful in some respects and altogether intelligent and beautifully harmonious . " Miss Ada Rehan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lent to it all the force of her remarkable talent and all her wealth of emotional expression so little used in the modern plays she has lately appeared in , as well as the lustre of her personal beauty and the dignity of her presence . No other actress we remember in this rle ( and they are legion ) has given to it so much variety . It was often the fate of poor Julia in the old days to have her gentlest , gayest moods adapted to the formal , not to say sepulchral , manner of antique tragedy . The actress who did Bianca , or the afflicted victim of Pescara one night , did Julia the next with the same unchanging manner , with scrupulous regard for elocutionary effect , carefully mindful of her pauses , and saving her full strength always for those critical passages in the text that habitual playgoers had become accustomed to wait for . " ' Helen ... Helen ... HELEN . Helen , I hate you ! ' " ' It is the Princess ! ' " ' ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " ' Show me a way I may escape these nuptials . ' " Who that remembers Miss Rehan 's delivery of these and many other familiar speeches last night in ' The Hunchback , ' without the least striving for mere elocutionary effect , with a true artist 's disregard for their traditional theatrical value , using every word and phrase as the spontaneous utterance of a thought , can fail to appreciate at its worth this latest embodiment of Knowles 's heroine ? Not that Miss Rehan disregards at any time the metre of the verse she is speaking . She delivers the old pentameters , often redundant in thought and painfully formal , as naturally as possible , to be sure , but with due regard for the melody . She has few living equals in the reading of verse , and no superiors before this public , if anywhere else on the English-speaking stage . " Her rich voice is easily attuned to the purely artificial measures of the ancient stage , and with variety of tone and shading she makes the verse of Knowles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as verse of Shakespeare . " Moreover , the development of the traits of Julia 's character is clearly and beautifully indicated in her portrayal ; the rural maid of Act I. , fancy free and light-hearted ; the town maid of Act II. , intoxicated by the gayety of fashion , does not wear the cothurnus of tragedy , or carry the air of ill-concealed misery . Julia 's moods in these passages are depicted with bewitching grace , with humor that the play has often seemed to sadly lack , with the deftest possible art . Her merriment is infectious , and her sorrow , under the slight imposed upon her by her hasty lover , is touching , but is not the black gloom of despair . " But there is no lack either of force or passion in the portrayal . She rises in the later scenes with the natural action of the play to splendid heights . Her facial expression , her half-choked utterances , and her final burst of exultation in the famous scene of the tapestry pictures could not be bettered as indications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her final appeal to the hunchback , a long declamatory passage that has been an unsurmountable obstacle to many a daring novice , was rendered last night with a degree of vehemence and a simulation of feeling that moved the audience deeply . It was remarkable as an example of elocution , and it was better than that , for it had the ring of truth . The tribute of tears was bestowed upon Miss Rehan 's acting in this passage and in the scene with Clifford . Her popular success in her new undertaking is indisputable . From a purely artistic point of view her triumph is not less great . A more perfect representation of all the traits of Julia has not been seen by the younger playgoers . A more charming one has never been seen . " But Mr. Winter is no less eloquent upon the merits of the new Julia . He writes in the Tribune : " Miss Rehan entered into the experience of Julia with profound sympathy . Her presentment of that heroine , in her ingenuous girlhood and amid her rural surroundings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetness , without any hint of that demure roguishness in which she is an adept , but which here would be so entirely inappropriate . The skill with which she invested artlessness with piquancy was , at the same time , conspicuously obvious . Her assumption of the artificial fine lady evinced the same kind of subtle discrimination  --  because the artificiality was made to be superficial , and the pure soul of the unspoiled girl was shown through it as through a transparency . Character is developed rapidly and mind is matured quickly under the stress of deep feeling . Miss Rehan 's portrayal of Julia , in the tempest that precedes the signing of the marriage contract , and in the stillness that follows it , was full of fine significance  --  the depth and strength of a woman 's heart thoroughly aroused . Her treatment of the incident of the torn letter showed once again that deep tenderness which is one of the potential charms of her temperament  --  a tenderness which was not that of placid , mournful reverie , but that of despairing passion . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tremulous assertion of self-respect , and , above all , her lovely kindness and trust during that exacting scene with Clifford , when the discarded lover has become the reverential servant , were completely in harmony with the character of Julia and with the purpose of the play . In modulation and symmetry Miss Rehan 's interpretation of that scene will become perfect through repetition ; in the element of sincerity it well-nigh surpassed precedent . In the almost frenzied abandonment of passionate protest , with which the comedy culminates , her demeanor was magnificent , while her delivery of the exhortation to Master Walter  --  copious , fluent , passionate , tempestuous , yet artfully restrained and guided away from blatant excess  --  was at once a triumph of elocutionary art and a fine example of sustained impersonation . If knowledge of woman 's heart be a matter of consequence to the observer of life , here is an opportunity for study of that subject . The author of ' The Hunchback ' has shown a deep and wise appreciation of his theme , and in Miss Ada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true interpreter . The principal defects of the embodiment  --  namely , occasional imperfections of articulation , occasional flurries of manner , occasional excess of gesticulation , and a few omissions of essential word ,  --  were evidently due to great excitement . Miss Rehan has never before played a part that requires such volume and such variety of steadily accumulative emotion as are required by Julia , and she has never before shown such almost uncontrollable feeling . She was many times recalled upon the scene amid genuine enthusiasm . " In the character of Master Walter , nobility and tenderness are richly suffused with romance . Personal deformity and a bitter experience consequent upon it have isolated and somewhat embittered that imaginative and sensitive gentleman , and he can be dangerous and stern . He lives wholly in his love for his daughter  --  who , until the last , only knows him as a guardian . There is a quality of patient affection in that character which makes it deeply sympathetic . It is a part that , above all , requires intrinsic authority in the actor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and true , and his picturesque presence and his fervid action imparted abundant animation to every scene in which he appeared . Mr. Arthur Bourchier amply fulfilled expectation by his fluent and polished embodiment of Clifford . The part , indeed , is conventional , but it requires weight of character and nobility of demeanor  --  the involuntary refinement and superiority of manner appertaining to a gentleman  --  and it admits of ardor if not of passion . Mr. Bourchier easily responded to every requirement of it . Mr. Creston Clarke ( son of John S. Clarke and nephew of Edwin Booth ) made his first appearance at this theatre , and distinguished himself by a correct and amusing performance of the bashful Modus . The piquant and tantalizing Helen became roguishly real , in the compact and pretty person of Miss Isabel Irving  --  a very earnest actress , charmingly successful in this instance . The sapient and sluggish Fathom had a neat , pointed representation , given by Mr. William Gilbert , and given with all the venerable tricks with which that part is commonly ornamented . Mr. Sidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comically absurd , without the unwarrantable exaggeration that has been a usage . " Those who are fond of gathering data for coincidences , may possibly find one in the fact that within a few weeks of the dbut of the latest Julia , who is to be added to the very brief list of successful representatives of that interesting heroine , the death was announced in the English papers of the original creator of the part :  --  Fanny Kemble , who first appeared as Julia to the author 's Master Walter in 1832 , and who passed from the stage of life during the first week of 1893 at the age of eighty-one .

You have known me scarce a minute . Clif . Clifford Say but a moment , still I say I love you . Love 's not a flower that grows on the dull earth ; Springs by the calendar ; must wait for sun  --  For rain ; matures by parts  --  must take its time To stem , to leaf , to bud , to blow . It owns A richer soil , and boasts a quicker seed ! You look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! E'en while you look , the peerless flower is up , Consummate in the birth ! Jul . Julia Crosses R. You 're from the town . How comes it , Sir , you seek a country wife ? Clif . Clifford In joining contrasts lieth love 's delight . Complexion , stature , nature mateth it , Not with their kinds , but with their opposites . Hence hands of snow in palms of russet lie ; The form of Hercules affects the sylph 's ; And breasts that case the lion 's fear-proof heart Find their loved lodge in arms where tremors dwell ! Therefore I , indeed , A gallant of the town , the town forsake , To win a country bride . Jul . Julia Who marries me must lead a country life . Clif . Clifford The life I love ! But fools would fly from it ; for oh ! ' t is sweet . It finds the heart out , be there one to find ; And corners i n't where stores of pleasures lodge We never dreamed were there ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deceit ; Music , whose melody is of the heart . It is to live on life , And husband it ! It is to constant scan The handiwork of heaven ! It is to con Its mercy , bounty , wisdom , power ! It is To nearer see our God ! Jul . Julia How like he talks to Master Walter ! Thou would'st not live one half a year ! A quarter might'st thou for the novelty Of fields and trees ; but then it needs must be In summer time , when they go dressed . Clif . Clifford In any time  --  say winter ! Fields and trees Have charms for me in very winter time . Jul . Julia But snow may clothe them then . Crosses L. Clif . Clifford I like them full As well in snow . Jul . Julia You do ? Clif .

Clifford Matchless maid , Fear not to undertake the charge of me ! Kneels . A willing pupil kneels to thee , and lays His title and his fortune at your feet . Enter MASTER WALTER followed by HELEN , R. JULIA sees WALTER first , blushes , and turns away , meeting HELEN face to face , who laughs at her and holds up her finger in mock reproach .

Fathom So please you , sir , a letter  --  a post-haste letter ! The bearer on horseback , the horse in a foam  --  smoking like a boiler at the heat  --  be sure a post-haste letter ! Wal . Walter Look to the horse and rider . Fath . Fathom I fly ! Exit FATHOM , R. WALTER opens the letter and reads . Wal . Walter What 's this ? A testament addressed to me , Found in his Lordship 's escritoire , and thence Directed to be taken by no hand But mine . My presence instantly required ?

SCENE I.  --  A rich Apartment in MASTER HEARTWELL 'S House . Enter THOMAS , L. C. , and FATHOM , R. C. Thom . Thomas Well , Fathom , is thy mistress up ? Fath . Fathom She is , Master Thomas , and breakfasted . Thom . Thomas She stands it well ! ' T was five , you say , when she came home ; and wants it now three quarters of an hour of ten ! Wait till her stock of country health is out . Fath . Fathom ' Twill come to that , Master Thomas , before she lives another month in town ! Three , four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps . ' T was otherwise with her in the country . There my mistress used to rise what time she now lies down . Thom . Thomas Why , yes ; she 's changed since she came hither . Fath . Fathom Changed , do you say , Master Thomas ? Changed forsooth ! I know not the thing in which she is not changed , saving that she is still a woman . I tell thee there is no keeping pace with her moods . In the country she had none of them . When I brought what she asked for , it was " Thank you , Fathom , " and no more to do ; but now , nothing contents her . Hark ye ! were you a gentleman , Master Thomas  --  for then you know you would be a different kind of man  --  how many times would you have your coat altered ? Thom . Thomas Why , Master Fathom , as many times as it would take to make it fit me . Fath . Fathom Good ! But supposing it fitted thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it altered not at all . Fath . Fathom Good ! Thou would'st be a reasonable gentleman . Thou would'st have a conscience . Now hark to a tale about my lady 's last gown . How many times , think you took I it back to the sempstress ? Thom . Thomas Thrice , may be . Fath . Fathom Thrice , may be ! Twenty times , may be ; and not a turn too many for the truth o n't . Twenty times , on the oath of the sempstress . Now mark me  --  can you count ? Thom . Thomas After a fashion . Fath . Fathom You have much to be thankful for , Master Thomas ; you London serving-men know a world of things which we in the country never dream of . Now mark : four times took I it back for the flounce ; twice for the sleeves ; twice for the tucker . How many times in all is that ? Thom . Thomas Eight times to a fraction , Master Fathom . Fath . Fathom What a master of figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then found she fault with the trimmings . Now , tell me how many times took I back the gown for the trimmings ? Thom . Thomas Eight times more , perhaps ! Fath . Fathom Ten times to a certainty . How many times makes that ? Thom . Thomas Eighteen , Master Fathom , by the rule of addition . Fath . Fathom And how many times more will make twenty ? Thom . Thomas Twice , by the same rule . Fath . Fathom Thou hast worked with thy pencil and slate , Master Thomas ! Well , ten times , as I said , took I back the gown for the trimmings : and was she content after all ? I warrant you , no , or my ears did not pay for it . She wished , she said , that the slattern sempstress had not touched the gown ; for naught had she done , but botched it . Now what , think you , had the sempstress done to the gown ? Thom . Thomas To surmise that I must be learned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's art ! Thou has hit it ! Oh , the sweet sempstress ! The excellent sempstress ! Mistress of her scissors and needles , which are pointless and edgeless to her art ! The sempstress had done nothing to the gown , yet raves and storms my mistress at her for having botched it in the making and mending ; and orders her straight to make another one , which home the sempstress brings on Tuesday last . Thom . Thomas And found thy fair mistress as many faults with that ? Fath . Fathom Not one ! She finds it a very pattern of a gown ! A well-sitting flounce ! The sleeves a fit  --  the tucker a fit  --  the trimmings her fancy to a T  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! and she praised the sempstress  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! and she smiles at me , and I smile  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! and the sempstress smiles  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! Now why did the sempstress smile ? Thom . Thomas That she had succeeded so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit it again . The jade must have been born a sempstress . If ever I marry , she shall work for my wife . The gown was the same gown , and there was my mistress 's twentieth mood ! Crosses L. Thom . Thomas What , think you , will Master Walter say when he comes back ? I fear he 'll hardly know his country maid again . Has she yet fixed her wedding-day ? Fath . Fathom She has , Master Thomas . I coaxed it from her maid . She marries Monday week . Thom . Thomas Comes not Master Walter back to-day ? Fath . Fathom Your master expects him . Bell ringing , L. He crosses R. of THOMAS . Perhaps that 's he . I prithee go and open the door ; do , Master Thomas , do ; for , proves it my master , he 'll surely question me . Rushing THOMAS up L. Thom . Thomas And what should I do ? Fath . Fathom Answer him , Master Thomas , and make him none the wiser . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Go ! open the door , I prithee . Fifty things , Master Thomas , know you , for one thing that I know ; you can turn and twist a matter into any other kind of matter , and then twist and turn it back again , if needs be ; so much you servants of the town beat us of the country , Master Thomas . Open the door , now ; do , Master Thomas , do ! Exeunt , L. Enter MASTER HEARTWELL , R. , and MASTER WALTER , L. , meeting . Heart . Heart well Good Master Walter , welcome back again ! Wal . Walter I 'm glad to see you , Master Heartwell . Heart . Heartwell How , I pray you , sped the weighty bus'ness which So sudden called you hence ? Wal . Walter Weighty , indeed !

Likes she the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match me her Amongst your city maids ? Heart . Heartwell Nor court ones neither ! She far outstrips them all ! Wal . Walter I knew she would . Crosses R. What else could follow in a maid so bred ? A pure mind , Master Heartwell !  --  not a taint From intercourse with the distempered town ; With which all contact was walled out ; until , Matured in soundness , I could trust her to it , And sleep amidst infection . Heart . Heartwell Master Walter ! Wal . Walter Well ? Heart . Heartwell Tell me , prithee , which is likelier To plough a sea in safety ?  --  he that 's wont To sail in it , or he that by the chart Is master of its soundings , bearings  --  knows Its headlands , havens , currents  --  where ' t is bold , And where behoves to keep a good lookout ?  --  The one will swim where sinks the other one !

Sleep only ends the riot , Which waking still begins ! Wal . Walter I 'm all amaze ! How bears Sir Thomas this ? Heart . Heartwell Why , patiently ; Though , one can see , with pain . Wal . Walter She loves him ? HEARTWELL shrugs his shoulders and exits L. Ha ! That shrug is doubt ! She 'd ne'er consent to wed him Unless she loved him !  --  never !

Helen That Ovid was a fool ! Crosses L. Modus . In what ? Hel . Helen In that : To call that thing an art , which art is none . Modus . And is not love an art ? Hel . Helen Are you a fool , As well as Ovid ? Love an art ! No art But taketh time and pains to learn . Love comes With neither . Is't to hoard such grain as that You went to college ? Better stay at home And study homely English . Modus . Nay , you know not The argument . Hel . Helen I do n't ? I know it better Than ever Ovid did ! Suppose a lady were in love with thee , Could'st thou , by Ovid , Cousin , find it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thyself ? Could Ovid , Cousin , teach thee to make love ? I could , that never read him . You begin With melancholy ; then to sadness ; then To sickness ; then to dying  --  but not die ! She would not let thee , were she of my mind ; She 'd take compassion on thee . Then for hope ; From hope to confidence ; from confidence To boldness ; then you 'd speak ; at first entreat ; Then urge ; then flout ! then argue ; then enforce ; Make prisoner of her hand ; besiege her waist ; Threaten her lips with storming ; keep thy word And carry her ! My sampler ' gainst thy Ovid ! Why , Cousin , are you frightened ? The case is clear You are no soldier . You 'll ne'er win a battle . You care too much for blows ! Modus . You wrong me there .

Of the twain She more affected you ; I 've caught you now , Opportunity on opportunity she gave you , Sir  --  But ' t was he that won her  --  Won her because he wooed her like a man . Crosses L.

You are not angry ? Shake hands ! Why , Cousin , do you squeeze me so ? Modus . Letting her go . I swear I squeezed you not ! Hel . Helen You did not ? Modus . No . I 'll die if I did ! Hel . Helen Why , then you did not , Cousin : So let 's shake hands again  --  He takes her hand as before . Oh , go , and now Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Wore lovers ruffs in Master Ovid 's time ?

Oh , would that she loved me ! Why did she taunt me With backwardness in love ? What could she mean ? Sees she I love her , and so laughs at me Because I lack the front to woo her ? Nay , I 'll woo her , then ! Her lips shall be in danger When next she trusts them near me ! Looked she at me To-day as never did she look before ! Begins to read , pauses , and thrusts book into his bosom . Hang Ovid 's Art of Love ! I 'll woo my cousin ! Exit R Enter MASTER WALTER and JULIA , R. Wal . Walter This is the banqueting-room .
