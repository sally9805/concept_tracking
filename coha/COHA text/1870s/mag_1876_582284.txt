VOL XI . MARCH , 1876 . No. 5 . TRINITY COLLEGE , HARTFORD . qwq appointed to prefer a petition if deemed by them expedient ; the powers of this committee were continued for two years , after which time the memorial was withholden , as objects of vital interest claimed their attention , among which was the establishment of the General Theological Seminary ; and this , together with the vacancy in the Episcopate , led the churchmen of Connecticut to defer , for the present , the founding of a cob lege , and to wait for more auspicious times , which seemed to have arrived soon after the adoption of a State Constitution in i 8 i8 . During the following year Bishop Brownell was consecrated , and when this noble prelate had fairly entered upon the duties of his office , he bent his energies toward the establishment of a Church college in the Diocese , and made strenuous efforts to carry out the project , the success of which bad been the hope of churchmen for years past . In 1822 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop Brownell , in New Haven , at which steps were taken with a view to securing the desired charter . During this year the General Theological Seminary had been removed to New York city , and this was one incentive to the founding of a Church college in Connecticut . A memorial was drawn up by the Bishop , three clergymen and two laymen , praying " the General Assembly to grant an act of incorporation for a college , with power to confer the usual literary honors , to be placed in either of the cities of Hartford , Middletown , or New Haven . " The claim of the memorialists was a just and fair one , as they asked for no exclusive privileges , but desired to be placed on a footing with other Christian denominations throughout the country , who had their own universities and colleges ; and , as they looked forward to the ultimate establishment of a literary institution which should be under the guardianship of the Episcopal Church , they were desirous that it should be founded in the State of Connecticut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presentation of this petition , it is curious to observe , as an historical fact , that the old " test law , " as it was called , of Yale College , the first established institution of learning in the State under control of the Congregationalists , was repealed . This law compelled any one elected to a chair of instruction in that institution to declare his consent to the " Confessions of Faith owned and consented to by the Elders and Messengers of the Churches in the Colony of Connecticut assembled by delegation at Saybrook , September 9th , 1703 . " The particular time for this act of the corporation repealing the severe law , was thought by some to have been critically chosen , and to have the appearance of an attempt to influence the mind of the Legislature against the passage of the petition for a charter establishing a second college in the State , by thus seemingly freeing Yale from the bias of its sectarian influence . Be this as it may , the day dawned bright at last for the Church , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington College was granted . The report of the committee to which the petition was referred is something peculiar in its way , and sets forth , by means of indirect . admission , the benefits which might accrue to the State from the establishment of the institution , in the statement that it " will in no way be prejudicial to the great and important interests of literature in the State . " At Hartford , where the General Assembly was convened when the passage of the charter took place , there was much demonstration over the event , the rejoicings of the people finding expression in the firing of cannon and the lighting of bonfires . The amount of money requisite to secure the provisions of incorporation was subscribed , and in less than a year nearly $50,000 was raised toward an endowment , which was obtained on the same plan as that adopted by the Fellows of Yale a century before , offering the larger towns in the State the privilege of fair competition for the location of the college , and Hartford , being most generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington College . The site selected was a beautiful one , as after years fully demonstrated ; the tract of land embraced fourteen acres , having peculiar natural advantages , not the least of which was a piece of rising ground , with gentle slopes on either side , whereon the buildings were located , and which was dignified by the name of " College Hill . " A small river bounded the grounds on one side , and at that time gratified the wishes of the students , whose taste inclined them to boating before that pastime was reduced to an exact science as at the present , and rowing was considered more as a pleasure than a labor . Thick forests were the near neighbors of the college , and among them undergraduates were wont to find sport , the click of the gun , rather than billiard balls , making holiday music in their ears . In speaking of the grounds and surroundings // of the college , it may here be remarked that the design of Samuel F. B. Morse , more among the studies of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partial course-an arrangement entered connection with the electric telegraph than into at only a few of the colleges-was by his celebrity in the profession of archibotany , to which very particular attention tecture . Both buildings were plain and subwas paid , and for practical advantages a stantial structures of modest brown-stone , well and firmly built . Jarvis Hall was designed for the accommodation of students , and Seabury Hall , with its somewhat pretentious portico supported by lofty Ionic columns , contained the chapel , library , cabinet , and other public apartments . With Bishop Brownell , whose name and memory are universally beloved and respected , as first President , ably assisted by a corps of instructors , among whom were the Right Rev. A. W. Potter , now Bishop of New York , and the late Bishop of New Jersey , Right Rev. G. W. Doane , Washington College entered upon her career of usefulness , and to-day ranks as one of the oldest Episcopal colleges in the country , and the only one located in New England . But the attacks which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ended , although its doors had been thrown open to the public , and a veritable war of pamphlets arose . The controversy upon the good and evil effects resulting from the foundation of a second institution of learniiig in the State was most severe , and the bitter feeling against the originators , the aiders and abettors in the undertaking , found vent in publications , which , at the date of their circulation , and for not a little time afterward , made considerable commotion throughout the community . Not only are " The Considerations Suggested by qwq planned . The year 1845 was also marked by the establishment of a chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society , which was organized at William and Mary Coll2ge in 1776 , and three years later granted charters for the founding of the Massachusetts and ConnecticutAlphas ; the latter was located at Yale College , and in June empowered a well and truly beloved brother " to found a chapter at Trinity . The society has prospered , and has been regarded with qwq is a noticeable fact that during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in proportion to its numbers than any other institution of a similar character in the North ; and up to the time of the late war Trinity College was a most popular educational resort for Southerners , while before it was scarcely over there were indications that the liberal patronage extended to it in former years was to be continued , if not increased , in the years to come . In tracing out a history like that before us , and following it step by step , marking the growth of the institution , noting its principles of government , gaining an insight into the aims and motives which actuate its being and enter into its every-day life , a contrast in the thoughts and feelings of fifty years ago as compared with those of the present time , is natural , and by no means devoid of interest . In the olden times young men entering college were but transferred temporarily to the care and guidance of second parents , and the protecting hand of Alma Mater stretched out in their behalf was , if we may judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the prime considerations in these old laws seems to have been great care for the monetary interests of every student , and not only was the time4ionored prevention against " extra or improper expenditure by the students " carried into operation , by placing all available funds in the hands of the Bursar ; but in order to make a purchase of *tny kind the student was obliged to obtain from that functionary a " permit " for the purpose . While keeping an eye on the funds intrusted , Alma Mater , with a disinterestedness pleasing to note , also remembered herself ; and if she was weary with night-watching for the return of the loitering student at the beginning of the term , she solaced herself with the reflection that " he shall pay fifty cents for each night 's absence . " In the matter of government , the Tutors were placed on a level with the Professors , and were vested with authority to punish students by private admonition and by " a fine not exceeding one dollar ; " and the last drain upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the terni bill , he was charged " one dollar and fifty cents for the expenses of Commencement dinner , " about the sum now required to fee the waiter at that annual banquet . The fact of a student not being permitted to " sleep in his room or lie down on his bed during study hours " must have seemed a trifle severe , when we reflect that during the summer term the first recitation was at five o'clock in the morning . In winter , however , the rigidity of the law was relaxed , and the bell called forth students at six o'clock , the recitation being conducted by aid of candle-light , which was a necessity to the successful deciphering of Greek text . Probably as a compensation for this unseemly early rising , " bed-time " was put down in the " Laws " at ten o'clock , and after half-past ten in the evening no student was allowed to leave his room . This , of course , antedates the existence of " germans , " fashionable frivolity being then in its infancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Two Orphans , " or Theodore 1'homas made their appeals for public favor at that time , we fear great temptation would have been offered the student to break that law which placed the theater or any similar amusement withouf the pale of recognition , and forbade attendance at " any festive entertainment in the city of Hartford or its vicinity . " This last prohibition must gradually have declined in popular favor , until at length it grew to be a mere letter , for not only was the college represented at the theater and at concerts in the city , but there are records of entertainments given by the students themselves , and in which they took an active interest . To give a sketch of the social life of the college at this time , we must turn to the flourishing days of the " Athenaeum , " a literary society , founded with a view to culture in extemporaneous debate and composition , BISHOP SEABURY 'S MITER. // and holding its meetings every Saturday morning . The establishment of a second literary society , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served to create a wholesome rivalry between the two , and in time led to public exhibitions , the first being given by the former organization in 1827 , and consisting of poems , orations , debates , and the production of an original play . These exhibitions , given alternately each year by the literary societies , were well sustained , and well attended , and were regarded as one of the events of the college year . Another source of recreation was Junior Exhibition , to which considerable attention was turned , it being popular for many years . During its latter days , however , the solemnity of the occasion was somewhat marred by the circulation among the audience of " mock programmes ; " but as the publication of these-frequently witty bills-was a penal offense , a keen zest was imparted to the undertaking , which was greatly enjoyed by the Sophomores , at whose hands the scheme was carried out . As a general thing , the interest in literary societies , established in our colleges , is at the present time in strong contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in their prime , now they are on the decline , if not already passed into memory . One theory for this lack of interest is , that the literary inclinations of the undergraduates of to-day are more toward theme-writing and composition than debate and declamation ; and opportunities for culture and improvement in both these branches are now frequently afforded in the curriculum , where , years ago , they failed to gain strong recognition as important features of a complete education . The publication of college papers and periodicals has also had an effect upon the literary associations , and has , to a great extent , attracted the pen of the student in another direction , and given him a more pleasing , if not a wider , field for his efforts . As an offset to the severe mental strain induced by the duties of the literary societies , and to guard against a too great cultivation of the brain to the exclusion of the body , the organization among the students of the " Washington College Archers " undoubtedly owed its existence , a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised their skill with the bow and arrow . The " Archers " flourished as early as 1834 , and during that year the late Gov . T. H. Seymour , then a resident of Hartford , instructed them occasionally in fancy movements . The monotony of l ) arades upon the Campus was varied by excursions to neighboring towns , Springfield , then reached by means of the " half pony power " boats ( immortalized by Dickens ) , which ran back and forth on the Connecticut River , being a favorite resort , where the company marched to the U. S. Armory , and *ere hospitably entertained by the commander of the post . The chief object of the " Archers , " besides the attainment of military glory in general , was to attract the attention of the fair sex in particular , and as there are no records extant to prove the contrary , we may infer , with a very tolerable degree of accuracy , that they succeeded admirably , when we consider the striking effect which must have been produced by the uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbans with black plumes , black belts , longbows of lance-wood , and black quivers filled with arrows , the officers of the company carrying swords in place of the bow and arrow , and having their turbans decorated with white plum*s . Among the customs at Trinity College , and , if space would permit , a chapter might be written on this theme , may be mentioned the " Burning of Conic Sections , " a midnight ceremomy by the Sophomore class , which , like Junior Exhibition , and many of those entertainments dating back to the pristine days of the institution , has been gently pushed into the background by affairs of recent popularity . The celebration of Washington 's Birthday claims the attention of the students , and the occasion is marked by appropriate exercises in the cabinet , and by an illumination of the buildings , the custom having been in vogue for twenty years or more ; but the gala day of the term is Class Day , a day particularly enjoyed by the undergraduates , and of as much importance in the estimation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractions are as varied as they are pleasant , and at the usual exercises on the Campus none are more worthy of note than the " Presentation of the Lemon-Squeezer , " and the " Presentation to Professor Jim , " both being ceremonies peculiar to the college , and as novel as they are distinctive . The subject of the first presentation is familiar to the average person , that is in its ordinary form ; but as the " Lemon-Squeezer " of Class Day fame is something not met with in every-day life , a word of description is pertinent . It is a plain piece of mechanism , devoid of much // ornamentation , boasting no pretentious design . It is revered and prized , not so much for its intrinsic value as for the memories which cluster around it , and are , upon auspicious occasions , squeezed out of it ! The material used in its construction is chiefly pine board , relieved at its further extremity by two hinges of brass , added more for practical use than for external embellishment . Upon its face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the classes who have been its fortunate recipients ; upon its reverse side TRINITY is lettered in green and white , the college colors , with 57 below , this being the date of the establishment of the custom . The popularity of a class in college became the sine qua non to obtain the " LemonSqueezer , " and , as a general thing , fitness depended upon a long list of " adventures . " However that may be , the receiving class was compelled to keep watch and ward over the relic , to immure it within bank vaults , and take the utmost precaution lest it should be wrested from them . It is customary for each class to append a lemon to the " Squeezer , " and also to add their " color " to the bunch of ribbons which flaunt themselves at its further extremity . Previous to its appearance on Class Day , the " Squeezer " is exhibited to the class for whom it is intended , and the exhibition is one in which the old relic is made to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk upon the occasion being squeezed over it by every member of the receiving class . Without the " Presentation to Professor Jim , " Class Day would be dull indeed . The ceremony generally consists of a purse of money , given by the Senior class to the old negro janitor , who has been connected with the college for the past fifty years , and whose reception speech as he holds the purse in his hand and discourses to the assembled guests , is as entertaining in its flights of rhetoric , and as laughable in its personalities , as one would wish to hear on a warm June afternoon . No sketch of Trinity College , however elaborate , would be complete without an allusion to " Professor Jim , " his departments being principally " dust and ashes , " and the care of the college bell . Although age has crept upon him , and he has been exempted from active duties by the authorities , still he never fails to appear on Class Day , and is on hand at Commencement , and invariably flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The life of " Professor Jim " has been written by a recent graduate and published in book form , and is to be found in the public libraries at Boston and New York , in company with the biographies of other distinguished men . The precise date of his birth is obscured in a slight maze of doubt ; but , as he remembers to have heard the bell-tolling and the cannon-firing when the news of Washington 's death spread through the land , it is conjectured that he was born somewhere about 1790 ; his father was a freedman and his mother a slave belonging to a retired Revolutionary officer , Colonel Robert by name , who lived at Yonkers , New York , and Jim 's early years were spent there and in New York city , when Pearl street , Broadway , and Greenwich street were the principal thoroughfares . Aaron Burr was an intimate friend of Jim 's master , and , after his duel with Hamilton , Burr repaired to Colonel Robert 's house , where a room was always in readiness against his arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green old age , singular as it may appear , at his " neat suburban retreat " in the vicinity of the institution over whose interests he has watched for half a century , and within hearing of that qwq grandson of Colonel Robert , clears up an historical doubt as to the whereabouts of Burr after the duel , historians contenting themselves with the announcement that he remained for eleven days in New York city at his home called Richmond Hill . " Professor Jim , " or , to give his own name , James Williams , in course of time followed the sea , and , after a number of voyages to foreign lands with attendant dangers , we find him figuring in the war of 1812 , as a gunner on board the " Hornet " during her famous engagement with the " Peacock . " This experience is , to the mind of the venerable old man , an ever-pleasant theme to dwell upon , and he recounts the story of his adventures with much gusto . Later he experienced hardships on board a pirate vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his abode in Hartford , Connecticut . When , in 1821 , Bishop Brownell ( afterward first President of Trinity College ) came with his family to this city , Jim was installed as I a servant in the household , and two years later , upon the establishment of the college , he became its first janitor . Until within a short time , he has remained at his post , and when , by reason of his old age , the duties became too burdensome , he was pensioned bell , which , rung by his faithful hands , has tolled alike the parting death-knell and sounded the summons to prayers and recitation . Perhaps there is no object about college so much despised , and scorned , and maltreated as the bell , and yet this was Professor Jim 's particular pet . He cared for it and tended it day after day , and the students had an eye and a hand on it night after night , but the old " Professor " was equal to any emergency . The coils of ropes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duty in spite of adverse , and , at times , disastrous circumstances . To illustrate some of the peculiarities of Jim 's Class Day eloquence , we append a few quotations from speeches which have been preserved : " Gentlemen , you has been very kind to me , an ' our communion has been sweet together , but we 've got to take our departur ' ! What will become of you , de Lord knows . Some may go to de sandy shores of Arabia , some on you to de tropical wilds of Africa-it 's your own fault if you ai n't fitted to travel to any part o ' de State ! " Upon one occasion , referring to a son of one of the Professors , Jim delivered the following eulogy : " There sits a young man whose father entered college and graduated with honor and dignity to his parents , and allers instructed him in his duty . " Jim was a founder of the African Zion Methodist Church in Hartford , and his Methodist fervor of exhortation would frequently tinge his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotation subjoined : " Where'er you go , may de Lord bless yer . THE LEMON-SQUEEZER . " PROFESSOR JIM , " FOR HALF A CENTURY JANITOR OF TRINITY COLLEGE . // You know I always had an interest in your salvation . Remember , gentlemen , you are now in de flower of your youth . You are advancing , but I am devancing ! You 're soon going to leave dis college , dis splendid canvas ; do n't neglect to make acquaintance xv id de Supreme Being . 0 , my beloved friends , who has been instructed in de class in de canopy of Heaven , or on de shores of Trinity College ! " The poor old janitor is in reality " devancing , " but his genial manners have not left him , and he still has a kindly word for everybody . The first Commencement of the college was held on the 2d of August , 1827 , the seeming disparity of years in the course being accounted for by the fact that the members of the graduating class entered at advanced standing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society in Hartford , the Commencement exercises were held there down to a comparatively recent date , a large stage being built about the pulpit and above the altar , for the accommodation of the Faculty , college dignitaries , and the speakers ; the galleries of the church , being the best position from which to see and to he seen , were crowded to their utmost capacity , and " The round , laughing face of the beautiful girl ? ' lighted up the dim old cloisters , and doubtless spoke approval of the efforts of the aspirants for academic honors . Among the men who received their Bachelor 's degree in Christ Church were two who , during their collegiate life , were closely associated , both as room-mates and class-mates , and in after years , separated by the tenets of their respective faiths , attained great eminence in the Episcopal and in the Roman Catholic Churches . We refer to Rt . Rev. John Williams , D. D. , present Bishop of Connecticut , and Archbishop J. R. Bayley , of New Jersey . In connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a custom which , pleasing and thoughtful in its nature , had also about it a touch of pathos . After the retirement of the first President , Bishop Brownell , from his duties as head of the college , and when the infirmities of age prevented him from leaving his home , the Commencement procession , on its way to the church , marched through the street on which he lived , and , pausing in front of his residence , tarried while the hand played " Auld Lang Syne , " in token of the kindly remembrance in which the founder of the college was gratefully held ; and then , reverently saluting the venerable prelate and his family , passed on to the more important duties which awaited them . Another custom of the day is not uninteresting , and is deserving of note  --  the occupation by the President , during the exercises , of a quaint old chair , primitive in design , dark with age , and , we might add , somewhat uncomfortable to sit in . The chair was originally the property of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years ago lived at Newport , R. I. , and , upon changing his place of residence , left his farm and also his books to Yale College , many of his personal effects being given to particular friends ; by which distribution the chair passed into the hands of Joseph Wanton , Governor of Rhode Island , whose daughter married a grandson of Govemor Saltonstall , of Connecticut , a Whig , who in 178I was burned out by Benedict Arnold . In this extremity , having applied to Governor Wanton for aid , he was the recipient , among other things , of this chair , which through a successive generation was presented to Trinity . It is becoming more and more historical , and the fact that it was the study chair in which Bishop Berkeley composed , while at Newport , the celebrated " Minute Philosopher , " adds to its value as a relic . The war record of Trinity College is a PRESIDENT PYNCHON. // noble one . Weakened as her academic ranks were by the departure of brave men , she was strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , true to her motto , " Pro Ecclesia et Patria , " she sent forth her sons , knowing that in doing their duty by their country 's flag they would likewise honor her . In proportion to the number of students then in college , the quota furnished was a large one , and death smote heavily the brave band . Many died from the hardships and the exposures of camp life , and one , the leader of his class , was a victim to a living death at Andersonville . Of those who during their service in the field rose to the rank which their bravery justly accorded them , we can not forbear to mention Stedman , who fell before Petersburgh , and , while acting Brigadier-General in that terrible campaign , had been recommended for that rank by all his superior officers . As if to mock all earthly honor , his brevet as Brigadier caine only after he had received his mortal wound . Trinity is a boating college , and has the honor to have been one of the four colleges that assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1858 , the projectors of the scheme being Harvard , Yale , Brown University , and Trinity . The Connecticut River at Hartford affording great facilities for practice , and being , comparatively speaking , easy of access , the college has good advantages , which of late years have been improved , there being now more interest evinced in boating matters than formerly . Particularly has this interest manifested itself since regatta laurels have been won by what are denominated " smaller colleges . " In 1873 Trinity was entered in the intercollegiate race at Springfield , and in the year following she pulled an oar at Saratoga , the death of one of her crew while training preventing her appearance on Saratoga Lake in 1875 . This element of student life , being now firmly established at Trinity , is considered one of the institutions of the college , and a membership of the Boat Club is accounted a privilege as well as an honor . In the neighborhood of the college the haunts familiar to the earlier graduates have all been removed ; among them one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " The Knickerbocker Magazine , " " the old brown house in the outskirts of the village , venerable with years ; a poor affair , yet rich in associations . " This was the rendezvous of those college wits , as gentlemanly as they were jovial , who composed the Corax Club , a fictitious name for a secret society , which to-day is the oldest local college fraternity in the country . In after years , the house being untenanted , the owner contemplated pulling it down , for , " in his eyes , " the writer brilliantly remarks , " the old brown house , like the barren figtree , cumbered the ground , and the old garden cucumbered it ! " The view from the Campus cityward is now a beautiful one , and , as the author of " My Farm at Edgewood " says , " what was once a wilderness has been converted into a blooming garden . " This refers to the city park , which , with its unequaled lawns , is a most picturesque and beautiful spot . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight wire fence . Recently many and marked have been the alterations , and to-day , under the rule of State authority , all vestiges of what was once the ample Campus of Trinity College are being fast removed ; the " long walk , " the college grove , the " oratorical rock , " the class ivies planted beneath the college walls , are destined to disappear amid the changes which are to come . Already a portion of one hall has been torn down , and all the others will share the same fate before another year is past . But beyond all this seeming sacrilege and uprooting of memories and associations , which , stronger than the ivies upon the wall , cling to everything pertaining to Alma Mater , comes the almost compensating thought of the brilliant future open to Trinity College in the new home of her academic life . At this point in our sketch , leaving the history of the college , having marked its growth in the past , we come to a description of what it is to-day , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ftiture . The old Campus and the college buildings were sold to the city of Hartford in February , 1872 , the college reserving the right of occupancy for five years . The grounds were purchased as a site for the new State House , the long mooted question of the State Capitol having been settled in favor of Hartford , and upon this beautiful location the public building is now in process of erection . Early in the following year the Trustees of Trinity College negotiated for the purchase of a tract of land eighty acres in extent , whereon to put up the new buildings , and in the summer Dr. Jackson , the President , went abroad and spent considerable time in visiting English univer // sities , and consulting architects . Previous to his return he laid the scheme for the new Trinity College before Mr. William Burges , a professional gentleman of eminence in London , from whom water-color sketches and plans were obtained , and , with these as a nucleus , the subject was with advantage presented to the Trustees for their consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that body , it was deemed important to advance the work as quickly as possible . With a view to this end an architect was sent to London to prepare working drawings required for the execution of the plans . To the instrumentality and indefatigable attention of Dr. Jackson , much of the success which may attend the carrying out the project now afoot will be justly due . At first seriously opposed to the sale of the property on which since its foundation the college had stood , when convinced that it would advance the interests of the institution , he applied himself earnestly to the accomplishment of the measure . But it was not destined that he , who had taken such a deep interest in everything pertaining to the erection of the new buildings , should live to see the fulfillment of his favorite plan . In April , 1874 , the college was called upon to mourn the death of President Jackson . A determined and energetic man , with great breadth of intellect and liberal culture , he was eminently fitted to occupy the position he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most affable and winning , through him the college became more identified with Hartford , and was at the same time making itself favorably felt among similar institutions , with whose members the President cultivated the most friendly relations . Being an alumnus of Trinity , and afterward having filled the Professorship of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy , he was bound to the college by peculiarly strong ties . He brought with him an experience of nine years as President of Hobart College , and was a man whose executive ability , aided by his many admirable qualities of head and heart , won for him the respect and trust of both the Faculty and undergraduates . During the fall of 1874 , the vacancy in the Presidency was filled by the election of Rev. Dr. T. R. Pynchon , Professor of Chemistry , and a graduate of the college in the class of 1841 . Under his direction as Chairman of the Building Committee , and with a zeal most hearty , the new building project is being carried out . On Commencement Day of last year , ground at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site selected for the erection of the new buildings is one scarcely without a rival in its natural advantages and picturesque location . About a mile distant from the old Campus , it lies upon the summit of what is known as Rocky Hill , a high ridge running south from the city , with a slope on either side , down across rich meadows and fertile fields , and then up with most gradual and pleasing ascent to far horizons " luminous with dawns , or soft with purple twilight . " It will form the center of a landscape , as beautiful as any for which the far-famed Connecticut Valley is justly celebrated . With this eligible spot , upon which to rear their buildings , the Trustees of Trinity College take advantage of the opportunity offered , to make a new departure in this country in college architecture , introducing for the first time that most effective plan of quadrangles , commonly adopted at the English universities . Some steps have been taken at other colleges toward the ultimate completion of quadrangles , but with this difference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former instance , when the plans are matured , the quadrangles will be bounded on their various sides by structures erected without the idea of future harmony throughout the entire pile , and widely differing from each other in their external design , presenting an aggregation of plans and a collection of various styles . The plan for the new college buildings at Hartford will , when completed , express a unity in arrangement and detail , while the structures , distinct in themselves , will be homogeneous and symmetrical parts of a single design . The quadrangles will be three in number , a " great quad " in the center with one on either side to the north and south , the entire frontage being over thirteen hundred feet , the buildings lengthwise in the design being chiefly Dormitory and Lecture-Room blocks with connecting gate-ways , the cross lines containing , in the first section , the Library and the Museum , and , in the second , the Chapel and the Dining-Hall , with intervening tower . The north line of buildings will be composed of the Theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the angle tower connecting the block on the west ; the southernmost line will be formed by the President 's house , and a block containing residences for the Professors . The college is designed in early French Gothic , a style devoid of excessive orna // mentation , and depending for its effect upon simplicity and boldness of detail , and the harmonious grouping of windows and other prominent features . The disposition of broad masses of stone is a characteristic , as well as the very pleasing introduction of objective points of emblematic sculpture . A color contrast in the material of the buildings is obtained by the use of brown-stonecut with a rock face-for the ashlar , which is lighted up by the sandstone from Ohio , used for string courses , and for work about the doors and windows , and introduced with good taste in nearly every interior . In carrying out an extensive scheme like that undertaken by Trinity College , it is seldom , if ever , that the original projectors live to see its fulfillment . This fact was sadly exemplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his were noble words , when , in answer to a doubt expressed as to the accomplishment of everything laid down , he said : " I shall do all I can , while God gives me life , and then leave the rest to others . " The erection of those buildings of most immediate importance was long ago begun , and the blocks forming the west line of the central quadrangle have been commenced under the superintendence of Mr. F. H. Kimball , a resident architect . These blocks are for lecture-rooms and dormitories , and between them stands one of the main gateways . They are each 286 feet long by 35 feet wide , and have their otherwise monotonous sky-line well broken by the roofs of the central portion of the block , which , carried up four stories high , affords on its upper floors additional accommodations for students , the lower stories being occupied by apartments most excellently arranged for Junior Professors , and holding out strong inducements to those gentlemen to cling to their bachelorhood . The plan and the accessories of the Dormitory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from an architectural point of view , but from the plain , practical , common sense which they . exhibit . Each wing , i 19 feet long , is virtually divided into three distinct sections or " stair-cases " by party walls , which are carried from the foundation up through the roof and coped with stone . The advantage of this arrangement , in case of fire , is unquestioned . The wings have each three entrance-doors , opening into halls eight feet wide , and all the entrances are from the east , and , consequently , from the quadrangle . Over the doors light stone will be left in the ; ough to receive sculptured heads of noted poets , philosophers , and statesmen . The ground or principal floor contains a suite of apartments ( for the occupancy of two students ) on either side of each principal hall-way , and , in the arrangement of these rooms , great attention has been paid to light and ventilation . The " Study " looks out upon the quadrangle , and is provided with wir*dows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a novelty in its way , and manufactured from a design much used abroad . The seats with which the deeply recessed windows are provided will , when fitted up with cushions , add much to the interior effect , as well as to the comfort of the room . The Study is i *xi 6 feet and of proportionate height ; two bedrooms are connected with it in the rear , and the suite thus occupying the entire width of the building , a circulation of air through the rooms can be had at all times . Ample closets , both for clothes and for fuel , are provided , and in each study is an open fireplace , with mantel of Ohio stone . Above the ground floor are two other floors with rooms similarly planned ; the second being lighted by dormer windows of stone , very effective in design . Water is brought into each floor , and on the main landings , in the halls , a PROPOSED CHIMNEY-PIECE IN DINING-HALL. // sink is located , having next it a dust shaft , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public buildings . This shaft , for the disposal of refuse , runs down to the basement , by means of which everything passing into it can readily be removed . The hall-ways will be wainscoted throughout and finished in ash , this wood being also used for the finish of the rooms , except the entrance doors , which are of oak . The most ample preparations for bathing have been made in this block , the bath-rooms being located in the basement and easy of access . The wings of the building are alike . The central portion , of increased height , with its gabled roofs and symmetrically grouped windows , and its ornate dressing of stone , forms a marked feature in the design . The gate-way between the block just mentioned and the one to the south will be the middle point of the entire line of buildings , and its foundations are already laid . It will be marked by four corner towers , and will contain an entrance-way for carriages , with smaller ones on either side for pedestrians . The several stories above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish some of the finest rooms in the whole range of buildings . Underneath the gate-way it is proposed to locate at a proper level the steam-heating apparatus . Both in internal arrangement and external desigh the Lecture-Room block , is eminently well adapted to the purposes of its future use , which are to provide the college with a philosophical apartment , a laboratory ; lecture and recitation rooms . The wings of the buildings are two stories in height , the ground floor being over sixteen feet high , and the one above , showing the open truss-work of the roof twenty-one feet high . The basement will be extensively utilized foi apparatus and working-rooms connected with the Laboratory , and in one of the wings the Library and Cabinet will be temporarily located , occupying the basement and ground floors . The design of this block , while in keeping with those adjoining , presents externally a different treatment , demanded by the requirements of the structure . The façades are pierced by pointed windows of effective composition , embodying in their design ample facilities for the admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great abundance to recitation-rooms and other apartments . To avoid any danger which might arise from dampness in the basement , recourse was had to an expedient successfully tried abroad , and the foundation walls were covered with a " damp course " before the superstructure was commenced . All the main entrances to the block are from the quadrangle ; its halls are wide , and staircases of easy ascent , and good solid oak is to be used with great effect in much of the wood-work . One pleasing feature , which we are happy to notice in the design of both buildings , is the extensive use of the English ridge tile in place of the more common iron cresting . It is imported from London , where it is in high favor with the leading architects , and , when set in place , forms a crowning effect , picturesque , and at the same time substantial , and it is to be hoped that the day . is not distant which will number among the manufactures in America this useful and inexpensive ornamentation . The Dining-Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both noble structures , and with the intervening tower , which rises to an altitude of two hundred and forty feet , they will form one of the most beautiful lines of buildings in the whole pile . In a limited space , it is scarcely possible to describe these structures as they should be , or to do them that justice which their beauty of design justly warrants , and , while our description is necessarily general , we will particularize a few of the more conspicuous features worthy of mention . The Chapel is entered through the arch-way of the tower ( which has a finely groined ceiling in stone ) , by means of two door-ways , whose heads are ornamented with sculpture in basrelief , illustrative of scenes in the life of the BISHOP BERKELEY S CHAIR . ( SEE PAGE 609 . ) Saviour . The Ante-Chapel , in which memorial tablets will be erected , is divided from the Chapel proper by a superb oaken screen . The seats will be arranged facing the aisle // of the nave , and behind them , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and other dignitaries . The Sacrarium at the eastern end of the building is elevated to a height equal to that of the stalls , and the altar is reached by seven steps from the floor of the nave , the general effect of the Chapel being not unlike that of those at Oxford University . The ceiling will be groined , and at some future time will be enriched with paintings of Scriptural subjects , and the walls of the Chapel will be treated with polychromatic decoration . Around three sides of the building , and at the level of the window-sills , is an ambulatory , by the introduction of which the appearance of a double wall is produced . The Chapel is45 feet wide and 145 feet long , and will , when completed , be without an equal at any of our American colleges . To descend from spiritual to temporal things , we beg indulgence for a word regarding the Dining-Hall , an imposing building of ample proportions , rich in detail . At its eastern extremity is a dais extending the entire width of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side , and at the opposite end is a " Minstrel Gallery , " arranged in accordance with the longtime custom of having music during the progress of the banquet . In coming years the Hall will doubtless be the scene of social gatherings where music and dancing are prominent features . The entrance to the building is from the great quadrangle on the south . The Hall is wainscoted in oak , and has a beautifully constructed open truss roog and is amply lighted by windows on the sides and by an ornamental rose window at the western end . The kitchen , store-rooms , etc. , are located beneath the main floor . Mr. Burges is especially felicitous in his introduction of symbolic sculpture , and perhaps nowhere is this more noticeable than in the Dining-Hall , at one side of which is to be built an ornate chimney-pPece of light stone . It bears upon its face intricately carved foliated work , in the midst of which human figures , armed and equipped , ar.e represented as defending the hearth-stone from the attacks of intruders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the college , and above , in bold relief are three angels , and on either side , sitting and kneeling figures . The story told in stone is that of the entertainment of the angels by Abraham and Sarah . The Library , as stated above , will , for the l ) resent , be located in the Lecture-Room block , and likewise the Cabinet , until the buildings planned for them are erected . The President 's residence is palatial in its appointments , and from the windows of the reception and drawing-rooms a very extensive and beautiful view is obtained . The houses of the Professors in the same line of buildings are planned with great skill , and in their internal arrangement evince careful study and forethought . Rooms for the Bishop , the Chancellor of the college , are provided in the angle tower of the same block . The most conspicuous feature of the north quadrangle block is the hall for public exercises , denominated the Theater ; but as the immediate wants do not call for its erection at present , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are needed , the blocks forming the eastern line of the quadrangles will be erected , and thus the design will be completed . For the proper presentation of good architecture , much depends upon its adjuncts and surroundings , and no mean effect is due to the sister art , landscape architecture . That nothing should be wanting in this respect , the laying out of the Campus has been intrusted to Mr. Frederick Law Olinsted , a native of Hartford , of whose skill and taste the Central Park , New York , will be a perpetual monument . It is proposed to place the statue of Bishop Brownell upon the terrace in front of the new buildings , and at a point midway in the entire line . This statue is of bronze , ten feet high , and i*epresents the prelate in the act of pronouncing the benediction . It was modeled by Powers in Rome , and was cast in Munich , and presented to the college by a son-in-law of the late Bishop . The statue was unvailed on the old Campus with appropriate ceremonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , and will form a conspk*uous and fitting feature in the landscape . The main approaches to the college will connect with a boulevard one hundred feet wide extending along the front , and the principal entrance to the buildings will be at the gate-way of the great quadrangle on the east , a corresponding gate-way opposite serving as the main exit , beyond which an esplanade , effectively treated with a terrace , will be thrown out to a distance of a hundred feet . The ample tract of land set apart for the Campus will afford unusual facilities for the exercise of artistic taste and good judgment in the distribution of lawns , groves , walks , and other ornamental features // qwq adopted by the older colleges in the country , also gives instruction in particular studies to those students desiring to take a partial course . But the training of Trinity College is not an intellectual one merely ; and the institution , recognizing that there is something above the intellect-something , in reference to which , as a superior part of our being , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who enter her halls ; and , while alive to the fact that too much supervision and too much restraint will fail in the accomplishment of the desited result , still
