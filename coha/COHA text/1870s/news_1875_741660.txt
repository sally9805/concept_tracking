txt The power of State Government has , in too many cases , been considered as unlimited , except so far as the particular Constitutions contained explicit restrictions . Courts have sometimes gone this length in judicial decisions . The distinction is sometimes , made between the powers of the State ' and of the National Government , that while , in the latter , the Government has no powers except those specifically granted , in the former the Government has all powers not specifically withheld . Although this is not , or certainly ought not to be , true as to State Governments , and is a practical denial of any such thing as natural right , it is yet too much the popular idea of State authority ; and we are glad to see that the Supreme Court of the United States , Mr. Justice MILLER delivering the opinion , in an action against the City of Topeka on some bonds , strikes this popular idea a severe blow . lie says : " There is no such thing in the theory of our Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their branches . The Executive , the Legislative , and the Judicial Departments , are all of limited and defined powers . There are limitations of such powers which arise out of the essential nature of all free governments , implied reservations of individual rights , without which the social compact could not exist , aud - which are respected by all Governments entitled to the name . Among these is the limitation of the right of taxation , that it can only be used in aid of a public object  --  an object which is within the purpose for which governments are established . It can not , ? therefore , be exercised in aid of enterprises strictly private for the benefit of individuals , though in a remote , or collateral way , the local public may be benefited thereby . " This is a sound decision and there is need enough of it . The modern notion that government is a machine by which , through unlimited taxation , every project which can be made to appear in the remotest degree beneficial to others than the parties immediately interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the curse and the demoralization of our politics ; and , through the heavy burden of taxation , is destructive of every business that i 's not subsidized . It has piled up a mass of debt , municipal and State , that is simply frightful ; and it yearly draws from the United States Treasury millions of dollars , helping to keep up in every form the taxation that is drawing the life-blood from the depressed industries of the country . Taxation , to a certain extent equal , and generally required to be so by the organic law , is very unequal when considered in connection with the right of suffrage . The man who pays a thousand or five thousand , dollars a year taxes may be no Inure influential in an election , or in a direct vote incurring a debt , than the man who pays only one dollar ; and it may and often does happen that the public benefit , if any , to result from the proposed taxation , will reach the man who pays the one dollar , while not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men out of work will generally vote for any expenditure of public money that gives them a chance of employment , for their taxes are comparatively nothing , and their profit out of the appropriation is clear . We do not mention this instance as a special reproach to these men , for in it they are only doing what many who are not laborers make really the only reason for then being in politics at all  --  they get their living by it . It is human nature to be influenced by selfinterest . Indeed , some honest men persuade themselves that what benefits many individuals , or a class , is , from that very fact , a public work , forgetting that the public , use , which is the only excuse or justification for taxation , should not be partial , but universal , not incidentally , but directly , a benefit to all . If we are to keep democratic government from being a failure , it must be kept within its limitations ; and in no particular is this more necessary than in the appropriations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Justice MILLER says further : " Though the line which distinguishes the public use , for which taxes may be assessed , from the ' private use , for which they may not , is not always easy to discern , yet it is the duty of the courts , where the case falls clearly within the latter class , to interpose , when properly called on , for the protection of the rights of the citizen , and aid to prevent his private property from being unlawfully appropriated to the use of others . A statute which authorizes a town to issue its bonds in aid of the manufacturing enterprise of individuals is void , because the taxes necessary to pay the bonds would , if collected , be . a transfer of the property of individuals to aid in the project of gain and profit ofotliers , and not for a public use , in the proper sense . of that term . " This doctrine seems plain and simple enough to command universal assent . and yet Topeka is not the only municipality , nor Kansas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the device of taxation and in the name of public improvements , into.the pockets ? of individuals . This very evil , as we have said , is not only one of the most corrupting influences in our polities ; it is the greatest reproach upon , and the most dangerous weakness , of our form of government . While in theory one selfish interest is supposed to balance another , and thus the public interest is to be protected , iu fact , selfish interests have been able , by combination , to plunder the people , make partition of the spoils , and do it all under cover of law . It is fortunate that we have a court fearless enough to interpose its defense against this system of public spoliation ; but . to make our remedy complete , Constitutions should be refurniod , and the organic laws , State and National , should put an end by specific limitations , to this confiscation of private property for private uses .                @ @ @ @ @
