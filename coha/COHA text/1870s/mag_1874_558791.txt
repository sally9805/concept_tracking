ART . V. - Sex in Education ; or , A Fair f/ltance for the Girls . By EDWARD H. CLARKE , M. D. , Member of the Massachusetts Medical Society ; Fellow of the American Academy . of Arts and Sciences ; late Professor of Materia Medi&amp;a in Harvard College , etc. , etc . Boston : James R. Osgood and Company . 18T3 . IN this small volume Dr. Clarke takes up the discussion of one of the many important questions of the present day , the education of women , bringing to its treatment the result of considerable experience and that frankness of speech warranted by his position , which , although demanded for the full comprehension of the subject , has often been lacking in the writings of others upon this matter . For the proper consideration of sex in education it is necessary that there should be unreserved mention of certain phenomena which modesty bids should be generally ignored ; but so long as reticence tends to allow the spread of harm , we should gladly welcome any plain words that may help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarke discusses a delicate subject , but , in general , only with what bluntness is required ; in one or two places , however , the earnestness with which he denounces what he considers impending evils runs away with him , and the reader can not help shrinking somewhat at his perhaps overdrawn description of the woman of the future . // 1874 . Dr. Clarke 's " Sex in Education . " But this is a trifling matter ; of the book as a whole , the tone is excellent ; more than that , the lesson it is intended to convey is one of the utmost importance , and the book can not fail to do good ; but we can not help thinking that it would do more good , if we could have had from such an authority a full account of the prophylactic measures to be taken with regard to the health of our daughters , in addition to the warnings , useful as they are in many cases , which the book contains . In the beginning of his essay , IDr . Clarke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , giving a brief and intelligible account of some of the peculiarities of the female constitution ; he goes on to urge that during the years of change from girlhood to womanhood , great caution should be exercised with regard to the amount of study demanded of the growing girl , for whom he recommends a system of rest at regular intervals , so that her brain need not be overworked at a time when there are unusual claims on the constitution , and that thereby such regularity of function be established as may secure a conifortable and healthy womanhood . For the support of his theories hp brings forward a small number of selected cases from his note-book , such as every physician is familiar with in his practice , of women who , by gross disregard of hygienic laws , ruined or enfeebled their health . That American women fade early is a matter of common observation ; but that American women are so well educated that even a rigid following of the maxim Post hoc , ergo propter hoc , can ascribe the many cases of impaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the variations from what would be recommended as obedience to the commands of physiology in the conduct of young girls , we find errors in dress , diet , and mode of life with regard to society and exercise , due to the carelessness and ignorance of both daughters and mothers . That young girls should be denied the use of books , and left to their own frivolity and to greater idleness , would be , in our opinion , a lamentable result of Dr. Clarke 's book , but one which it is to be feared will follow from what seems to us the undue stress laid upon the dangers of the employment of the mind on intellectual subjects . What Dr. Clarke says about the harm that may be caused by excessive // Jan. brain-work is perfectly true , and true of men as well as of women . But it can only be said of the most excessive work , and to forbid well-regulated , moderate study from fear of such extreme consequences is no wiser than it would be to denounce all care of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great while we hear of a man who by longcontinued application to intellectual work has , to all intents and purposes , emasculated himself ; he is as unfit to be a father as an equally overworked woman would be to become a mother ; the harm is as bad in one case as in the other ; but still we do not feel inclined to close our colleges , nor to warn ambitious youths against the deleterious influence of abstruse studies . That there are delicate girls who often show more zeal for their lessons than their hardier brothers is very true , and to recommend the same course of study for both would be as unadvisable as to send them both out of doors to take the same amount of exercise every day in the year ; such girls need to be treated with great care ; their over-ambition may be one symptom of an unhealthy nervous condition , and the physician needs all his tact to determine the amount of brainwork they are to be allowed . But the same care is needed if his patient be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curvature of the spine . Ill health in any form demands particular care that no part of the body should be overtasked , and parents should be cautioned against allowing delicate children of either sex to injure their health by poring over books , as well as by sitting in draughts when over-heated , or by wearing insufficient clothing . The general effect of education we can not help thinking is undoubtedly good , and for girls quite as much as for boys . In the first place , it is absolutely indispensable , if women are at all anxious to adapt themselves for what is demanded of them by men who seek to make companions of their wives , and by their own wishes to be able to understand what is going on about them . To resist the demand that women are making for education is a hopeless task ; but the opposition is doing good work by defining , modifying , and improving the claims that continually present themselves with renewed force . It // is , of course , to be desired that the best methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes with proper severity at some objectionable sides of education , which we shall discuss further on ; but so far as his book has a tendency to throw a doubt on the advantages of study for women , we think it demands correction . For , secondly , study , if properly supervised , that excess may be avoided , gives occupation to the mind at the time of its unfolding , when the young girl 's curiosity is aroused , when she ceases to take an interest in childish things , and when , if worthy objects do not claim her attention , she is likely to devote it to things unworthy . At that time she learns with extraordinary facility , which , it is very true , is prone to tempt her to undue exertion ; but so long as a teacher has the best interests of her pupil at heart , that may be easily controlled , - at least , that would seem the proper course to be followed , rather than the forbidding of all study . The facility she shows , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who very often does not begin fairly to work for some years later , often not until he is busy with professional study , is to be found connected with her greater interest in her studies . If at this time she be taken away from school , it is very difficult for her to do satisfactory work without proper instruction , - we all know the listless way in which girls read history together , - and she is only too ready to transfer her interest from books to fashion-plates , from reading to dancing , from solid improvement to flimsy joys . It is at a very critical age that custom demands that a girl be taken away from school , and when , as is almost universally the case , she is hurried into society , where she goes to half a dozen balls a week , where she meets young men , dances with them in heated rooms to the sound of fascinating music , resting in unobserved corners , talking heaven knows what nonsense to these same youths , we have here a course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quiet home life , regular hours , plenty of sleep , and the active mind employed on truly humanizing occupations , which have at least the one healthy physiological effect , that of making the student forget herself . It is impossible to shut a girl up in a dark room with no employment for four years , and it would seem // to be self-evident that it were better to find such occupation as notoriously distracts the mind from undue reflection on distinctions of sek , - a subject of thought always lial ) le to do harm , and never more than at so susceptible an age , - than to let one 's daughter run riot amid those pleasures which make this especially prominent , with the social ceremonies we have described above , with perpetual twittering about so-called " beaux , " and very possibly careless , indiscriminate reading . There is no need of immuring a girl away from the society of men , but there is a difference between freedom and license . Every physician knows the calming influence that intellectual work exercises over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and we can not help recommending some serious occupation of that sort to girls durine the critical years of their early womanhood , as best worthy of their attention , and , properly managed , most likely to save them from subsequent suffering . While a physician 's experience tends naturally enough to make him look at all mankind , and more especially all womankind , as victims of disease , the fortunately large number of healthy men and women is not to be forgotten ; and while they should all take warning , they should not all suffer for the errors of their brothers and sisters . With what Dr. Clarke says about identical coeducation , we agree most heartily . On page 123 , he speaks as follows - " Let us look for a moment at what identical coeducation is . The law has , or had , a maxim , that a man and his wife are one , and that the one is a man . Modern American education has a maxim that boys ' schools and girls ' schools are one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schobis have been arranged , accordingly , to meet the requirements of the masculine organization . Studies have been selected that experience has proved to he appropriate to his physical development . his school and college life , his methods of study , recitations , exercis Cs , and recreations , are ordered upon the supposition that , barring disease or infirmity , punctual attendance upon the hours of recitation , and upon all other duties in their season and order , max- he required of him continuously , in spite of ennui , inclement weather , or fatigue ; that there is no week in the month , or day in the week , or hour in the day , when it is a physical necessity // to relieve him from standing or from studying , from physical effort or mental labor that the chapel bell may safely call him to morning prayer from New Year to Christmas , with the assurance that , if the going does not add to his stock of piety , it will not diminih his stock of health ; that he may be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical and intellectual dispL y , at any time ; in short , that he develops health and strength , blood and nerve , intellect and life , by a regular , uninterrupted , and sustained course of work . And all this is justified by experience and physiology . " After this model girls ' schools have been arranged , and it is further sought to have the two sexes educated together on the principle which has been found of use for boys , but which , it is feared , and apparently with reason , will be found impracticable for girls . It is found that while with boys there is the uniform capacity for intellectual work , the same does not hold true of girls , many of whom require , while none would be the worse for , a periodical remission of their studies . This is an important fact which it is not usual to bring up in the discussion of the subject ; but it is not fair for those who are hostile to Dr. Clarke 's views of the matter to treat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because generally ignored . Girls who did not follow this regimen would , under the impulse of ambition , run great risk of injuring their health very seriously ; those who did would be embarrassed by falling behind in their studies . At the end of a year they would probably be as far advanced as the boys , or perhaps even further ; but they would always be exposed to the temptation of doing work when they should be resting in order to keep on an equality with the boys , who were not impeded by any such periodical disturbance . As Dr. Clarke says - " The inherent difficulty in the experiment of special and appropriate coeducation is the difficulty of adjusting , in the same institution , the methods of instruction to the physiological needs of each sex ; to the persistent type of one and the periodical type of the other ; to the demand for a margin in metamorphosis of tissue , beyond what study causes , for a general growth in one sex , and for a larger margin in the other sex , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of the reproductive apparatus . " The importance of Dr. Clarke 's views on the subject of the // coeducation of the sexes can hardly be overestimated . The whole subject is one that is just at present receiving a great deal of attentioii , and his contribution is most timely . He speaks ex cathedra , and his words demand respectful consideration , especially from those friends of female education whose ardor at having identical coeducation attacked would seem rather to indicate anxiety to maintain a conspicuous theory than an earnest desire to establish the best possible plan in behalf of women . We are friends of the cause of women 's education , but we consider it of the utmost importance that the testimony of physicians , as well as of teachers , should be taken with regard to the best methods to be adopted . It is no wonder that women repine at the few opportunities for study offered them , when we reflect how many chances are given their brothers ; and it is very natural that they should stretch out their hands for the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , for the same means as their brothers enjoy ; but those who are anxious to adapt what is the masculine method for the greater convenience of women do not deserve to be denounced as traitors to the cause . We fancy that most of the medical profession will be found to side with Dr. Clarke , some , probably , out of sheer conservatism , but many from convictions forced upon them by experience . We agree thoroughly , as we have said , with this part of Dr. Clarke 's book , and commend it to the serious attention of parents and teachers ; and the criticisms that we have made are rather on what is left unsaid on the subject than on any inaccuracies which we have believed ourselves to have detected . The impression we have received from reading the volume is , that too much is laid to the score of overstudy . In one or two brief passages the author refers to other causes , but all the weight of his blame falls on excessive education . In this way we think the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance of a girl 's study being stopped when it might be advantageous , and by other more harmful habits being followed , because they are not denounced forcibly enough by the author . The disposition of the blame seems disproportionate ; overstudy may , and probably does , do harm , but we fancy that its amount is trifling in comparison with that wrought by // some other excesses , which fashion favors , and which parents would do well to consider . Errors in diet , and , more especially , errors in dress , are old stories . Girls who come into the house worn out by the weight of a dress hanging from their hips know , at any rate , that it renders them unable to walk far without excessive fatigne , even if they are nnaware of the more serious consequences which may follow their obedience to fashion . The would-be reformers of women 's clothing , with their wild visions of dresses no longer than a ballet-girl 's skirts , are unable to appreciate the unwillingness of women to adopt a costume so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best motives and after the most approved hygienic principles , by those who refuse to bow to the tyranny of conventionality . But if clothing is to be constructed so as not to do harm to the wearer , the reform will have to begin with the dress-makers . All exoteric plans of dress , however convenient for sawing wood and holding the baby at the same time , are as ineffectual as ridicule and sumptuary laws . It is too much to ask of a modest girl that she make herself conspicuons by a dress unlike that of her companions , simply for the sake of teaching other women how to dress on right principles . She may use her cunning to keep near the fashion without doing herself harm , but she will never take all the steps needed for a thorough emancipation from the prevailing custom . She may assent to everything that is said about it in the parlor , but the reformed dress she will not put on her back until it , too , is in the fashion . It is not so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , as of some more active causes of harm which lie more completely within the parents ' control . Perhaps the most efficient cause of the early decay , or certainly one of the most efficient , is the manner in which almost every girl before she is completely grown up is allowed to go into society . As we have said , she is taken out of school , where her mind has been occupied with subjects that could hardly fail to strengthen her character , to adapt her for meeting the really serious part of life , and plunged into a very giddy whirl of pleasure . This is a subject which demands plain speaking , and we beg to be acquitted of unworthy // motives if we say that , however unconscious the girl herself may be of the consequences , however pure her mind may still remain , it is almost impossible for her to spend her evenings dancing in a young man 's arms , supported by the excitement of the music , the crowd , the general bustle , and listening to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment , without the awakening of the senses in a manner innocent enough in itself , but certainly disadvantageous to the health of a growing girl , who mentally exaggerates the ; importance of all she sees with the quick sensibilities of her age , and who physically can not fail to suffer from the reaction from such excitement . If this is continued night after night , without the repose which might be introduced by some higher interest crowding the petty personalities from the mind , is it any wonder that , after a few months of such a life , girls grow pale , languid , and hysterical ? In no civilized country of the world do girls enter society so early as is customary in America . This is a much more notorious fact than the superiority of female education in this country , and one which , in our opinion , demands the sternest condemnation . And when it is added that every physician knows cases of girls who are really physically unable to go to a party , but who yet rise from their beds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by the excitement , one need not wonder at the many pitiable cases of invalidism of which one so often hears . A girl who has been properly trained about her health , who knows more of the world than does a chit of seventeen , who has grown to healthy womanhood away from such dangerous excitement , is able to enter society , appreciate it at its proper worth , and derive healthy enjoyment from it ; but for young , unformed girls it is likely to be harmful . Still , even going to a party , unadvisable as it often is , is very possibly less deleterious than staying at home to read harmful books , - French novels , for instance . A young girl whose reading is not supervised by older and wiser persons will be very likely to take naturally , not to maliciously wicked books , but to love-stories , which are forever harping on different complications of passion , filling the reader 's head - especially when there is no higher interest to counterbalance them - // with all sortS of ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frivolous . It is not desirable that the young , and especially young girls , who have not the diversity of interests that occupy young men , should be allowed to give themselves up to the fascinations of that sort of literature , which arouses the imagination , and turns the mind towards nothing but the consideration of the emotional side of life . This is not only true of novels , but also , to a considerable extent , of poetry ; and any one who is interested in the matter , and will look over the shelves of any circulating library , from which very many girls are allowed to take any books they please , without any control , except that of their unformed taste , will find little except novels , chosen rather for their newness than from any literary merit , and which are vastly more likely to do harm than any manual of history , grammar , or mathematics against which the note of warning is raised . The harm that they do is by the excitement their interest arouses . The fictitious heroes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , and the reaction from this excitement is very sure to have an injurious effect on growing girls , whose bodies are extremely sensitive to mental influences . It is this fact which renders study , when intelligently conducted , a safer occupation than ordinary reading . Discipline is better than license , especially at the time of life when habits are forming which are to establish either physical and moral well-being or the contrary . The responsiveness of the body to the condition of the mind should not be forgotten by parents and educators . While it is true of men and women , it is more especially true of growing girls at the time when they need the closest care , but when , too , they are most anxious to resist parental authority , and when they are most subservient to the laws of conventionality , especially to those established by their contemporaries . Undue attention to study is a very common cause of neglect of exercise , which is another harmful agent . But while this is true of study , the same may be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl who has danced all night is averse to taking a long walk the next day . She is averse to anything save rest , as is also the case even with // her hardier brother . Men can not follow a reckless course of even the comparatively harmless gayety of parties , without being incapacitated for brain-work the next day ; students at college find it impossible to give proper attention to their studies and enter society at the same time , without overexertion ; and girls who wear themselves out with dancing are as unable to read as they are to walk . But if exercise is neglected the body grows feeble , and the train is laid for all sorts of suffering . In our climate , with its three or four months of torrid heat and its four or five months of fierce cold and angry wind , it requires a great deal of energy on the part of any one to go out simply to get fresh air . In England , perhaps the most fortunate part of the world in this respect , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from going out ; but with us it is very different , in a climate like that of New England , for instance , with 100* and . *20o F. not infrequent extremes . When to this is added the fact that our climate is very stimulating , and so induces almost every one to undertake more work than can be fairly accomplished , without feeling at the time the need of repose , it will be seen that the early decay of American women can not be justly ascribed to overstudy alone ; and that , the external circumstances being so inauspicious , it is doubly our duty to take measures against the dangers introduced by them , instead of conforming to our present practices , which are not only at variance with those of the rest of the world , and mischievous of themselves , but also rendered even more harmful by the peculiarities of the climate . But if girls could be made to brave the manifold horrors of the weather , there is no doubt that they would be healthier . Houses with lofty stairs , hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parties , are not good nurseries for girls . More country life , and plenty , though not too much , of fresh air , would bring better results . It will not be found to be easy of execution , but health will be the consequence . It would seem as if our climate had wrought more change in this secondary way , by impeding exercise , than by its direct effect on the body in causing leanness through the dryness of the air . The last chapter of the essay , called " The European Way , " is very well worth reading . Dr. Clarke gives us , from trustworthy // authority , an account of the way in which German girls are watched during the tender years of growth . Study is not neglected ; it is not generally carried on at school , but it goes on " at home , by means of lectures or private arrangements . These , of course , are not as inflexible as the rigid rules of a technical school , and admit of easy adjustment to the periodical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that society is not allowed to exercise a disturbing influence . The mother , too , has more thorough control over her daughter , and has no hesitation about exercising it at those times when a young girl 's ignorance might lead her into imprudence . With us the whole relation between parent and child is unlike what exists in Europe , and inexperienced girls , unaccustomed to restraint , are very likely to mistake for maternal cruelty what is really only just precaution . But if mothers who are seeking for instruction about one of the heaviest of their responsibilities will consider in the light of their own experience the advice given by Dr. Clarke , they can not fail to find their task made easier . He had in view in writing his book more especially the evil effects of a single cause of harm , and hence what he has to say applies almost entirely to that branch of the discussion alone ; and we trust that this little volume may serve to show those who are forcing girls on to excessive study the risk they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If overstudy is made a scapegoat for all sorts of errors , and girls are forbidden all books that train the mind , and are sent off to parties , having nothing but calls and novels to help amuse their idle time , the chances of general improvement in the health of women seem as far off as ever . But if mothers will remember that study , wisely directed , is one of the best employments of their daughters ' minds which can possibly be found , that it is the best means in the world of counteracting the frivolities of society , that without it a woman , however charming to the eye , is but half fitted to be the companion of an educated man , or fitly to understand her own position in life , they will be the readier to find that the causes of the early fading of their daughters lie much more in the excesses of society than in those of study . Dr. Clarke 's book , it is to be hoped , will bring about some re // form in school-rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we hope that popular feeling will not coutent itself with that half-way measure , when so much more crying evils , which it is the fashion to approve of or to condemu only in silence , demand immediate setting to rights . Some of these we have endeavored to point out in the preceding pages .
