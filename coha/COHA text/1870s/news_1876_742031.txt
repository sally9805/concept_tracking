txt July is the month in which many , too many , things ripen . With blackberries , peaches , and corn we must reckon an agricultural product less cheering to the farmer  --  namely , the joyous grasshopper . In July this frivolous emblem of improvidence sheds his last skin as a mere hopper , and at last emerges , full-fledged and thoroughly baked , with four soft but soon sturdy wings , for the express purpose of carrying despair to the heart and profanity to the lips of the Western farmer . It is during this fine , hot , dry month of August that we are invited to look on at the grasshoppers ' feast . Recent biographers of this boon to man represent him as fully conscious of a rich and much-occupied life only then , when the sun pours vertically down to meet the upward radiance of heat already stored in the parched fields . It is in such weather that he begins to feel himself born to higher things , and , hurling himself upward in the air , is astonished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed with envy by his neighbor , who essays the same , and presently the dry buzz and clatter of a hundred wings inspire all the grasshoppers of the surrounding fields to try the paths of air . Like a rolling snowball , this insect revival gathers force , and soon a swarm arises like a dun cloud , which receives as it proceeds a contingent from every direction , before and on its flanks , until the sun is darkened with the voracious masses , and the plague of locusts settles on the land . If it is curious and somewhat alarming to watch a single grasshopper fall upon a stalk of grass or wheat , chop it down with its strong mandibles , and rapidly devour it end on , what must be the sensations of the owner of harvest-fields to see the apparently sudden irruption of large and hungry millions of grasshoppers upon his defenseless crops 1 This year the first note of warning comes from California . The newest land is experiencing the plague which is as old as Egypt , and which springs from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and Asia . Although called migratory in deference to the natural instinct of attributing bad things to other nations , the winged grasshopper only moves from place to place in obedience to hunger , though the flight of swarms is doubtless prolonged by the pleasurable excitement which movement in great masses gives to the individuals . A late writer attributes their marvelous abundance in certain years to two main reasons , and evidently considers their occasional appearance iu overwhelming numbers an unavoidable necessity . One cause is the abnormal quantity of their especial articles of diet cultivated by the labors of men , and the other is the absence , also due to men , of their natural enemies . These are the two main factors affecting the abundance of many other scourges , among which perhaps the most familiar will be the measuring worms which devour elms and other trees . The natural enemies of grasshoppers are enumerated by the same writer as moles , mice , hawks , and many smaller birds , black crickets , and the long green grasshopper which is usually taken for a vegetarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high estimation . The latter destroy thousands of the wingless young , while the former root out unerringly the packages of eggs which the female deposits au inch or so below the surface of the ground . Farmers are advised to plow up in Autumn the clay and loam soils where dead . females are found , and after searching for the eggs , if that be possible , to turn in swine and turkeys , and trust to the Winter frosts to kill as many of the eggs as are overlooked . Iu late Spring , when the grasshoppers are half grown , it is customary in Southern Russia to use a kind of harrow , made of thorny bushes , to destroy the young insects , and sometimes a combination of a roller and harrow . Some have springs , so that the twigs or thorns fit into the inequalities of the ground . Ditches ' are also dug and swarms of unfledged grasshoppers driven into them and crushed . When the roller and machine are used the practice is to drive it in a narrowing circle , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more certainly crushed . Fires and driving of the insects , whether fledged or unfledged , are not considered of any lasting benefit , wherever they occur in extraordinary numbers . The two favoring causes , then , are vast amounts of congenial food and lack of hereditary enemies . The former is , of course , unalterable while population increases or remains as it is ; the latter want is one of the clearest acts of retribution which human beings are able to bring down upon themselves . The slaughter of birds which gges on all the while in the West is the direct cause of insect plagues , for it is well known that there is no agent so destructive of insects as a bird with young . The destruction of Prairie chickens is prac- tically unlimited , and does not cease during brooding months ; like the buffalo , the prairie chicken has only a certain number of years of existence before it becomes to all Intents and purposes extinct . But it is not only edible birds like the prairie chicken which suffer . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slaughter everything in the feathered line which comes in their way , from the useful insect-devouring crow to the tiniest wren . This is a proper question for Grangers to take up , in how far birds should be protected by effective laws for the sake of their aid in suppressing insects . Nothing could be more appropriate for associations of that sort , and nothing is of more serious interest to farming populations . On purely business principles , the logic would be on the side of the birds , even if a certain amount of grain were necessary to be set aside for them annually ; and for two reasons . One is that if birds increase unduly , they can be made available for food at certain seasons , if that be necessary , while grasshoppers can not ; the other is , that since many grasshoppers go to the maintenance of one bird , it is easier to capture one bird than many grasshoppers . Thus birds save grain , are themselves available food , and save labor , while for the grasshoppers nothing can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with wild honey in the desert , but unfortunately we are not John the Baptists . The fact is that the grasshoppers feast upon us.
