txt Shall we have " good . times " again if the Democratic candidates are elected V According to their own organs and speakers , we shall . According . to all reasonable inferences from the facts which are known to every one , we shall not . So far as our Government directly influences the prosperity of its citizens , it does so for the most part in one of the following ways : By its management of the currency , by its Bare for the public credit , by its demands for taxation and its mode of levying taxes , and by its success or failure in preserving general tranquillity , so far as that depends on the Federal Government . What would be the probable course of the Democrats on these points It 1 . The currency . Nothing is more necessary to a return to prosperity than an honest , open , and steady policy on this question . Have the Democrats any such policy Do they not tend strongly to ode ' that is dishonest , tricky , and vacillating F They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency  --  the Eastern want less . In this strait the party have professed to be resolved on specie payments , and have begun by repudiating the promise of resumption , is that honest Is it not sure to produce confusion if the party regains power , no matter which faction is uppermost ? Auy man who has sense eu.ugh to manage his own affairs knows that he can not got on in business by pretending to adopt one system while actually adopting another ; by professing rigid honesty in one direction and cheating in au -- other ; by making a great show of saving money to pay his debts while at the same moment repudiating his overdue notes . Parties can not safely be dishonorable and treacherous any more than men . If they are , , and the Government falls into their hands , the people suffer . No double-faced party can restore good times . 2 . The ' public credit . Nothing touches our business interest more than that . We are largely a borrowing people . Some of the greatest enterprises in oar country have been started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many hundred millions of foreign money in our railroads , our factories , our city and State improvements , and we shall need more . If our public credit is injured , the money we need will be refused , or loaned only at high rates , and the money we have borrowed will be called for at the earliest day . The Democrats are careless of the public credit . They have struck a blow at it by trying to repudiate the resumption pledge . They tried to pay the United States bonds in paper . They wish now to pay Government debts in depreciated silver . They are notoriously loose in their general ideas an this subject . Moreover , they ( - imbrue in their ranks the only men in our  --  country to whom the public debt is hateful , who regard it , as a monument of oppression , and would be glad to see it repudiated . This class , let us hope , is small , but it will all vote for Mr. TILDEN . Prosperity can not be brought about by a party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Democrats say that they , if they were in power , would not spend so much money as the Republicans have done . What proof have we of that ? It is true that the House of Representatives was willing to cut off expenditures which would be made , if at all , by Republica , ne ; but when it came to expenditures likely to benefit Democrats they wore outrageously extravagant . Take the River and Harbor bill as an example . It sought to squander thousands of dollars in Democratic districts where there was no public need , and where the money spent would be sheer robbery . This was so obvious that the President was obliged to say to the House that had the bill been imperative  --  had it not been left to him to withhold the money in cases where the public necessities did . not require its expenditure  --  he should have been obliged to veto the bill . Why should we believe that the Democrats would be economical with full power when they are grossly extravagant with what little power they now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democracy would be as high as they now are , even with no other demands upon them than now exist . But we know that the pressure from the South for increased expenditure in that section would be irresistible . If TILDEN is elected , the great majority of his electoral vote must come from the South . Is it to be expected that the South will not use the power it would have 7 That is not its habit . Taxes would . be higher under Democratic rule than they are under Republican rule . 4 . Public tranquillity . This ought to be secure under any party . It ought not to be an issue in a Federal election .. But it would not be sure under the Democracy . It is an issue in this election . Col. MOSBY says that the election of a Democrat would " open for the South a Pandora 's box of evils . The very remote prospect , " he adds , " lms already excited hopes and expectations that can never be realized , If such a thing should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South combining with a mere fragment of the North , it would simply revive the old conflict of the sections . " This is plain trath . HAYES might give the South secure peace ; TILDEN could not . HAYES would be free from any obligations to those who are likely to disturb that peace ; TILDEN would owe his election to them . HAYES would have no inducement to tolerate violence , but , on the contrary , to protect his adherents , who alone would be exposed to violence . TILDEN , on the other hand , would be hampered in every : step toward the punishment of violence , because the only ones likely to be guilty of it would hold the political fortunes of a Democratic President in the hollow of their hand . If even the remote prospect of his election has awakened the hopes of extremists in the South , what would . the election itself do No party can bring back pros ' perity which tends to revive the " old conflict of the sections . " These are very simple considerations , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigh them , and decide whether the election of a Democratic Administration would restore prosperity . Whether it would not , on the contrary , tend to disturb business calculations , excite distrust as to the public credit , multiply taxes , and retard the progress of a large and important section of the country .
