VILLAGE IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS . IT may be because the newness of our country and the fragile character of our early structures have prevented the accumulation of inferior , ugly , and uncomfortable houses as the nucleus around which later building has crystallized ; it may be from circumstances which have prevented the isolated residences of the better classes of our l ) eople ; or it may be the result of accident ,  --  but whatever the reason , it is beyond dispute that the United States is par excellence a land of beautiful villages . North , south , east and west , there are plenty of hideous conglomerations of poor-looking houses with an absence of every element of beauty , but there are thousands of other villages scattered all over the land which are full of the evidences of good taste in their regulation and management . As a rule , these more attractive features are very much modified by the presence of badly kept private places or neglected public buildings , and by a general air of untidiness . Still , the foundation of attractiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well-guided control of public sentiment to remove or at least to hide the objectionable features and to permit such beauty as the village may possess to manifest itself . The real elements of beauty in a village are not fine houses , costly fences , paved roadways , geometrical lines , mathematical grading , nor any obviously costly improvements . They are rather coziness , neatness , simplicity , and that general air springing from all these , and from the real love of home . To state the case tersely , the shiftless village is a hideous village , while the charm which we often realize without analyzing it comes of affectionate care and attention . There are villages in New England , in western New York , and all over the West , even to the far side of Arkansas , which impress the visitor at once as being home-like and full of sociability and kindliness , which delight him and lead him almost to wish that his own lot had been cast within their shades . These are chiefly villages where the evidences of public and l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A critical examination would , in almost every case , develop very serious evidence of neglect , unwholesomeness and bad neighborhood . Of late , beginning , I beLeve , in Massachusetts , the more thoughtul of those whose VoL . XIV. - 7. affections are centered in their village homes have united in unorganized efforts to make their villages more tidy , to interest all classes of society in attention to those little details the neglect of which is fatal , and to make the village , what it certainly should be , an expression of the interest of its people in their homes and in the surroundings of their daily life . The first of these associations of which I have any knowledge ( though , as such work is unobtrusive , there may have been many before it ) was the " Laurel Hill Association " of Stockbridge , Mass . It takes its name from a wooded knoll in the center of the village which had been dedicated to public use . The first object of the association was to convert this knoll into a village park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was put in proper condition and suitably surrounded with hedge and railing . Then the broad village street was properly graded and drained , and agreeable walks were made at its sides . Incidental to this , the people living along both sides of the streets were encouraged to do what they could to give it an appropriate setting by putting their own premises into tasteful condition and maintaining them so . The organization worked well and accomplished good results . The Rev. N. P. Eggieston , formerly of Stockbridge , in a paper on village improvements , written for the " New York Tribune , " thus describes the collateral work and influences of the Laurel Hill Association : " Next followed the planting of trees by the roadside wherever trees were lacking . The children , sometimes disposed in their thoughtlessness to treat young trees too rudely , were brought in as helpers of the association , while , at the same time , put under a beneficial culture for themselves . Any boy who would undertake to watch and care for a particular tree for two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other children were paid for all the loose papers and other unsightly things which they would pick us and remove from the street . " Gradually the work of the association extended . It soon took in hand the streets connected with the main street . Year by year it pushed out walks from the center of the village toward its outer borders . Year by year it extended its line of trees in the same manner ; and year by year there has been a marked improvement in the aspect of the village . Little by little , and in many nameless ways , the houses and barns , the door-yards and farms have come to wear a look of neatness and intelligent , tasteful care that makes the Stockhridge of to-day quite a different place from the Stockbridge of twenty years ago . Travelers passing through it are apt to speak of it with admiration as a finished place ; and , compared with most even of our New England villages , it has // such a look ; but the Laurel Hill Association does not consider its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work goes on . Committees are even now conning plans for further improvements . By itself , or by suggestions and stimulations offered to others , the association is aiming at the culture of the village people through other agencies than those of outward and physical adornment . It fosters libraries , reading-rooms , and other places of resort where innocent and healthful games , music and conversation , will tend to promote the social feeling and lessen vice by removing some of its causes . " No one can drive through this beautiful old place without realizing the effect of some influence different from that which has usually been at work in country towns . One feels that it is a village of homes ; that the people who live in it love it , and that it has no public or private interest so insignificant as to be neglected . I have cited this instance somewhat at length , because it was the first , as it is the most complete , that has come to my notice . In other places , more serious work of improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . In fact the idea of preparing this paper was suggested by frequent requests for information and advice on the more practical parts of the subject . At the outset it is to be said that the organization and control of the village society is especially woman 's work . It requires the sort of systematized attention to detail , especially in the constantly recurring duty of " cleaning up , " that grows more naturally out of the habit of good housekeeping than out of any occupation to which man is accustomed . Then , too , it requires a degree of leisure which women are the more apt to have , and it will especially enlist their sympathy as being a real addition to their ordinary sphere of life . The sort of enthusiasm which has led to marked success in the Dorcas Society , and other limited fields of organized action outside of one 's own home , for which American country women are noted , will find here a new and engaging field . This , however , is only a suggestion by the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under varying circumstances . If we assume , which is not altogether true , that the main purpose of village improvement is to improve the appearance of the village , we must still understand that the direct object of the society should not be alone , nor chiefly , in the direction of appearanCe . What it is especially desirable that a village should appear to be is , a wholesome , cleanly , tidy , simple , modest collection of country homes , with all of its parts and appliances adapted to the pleasantest and most satisfactory living of its people . All improvements should therefore have this fundamental tendency , and every element of adornment , and every evidence of careful attention , should be only an outgrowth of the effort to obtain the best practical results . Costly park railing where no railing is needed , width of roadway greater than the needs of the community require , formal geometric lines and surfaces where more natural slopes and curves would be practically better , elaborate fountains or statuary out of keeping with the general character of the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretentious fellow-townsman ) , and isolated examples , as in a church or school-house , of a styleof architecture which would be more appropriate for a city ,  --  all these are obtrusive and objectionable , and consequently in bad taste . In so far as these or any other elements of improvement are unsuited to the conditions in which they are placed , they are undesirable ; and it would be well for those having the interest of the village in charge , to adopt an early resolution to accept no gifts , and to allow no work of construction or embellishment , which is not first of all appropriate to the modest character of a well-regulated country village . If every public building is sufficient for its uses and suggests no undue otitlay for show alone , if the roads and walks are such as the uses of the people require , if the fountain suggests a tasteful ornament and center of freshness and coolness , rather than a monument of some citizen 's liberality and ambition , if the village green or park is a proper pleasure-ground for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that is done , and every dollar that is expended has for its object only the improvement of the conditions of living , then there will be needed only the element of careful keeping to maintain always the best sort of beauty that is possible under the circumstances . No satisfactory result can be attained without organization . The work will necessarily require much money and more time in order to avoid an undue tax upon individuals . It is desirable , too , that , so far as possible* every member of the community should be interested in the work , and should contribute in labor or in money according to his means . This general interest can be secured much better through the influence of an organization in which all are interested , than by any individual effort . // The association should become the distributor , not only of moneys accruing from membership fees , etc. , but of contributions made by citizens , or subscriptions raised by combined effort for general or specific works of improvement . It should be in fact not only the inciter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The precise form of constitution for such an association must necessarily depend more or less on circumstances , and I sketch only as a basis for discussion , the following form suggested by the regulations governing the Laurel Hill Association of Stockbridge . ARTICLE * . This Association shall be called " The Village Improvement Association of ARTICLE II . The object of this Association shall be to improve and ornament the streets and public grounds of the village by planting and cultivating trees ; establishing and maintaining walks ; grading and draining roadways ; establishing and protecting good grassplots and borders in the streets and public squares ; securing  --  a proper public supply of water ; establishing and maintaining such sewerage as shall be needed for the best sanitary condition of the village ; providing public fountains and drinking-troughs ; breaking out paths through the snow ; lighting the streets ; encouraging the formation of a library and reading-room ; and generally doing whatever may tend to the improvement of the village as- a place of residence .

These officers shall be elected at the annual meet . ing , and shall hold their offices until their successors shall have been elected . ARTICLE IV . It shall be the duty of the President , and in his absence of the senior Vice-President , to preside at all meetings of the Association , and to carry out all orders of the Executive Committee . ARTICLE V. It shall be the duty of the Secretary to keep a correct and careful record of all proceedings of the association , and of the Executive Committee , in a book suitable for their preservation ; to give notice of all meetings of the Association and of the Executive Committee ; to make all publications , and to give all public and private notices ordered by the Executive Committee , and to attend to all the correspondence of the Association . ARTICLE VI . It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to keep the funds of the Association , and to make such disbursements as may be ordered by the Executive Committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive Committee to manage all the affairs of the Association , to employ all laborers , to make all contracts , to expend all moneys and generally to direct and superintend all improvements which , in their discretion , and with the means at their command , will best serve the public interest . The Executive Committee shall hold a meeting at least once in each month , and as much oftener as they may deem expedient . The Executive Committee shall have power to institute premiums to be awarded for planting and protecting ornamental trees , and for doing such other acts as may seem to them worthy of such encouragement . They shall also encourage frequent public meetings of the Association and of citizens generally , both with a view to maintain an interest in their work , and for the general encouragement of the habit of meeting for discussion and amusement . ARTICLE VIII . Three members of the Executive Committee present at any meeting shall constitute a quorum for transacting business , and the vote of a majority of those present shall be binding on the Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Executive Committee beyond the amount of available funds within their control to pay it , and no member of this Association shall be liable for any debt of the Association beyond the amount of his or her subscription . ARTICLE X Every person over fourteen years of age who shall plant and protect a tree under the direction of the Executive Committee , or who shall pay the sum of one dollar annually , and shall obligate him or herself to pay the same for three years , shall be a member of this Association ; and every child under fourteen years of age , who shall pay or shall become obligated to pay as before the sum of twentyfive cents annually for three years , shall be a member of this Association .

M. Notice of such meeting shall be posted on each of the churches and at the Post-office at least seven days prior to the time of holding said meetings , and a written notice shall be sent to all non-resident members . Other meetings of the Association may be called by the Executive Committee on seven days ' notice as above prescribed . - ARTICLE XIV . At the annual meeting , the Executive Committee shall report the amount of money received during the year and the source from which it has been received ; the amount of money expended during the year , and the objects for which it has been expended ; the number of trees planted at the cost of the Association ; the number planted by individuals , with the location , the kind of tree , and the name of the planter ; and generally all of the acts of the Committee . This report shall be entered on the record of the Association . ARTICLE XV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the Executive Committee , and shall // protect it for five years , shall be entitled to have such tree known forever by his or her name . ARTICLE xvi . This Constitution may be amended by the Executive Committee with the approval of the majority of the members present at any annual meeting of the Association , or at any special meeting , the notice of which shall have been accompanied by a copy of the proposed amendment , with the statement that the amendment is to be voted on at such meeting . I have provided in the above draft of a constitution for an executive committee of only five members , for the reason that , while . it xviii be comparatively easy to secure the services of this number , the duties and responsibilities of a larger committee would be so distributed that there would be too often occasion for the application of the old rule : " What is everybody 's business is nobody 's business . " The Laurel Hill Association has an executive committee of fifteen , in addition to seven officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest ef a larger number of citizens ; but the same thing may be as well accomplished by inviting the co-operatiof of citizens in the work of sub-committees , the chairman of each of which would be a member of the regular executive committee . In Easthampton , Mass. , there is a board of fourteen directors , and there are committees on sanitary matters , on setting out trees , on sidewalks and hitching-posts , etc . It would be prudent to restrict the number of members of these sub-committees to three ,  --  one from the executive committee and two from the outside . Aside from special executive work , a vast deal has been done wherever iml ) rovement societies have been organized in the way of stimulating citizens to adorn their private grounds , or at least to keep grounds and fences in good order , removing weeds and rubbish from the sidewalk , keeping the grass well trimmed and free from litter and leaves . What most ( letracts from the good appearance of any village is the slovenly look which comes from badly hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about private places ; and it is by encouraging citizens to take a pride in attention to these minor details that the association will do its best work . The result may be accomplished almost entirely without the expenditure of money . It is in attention to little things and in securing the co-operation of J ) rivate oxvners ,  --  a cooperation which will call for an inappreciable amount of labor ,  --  that the most telling work of the officers of the society is to be done . So far as these details are concerned it is hardly necessary in a paper of this sort to do more than call attention to them . They are within the capacity of every citizen , and they will naturally suggest themselves to any person who would be likely to undertake the direction of an improvement association . There are other and really more important objects looking to a certain amount of landscape gardening and engineering , on which specific instruction may be desired-often in cases where it will be impracticable to employ professional assistance . These are as follows : i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of roadways . 3 . The supply of water and the construction of drinking-troughs. 4 . The laying out and adornment of public squares and other open spaces . 5 . The establishment of a system of sewerage or sanitary drainage , including the removal of excessive soil moisture . SIDEWALKS . No one thing has more to do with the comfort of those living in country villages than sidewalks which are good at all seasons of the year . Those fortunate villages which are built on a gravelly soil , with a perfect natural drainage , need little more in this direction than such a conformation of the surface as will prevent water from standing on the footway when the ground is frozen . At all other times it sinks naturally away into the earth . It is much more often the case that the character of the soil or subsoil prevents a settling away of water , or that subterranean oozing from higher ground keeps the earth throughout the spring and autumn , and after heavy rains in summer , damp and often sloppy . XVherever the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinking to a considerable depth of all excessive moisture , there is sure to be a disagreeable condition of the footway whenever the lower soil is locked with frost and the surface is thawed . Even with the best drainage , natural or artificial , this condition xviii exist for a short time while frost is coming out of the ground ; but with good drainage it is of so temporary a character as hardly to justify any expensive finishing of the surface , except perhaps in the case of the most frequented walks . To overcome occasional sloppiness , where the difficulty is not deep-seated , there is no cheaper nor better device than to dress // the surface with coal ashes . Indeed , if these are used to a sufficient thickness they are practically as good as concrete or the best gravel . When first applied they are dusty and unpleasant , but the first wetting lays the dust , and they soon settle to a firm consistency and make a very pleasant walk , with the great advantages of being entirely barren and of preventing the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village are collected and screened , the cinders being used at the bottom , and the surface being smoothly dressed with the finer material , they will make as satisfactory walks , even where the use is considerable , as any other material . The color is unobtrusive , and the surface soon becomes hard enough to bear sweeping . Those who are more ambitious for effect may prefer a walk made of tar and gravel concrete , and this if well made is good , durable and satisfactory . So far as the improvement association is concerned , it can find many ways for expending the difference of cost between ashes and concrete , which will accomplish a much more tellin o result . b If gravel can be obtained without too much cost it may be used with excellent results , to a depth of from one to three inches , according to the porosity of the subsoil ,  --  more being needed where the groun ( l is inclined to become soft . In using gravel it is best either to screen it , using the coarser parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after applying it , to add a thin layer of earth , barely sufficient to ff1 its spaces ,  --  to " bind " it so as to give it a firm and solid consistency . Loose and rattling gravel makes a handsome walk to look at , but an unpleasant one to walk upon . Nothing is more pleasant than well-trodden , dry , root-bound earth , as where grass has been worn away by frequent use ; but this becomes at once objectionable on being saturated with rain ormoistened by melting frost . It is a common impression that all thoroughly good foot-paths must be dug out to a considerable depth , filled with loose stones , and dressed rt the top with some good finishing materal ; but this is not necessary even for the best work . The great point is to secure a thorough draining of the substratum , so that there shall be no r:sing of ooze-water from below , and so that the ground shall be free from such saturation as to cause heaving during frost . This concution may be secured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the use of a well-compacted and tightly bound surface covering of such form as to shed or turn away rain-water . Figure i ( page 104 ) shows the cross section of a footpath six feet wide on slightly sloping ground - where we have to apprehend an oozing of subsoil water from th' land at the highest side . The center of the walk is slightly crowning ,  - -  say one inch higher than the sides ,  --  so that rain falling upon it will flow readily toward the grass border at either side . To prevent the ponding of water at the sides when the ground is frozen , the surface of the walk at its edges should be well above the level of the adjoining ground , but it may be necessary* under some circumstances to furnish , here and there , a channel or surfacegutter across the walk to allow the accumulation at the higher side to escape . Rarely will deep gutters at the sides be necessary or desirable . If the walk is laid at a sufficient height to turn water on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be easy to keep it dry . We will assume that the path in question is to be made over a tenacious clay soil , with a considerable oozing from the hill-side ,  --  the most unfavorable condition that can be found , especially in cold climates . The first thing to be secured is the cutting off of the subsoil water from the hill . This may be done by digging a trench as narrow as possible ,  --  six inches will be better than more , as requiring less filling material ,  --  to a depth of three feet . In the bottom of this drain lay a common land-tile drain , with collars at the joints if these can be procured , and if net , with a bit of paper laid over the joints to prevent the entrance of loose material , and to hold the pipes in place during construction . The ditch should then be filled with cinders , gravel , or coarse sand . If stones are to be used , they should be broken to a small size ,  --  not more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits should be mixed with them in the filling . Very small interstices will be sufficient to allow water to pass freely through , while if large stones are used , with large interstices , there will be danger of a washing in of earth sufficient in time to obstruct both the stone-work and the tile . The smaller the tile , so long as it 13 sufficient for its purpose , the better ; for lengths of five hundred feet or less , an interior diameter of i * inches will be sufficient ; from this to one thousand feet , use i 2 inch bore . If possible , before exceeding this length , secure an outlet for the water in the road-side gutter , or some other channel of exit . The tile-drain , at a depth of three feet , will remove all subsoil water from // under the walk , and all that may be delivered into the loosely filled trench at its side . The loose filling of the trench should not be carried nearer than within six inches of the surface of the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the entrance of surface-water which would soon carry in silt enough to stop its action . Whatever covering is adopted for the walk itself , it must be of such a character as to prevent anything like a free admission of surfacewater . Concrete will do this perfectly , and either ashes , or gravel dressed at the top with ashes , if well raked and rolled at the outset to a smooth surface , will become so bound together as to shed pretty nearly all rain falling upon it . The difference in cost between a walk made in this way and one dug out for its whole width to a depth of two feet , and filled first with stone and then with gravel , and a suitable surface dressing , will be very important , and it is safe to say that the cheaper will be at least as good and durable as the more expensive method . In all construction of sidewalks , whether public or private , regard must be had to the surface conformation , and some device must be adopted for preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , and for the easy deliveryof storm-water falling upon the walk itself . ROADWAYS . THE great expense of Macadamizing or Telfordizing puts these systems out of the reach of small communities . Wherever the original expense can be borne , the subsequent cost of maintenance will be so slight , and the result generally will be so satisfactory as to make it always a good investment . The circumstances under which these costly forms of construction may be adopted will be greatly extended if we can overcome the prevalent American prejudice in favor of wide roads . Against wide s/reefs there is as a rule no objection , though exceptional narrow and well-shaded lanes have a rural charm that will always commend them to persons of taste . A wide street , that is , broad spaces between fences , by no means implies a broad roadway . All we need in the principal thoroughfare of a busy village is such a width as will allow of the easy passing of vehicles in the middle of the road , and the standing of one vehicle at rest at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street of a village by a width of roadway of thirty feet . Under most other circumstances twenty feet of roadway will be ample . This will allow of the moving of three vehicles side by side and will give a leeway of six feet between two vehicles passing each other . On both sides of this roadway , except for the necessary sidewalks , the whole space , to the fences , should be in well-kept grass , which is the cheapest to secure , the most economical to maintain , and the most agreeable to see of all ground covering . It is not unusual in country towns to find a width of from sixty to eighty feet devoted to a muddy , dusty , and ill-kept roadway . From onehalf to two-thirds of this width is waste space which must either remain an eye-sore , or which must entail an undue cost for maintenance . When both sides of the street are occupied by places of business , it may be necessary to provide for some occasional driving close to the buildings for the delivery of merchandise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause any serious damage to grass . If the line of hitching-posts is placed within i 5 feet of the center of the roadway on each side , it will be seldom that any one will drive over the bordering grass , especially if there is , as there generally should be , a well-defined gutter or well-kept grass with a curb-stone border at each side . In considering the width to be given to roadways , it should be understood that every form of road is more or less costly to make , and to keep in order , and that the cost of both items is in direct proportion to the width . If to the cost of making and grading an ordinary roadway sixty feet wide , we add the capital sum whose interest would be necessary to keep this width in good repair , we shall have an amount that would go far toward the construction and maintenance of a road of the very best quality only thirty feet wide . Furthermore , while it is impossible to estimate such items exactly , and while the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the saving in the wear and tear of vehicles , and in the team-force needed to move heavy loads , constitutes an important argument in favor of the best construction . The amount thus saved in the short streets of the village , where the principal traffic is over rough country roads would not be very great , and would enable the road authorities of the township to realize the advantage of first-rate roads and the degree to which the narrowing of the roadway cheapens construction . As a result , there would soon be an extension of the improvement over the more important highways in the country ,  --  // whereas a *vell-metaled width of twelve feet would accommodate nearly the whole traffic and where the proper application of a cheap system of under-drainage would make wellmetaled roads extremely cheap to maintain . In the island of Jersey , there are many excellent roads only six feet wide . These are provided with frequent little bays or turn-outs to allow teams to pass each other . Although such extremely narrow roads are not to be recommended , the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average American dirt road is enormously in their favor . The widest roads in Jersey , leading from a busy town of thirty thousand inhabitants into a thickly settled farmiiig region , where business and pleasure travel is very active , and where excursion cars carrying thirty or forty persons are constantly passing , are only twenty-four feet wide ; often only of this width between the hedge-rows , the road itself being an excellent foot-path for its whole width . Nowhere else in the world is the rural charm more perfectly developed than in Jersey , and no element of its great beauty is so conspicuous and so constantly satisfactory as its narrow and embowered lanes and roadways . This , however , by the way , and only as a suggestion , for the sake of variety . As a rule , we may , at least , accept much less width than is now usual for our country and village roads . Wherever it is intended to build expensive stone roads , those having the work in charge will naturally employ a competent engineer , or will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road-making or to some other authority . Space need not be given here to engineering details which would require a lengthy elucidation . There is , however , a sort of road-making materially more costly at the outset than that now in vogue , but much less costly in the long run if we consider the element of practical value and the cost of maintenance . It depends more on fundamental principles of construction than on special processes of finishing , and will be more or less satisfactory according to the character of the soil and of the covering material available . The great enemy of all roads is excessive moisture , and the chief purpose of all methods of improvement is to get rid of this , or to counteract its effect . As in the case of footpaths , wherever the porous character of the subsoil and the absence of higher-lying wet lands is such that no accumulation of water upon or under the roadway need be feared , the greatest difficulty is at once set aside . Roads lying on such a soil may be over-dusty in dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its frozen condition , they may become unduly muddy , or when the situation is such as to lead hillwater upon them they may be badly washed , but they are free from the great difficulties that beset all roads which for a large part of the year are underlaid by an over-saturated , compact subsoil . Where such natural drainage is secured , no artificial underdrainage will be needed . In many more instances all that will be required in the way of draining will be to lead away the sources of wet-weather springs which break through the road-bed and cause deep sloughs . Where incomplete or partial artificial underdraining is needed , the need is absolute , and whether we consider the durability of the road , or the degree to which its traffic is interfered with by its wet condition , we may be confident that every d ? llar spent in well-directed under-draining will be invested to the very best advantage . The varying conditions of wetness and the different sources of surplus water must be regarded in deciding precisely how much of this work is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be fully considered here , but as a general rule , it may be said that where the subsoil generally is of an impervious character , and where the road is more or less wet and weeping after long rains , a continuous system of under-drains is required . If the trouble is local , here and there in spots , and is obviously caused by the breaking up of springs from the roadbed , such partial work may be adopted as will tap the sources of these springs , and lead their water harmlessly away . Gisborne , one of the best agricultural writers of England , put the case tersely and well whenobjecting to the system of circumventing springs-he said : " Hit him straight in the eye is as good a maxim in draining as in pugilism . " It is best not to pass up at the side of a spring and so creep around behind it to head off its water , but to drive the drain straight through it and far enough beyond it to tap and lead away at a lower level the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all others intended simply to remove subsoil water and not to cut off a weeping stream are best made with common draintiles , laid as before directed , and covered immediately with well-packed earth . Water enters an under-drain not from abovebut from below ; that is to say , as water , from whatever // source , fills the subsoil , it rises therein until it reaches the floor of the drain , when it enters and is led away , just as water falling into a cask which stands on end flows off at the under side of the bung-hole when it reaches its level . Even if the cask be filled to the top with earth , the rain falling upon it will descend perpendicularly to the bottom and will flow off at the bung only when the soil to that level has become saturated ,  --  it will descend through the soil by the straightest course and will raise the general level . It will not violate the laws of gravitation and run diagonally toward the point of outlet as seems to be the general supposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the drain ? " is first considered . When we drive a drain through a spring , and into the water-bearing stratum which feeds it , we simply make it easier for the water to escape by the drain than to keep on at the higher level and break out at the surface of the ground . As in the case of the sidewalk illustrated FIG . I. in Figure i , in cutting off a continuous weeping or ooze from higher land , it is best to introduce a vertical filling of porous material through which the water will descend and enter the drain , but , excepting this single instance , all that we need to do , so far as subterranean work is concerned , is to furnish an easy and sufficient channel for the removal of subsoil water . What constitutes a sufficient drain is something very much less than what is generally supposed . In ordinary agricultural drainage , where the lines of tiles are forty feet apart , a well-laid tile i * inches in diameter is sufficient for a length of 1,000 feet-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filtration from an acre of land . If laid with only an inclination of six inches in one hundred feet , its delivery will be so rapid as to amount to more than a heavy continuous rain-fall upon this area . In road drainage , the same rule would hold true ; but as the soil offers a certain resistance to the rapid descent of water , it is best to give a means of outlet at smaller intervals , and for the best work in roads thirty feet wide or more , three drains could be used with advantage . In no case , however , need the size of pipes be larger than above indicated , if the form of the tiles is true , and if they are well joined together at . their ends . Tiles of less perfect form had better be 1 I* inches or even 2 inches in diameter ; but , as a rule , they should not be of a larger size , for the reason that the amount of water that they may be expected to , carry will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow is concentrated within a narrow channel . Figure 2 shows the cross sectionof a country road thirty feet wide , with three lines of tile-drain laid at a depth of about three feet below it . Except in case of necessity , these drains should have an inclination of not less than six inches in one hundred feet . There is no objection to their having more than this wherever the lay of the land permits or requires it . They may often have considerably less in case of need ; but the smaller the rate of inclination , the greater the care needed in securing a true grade . The water of these drains should be collected into a single drain and led away at intervals of from five hundred to one thousand feet . It may be delivered into a road-side gutter , or into a collecting under-drain , according to the requirements of the situation . It is now possible to procure drain-tiles at reasonable cost in almost all parts of the country , and these are not only very much better than any form of stone-drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the labor of preparing and handling the stone , and of excavating the wider trench that stone requires , amounting to more than the cost of the tile , even with a high charge of transportation added . Incidentally , it is proper to say that where tiles can not be had , a mass of gravel or fine cinders , six inches wide and six inches deep , placed at the bottom of the drain , and covcrcd wi//i well/acked so ? is preferable even to broken stone or any other form of channel that would Dermit of the rapid running of water FIG* 2. // and the washing into the drains of even a slight amount of silt . The removal of excessive subsoil moisture being secured , attention should next be given to the surface of the road , which should be finished with the firmest material at hand ,  - -  with the common earth of the subsoil where nothing better can be afforded ,  --  and which should be brought to a true grade , with a vey slight slope from the center to the edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center above the level of the edges should not be more than four to six inches , and the grade should be made on a straight line rather than on a curve . If the road is made as flat as the turning off of surfacewater will permit , it will be traveled upon in all its parts ; while , if it is crowned to a high arch , as is often the case , it will soon be found that the best place to drive is in the middle of the road , and foot-tracks and wheel-tracks will soon form slight channels or ruts which will lead water lengthwise along the road , and which will cause an undue amount of wear and washing . A road may be actually flat to the eye , and equally convenient for travel at every part of its width , and still have enough lateral slope to cause water to run off from it . It is especially desirable that no surfacewater flowing from the road-side ( above all when frost is coming out of the ground in the spring ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be effectively prevented by the formation of sufficient gutters , with such outlets as will prevent ponding at the sides of the road . When it is necessary to carry the water of the gutters from one side of the road to the other . culverts should be provided , and wherever the slope of the road is sufficient to cause water to flow along it lengthwise ,  --  that is xvherever the inclination is more than about one in fifty ,  - -  there shoLld be frequent slight depressions from the center diagonally toward the gutters to carry the flow away before it can accumulate sufficiently to form a washing current . If it can be done without hauling additional material it is always well to raise the road-bed somewhat above the level of the adjoining land , and this may usually be accoml ) lIshed by throwing upon it the subsoil of the gutters . Ii no case should surface-soil sods or fine road-mud be used for repairs . The most serous objection to the absurd system of road-mending so common in this country lies in the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing back upon the roadway of the soft and unsuitable material which has been washed into the gutters . What is said above applies especially to country roads , but it is appropriate , so far as it goes , to the better-made and betterkept roads of a village . In the case of these latter , except where the soil is naturally dry and firm , some attention should be given to the improvement of the surface , and it is to be considered whether to adopt the expensive process of covering with broken stone road-metal , or to use gravel . One or the other of these is desirable in all cases where there is much tendency to sloppiness in wet weather ; but any form of artificial covenng is so costly that the early efforts of the improvement association will produce a more telling result if applied in other directions . The necessary cross-walks may be satisfactorily made with coal ashes . It is even more easy in a village than in the country , to have the grades of all roadways so regulated as to shed rain- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished with side gutters so as to prevent water from the road-side from running on to them . The simplest way to effect this , and the neatest way too , is to make gutters outside of the line of the road , say six inches deep and eight feet wide , these being at once sodded or sown with grass and grain to give an early protection against washing ; made on such a shallow curve , they will afford no obstruction to any system of mowing that may be adopted , while their great width will give them sufficient capacity to carry away the water of considerable storms . The work of construction having been duly attended to , it is no less important to provide for regular and constant care . Any rutting that comes of heavy traffic in bad weather should be obliterated either by raking or , better still , by filling the ruts with gravel or ashes . If such work is attended to immediately on the occasion for it arising , the amount of labor required will be very slight ; for it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time saves nine . " If the filling of ruts and wheel-tracks be ( lone in time , the serious damage that comes from guttering flows of water lengthwise along the road may be almost entirely avoided . The mere cleaning work of both the roadway and r$ ) ad-side grass spaces , it will be easy to induce children to perform for slight rewards and encouragement . The daily removal of bits of paper and other rubbish // will have an excellent effect on the general appearance of the village . In the autumn the removal of the fallen leaves will call for something more than children 's work ; but ordinarily this source of cheap labor will be found sufficient if properly directed . PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY . As a field for encouragement , rather than as an object for the expenditure of the association 's funds , the furnishing of an ample supply of water is entitled to very early consideration . Not only is the question of public health very seriously involved in the water problem , but as a mere beautifying element an abundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very telling effect by the facility it gives for preserving the fresh appearance of lawns and shrubbery , and for the cultivation of flowers and vines . Regarded from the horticulturist 's point of view , the climate of pretty nearly the whole of this country is simply detestable . We may arrange to withstand very well the severity of our northern winters . We expect an entire shutting up of all garden industries , and long cold seasons are an accustomed matter of necessity ; but we have never yet learned to accept with patience the almost annual destruction of our lawns and gardens and flower-beds by scathing drought . No public water supply available for an ordinary village would suffice to overcome the effects of a dry season over the whole of even a small homestead ; but we may hope to secure enough to keep one or two small sprinklers flowing steadily through the hot months , and so keep a little grass measurably green , and preserve a semblance of life and beauty in flower-beds and delicate shrubbery . It is very rarely that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to equal in its effect a half-hour 's rain ; but the difference between towns where even the small amount of water is available for the garden and those which are hopelessly given over to drought shows how much may be accomplished in this direction even with limited means . As in the case of road-making in anything like a complete and thorough manner , the providing of a water supply must necessarily be directed by professional advice . Although the simpler principles of hydraulics are sufficiently understood , and although it would be quite within the ability of a number of the more intelligent men of any village to secure and distribute a satisfactory amount of water , the cost of doing such work in an experimental way by persons unaccustomed to its details , as compared with the cost of doing it under the direction of an engineer whose natural judgment and capacity are supplemented by experience and skill , would be without doubt far beyond the fee demanded for his services . In this case , as in many others connected with public and private works , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . Very likely-perhaps indeed very generally-the actual performance of the work , the buying and laying of the pipe , and all that , can be as cheaply done under home direction as under that of a public contractor ; but the making of the plans  --  the deciding upon the source of the supply , upon the means for securing a sufficient head , the sizes of the pipes , the location and construction of fireplugs , and all the minor details of the workwill be more or less economical , according to the skill , experience and capacity of the person who directs it . The sources from which water may be obtained are various . Often enough water of the best quality may be procured by driven , dug , or artesian wells , but whenever this course is adopted , the wells should be located far enough away from the village , or on land sufficiently high , to make it impossible that there shall be any fouling of the water-bearing strata by the filtration from barn-yards , privy vaults , or cesspools . Generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated reservoir by some mechanical force . If the demand is to be a large one , and if the community can afford the cost , the most reliable plan will be to use steampower for pumping ; but in smaller places , and where economy is a great object , windpower may serve an excellent purpose . If a stream of pure water is available at a sufficient height , it may be led directly to the reservoir , or its current may be used to drive a water-wheel sufficient to do the pumping . In a majority of cases there will be found at no great distance a stream capable of supplying the water needed throughout the dryest season of the year , but not entirely free from organic impurities . In such cases it is often feasible , by excavating a filtering sump or pump-well at a little distance from the side of the stream , and at a sufficient depth below the level of its bed , to secure a supply tolerably purified by filtration through the intervening earth . The distance at which this sump should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on the character of the soil . The more porous this is the greater should the distance be . This question as to the source from which the water is to be taken is one which more than any other calls for experienced judgment . Frequently , the conformation of the surrounding country is such that even where there is no constant stream it is possible by the construction of dams to pond an amount of water , to be furnished by surface washing , sufficient to supply the demands of the longest drought . In this case , as in all others where reservoirs are used , it is important to have a good depth of water , and not to allow , even toward the edges , any considerable shallow area . So far as possible the depth should be everywhere great enough to prevent vegetation , and in all the shallower parts the surface soil should be entirely removed . As a rule there should be a depth of at least fifteen feet of water , except near the very edges of the pond , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of water for private use is a simple question of construcLion , but as a matter of taste , too vehemei*it a protest can not be entered against the common misconception as to what is desirable in the way of public fountains . An instance in point is furnished by the public drinkingfountain in Newport . Some years ago there stood at the foot of the Parade a grand old stone bowl , hewn out of a solid block of granite , and filled by a pipe leading from a copious spring . This was a good , sensible , substantial drinking-trough , perfectly adapted to its use , unpretending and handsome . Later , a public-spirited gentleman , desiring to leave a monument of his regard for the city , gave a considerable sum to be used in providing a suitable drinking-fountain at this point . Those who had the control of the fund lacked either the good taste or the courage to refuse to expend it , The result is that this granite horse-basin-one of the best of its sort-has been removed to an obscure position , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of bad architecture and bad statuary such as form a conspicuous defacement to the public squares of Philadelphia ,  --  where they serve the double purpose of furnishing water to the people , and advertising a cheap clothing establishment . The one compensation for the violation of good taste inseparable from these constructions is to be found in the fact that they must , sooner or later , lead the public to realize the absolute unfitness of cast-iron for monumental and decorative uses . With the artistic influences which are now so active in the instruction of the American people , it is not perhaps unreasonable to look forward to the day when all of these piles of pot-metal shall be relegated to the scrap heap , and when less offensive fountains shall take their place . We may even hope to see the iron statue and its stove-like support which supplies water to the horses of Newport condemned to the foundry , and its solid old predecessor restored to the position which it ornamented for so many years . A wide margin may be allowed for the exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private munificence enables the expenditure of a considerable sum , a good amount of exterior decoration may be admissible ; but it should always be borne in mind that so much of the outlay as is needed for the purpose should go to secure a good artistic design . Especially should the use of cast-iron be avoided , as being from every point of view , and under all circumstances , whether in the shape of cast-iron dogs , or deer , or attempts at the divine human form , absolutely and entirely inadmissible for artistic uses . Better a dugout log horse-trough , overflowing through a notch at its side , as an ornament to the bestkept village green , than the most elaborate pitcher-spilling nymph that was ever cast in an iron-foundry . So far as the mere construction work of public drinking-fountains and horse-troughs is concerned , not much need be said except in connection with the overflow . In cold climates there is apt to be from all such structures a spilling of water which covers the ground for some distance with ice . This may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the surface of the water through some well-protected channel directly into a drain in the ground at a depth beyond the direct action of frosts . If the stream is constant , this depth need be nothing like that to which frost penetrates into the soil , for the constant movement of the water will prevent its freezing even if covered only a foot deep , though to something more than this depth it will be desirable to have the metal pipe inclosed in a larger pipe of earthenware ,  --  giving a space of inclosed air . The work of landscape gardening and sanitary improvement will be considered in future papers .
