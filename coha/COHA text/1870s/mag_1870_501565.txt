A FEW days after my arrival for the first time in the United States , I was present at a large open-air meeting , not political , in Westchester county . There was a band there , and the band was making preparations to open the proceedings of the meeting with music . A distinguished American friend who was nearmesaid : " You must expect to hear a good deal of Hail Columbia ' and The Star-spangled Banner'to-day . " The crash of the instruments cut him short in his remarks , and the band began to play " Tommy Dodd , " the delightful popular air wherewith London streets and squares , London musichalls and hurdy-gurdies , were ringing and squeaking as I left the English capital two or three weeks before . I was standing under the glorious sun of an American autumn and under the flag of the Stars and Stripes ; and here in my ears was the music of Bloomsbury and Islington , of the Strand and Covent Garden ! The first day I walked down Broadway I saw the walls placarded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows of the bookshops told not merely of Charles Dickens , and George Eliot , and Charles Reade , but of Edmund Yates and Annie Thomas , and other minor novelists , too , with whose works I was not unfamiliar , but whose names it seemed odd to see thus blazoned in the streets of New York . Could one help being a little disappointed ? This then is only London over again ? I felt for the moment like somebody in one of Xavier de Montepin 's refined and cheerful romances , who flies for novelty to some place distant from Paris , and on the first day of his arrival there is confronted by so many familiar costumes , sights , faces , fashions , that he exclaims in surprise and disappointment , " Mais , mon . Dieu / here is the whole Boulevard des Italiens over again ! " In plain words , my first impressions of New York and its society were tinged a good deal with the odd blending of disappointment and delight which one feels when he finds that the strange land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar place he has left behind . It was only after some stay in this country and some considerable intercourse with Americans that I began to observe the points of dissimilarity , other than mere superficialities , which distinguish the American man from the Englishman . Of course the superficial differences-those of manner and appearance-are obvious and general . We can all distinguish at a glance the average and typical Englishman from the same class of American or Irishman . You know the man 's nationality by his face just as you would by his accent . But it would be hardly worth while occupying many lines of THE GALAXY 'S page in descanting on the fact that certain outlines of face and tints of complexion are more or less peculiarly American , or English , or Irish , or French . I think a stranger from the Old World living here for some time begins gradually to appreciate certain differences between Englishmen and Americans which are deeper and more interesting than the merely superficial , and which yet do not go so deeply down as to affect that profoundest basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . If one could dig far enough into the substance of our earth , he would , I suppose , after having pierced through many strata of various composition , come at last to a region of central , equal , and unvarying heat and pressure . So in human nature thedepths of emotion and passion , the regions of the central heat where character is primarily formed , are // doubtless alike everywhere , and recognize no distinctive disturbing influeijce of nationality . A man with a peculiarly fine and delicate ear once said to me that when he heard the language of genuine emotion , either on the stage or in political declamation or in common life , he could no longer detect the peculiar accent of the speaker ; the intonation seemed to be just that which the listener 's own voice would naturally have given . Thus the profounder impulses and realities of human nature lose in their expression all the mere distinctions and peculiar characteristics of nationality . But between the surface and the centre of character there are national differences and dissimilarities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should like to cover a few of these pages with some remarks on certain of these dissimilarities between American men as they are found in these Northern States , and Englishmen as they are found in the great cities of London , Liverpool , Manchester , and other such places . Perhaps I may lay some claim to impartiality in this matter , inasmuch as I am no more an Englishman than I am an American , and consider myself qualified to be as calm a critic of England , where I have lived nearl*y all my working lifetime thus far , as of America , where I am still , a stranger ; and that I have hardly found myself excited to national prejudice or partisanship , except when there is question of my native country , which I have not seen for ever so many years , where I have not now one single tie of blood interest or pecuniary interest , and where it is utterly improbable that I shall ever live again . Is it rather an absurd thing to think of applying any general and common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Californians , to New York and Maine , Pennsylvania and Illinois ? Perhaps so . Yet I venture to think that a man may observe far broader dissimilarities of habit , and character , and speech , who travels from Cornwall in England to Dundee in Scotland , or from London to Galway , than he can find in journeying from Broadway , New York , to Montgomery street , San Francisco . To begin with , all Americans speak the same dialect . Maine finds no shadow of difficulty in talking with Nebraska ; the most refined Bostonian is in no perplexity about making himself understood if he stands at the door of the rudest log-cabin by the Missouri . But a Cumberland peasant and a Somersetshire peasant can hardly find any mode of verbal communication , and neither could understand or be understood by an average literary man from London . The difference between the Northern and Southern States of the Union is not after all nearly so great , so far as national characteristics are concerned , as the difference between England and Ireland . The on* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pacify Ireland lies in the fact that the moods and ways of the one country are almost hopelessly unintelligible to the other . Great Britain is very little and the United States are very large ; but it w6uld , I think , be possible to give a tolerably precise idea of the general characteristics of the American in smaller space than would be needed to do the same for the Briton . We have all read , and heard , and said a great deal ( assuredly not too much ) about the beauty of the American woman . Let me say that I think we have not generally heard justice done to the face and figure of the American man . In every theatre , public meeting , social gathering , railway car , one finds quite a surprising number of handsome , bright-eyed , finely-made American men-Americans of the true and unmistakable type . In some parts of the West a stranger in one of the railway cars might suppose himself to be journeying in the companionship of giants . Frederick William of Prussia might have looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I have seen travelling together in various of the Western States . Look . at the public men of these Northern States , the eminent men  --  the poets , orators , statesmen , journalists , authors : what a remarkably large proportion of them are of handsome face and noble presence ! To come to a different sphere of life , look at the conductors of the railway cars : what fine faces and manly figures one sees among them . There is a type of manhood-and , in its way , a splendid model-which America alone seems to be developing , which is not seen anywhere else , so far as I know , and which , when I was newer to the country , used to fill me with interest and surprise . I mean what I may call , for lack of a more precise and expressive phrase , the American-Fenian type of man . I speak of the man of immediate Irish descent who has seen service and acquired a soldierly bearing under the flag of the United States , and who is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fenian meeting is held there  --  the man *itli the bright , humorous eyes and the short nose of the regulation Irishman , but who has acquired much of the keen intelligence of expression which belongs to the American ; who wears the soldier 's thick moustache , and has exchanged the easy-going , lounging , devil-may-care ways and gait of his own people at home , for the erect , energetic , defiant bearing , compound of soldier and brigand , which makes him look like a figure from a drama . Half a life , a whole life of service in the English army , under all varieties of climate , from Quebec to Calcutta , and from Cape Town to Gibrab tar , does not convert the Irish peasant or artisan into anything like that . He is to Mickey Free what Fra Diavolo is to Dick Turpin  --  the same idea glorified into a picturesque , statuesque , dramatic , melodramatic expression . To come back , however , to my comparison between Americans and English . men , it has seemed to me that the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less talkative than the latter . The common English idea that American men are generally inquisitive and loquacious is surely an odd sort of error-curiously the reverse of truth , as Carlyle would say . I have travelled through several States , have made the great Pacific journey , and more lately spent weeks and weeks of almost incessant going about in railway cars , and I declare that during all the time I only met with two inquisitive men . One was so amusing and eccentric a figure , 50 absolutely the sort of person a caricaturist would adopt in a book or a comedy as a representative of the whole manhood of Yankeedom , that I can not resist the temptation of giving up a few lines to an account of him . He was a lank , dry , gray-haired , keen-eyed man , and I met him in a hotel on the edge of Lake Champlain . The day was one of unmitigated snow , and sleet , and slush ; and my friend and I found ourselves standing at the door of the hotel looking hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very cold ; I said it was very cold . He eyed me curiously , and said he guessed I was not used to so much snow ; I assented . Came from the South . perhaps ? No , indeed ; I came from England . " I want to know ! Travelling for one of the big English houses , perhaps ? " No , indeed . In trade , somehow ? No ; not in trade . This seemed to surprise him : he could not quite understand what but trade could have brought anybody so far away from home . In answer to another leading question or two , I admitted having come to the United States for pleasure ; whereupon he brightened considerably , believing apparently that he had found the right track , and he remarked that many Englishmen had great estates in England . This I acknowledged to be a fact . And then he s'posed I had much real estate in England . No-none at all ! Was very rich , anyhow ? No ; not rich at all-quite the reverse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculations . He could not " fix " me , evidently , and I was resolved to let him puzzle out the matter for himself . Presently , a new idea flashed upon him . He had heard that the younger sons of our English lords often did n't have many dollars of their own-was that so ? Yes ; that was so . Ah , perhaps I was one of them younger sons ? Alas , no ! There was an end of that conjecture : that way of explaining the strange phenomenon of a man not in trade and not rich travelling across the ocean for pleasure had proved a failure . He shifted his ground , and by patient questioning found out that I had been to California , and had travelled about in several of the Western States this side the Mississipp . Then , with a glance of triumph which seemed to declare that he had got it at last , he put it to me whether I had not been speculating in land . No ; I knew nothing about land , and had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly fell , and before he could collect himself for a fresh spring I escaped , leaving him to puzzle over the mysterious appearance as a tourist in America of a Briton who was not rich , was not a lord 's son , was not in trade , and was not looking after lots and land . Perhaps if his keen , inquisitive , restless old eye should ever fall on this page , he may learn that a literary man can often travel as a tinker does , and pay his way by jobs of work along the road . Anyhow , this man and one other were the only inquisitive beings I have encountered during my journeyings thus far through the States . People seem to me as a rule more generally silent here than in England . I found myself much less often invited into conversation by strangers on a journey than would have been the case at home . But I find American men , when they do talk , much more effusive and demonstrative than men are in England . The unemotional , impassive manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to find little favor or imitation in this country . A stranger who is introduced to an Englishman is often inclined to regard the Englishman 's tone and deportment as indicating a hope that he may never see the stranger again ; and very likely the stranger is entirely mistaken , and the Englishman is thinking how he can best be of service to him . On the other hand , may I hint that a stranger is apt to be a little misled by the warm and demonstrative nature of the reception occasionally given to him by Americans on whom he has no particular claim , and who quite naturally forget all about him five minutes after his back is turned , but who nevertheless greeted him on his introduction to them with an eager warmth of welcome which seemed to promise eternal friendship ? I do not know how to explain the fact , but it seems to me indisputable that the Americans who are thus individually so much more warm and demonstrative than Englisl*men , are collectively much less so . An American political meeting is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of gathering in England . A lecturer of universal popularity comes before a large audience here . He is greeted with a faint murmur of applause . His finest points , his most stirring passages only awaken a repetition of this murmur . In Eng* land he would be applauded to the echo that should applaud again . Oddly enough , in the great , robust , full-blooded West , audiences are even more reticent and undemonstrative than here in the East . One of the brightest and most popular lecturers in America , an acknowledged success everywhere , told me the other day that her heart sometimes sank within her at the cool composure of her Western audiences , and that she never could tell by their manner whether they liked her or did not like her-although her list of engagements and her receipts must have made it pretty clear to her that her listeners were not unappreciative. // When first I saw Mr. Booth play , I was lost in wonder as to how he cQntrived to play at all to such a house , which hardly rewarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilling , invigorating applause . On the other hand , I am convinced that American audiences in general listen with a far closer attention and keener appreciation than English audiences do , and that the very silence and quietness which to a stranger seem so chilling , are in reality the best compliments which a listener can pay to the speaker . All American men seem to me to be fluent talkers when they have occasion to talk . There is no halting for a word , no stammering and beating about ; but a man , whether he speaks well or speaks ill , will at all events speak right on , and say what he has to say with unbroken rush and fluency . I need not say that fluency is the rarest gift among Englishmen . The ordinary Briton , when called upon to address a public meeting , even though he is in the constant habit of performing such a feat , will stammer and boggle , hem and haw , as if that sort of thing were a necessary accompaniment of all public speaking . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit as if it were an adornment of eloquence . The late Lord Palmerston , who could speak , and speak well , for any number of hours on almost any subject , used to introduce a sort of stammered grunt , or such semiarticulate interjection , after almost every other word . Disraeli has the same trick to a lesser degree . Robert Lowe 's speaking is all stammering , and stuttering , and awkward interjection . One of the greatest charms of the style of Gladstone and Bright is an absolute freedom from this detestable peculiarity . The average of public speaking is infinitely better in America than in England ; but I think we have a few speakers in England who , for force and originality , for the combination of argument and eloquence , perfect ease and unstrained power , for variety of illustration , for depth and breadth of culture , have not an equal number of rivals in the United States . Words mean more-do they not ? - with Englishmen in general than with Americans . Em Won ' , em Mann , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says he means-that and nothing else . Much of the misinterpretation of the character of American public life which prevails in England is probably to be clearly traced to the extravagance of expression in which American newspapers and speakers so commonly indulge . Take up an American paper-any paper , almost , of to-day  --  and observe how it will speak of some public man on the opposite side of a political question . Might not the unaccustomed stranger naturally and fairly suppose that this public man was , at least in the sincere opinion of the writer , one of the most abandoned villains who ever made a trade of political profligacy ? Yet the writer does not really think anything of the kind , and has not the slightest notion of the words being taken au tied de la let/re , as they assuredly would be in Eno land . Opponents in politics and journalism are far more familiar and friendly with each other here than in England . There two men may face each other in the House of Commons for twenty years , making public allusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period , and yet not have the slightest private acquaintanceship-not have even a bowing acquaintanceship when they meet in the street . In London , the probability is that the editor of one daily journal does not know the editor of another daily journal by sight . Yet the political opponents will always allude to each other publicly with a demeanor of respect , and anything like an insinuation of want of integrity is the rarest thing possible . An English public man often believes in his heart of hearts that his opponent is a scoundrel , and detests him accordingly ; but he never publicly says or suggests // this . In America , a man quite commonly suggests or declares that his oppohent is a scoundrel , while privately he regards him as a very worthy fellow , and is de .. lighted to meet him in society . I had not been long in New York when I met in the apartments of one of the most distinguished of American or other journalists a gentleman holding a lea ding position on the editorial staff of a rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced every other day , openly and by name , in language such as English journalists would hardly employ to describe the most abominable of miscreants . I remember Louis Blanc once expressing to me his surprise at the harshness with which English journalists habitually assail political opponents . He insisted that in France all men , of whatever party , would admire and respect the talents of a Gladstone , a Disraeli , or a Bright , and that a journalist , criticising any such nan , would , in whatever severity of comment , make it apparent that he could appreciate his genius and acknowledge the worth of his character . But the harshest commentary ever made by the most reckless partisan print of our days in London might be regarded as base flattery when compared with the sort of abuse which American newspapers quite commonly shower on their political opponents . The thing is only intelligible at all when one recognizes the fact that a far less precise value is attached to the meaning of words here than among Englishmen . Indeed , the ordinary Englishman of to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of obvious and purposed exaggeration essential to a certain kind of humor , is usually lost on him . He either fails to understand it , or he sets it down as lying . Such an Englishman , when he travels for the first time among the peasantry of Naples or the south of Ireland , comes almost at once to the conclusion that he is among a population of liars . Every little extravagance of protestation , or welcome , or narration , appears to him just a lie , and nothing else . England has produced probably a larger number of great and true humorists than any other country in the world . The very word " humor " is hardly susceptible of translation into any other language . Yet nine out of ten Englishmen seem absolutely devoid of the faintest sense of humor , while nine out of every ten Americans are apparently brimming over with it . I suppose all people endowed with a quick sense of humor are prone to exaggeration . Is it not in the " Spectator , " or in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole fun of his story would have been lost if he had made the brim of somebody 's hat two inches narrower I I think the national spirit which stimulates and appreciates the humorous extravagances and exaggerations of Hosea Bigelow , and Artemus Ward , and Josh Billings , and Mark Twain , has a good deal to do with the grotesque absurdity of the unbridled abuse which American journals so often pour out on American public men . Is there not a much greater amount of what I may call sentiment in the American than in the Englishman ? The majority in England failed to understand the course taken by the citizens of the North during the late civil war because they had not the least conception of the strength of the Union sentiment . No creature living has less sentiment in him than the average Englishman ; an*.l no creature living is less endowed with that dramatic instinct which enables one man to enter into the inner feelings of another and a differently-moulded man . A familiar term of contempt in England is to call some complaint a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly demolished and annihilated any case of complaint when he has called it a sentimental grievance-as if was b s the power of sentiment . any power in political affairs ever half so strona a Now I think Americans in general have a good deal of sentiment in them ; and 10 // I think the possession of this quality will prove to be the great soui'ce of their success , as the lack of it among Englishmen has proved to be the great source of failure , in moulding alien creeds and races into their own political system . I am not very proud of the part played in American political life by the vast majority of Irishmen , and I am not a great admirer of the party which has contrived to monopolize their votes and services . But I can not help being impressed by the dramatic skill with which the American Democrats have succeeded in inducing the Irish citizens , almost to a man , to follow their banner . The thing was done in the first instance by recognizing and appreciating poor Paddy 's national sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Irish harp that he thought he heard the echoes of Tara from the regions of Tammany . Foreigners in England remain foreigners always ; nay , a Scotchhman in London is never anything but a Scotchman . For no Englishman ever troubles himself to understand or enter into the feelings of a stranger . A national or other sentiment is to the regular Anglo-Saxon only something so ridiculous and stupid that he will not even give himself the pains to ask what it means . The feeling with which Americans regard the flag of the Union is quite unknown in England . An Englishman , it is needless to say , will fight for his flag , and nail it to the mast , and die for it , if need be , when it is threatened by an enemy , because it is the symbol of the home , and the State , and the people that really are the object of attack ; but in ordinary times he has no feeling whatever about it . Nor has he anything like the sentiment towards the place of his birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between New York men , Boston men , Chicago men , and so forth , are without any parallel in England . No Englishman born in Bristol or Liverpool has any very thrilling pride in the growth or prowess of Bristol or Liverpool except so far as he and his are immediately and practically affected thereby . There is very little in England of that feeling of filial devotion which is almost universal in the Northern States of America . The family supper-table at which three generations are represented , and which one may see anywhere and ei*erywhere here , is now a rare and strange phenomenon there . A mother-in-law is in England a nuisance , and nothing more . I have often been struck by the fact that so much of the poetry of the late civil war was so purely sentimental in its character . I do not remember having heard or read a single genuine war-song  --  a song breathi.ag the gaudium certaminis , or even the fierce passion of the patriot in arms ; a song such as Korner might have written , or even one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Light Brigade . " Such ballads of the war as I have heard were rather , indeed , pure and pathetic protests against all war ; songs embodying the strong , gentle heart 's regret for the home-circle , the mother , the wife , the child  --  the mother coming in for the largest share of tender recollection . Indeed , there seems to be a wonderful depth of tenderness , as well as of humor ( I suppose tenderness and humor always go together ) , in the American i*ature . My friend Edmund C. Stedman 's charming little poem , " Pan in Wall Street , " has a symbolic truth in its fanciful picture . Even in Wall street old Pan , the true-hearted god , the divinity of simple Nature , still lives . It is tine that one who goes about in America does hear the dollar talked of infinitely more *oft*n than money of any kind is spoken of in England . I nevertheless hold that sociat life in the United States is everywhere moistened and sweetened by an **nderflow of sentiment which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arid English system . I never knew an American who had not almost on the surface a contending , contrasting play of gleams of sentiment and // flashes of humor . Quick receptivity is doubtless a special chara:teristic of the American n*in4 . Did any one ever see or hear of an Ame4can who could fairly be called dull ? I , at least , have not yet met such a creature . In almost every possib1* way , socially , morally , and politically , Americans seem to me to be distinguished from *nglishmen by the ab*ence of the influences of caste and traditional privileg* , which in England are almost ubiquitous , almost omnipotent. *efor*i and progress with an Englishman mean the unmaking of oki laws , the nawinding *f old cQils , the bursting of old chains . Reform with Americans seems to mean the introduction of new legal mechanism , to reduce disorcier into order . The tendency in *ngland is to reduce legal restriction dQwn to its very minimum , relbrruers there believing that human nature can generally be trusted more freely than class legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for generations , and almost from the beginning of our judicial and legal systems , q*r English laws have been made by a class , and as the nation grows it finds itself compelled to shake off *ucces*ive coils of unwise and partial restriction . " Something is wrong here , " says the American ; " let un , the nation , make a law to set it right . " " Something is wrong here , " says the Englishman ; " the fault must be in some measure passed long ago by this or that class or party ; frt *s try to get rid of it . " I happened lately to be conversing with an American friend about systems of taxation , and I learned for the first time that p*opl* in this city are only informed by a public and general notification that their taxes are due , and then they are bound to go and pay them , or else- ! I thought *f our rate-collec*to*s at home in England , who believe themselves lucky indeed if they can get the amount due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's door . I tried to picture to myself an Englishman seeing a general notice in the papers that everybody 's taxes were due , and thereupon walking over to the p*b*ic Qf&amp;ce and paying the money . I have not a very high-soaring imagination , and my fancy %ZQuld not reach this flight . My friend , on the other hand , could scarcely understand my surprise . " It i5 our business , " he said , " to go and pay the taxes ; it is not the business of the public office to keep sending after us ; the taxes ? . re our owp , and we are bound to pay them . " Fancy an Englishman talking in this sort of way of a tax ! Why , we all regard the , tax-coflector as our natural enemy ; an a creature to be dodged , denounced , ridiculed ; as a being who has no rights we are bound to respect ; between whom and us the laws of morality and commercial integrity have no binding power whatever . Seriously , a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that until very lately the great m*jority of the people of England had little or nothing to do with the making of the laws which they were to obey , and the imposition of the taxes they were to contribute . It is not so much a sense of universal equality that seems to me to nialce itself evident in American society , as the sense of universal ownership or copartnership in the state and its  |p05-sessions  . Every American man appears to me to proclaim after his own meaning the L'it*t c'es ( mof/ maxim . The late civil war nw*t have do*e mt*ch to strengthen and deepen this feeling . Who are affe*ted directly in *nglan4 by a war ? Two classes : the aristQcracy whos*e eons are the ofli*cers , and the poor whose sons are in the ranhs , . " The English ar*ny , " said a brilliant young memher of Parliat*ent , Mr. George Trevelyan ( nephew of LQrd Macaulay ) , " is the up of the froth and the dregs of English sqcjety " ; and the ren*rl , c wan almo.nt literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nhs ; only tht. rich s*d officers to the mess-table . The whole bullc of the lower " niidcUe class " in *gland are practically unaffected by a war , exce , pt , of cour*e* an to tM paying ? * // heavier taxes . We have not had any very prolonged experience of w*r in this generation , but the Crimean campaign and the Indian mutiny gave us some taste of its quality , and we all know that the mothers who watched , and wept , and prayed for their sons during each terrible crisis lived for the most part in Belgravian mansions and great country houses , or in village cottages and city garrets . The middle class had little part in the suffering or the triumph . Now , I can affirm that , in a wide and varied intercourse with Americans , I have hardly known a single family which had not some relative , or relatives , more or less distant , engaged in the recent civil war . All this must modify incalculably the manners of a people . It must produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and utterances of daily intercourse . Of course it has its magnificent virtues , infinitely transcending any possible disadvantages ; but it has disadvantages too . " I own the State as much as you ; I help to run the machine as well as you . I am your equal . Therefore I owe you no reverence . ' * Does not this feeling express itself commonly in the manners of American men ? One observes a striking absence of reverence for authority or for personal dignity ; a constant tendency to make irreverent comments on personal weaknesses or defects . A man , however gifted and meritorious , can hardly afford to be ridiculous in America . Little eccentricities in the appearance , dress , and manner of certain public men , which are the constant theme of observation , ridicule , and caricature here , would hardly be noticed in England . I have often wondered whether a man with so many defects of manner , awkwardnesses , and eccentricities as Lord Brougham had , for example , could ever have obtained a high position and great popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social toleration of individual peculiarities and oddities in England than there is here ; and I doubt whether a man might not more safely indulge in extreme opinions on any subject there than here . The manner in which some one who has expressed , or is reported to have expressed , any opinion distasteful to the majority , is set upon by newspapers and hounded at day after day , is something quite unknown among the forms of social persecution in England . I dare say this sort of thing makes a fine bracing atmosphere in which the strong of lungs and constitution are tried and further strengthened . I am ready to admit that it may be a splendid ordeal by fire , which the sublimely fearless nature will brave and triumph over ; but I am quite with Burke in his distrust of human systems which depend for their existence upon the heroic virtues ; and I fear the man of average character will be apt to keep his opinions to himself or to think with the majority , or not to think at all , if such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . Take , for example , the career of an Englishman who is regarded with profound respect in America , I mean Mr. John Stuart Mill . On nine out of every ten questions of great public interest , social , political , moral , and religious , Mr. Mill entertains and uncompromisingly expresses opinions which are opposed to those of the vast majority of the English people , high and low , the Belgravian , the Bohemian , and the Philistine . On some of the gravest questions affecting humanity Mr. Mill 's views are regarded by th' majority of his countrymen with genuine dread and positive detestation . Yet , although , of course , he has been bitterly opposed , and stupidly misjudged , and sharply assailed , I am not aware that a single sentence was ever directed against him which could fairly be regarded as insulting or offensive . Respect for the unquestioned purity , sincerity , and intellect of the man mitigated the manners of his opponents , nor permitted them to be too fierce . But only suppose the case of any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // opinion , acting in this country the part Mr. Mill has always taken in Englapd , and say whether he would not have needed strong nerves to hold his own against the storm of denunciation , abuse , and ridicule ! How the hostile papers and parties would vilify and slander him ; how they would invent nicknames of opprobrium for him ; how they would ridicule his personal appearance , and rake everywhere through his past life to find out whether he had not at some time or other done something which he ought not to have done , and which it would pain him no ' 7 , ' L* have made publicly known ! Of course , men of the heroic stamp , of the *taml. of Mill , would endure all that , even as such men do endure it here ; hut the tendency of such a system is undoubtedly to suppress all individuality , to make men think , or at least pretend to think , in platoons , to compel opinion to follow a word of command , and enable the ignorant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have little observation indeed who can not already discern the influence of this kind of thing upon American men . Of course I do not regard the public as identified with or responsible for the extravagances of certain journals , but such extravagances could not float at all except in an atmosphere much wanting in the element of reverence for personal character and the dignity of individual manhood . I spoke of this once to an American friend , a man * great ability , culture , and thought , well acquainted with his own country and with England . He admitted that lack of personal reverence is one of the penalties to be paid for individual equality of rights , and copartnership in power ; but he pointed out that there was something to be said too on the side of the irreverent . In England , he went on to argue , it was quite easy to make a parade of admitting colored people to social equality ; the colored people there were so fe*v that they could not possibly come in anybody 's way , or create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political or social distinction between races , he yet maintained that there was a much greater excuse for the man who would keep the negro in a moral Ghetto than there could be in England ; and the Englishman has no right to pride himself upon a heroism which costs him nothing . So of certain extreme opinions and their advocates . In England every great question is looked upon as fundamentally settled . There is a solidity , or even a stolidity of public opinion , which makes it utterly impossible that the most supremely endowed reformer could bring about any radical change except by the slowest creeping steps of gradual innovation . Philistinism may sit securely behind its intrenchments and smile composedly at the utmost efforts of Mill or anybody else to disturb the foundations of any social institution . But here things are quite different . Everything is on trial , everything is possible . No scheme so extravagant , no social or moral innovation so daring ; but it may succeed with a rush , and sweep all before it . Therefore we must make allowance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter and passionate vehemence with which people who are opposed to and afraid of certain changes try to shriek down and scare away anybody , however worthy of personal respect , who makes himself the advocate of changes at once odious and possible . I fully admit the force and justice of much of this reasoning ; but still , as one recording merely his impressions of facts as they are , I retain the belie.f that there is more reverence for personal dignity and more toleration of individualities and eccentricities among Englishmen than among Americans . One sentiment of reverence the American certainly now has to a degree far beyond that which is manifested by Englishmen  --  the sentiment of reverence for woman . Much as I had read of the politeness and deference shown to women by all classes of // Americans , I had not by any means realized the *elf-*acri1lcing thitalry with which the American everywhere defers to womanhood . Fiench politeness to woman I hold to be a mere grace and nothing more , having or not having any reality beneath it , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads of the F*encbman 's exquisite courtesy to *oman , he is reminded of the praise bestowed on Louis the Fourteenth , because he raised his hat when passing the serving-maidens on the steps at Versailles , while the same Louis would , to gratify the idlest whim , drag the women of his own family on dreary journeys , over dusty roads , for a whole day together , no matter what their condition of health , and without allowing them to stop even a moment on their toilsome way . But American courtesy to woman is a genuine , practical article , although it springs from what may be called a mere sehtiment ; and I confess I think it not merely lends a gentleness and beauty to common daily life , but is an absolute necessity for the preserMation of the finer parts of man 's character in a country where existence is so much of a constant struggle and turbulent rushing movement . Of course , the freedom with which men and women mingle together in this country , is a source of almost perpetual wonder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible but for the strength and reality of that chivalrous feeling of deference to woman as woman which is found among American men as among the men of no other country of which I have any knowledge . I presume this sentiment will not survive the establishment of perfect political equality between the sexes ; and slight as this fact may seem , it is one of the only things which would make me at all regret what is called the enfranchisement of women . One can not but see that the moment a woman in this country emerges from what tradition and prejudice regard as woman 's sphere , she is subjected to just the same irreverent and vehement criticism with which a public man is assailed . I do not know that this would do the woman any special harm , but I think American men can ill afford to lose a sentiment of reverence of any kind . Even superstitions sometimes have a sweetening and purifying influence over certain characters , and it is probably better on the whole to feel some reverence for a wooden idol than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not find American men in general convivial personages . I do not find that eating and drinking are regarded as means of social enjoyment here , in anything like the fashion of the old country . The " perpendkular system " of drinking which Dickens speaks of , is surely the most cheerless and unsocial form of potation known to mortal beings . Every one , American and other , assures me that there is a great deal of drinking done in these Northern States . Perhaps so ; but as in this paper I am giving only my own impressions , right or wron* , for just what they are worth , I must say that , so far as my observation goes , Americans are the soberest race of men under the suil . No Englishman who is not a professed teetotaller ever dreams of dining without a glass of wine or ale . Mr. Parton 's question about the probable potations of the Coming Man would in England seem almost as absurd as if he were to speculate on the problem whether the Coming Man will wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the habit is to accompany dinner with nothing but ice-water , unless when a set and formal dinner-party is given . Look round the dining hall of any London hotel or restaurant-so many diners , so many glasses of light wine , or stout , or ale . Look round the dining hall of the Fifth Avenue Hotel , New York ; the Parker House , Boston ; the Continental , Philadelphia ; The Sherman House , Chicago ; the Russell House , Detroit ; the Cosmopolitan Hotel , San Francisco-anywhere , // everywhere you will find the ice-water the rule , the wine or beer the rare exception . Teetotalism is a strange phenomenon among cultivated Englishmen ; ' almost as strange as immoderate drinking , which is now , I am glad to say , a very unusual thing among such classes of men in England . But the tendency in these Northern States seems to be towards the erection of teetotalism ii1to a virtue : that is to say , into something indispensable , unquestionable , on the need of which no controversy can arise , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England clergyman on this subject , and , endeavc*ring in a feeble way to plead the cause of moderation , I asked him if he had not observed during his travels in Germany that decent , well-conducted men and their wives sat pleasantly together in their beer gardens and sipped their beer , and that no excess came of it . He said he had seen such things , and had not observed any excess ; but he assured me in all seriousness and earnestness , that the sight of a married pair drinking beer together was to him simply disgusting and revolting-like the sight of a husband and wife committing some crime together . Doubtless , this was a teetotal profession of an extreme kind ; but the tendency of the moral code in the Northern States seems to me to lead in that direction . The Puritan element still forms the basis of most characters here ; and the man of the Northern and Northwestern States has to my thinking less of the sensuous about him than any other man of any other nation with which I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his art , his literature , the joy of the senses has little part . He eats and drinks to nourish his frame ; he amuses himself ( when he does amuse himself ) in.some easy and healthy way ; he reads books which have a good purpose in them , and likes pictures which illustrate a moral story . The deep , absorbing joy in a beautiful sight because it is so beautiful , rarely indeed makes manifest its presence here . I think Hawthorne was the most UnAmerican of all Americans . He was to the ordinary American what Savage Landor was to the ordinary Englishman . May I say that , to a stranger , this peculiarity often presents itself in rather a cheerless sort of way ? Of course , the social habits of certain classes in New York and Boston are hardly different from those of similar classes in London ; and let me say , in passing , that I am delighted to find that the abominable custorn of sending the ladies upstairs after dinner , while the gentlemen draw their chairs together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than even in England . But in country houses , and in many city homes too , when the rather early dinner is succeeded at oi*ce by tea or coffee , and then the rest of the long evening goes on without a solitary glass of wine to enliven host and guest , and give new freshness to conversation , is n't it , now is n't it-as Rosa Dartle would say-just a little cheerless ? I hope no eartiest teetotaller will deal with me , as some terribly earnest teetotallers did the other day with my friend Bayard Taylor , and set me down as an advocate of the immoderate use of strong drinks , because I put in this mild plea in favor of one or two genial English fashions . This at all events is to be said in favor of English ways , that if almost every Englishman drinks wine or beer at dinner , no Englishman whatever , above the level of a coallaeaver or a costermonger , walks into a bar-room at midday and swallows ardent spirits . The bar-rooms of the Fifth Avenue Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be useless institutions in hotels of that class in London . The persons who alone would be likely to visit the hotels are persons who would never think of presenting themselves in a bar-room . But the very existence of the bar-room and the " perpendicular system " only tends to confirm me in my opinion as to the remarkable absence of the sensuous // in the composition of man 's character in the Northern and West*rn States . When a man drinks , he drinks to satisfy a certain craving , to supply a certain supposed necessity ; not for the joy of drinking and the sweetness of prolonged sensation , The Viennese with his yard or so of thin , bright beer , nay , the Neapolitan over his coffee , illustrates the delight of sensuousness far more strongly than the American drinker of cocktails or rum punches at the midday bar-room . Beyond doubt , the habitual unfluency ( if I may use such a word ) of Englishmen in conversation , explains to some extent the necessity of the occasional stimulus in their social intercourse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his talking ; and he finds , as Macaulay says of Addison , that wine unlocks the spell which chains his tongue . The American man seems to need nothing of the kind . When he chooses to talk ( often , as I havQ said already , he is habitually reticent ) , he can always talk with force and freedom . I declare that I have never met with an American who could not talk well in private . I am even still constantly thrown into surprise and admiration at the readiness with which every one can express his ideas , and the way in which he seems to have all the ideas arranged and classified ready for use . How slowly , hesitatingly , by fits and starts , in random glimpses , an Englishman allows you to know what he thinks on any subject ! How readily , deliberately , exhaustively the American pours out all he knows , or at least all he chooses to say ! I spent an evening lately in a city , not New York , at the house of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the evening alone . He told me he wished to talk with me , and compare impressions on certain subjects . We talked for hours , and I know that I have never had a more delightful conversation . His frank way of going directly to the heart of a subject and setting forth his views with .. out any reserve ; his complete command of his ideas and his words , actually inspired the other party to the conversation with something like ease and freedom of expression ; and so we talked , and the hours went on . I doubt if it would be possible for two Englishmen , not previously acquainted with each other , to have thus deliberately set about an exhaustive interchange of ideas without an utter and ignominious breakdown in the conversation as the immediate result , and a cordial desire on both sides for escape on any terms of humiliating capitulation . There are of course almost innumerable points of comparison and contrast between the American of the Northern States and the Englishman . on which I might descant if time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , however , what I have thus far explained , I have only to say that my observation shows me the American as at once more humorous and more sentimental , more habitually reticent and yet far more fluent of tongue , more sober and less sensuous , less endowed with reverence for personal dignity and toleration of individual eccentricity , less precise in the use of words and more given to exaggeration , more intellectual in face and nfore " subjective** in mental temperament than his English brother . Let me add that I think the difference between an American and an Englishman is slight and superficial indeed , when compared with the differencer*about which I shall venture on some other occasion to offer a few observations , ' between an American woman and an English woman . JUSTIN MCCARTHY .
