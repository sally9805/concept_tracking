PREFACE . The dramatic trifles which compose this volume have been selected from a large collection , written during the last five years for charitable purposes . One , " Stand by the Flag , " was prepared for the first entertainment given in Boston for the benefit of the United-States Sanitary Commission , at the breaking-out of the Rebellion , and was successfully performed on that occasion by the Ballou Literary Association of Boston . The others have been prepared for various literary societies with which the author has been connected , and all have received a favorable reception . The plots are simple , and easy of comprehension by the most inexperienced amateur . The stage-directions are carefully noted ; no scenery is required ; the furniture and properties can be readily supplied ; and all of the pieces can be represented in the house or exhibition-hall . The " stage-struck hero " who aspires to Richard or Hamlet will find here little to feed his ambition ; but to those who desire an evening 's entertainment with private theatricals , or to the teacher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little volume may be a welcome assistant , and , should it afford entertainment , will feel himself amply compensated for venturing to place it before the public .

Lounge , Easy-chairs , Vases and Flowers , all arranged with taste . Entrances r. and l . ( Enter Mr. Horton , l. , with his watch in his hand . ) Mr. Horton . Mr. Horton Nearly ten o'clock , and Sylvia still away . What can keep her all this while ? It 's not more than ten minutes ' walk to the post-office , and she has been gone nearly two hours . The house seems deserted : I 've wandered from cellar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular stampede ( looking off r . ) . Ah ! there 's some one at last . Here , Bessie , Bessie ! ( Enter Bessie , r . ) Where the dickens is everybody ? Bessie . Bessie Bray I 'm sure I do n't know , sir : it 's as much as I can do to look after my own little body , without troubling myself about everybody . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Where 's Sylvia ? Bessie . Bessie Bray Gone for your paper . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Where 's Arthur ? Bessie . Bessie Bray Gone fishing , the booby ! Mr. H. Mr. Horton Booby ! Why , bless my soul ! you and he have not been quarrelling , I hope . I thought you were the best of friends . Bessie . Bessie Bray Oh , yes , indeed , the best of friends ! I 'd like to box his ears . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Box his ears ! Why , Bessie ! What for ? Bessie . Bessie Bray The great silly goose ! he must go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Our Arthur in love ! Ha , ha , ha ! That 's too good ! Bessie . Bessie Bray But I say it 's too bad . Mr. H. Mr. Horton But who is he in love with ? Bessie . Bessie Bray With me . Mr. H. Mr. Horton With you ? And you want to box his ears for that ? Bessie . Bessie Bray To be sure I do . What business has he to fall in love with me ? Just as we had begun to have such sport at croquet and boating , he must needs transform himself into a lover . Lover , indeed ! I do n't want him sighing and groaning about me : it spoils all the fun . Mr. H Mr. Horton You do n't like him , then ? Bessie . Bessie Bray Yes , I do , and that 's why I complain : I want a playmate , and not a lover . What 's the use of trying to play croquet with a man who 's afraid of beating you at the game , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who rolls his eyes as though he were going into a fit ? If ever I hear Arthur sigh again , I 'll box his ears ; you see if I do n't . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Where is he now ? Bessie . Bessie Bray Gone off fishing . Ha ! ha ! ha ! if the fish get sight of his dismal face , good-by to his luck . Oh , I do hope he 'll tumble into the water ! Mr. H. Mr. Horton Why , Bessie ! Bessie ! do n't talk so . Do you know , Bessie , that this is what I most desire ? When your poor mother , dying , bequeathed me her daughter , I confess I was not much pleased with the legacy ; but as the years have rolled away , and I have seen you growing up by the side of my own dear girl , bright , happy , and affectionate , my old heart has warmed to you , and it would be the dearest wish of my life to call you daughter . Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your adopted daughter ? Mr. H. Mr. Horton Oh , yes ! but I join with my son in wishing to make you really one of the family . Bessie . Bessie Bray Oh , dear me ! here 's another wants to get me married . I 'm sure I do n't know what I have done to make you so anxious to get rid of me . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Why , bless me ! Bessie , you 'll be nearer than over , you 'll  --  Bessie Bessie Bray ( interrupting ) . Oh ! here comes Sylvia . Please do n't say any thing more . Sylvia Sylvia Horton ( without , r . ) . Not a step , sir : I will not allow it . ( Enter , r . ) Here , father , here 's your paper . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Why , Sylvia ! who is that you are driving away ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Only Mr. Lyford . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Only Mr. Lyford ! Why , dear me , child , you must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling ) Lyford ! Here , Lyford ! ( Sylvia runs after him , and brings him down , c . ) Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Now , stop , father , if you please . Mr. Lyford is my property ; and as I do n't choose to have him come in at present , you will oblige me by not interfering . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Why , I should think he was your slave . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Well , he is . Mr. H. Mr. Horton What ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton I take his word for it ; he 's told me so fifty times . Bessie Bessie Bray ( aside ) . He 's another booby . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Well , but , girl , what has kept you so long ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Oh , father ! there 's such dreadful news : our troops have met with a terrible disaster and have been driven back to the Capital in disorder . The whole country is in an uproar ; new troops are called for ; and , oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. H. Mr. Horton Bless my soul ! ( Seats himself at table , r. , with paper ) . The cowards ! Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Cowards ! No indeed , father , it is not cowardice ; bad management has caused this disaster . The brave men who could so readily spring to arms at their country 's call can not be cowards . Oh , I wish I was a man ! Bessie . Bessie Bray You silly thing ! what 's the use of wishing that ? Catch me in any such scrape if I was a man . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Why , Bessie , have you no patriotism ? Bessie . Bessie Bray Yes , indeed ; but I do hate cannon-balls and Mr. H. Mr. Horton ( who has been reading paper , starts up ) . Bless me ! this is terrible news . I must go to the village : I may be of some assistance . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Oh , do , father , urge the men to go ! You know how to talk to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Yes , yes ; hunt up all the blankets , socks , and flannels about the house : I will soon return . ( Exit , r . ) Bessie . Bessie Bray Oh , dear ! here 's an end to all our fun . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Fun ! why , Bessie , how can you talk so ? Where 's Arthur ? ( Enter Arthur , l. ; he has a basket in one hand , a fishing-pole over his shoulder , and clothes and face are liberally sprinkled with mud . ) Bessie . Bessie Bray I 'm sure I do n't know where he is : the last I saw of him he was up to ears in love . Arthur Arthur Horton ( coming down , c . ) . And the last I saw of him , he was over ears in mud . Bessie . Bessie Bray Good gracious ! what 's the matter ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Why , Arthur ! where have you been ? Arthur . Arthur Horton At the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The soil was rather soft ; so I did n't stop long . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton How did it happen ? Arthur . Arthur Horton It 's all along of that girl ( with a sigh ) . O Bessie Bray ! Bessie . Bessie Bray Me ! Why you have n't been committing suicide ? Arthur Arthur Horton Well , not exactly , as " I still live . " Sylvia . Sylvia Horton At the bottom of the stream ! I do n't understand . Arthur . Arthur Horton Neither did I till I got there . It 's all very veil " going down to the sea in ships ; " but going under , in a muddy stream , is not just the sport I like . Bessie . Bessie Bray Did n't I tell you not to go fishing ? Arthur . Arthur Horton Oh , yes ! you 're always telling me what I do n't want you to ( with a sigh ) . O Bessie Bray ! How could you say  --  Bessie . Bessie Bray You 're a goose ! Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nearer the truth , This all comes of your hard-heartedness . I 've ruined my clothes , and caught the influenza ; and it 's all for love of you . O Bessie Bray ! How could you say  --  Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Arthur , you must go and change your clothes directly . Arthur . Arthur Horton So I will : it will give me a better appearance , and no doubt be more comfortable . O Bessie Bray ! may you never suffer the torments which agitated my frame as I sat upon that high rock by the side of the stream ! Musing upon your obdurate heart , I was composing a few lines to express my heartsick feelings . I had arranged but two ,  --  O Bessie Bray ! How could you say ,  --  when a gigantic eel ( was n't he a whopper ! ) fastened himself upon my hook , and drew me from my lofty porch and lofty thought . I lost it . Bessie . Bessie Bray What ! the eel ? Arthur . Arthur Horton The eel ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lofty seat too . Ha , ha , ha ! Arthur Arthur Horton ( crosses , r . ) . Oh , mockery ! That laugh is torment to my lacerated soul . Farewell ! I leave you forever . ( Exit , r . ) Bessie . Bessie Bray Ha , ha , ha ! Poor fellow ! Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Poor fellow ! what is the meaning of this , Bessie ? Bessie . Bessie Bray It means that silly goose has fallen in love with me . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Indeed ! I am glad of that , Bessie ; and I hope , dear Bessie , you will favor his suit . Bessie . Bessie Bray Now , this is too bad : you want to get rid of me . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Get rid of you ! Oh , no ! I love you too well not to feel happy at the prospect of having you for a sister . Bessie . Bessie Bray But I do n't want to favor anybody 's suit . Why could n't he fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have pleased you , Bessie ? Bessie . Bessie Bray Why , yes  --  no : oh , dear me ! I do wish foll would let me alone ( crosses , r . ) . Why , I declare ! there is Mr. Lyford on the piazza , looking as melancholy as an owl . Do let me send him in ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Well , he may come in . ( Exit Bessie , r . ) ( Sylvia seats herself at table , r. ; takes up paper . ) Those dreadful lines stare me in the face again : " Terrible disaster to the Federal troops . " What a fearful blow to the hopeful hearts who saw , in the brave uprising of the North , the speedy overturn of this wicked Rebellion ! Oh that I could find some way to show my sympathy in this dark hour ! ( Enter Lyford , r . ) Lyford Horace Lyford ( l . ) . Dear Sylvia ! at last you have relented , and once more made me happy . Sylvia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyford . Horace Lyford Nay , do not say so ! you must have been thinking of me , or I should not have been sent for . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton You must thank Bessie for that . If she had not spoken of you , I should have forgotten there was such a man in the world . Lyford . Horace Lyford Indeed ! where were your thoughts , then ? Sylvia Sylvia Horton ( rises ) . Where those of every patriotic man and woman should be in this fearful hour . O Horace Lyford ! can you be thus unmoved when disaster has overtaken the loyal army ? Can you loiter here when your country calls for defenders ? Lyford . Horace Lyford No , Sylvia , I am not unmoved . My heart throbs in sympathy with our brave boys , overtaken with disaster ; my blood boils with indignation at the baseness of the traitorous foe ; and I long to join the noble army of freemen . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Then why are you here ? Lyford . Horace Lyford You ask me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in woman 's eyes the beacon-light to happiness . You , whose steps I have followed with pleasure never known before ; whose smile has been an inspiration to wake within my soul all high and noble feelings , and whom I love with a devotion never dreamed of . You ask me why ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Surely the present is no time to waste in dalliance for a woman 's favor . Lyford . Horace Lyford You say true , Sylvia . It is not . But I have thought that a man going forth to fight the battles of his country , brave though he be , is braver , and serves his country better , when he knows he carries with him a woman 's love . To gain that incentive , I have waited . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton And that gained ? Lyford . Horace Lyford I am in the field , ready to dare all , to die , if need be , to show myself worthy of that love . Speak , Sylvia ! have I waited in vain ? Sylvia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just . Lyford . Horace Lyford Speak , Sylvia ! I must have your answer . Even now a commission awaits me at the Governor 's . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton A commission ? Lyford . Horace Lyford Yes : a commission as lieutenant . Come , dear Sylvia , your answer ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton You shall have it . I will never wed one , who , when his country is calling for men ,  --  men to bear the musket , to toil , to fight ,  --  can basely stoop to accept a commission . Lyford . Horace Lyford Why , Sylvia ! commissioned officers must fight as well as enlisted men . There must be some to command . Shoulder-straps are not to be despised . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton When they are earned , not bought . I can honor these emblems of command when they are worn by a brave man , who on many a bloody field has won the right to wear them . The sickening accounts of loitering officers at Washington have cured me of any love I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please . I am then rejected ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Yes . Lyford . Horace Lyford Were I to enlist in the ranks ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Will you ? Lyford . Horace Lyford Sylvia , you are doing this to try my love . You could not wish to have me disgrace myself . Think of my condition and prospects : my father would never consent to have me in the ranks , when money can place me in a higher position . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Disgrace ! the meanest peasant , who , in a foreign land , bowed beneath the oppressor 's power , is ennobled when he bears a musket in the cause of liberty . Lyford . Horace Lyford I see the course you would have me adopt . I can not consent to it . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Then ' t is best we part . Lyford . Horace Lyford And will this parting cause you no pain ? Sylvia Sylvia Horton ( after a struggle ) . No . Lyford . Horace Lyford I have been mistaken , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Should I fall , my last thought will be of you ; my last prayer , for your happiness . Farewell ! ( Exit , r . ) Sylvia Sylvia Horton ( at table , r . ) . Gone ! and this man says he loves me , has sat at my feet , and begged of me to show him some way by which he might prove his devotion ; and my first request is unfulfilled : he leaves me , no doubt , thinking it a foolish girl 's whim . He serve his country with his whole heart ! He little thinks what a power the name of Horace Lyford would have been on the enlistment-rolls . The whole village would have followed the example he set . Well , I 'll think of him no more . He has earned no right to know how much I love him . ( Enter Mr. Horton , r . ) Mr. H. Mr. Horton ( l . ) . Bless my soul ! Only think of it ! Sylvia Sylvia Horton ( r . ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horton Matter , child ! Disgrace , infamy ! To think that the village , bearing so warlike a title as Warwick , is unable to raise a single man to respond to the call of the country ! North , east , west , and south , the whole country is rising , and we can not send one man . Yes , we will ! I 'll go myself . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton How ! no one willing to volunteer ? Mr. H. Mr. Horton Not one ; that 's the trouble . If we can only find the first one , the rest will follow : but they loiter about , casting wistful glances at the flag , and more wistful glances into each other 's faces ; for all the world like a flock of sheep waiting for some old wether to lead the way . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Oh that I were a man ! Mr. H. Mr. Horton I wish to Heaven you were ! Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Where 's Arthur ? He will lead , I know . Mr. H. Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a country dance , but not in a fight . I would n't trust him in the village for the world ; he 'd scare away all who are disposed to go . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Will not money tempt them ? Mr. H. Mr. Horton No : I have tried that . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Then let me make an effort . You have been very indulgent to me , father . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Have I ? well , you have deserved it . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Be still more indulgent , and let me have my way now . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Why , what would you do ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton That 's a secret . You will let me do as I please ? Mr. H. Mr. Horton Yes ; for I know what you do will be right . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Thank you ! Who is the recruiting-officer ? Mr. H. Mr. Horton Archy Blake . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton My old friend Archy ! Oh , then I shall have no difficulty . Good-by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Exit , l . ) Mr. H. Mr. Horton Now , what scheme can that girl have in her head ? No matter ; she ca n't go wrong ; I will trust her . ( Enter Arthur , r. ; his muddy appearance has disappeared . ) Why , Arthur , where have you been all the morning ? Arthur . Arthur Horton Studying , sir ; studying ; deep in the mysteries of geology . Deep in Hitchcock 's and Hugh Miller 's theories . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Well , sir , do they make it clear ? Arthur . Arthur Horton Oh , yes ! wonderfully clear ( aside ) , clear as mud . But where 's Bessie ? Mr. H. Mr. Horton Hark you , sir ! Do you know the whole country is in an uproar ? Arthur . Arthur Horton About Bessie ? Mr. H. Mr. Horton About Bessie ? No , sir : there has been a terrible disaster to the Federal troops . Arthur . Arthur Horton So I have heard . Do n't see how those chaps can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not a soldier . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Glad , sir ! Why , sir , were I of your age , I should be proud to shoulder a musket in defence of liberty . Arthur . Arthur Horton Oh , yes ! It 's all very well for those who like it ; but , for my part , I do n't fancy marching forty miles before breakfast , with the chances of having for my next meal a fifty-pound shot deposited in my bread-basket , without the usual method of mastication . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Oh , pshaw ! All men must meet Death . Arthur . Arthur Horton Yes : I suppose so ; but I 'm not going to meet him half-way . Mr. H. Mr. Horton My son , I 'm afraid you 're a coward . Arthur . Arthur Horton Are you ? Well , I 'm not afraid of it ; I rather like it ; it saves a great deal of trouble . Being a coward , you 're not expected to stop runaway horses , climb shaky ladders to rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve unfortunate individuals sinking for the last time . To be sure , you do n't get the glory of being puffed by the newspapers : but , then , you can take your comfort ; and , to my mind , that is to be preferred . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Then you wo n't be a soldier ? Arthur . Arthur Horton Yes , I will : make me a major-general or a quartermaster , I do n't care which , and I 'll be a soldier ! Mr. H. Mr. Horton Why are you thus particular ? Arthur . Arthur Horton Because you seldom hear of such soldiers being shot , which proves their duties keep them out of danger . Mr. H. Mr. Horton Pshaw , pshaw , boy ! this is nonsense . ( Enter Bessie , l . ) Bessie . Bessie Bray O Arthur ! I 'm so glad I have found you ! Here , hold this yarn for me , that 's a good fellow : I 'm going to knit a pair of socks for the soldiers ( seats herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you hear ? Arthur . Arthur Horton Oh , yes ! I hear you ( sighs ) ; I always hear you ( sighs ) . If I had n't listened to your beguiling voice , I should be a happier man . Bessie . Bessie Bray Why , you great goose ! have n't you done that yet ? Now , look here , Arthur Horton : you just sit down , and hold this yarn ; and , if I hear one of those melancholy sounds coming out of your mouth , I 'll box your ears . Come , quick ! ( Arthur seats himself opposite Bessie very quietly , and takes the skein upon his hands . Bessie winds the yarn during the dialogue . ) Mr. H. Mr. Horton Why , Bessie ! you are becoming a perfect vixen . ( Exit , r . ) Arthur . Arthur Horton There , Bessie : you hear what father says . Bessie . Bessie Bray What 's that to you ? Do as I tell you . Arthur . Arthur Horton Yes , you 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Bessie . Bessie Bray Nothing of the kind : I want to wind this yarn . Only think , Arthur ! this must be made into socks for some poor fellow who may be left dead on the battlefield . Is n't it sad ? Arthur . Arthur Horton Yes : it 's a very melancholy yarn . Bessie . Bessie Bray Hold up your hands ; you are losing the skein . Arthur . Arthur Horton I 'm more afraid of losing you . Why , Bessie , how blue your eyes are ! Bessie . Bessie Bray Oh , pshaw ! it 's the reflection of the yarn . Arthur . Arthur Horton Why , good gracious , Bessie ! now they look green . Bessie . Bessie Bray That 's the reflection of your face , you goose ! Arthur . Arthur Horton Now , do n't be cruel , Bessie : suppose I was the poor fellow who was to wear these socks . Bessie .

Bessie Bray Well , if ever I saw such a ninny ! See how you 've tangled the skein ! Arthur Arthur Horton ( coming forward ) . An idea , by Jove ! an idea ! I believe she loves me . I 'll try her . She would die if I went to the war . I 'll try her . She wo n't let me go ; so I can afford to be valiant . Bessie . Bessie Bray Arthur , do come here and finish the yarn ! Arthur . Arthur Horton Never ! I 'll work no more ! I feel my soul firing with patriotism . I feel that I must rush to the field of battle ; that I must strike a blow for liberty . Ensanguined fields float before my eyes ; bristling cannon beckon me to glory ; flashing bayonets gleam before me . " Is this a rammer which I see before me , the handle toward my hand ? Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bray O Arthur ! you are not going to war ? Arthur . Arthur Horton I must ; I ca n't help myself : " my soul 's in arms , and eager for the fray . " Farewell , gentle maid ! " I go where glory waits me . " ( Crosses to door , r . ) Bessie Bessie Bray ( running after him , and seizing his coat ) . O Arthur ! think of your friends ! you must not go . Arthur . Arthur Horton Friends ! I have no friends . " No one to love ; " not even a puppy dog . I 'm a sad , disappointed man : let me lay my bones beneath the clover and the dandelion greens of the sunny South . Bessie . Bessie Bray No , no , Arthur ! I am your friend ; I love you . Arthur .

Arthur Horton Pause , patriotic soul , and reflect : glory waits you there ; love holds you here . Glory is unpleasantly suggestive of damp grounds , bullets , sabre-cuts , and mosquitoes ; love , of delightful walks , et ctera . I think I wo n't go , Bessie ; not to-day . Bessie . Bessie Bray Oh , you must n't go at all ! Arthur . Arthur Horton Well , then , I wo n't . ( Enter Sylvia , r . ) Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Arthur , I have been looking for you .

Arthur Horton I am ready ( takes note ) . To Archy Blake , you say ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Deliver it into his own hands , and bring me the answer . Arthur . Arthur Horton I will . Good-by , Bessie ! Bessie . Bessie Bray Remember , Arthur : do n't you go . Arthur . Arthur Horton I will endeavor to curb my impatient soul . I 'll not go , ( aside ) not if I know myself .

I told him I would be his wife if he would n't go : I call that a sacrifice . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Sacrifice , indeed ! Listen , Bessie : you love my brother , and yet can keep him by your side when every man is needed to repel the invaders of our sacred rights ; it may be , the despoilers of our homes .

Sylvia discovered at table , r. , sewing . Bessie in easy-chair , l. , reading . Bessie Bessie Bray ( suddenly throwing the book upon the floor ) . Plague take the book ! I wish I had never seen it ! Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Why , Bessie ! what 's the matter ? Bessie . Bessie Bray Just what I expected . I can never take up a book but there 's some fascinating hero in it , so devoted to somebody ; always rescuing some interesting young woman on the brink of a frightful precipice . Oh , dear ! it 's so provoking ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such senseless stories . Bessie . Bessie Bray Senseless ! why , I declare they are beautiful . The provoking part of them is , that I can never hope to have such a hero ; and I do want one so much . I wish I was as industrious as you are , Sylvia ! You are always doing something for the comfort of the soldiers : you are a perfect saint ! Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Oh , no , Bessie ! far from a saint . To be sure , I have accomplished a little towards the comfort of our brave soldiers ; but how little it seems compared to the great work they are engaged in ! The women of America should be proud of the opportunity to contribute to the comfort of such heroes . Bessie . Bessie Bray To be sure they should ; especially if , like you , they all had a particular hero to comfort . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton Particular hero ! who mean you ? I am proud to say there is no distinction : I love them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bessie . Bessie Bray Ah ! but there is one who claims a nearer title than that of a brother . Sylvia . Sylvia Horton I do not understand . Bessie . Bessie Bray Your knight of two years ago ! Allen Sandford  --  have you forgotten him ? Sylvia . Sylvia Horton No , Bessie ! I have not forgotten him : ' t is he who has forgotten me . I have never heard from him ; and , if he is living , no doubt he has found among the maidens of the South some one to draw his admiration . Bessie .
