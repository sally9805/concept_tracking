txt For many years the friends of republican institutions have been uttering words of warning about a certain menacing evil . The tendency among wealthy or educated men to withdraw from politics has been observed with apprehension , and its consequences have been frequently pointed out . Not only have intelligent and far-seeing Americans perceived and announced this danger . but well-wishers among foreigners , like the Frenchman , DE TocquEvrrxe , and the Englishman , MILL , have dwelt upon it with earnestness and solicitude . These observers have felt how impossible it is for a Government to be better than those who make it ; and have realized , as a consequence , that , in the measure wherein political power fell into the exclusive possession of the lower strata of society , corruption and weakness must surely ensue , and free insti ' tutions be proportionably endangered . It is now pretty generally acknowledged that the peril so long dreaded. , if not absolutely upon us , is close at hand . Matters have gone from bad to worse for a long time , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells of approaching catastrophe . This remark , of course , refers to Now-York ; broadly and . 1-03-avrally to her SOLO begislatur6 , rolipieuouslY : and Blamefully to her chief City . Few intelligent people , of whatever party , now deny that local misgovernment has reached a point altogether unparalleled in the history of the Republic , or that it forebodes results , as in those other republics of antiquity , which may prove destructive if not ruinous . This being the case , various suggestions are heard in the way of remedy . Some propose to simplify the political machinery ; some to return to household suffrage ; some . while leaving the vote to all who " now possess it , to deny its future attainment to all who have not certain assigned qualifications . The danger that threatens us is partly measurable , in fact , by the animated discussion of the subject which is heard in nearly every intelligent circle . When such a discussion has become all but universal , it is clear that it is no longer thought to be merely academical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether we are to go back and . undo what , was done in 1846 or not , whether we are to remove things old or to devise things new , there is one truth about which there can be no dispute ; and it is , that just so surely as present mischiefs have sprung in a great degree from the withdrawal from political duty of the wealthy and cultivated classes , so surely must the remedy spring from their return to it . The men of property and the men of thought must set themselves to the work done by their fathers one ortwo generations ago . They must take an active and persistent share in legislation . They must give time awl money to the work , employing both in such ways as wisdom may suggest . As to what these ways shall be , opinions , of course , may differ . But there can be no difference as to the imperative need for action . The personal labor and influence a the affluent and educated classes is the true motive power to bring about reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which reform can be brought about . To get the best attainable Government we must have the hole of the best people in the community . This help may bo given in various forms . The regular exercise of the suffrage should , of course , be one of them . The promotion of intelligent debate . the dissemination of healthy moral and political truths , the education , in a word , of the masses , is another . When every man of brains and substance makes up his mind to do his utmost for the good end , that end will not be long postponed . The very fact that such a movement , or concerted series of movements , bad been determined upon by our first merchants . lawyers , bankers and other leading citizens , and would be pushed resolutely to conclusions , would be equivalent to almost half the battle . And her-An , we repeat , is our only safety and remedy ; nostrums and palliatives without end may be prescribed , but the only true cure for our political disease is the restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease possible .
