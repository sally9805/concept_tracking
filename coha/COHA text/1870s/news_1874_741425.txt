txt The House of Representatives yesterday passed a number of amendments to the Revenue laws , substantially as they came from the committee . The amendments are not particularly important , as it has been the avowed purpose of the Committee on . Ways and Means to avoid any changes , either radical or general in their nature . The intent of the bill , as appears from the debate upon it in the House  --  a debate of considerable spirit , but not very thorough  --  was mainly to remedy defects in existing statutes . As a revenue measure , ' the bill amounts to nearly nothing . The items of increase are as nearly as may be balanced . by the items of decrease , the theory of the committee being that more harm would come to the country from confusing business by proposing a general revision of the Revenue laws than could come from any possible deficiency in the revenue . Mr. DAWES calculates that the Treasury will have this year a surplus , not counting anything for the sinking fund , of " five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entertains the very pleasing hope that next year there will be a surplus of fifty-one millions . That amount of surplus will be absolutely necessary if we are to meet the sinking fund of this year . which will be short some twenty-two millions , and the sinking fund of next year , which will be about $29,000,000 . This seems to the Committee of Ways and . Means , and to the House , a satisfactory method of dealing with the sinking fund . To us it seems very unsatisfactory . It amounts to ignoring the obligation to create this fund . Yet that obligation is a most explicit and . solemn one . It is imposed by the law which authorizes the issue of our bonds , and it forms a part of the contract with those who loaned . us money on the bonds . Nothing would seem to be more binding , nothing more essential to the national credit , than the careful and faithful observance of this obligation . The notion that it can Le whistled down the wind on the assumption that next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe one to entertain . It is , in fact , a foolish and ignorant notion , for which neither the condition of business : affairs , nor the course of events abroad , nor the tenor of our financial legislation affords any support whatever . We regard it cs by no means a flattering indication of the temper of our public men with reference to the national credit , that no one on either side of the House was found to say a single word to call attention to the duty of maintaining the sinking fund , or to the discredit and danger of treating it with indifference . One of the most important of the points acted on by the House was a proposition to impose a tax of one-twentieth of one per cent . on all sales of bonds , stocks , and bullion . This proposition was made apparently without much thought , and originated with Mr. STARKWEATH EH , of Connecticut , who may have received it by direct inspiration from the late THADDEUS STEN-ENS . The very sensible objection that there was no machinery provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have weighed greatly with , the House , ' which took Mr. STARKWEATHER 'S word that the tax would produce $12,000,000 of revenue , and adopted the amendment off hand . We suspect that if this provision ever becomes a law its friends will be very much disappointed in its operation . Judging by previous experience , it will be found a cumbrous , inquisitorial , expensive , and unproductive tax . Three distinctly and avowedly protective items occur in the amendments passed by the louse yesterday , and all of them are curiously enough intended in part or entirely to benefit the West , though the Senators from that section are reported to be unfriendly to the bill for its presumed discrimination against their constituencies . These items are the imposition of a tax of fifty cents a gallon on still wines in casks , $2 a case in bottles , which is exclusively for the benefit of the Western wine-makers ; the imposition of a duty of : ; ' fi per ton on jute butts , which , under the law now in force , are free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pound in the duty on hops , which is partially for the Wisconsin , but mostly for the New-York growers . These items were avowed to be in the interest of the grangers , and - were principally advocated by gentlemen who were opposed to protective duties , but who thought that if that was the principle on which the Government levies its taxes , there was no reason why their constituents should not " take a hand in . " And we are bound to say that these new experiments in protection seem to be quite as capable of rational defense as the rest of the system of which they are a part . They are , nevertheless , by no means in the interest of the revenue , and are quite certain to afford additional instances of the fully , under existing circumstances , of legislating for classes and sections and small interests , instead of for the country at large . On the whole the Revenue ' bill demands closer critici6m than it has yet had , and we hope it will receive it in the Senate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country some amendment looking toward a provision for the sinking fund of this year . It is a great mistake to suppose that the American people " will not stand " taxes imposed to meet the sacred and clearly-defined obligations of the Government .
