THE GENIUS OF NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE . IT is not sufficient for us to have a good thing and to enjoy it without knowing something of its nature , and inquiring how it has been produced , how far it is perfect , how far deficient , how it might have been improved , how it may have been marred . Would any one be contented to know that his watch told him the hour more or less correctly without understanding how it did so , and why correctly or why incorrectly ? You shall have a horse that shall do all your work for you admirably out of doors , but bite and kick you if you go to him in the stable ; or shall drag your buggy for you most obediently , but will never condescend to plow . How natural it is to look into the causes of the animal 's proclivities ! But when our intelligence is affected by something that comes to us from without , so as to make us aware that our inner self is being formed and reformed by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we read ,  - -  then the desire to search and ascertain of what kind is the instrument that is acting upon us becomes reasonably and naturally strong . It is not enough to have the book . We must know , if possible , how it was that the book became what it is , and why . How came it to pass that a man with no peculiar advantages of early education grew to be so many-sided as Shakespeare , and with every side so equal ? How did he become so wise ,  --  for you may // glean from him such a book of proverbs that Solomon shall hardly furnish you with a better ,  --  so pathetic , that not even Sophocles has equaled him ? Could he have heard of the old *ZEdipus when he wrote his " Lear , " and have understood it all ? - so full of humor that not even Moli*re has excelled him ; so happy in his pleasantries as to have rivaled Horace ? And yet he was a poor player , who , as far as we can judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When one mind was so round , well-poised , and wholesome , why should another , also greatly gifted , be lop-sided , with all its very excellences tending toward malformation and disease ,  --  as you shall see in a postman 's legs or a blacksmith 's arm , when all the strength collects itself in one part ? How morbid were the natures of Byron and of Godwin and of Rousseau ! How ill-natured was the genius of Swift ; how impure and flashy that of Sterne ; how preeminently , I might almost say predominantly , pure is that of Longfellow ; how austere and unbending that of Milton ! Then , again , there were others to whom the " totus teres atque rotundus " applies ,  - -  minds that were beautifully round , though the circles described were larger or smaller . Such were the minds of Homer and of Scott . There never surely was a powerful , active , continually effective mind less round , more lop-sided , than that of NATHANIEL IJAwTHOENE . If there were aught of dispraise in this , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an American whom I knew , by an Englishman of letters of a brother on the other side of the water , much less by me , an English novelist , of an American novelist . The blacksmith , who is abnormally strong in his arm , gives the world the advantage of his strength . The poor bird , whose wretched life is sacrificed to the unnatural growth of that portion of him which the gourmands love , does produce the desired dainties in all their perfection . We could have hardly had " Childe Harold " except from a soured nature . The seraphic excellence of " hiawatha " and " Evangeline " could have proceeded only from a mind which the world 's roughness had neither toughened nor tainted . So from Hawthorne we could not have obtained that weird , mysterious , thrilling charm with which he has awed and delighted us had he not allowed his mind to revel in one direction , so as to lose its fair proportions . I have been specially driven to think of this by the strong divergence between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw my little pictures as like to life as possible , so that my readers should feel that they were dealing with people whom // they might probably have known , but so to do it that the every-day good to be found among them should allure , and the every-day evil repel ; and this I have attempted , believing that such ordinary good and ordinary evil would be more powerful in repelling or alluring th ' n great and glowing incidents which , though they might interest , would not come home to the minds of readers . Hawthorne , on the other hand , has dealt with persons and incidents which were often but barely within the bounds of possibility ,  --  which were sometimes altogether without those bounds ,  --  and has determined that his readers should be carried out of their own little mundane ways , and brought into a world of imagination in which their intelligence might be raised , if only for a time , to something higher than the common needs of common life . I will venture here to quote an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman , a friend of his ,  --  and of mine , though , if I remember rightly , I did not get it from him ,  --  which he will recognize should he see this paper . As it is altogether about myself , perhaps I should do better to keep it to myself , but I will give it because it explains so accurately his own condition of mind in regard to novels ; " It is odd enough that my own individual taste is for quite another class of novels than those which I myself am able to write . If I were to meet with such books as mine by another writer , I do n't believe I should be able to get through them . Have you ever read the novels of Anthony Trollope ? They precisely suit my taste ; solid and substantial , written on strength of beef and through the inspiration of ale , and just as real as if some giant had hewn a great lump out of the earth , and put it under a glass case , with all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were made a show of . " This is what he could read himself , but could not possibly have produced ,  --  any more than I could have produced that " Marble Faun " which has been quite as much to my taste as was to his the fragment of common life which he has supposed me to put under a glass case in order that the frequenters at my little show might inspect at their ease all that was being done on that morsel of the earth 's surface . How was it that his mind wandered away always into those fancies , not jocund as are usually those of the tellers of fairy tales , not highflown as are the pictures generally drawn by the poets , with no fearful adventures though so sad , often by no means beautiful , without an attempt even at the picturesque , melancholy beyond compare , as though the writer had drawn all his experiences from untoward // accidents ? That some remnant of Puritan asceticism should be found in the writings of a novelist from Concord , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  though I doubt whether there be much of the flavor of the Mayflower left at present to pervade the literary parterres of Boston . But , had that been the Hawthorne flavor , readers both in England and in the States would have accepted it without surprise . It is , however , altogether different , though ascetic enough . The predominating quality of Puritan life was hard , good sense ,  --  a good sense which could value the realities of life while it rejected the frivolities ,  --  a good sense to which buttered cakes , water-tight boots , and a pretty wife , or a kind husband could endear themselves . Hawthorne is severe , but his severity is never of a nature to form laws for life . His is a mixture of romance and austerity , quite as far removed from the realities of Puritanism as it is from the sentimentalism of poetry . He creates a melancholy which amounts almost to remorse in the minds of his readers . There falls upon them a conviction of some unutterable woe which is not altogether dispelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woe is of course fictitious , and therefore endurable ,  --  and therefore alluring . And woe itself has its charm . It is a fact that the really miserable will pity the comfortable insignificance of those who are not unhappy , and that they are apt even to boast of their own sufferings . There is a sublimity in mental and even in corporal torment which will sometimes make the position of Lucifer almost enviable . " Allis not lost " with him ! Prometheus chained , with the bird at his liver , had wherewithal to console himself in the magnificence of his thoughts . And so in the world of melancholy romance , of agony more realistic than melancholy , to which Hawthorne brings his readers , there is compensation to the reader in the feeling that , in having submitted himself to such sublime affliction , he has proved himself capable of sublimity . The bird that feeds upon your vitals would not have gorged himself-with common flesh . You are beyond measure depressed by the weird tale that is told to you , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being susceptible of such suffering . When you hear what Hawthorne has done to others , you long to search his volumes . When he has operated upon you , you would not for worlds have foregone it . You have been ennobled by that familiarity with sorrow . You have been , as it were , sent through the fire and purged of so much of your dross . For a time , at least , you // have been free from the mundane touch of that beef and ale with which novelists of a meaner school will certainly bring you in contact . No one will feel himself ennobled at once by having read one of my novels . But Hawthorne , when you have studied him , will be very precious to you . He will have plunged you into melancholy , he will have overshadowed you with black forebodings , he will almost have crushed you with imaginary sorrows ; but he will have enabled you to feel yourself an inch taller during the process . Something of the sublimity of the transcendent , something of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celestial , will have attached itself to you , and you will all but think that you too might live to be sublime , and revel in mingled light and mystery . The creations of American literature generally are no doubt more given to the speculative ,  --  less given to the realistic ,  --  than are those of English literature . On our side of the water we deal more with beef and ale , and less with dreams . Even with the broad humor of Bret Harte , even with the broader humor of Artemus Ward and Mark Twain , there is generally present an undercurrent of melancholy , in which pathos and satire are intermingled . There was a touch of it even with the simple-going Cooper and the kindly Washington Irving . Melancholy and pathos , without the humor , are the springs on which all Longfellow 's lines are set moving . But in no American writer is to be found the same predominance of weird imagination as in Hawthorne . There was something of it in M. G. Lewis-our Monk Lewis as he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he wrote ; but with him , as with many others , we feel that they have been weird because they have desired to be so . They have struggled to achieve the tone with which their works are pervaded . With Hawthorne we are made to think that he could not have been anything else if he would . It is as though he could certainly have been nothing else in his own inner life . We know that such was not actually the case . Though a man singularly reticent ,  --  what we generally call shy ,  --  he could , when things went well with him , be argumentative , social , and cheery . I have seen him very happy over canvas-back ducks , and have heard him discuss , almost with violence , the superiority of American vegetables . Indeed , he once withered me with a scorn which was anything but mystic or melancholy because I expressed a patriotic preference for English peas . And yet his imagination was such that the creations of his brain could not have been other than such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a well-known story , weird and witch-like also , and has displayed much genius in the picture which he has given us of Elsie Venner . But the reader is at once aware that Holmes compelled himself to the construction of " Elsie Yenncr , " and feels equally sure that Hawthorne , wrote " The Marble Faun " because he could not help himself . I will take a few of his novels ,  --  those which I believe to be the best known ,  --  and will endeavor to illustrate my idea of his genius by describing the manner in which his stories have been told . " The Scarlet Letter " is , on the English side of the water , perhaps the best known . It is so terrible in its pictures of diseased human nature as to produce most questionable delight . The reader 's interest never flags for a moment . There is nothing of episode or digression . The author is always telling his one story with a concentration of energy which , as we can understand , must have made it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with it to the end very quickly , entranced , excited , shuddering , and at times almost wretched . His consolation will be that he too has been able to see into these black deeps of the human heart . The story is one of jealousy ,  --  of love and jealousy ,  --  in which love is allowed but little scope , but full play is given to the hatred which can spring from injured love . A woman has been taken in adultery ,  --  among the Puritans of Boston some two centuries since ,  --  and is brought upon the stage that she may be punished by a public stigma . She was beautiful and young , and had been married to an old husband who had wandered away from her for a time . Then she has sinned , and the partner of her sin , though not of her punishment , is the young minister of the church to which she is attached . It is her doom to wear the Scarlet Letter , the letter A , always worked on her dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all men . The first hour of her punishment has to be endured , in the middle of the town , on the public scaffold , under the gaze of all men . As she stands there , her husband comes by chance into the town and sees her , and she sees him , and they know each other . But no one else in Boston knows that they are man and wife . Then they meet , and she refuses to tell him who has been her fellow sinner . She makes no excuse for herself . She will bear her doom and acknowledge its justice , but to no one will she tell the name of him who is the father of her baby . For her disgrace has borne its fruit , and she has a child . The injured husband is at once aware that he need deal no further with the woman // who has been false to him . Her punishment is sure . But it is necessary for his revenge that the man too shall be punished ,  --  and to punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find him out , and he finds him out . Then he does punish him with a vengeance and brings him to death ,  --  does it by the very stress of mental misery . After a while the woman turns and rebels against the atrocity of fate ,  --  not on her own account , but for the sake of that man the sight of whose sufferings she can not bear . They meet once again , the two sinful lovers , and a hope of escape comes upon them ,  --  and another gleam of love . But fate in the shape of the old man is too strong for them . He finds them out , and , not stopping to hinder their flight , merely declares his purpose of accompanying them ! Then the lover succumbs and dies , and the woman is left to her solitude . That is the story . The personages in it with whom the reader will interest himself are four ,  --  the husband , the minister who has been the sinful lover , the woman , and the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ,  --  and will sympathize only with her . The husband , an old man who has knowingly married a young woman who did not love him , is a personification of that feeling of injury which is supposed to fall upon a man when his honor has been stained by the falseness of a wife . He has left her and has wan ( lered away , not even telling her of his whereabout . He comes back to her without a sign . The author tells us that he had looked to find his happiness in her solicitude and care for him . The reader , however , gives him credit for no love . But the woman was his wife , and he comes back and finds that she had gone astray . Her he despises , and is content to leave to the ascetic cruelty of the town magistrates ; but to find the man out and bring the man to his grave by slow torture is enough of employment for what is left to him of life and energy . With the man , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have nothing in common , though he is compelled to pity his sufferings . The woman has held her peace when she was discovered and reviled and exposed . She - grill never whisper his name , never call on him for any comfort or support in her misery ; but he , though the very shame is eating into his soul , lives through the seven years of the story , a witness of her misery and solitude , while he himse1f is surrounded by the very glory of sanctity . Of the two , indeed , he is the greater sufferer . While shame only deals with her , conscience is at work with him . But there can be no // sympathy , because he looks on and holds his peace . Her child says to him ,  --  her child , not knowing that he is her father , not knowing what she says , but in answer to him when he would fain take her little hand in his during the darkness of night ,  --  " Wilt thou stand here with mother and me to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , though he struggles hard to do it , and therefore we despise him , He can not do it till the hand of death is upon him , and then the time is too late for reparation in the reader 's judgment . Could we have sympathized with a pair of lovers , the human element would have prevailed too strongly for the author 's purpose . He seems hardly to have wished that we should sympathize even with her ; or , at any rate , he has not bid us in so many words to do so , as is common with authors . Of course , he has wished it . He has intended that the reader 's heart should run over with ruth for the undeserved fate of that wretched woman . And it does . She is pure as undriven snow . We know that at some time far back she loved and sinned , but it was done when we did not know her . We are not told so , but come to understand , by the wonderful power of the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been no taint of foulness in her love , though there has been deep sin . He never even tells us why that letter A has been used , though the abominable word is burning in our ears from first to last . We merely see her with her child , bearing her lot with patience , seeking for no comfort , doing what good she can in her humble solitude by the work of her hands , pointed at from all by the finger of scorn , but the purest , the cleanest , the fairest also among women . She never dreams of supposing that she ought not to be regarded as vile , while the reader 's heart glows with a longing to take her soft hand and lead her into some pleasant place where the world shall be pleasant and honest and kind to her . I can fancy a reader so loving the image of Hester Prynne as to find himself on the verge of treachery to the real Hester of flesh and blood who may have a claim upon him . Sympathy can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in a spirit of assumed hardness , almost as though he assented to the judgment and the manner in which it was carried out . In this , however , there is a streak of that satire with which Hawthorne always speaks of the peculiar institutions of his own country . The worthy magistrates of Massachusetts are under his lash throughout the story , and so is the virtue of her citizens and the chastity of her matrons , which // can take delight in the open shame of a woman whose sin has been discovered . Indeed , there is never a page written by Hawthorne not tinged by satire . The fourth character is that of the child , Pearl . Here the author has , I think , given way to a temptation , and in doing so has not increased the power of his story . The temptation was , that Pearl should add a picturesque element by being an elf and also a charming child . Elf she is , but , being so , is incongruous with all else in the story , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ghostlike , nothing of the unnatural . The old man becomes a fiend , so to say , during the process of the tale ; but he is a man-fiend . And Hester becomes sublimated almost to divine purity ; but she is still simply a woman . The minister is tortured beyond the power of human endurance ; but neither do his sufferings nor his failure of strength adequate to support them come to him from any miraculous agency . But Pearl is miraculous ,  --  speaking , acting , and thinking like an elf ,  --  and is therefore , I think , a drawback rather than an aid . The desolation of the woman , too , would have been more perfect without the child . It seems as though the author 's heart had not been hard enough to make her live alone ; - as sometimes when you punish a child you can not drive from your face that gleam of love which shoots across your frown and mars its salutary effect . Hatred , fear , and shame are the passions which revel through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate as to be content to sacrifice everything to his hatred ; how another may fear so that , even though it be for the rescue of his soul , he can not bring himself to face the reproaches of the world ; how a woman may bear her load of infamy openly before the eyes of all men ,  --  this has been Hawthorne 's object . And surely no author was ever more successful . The relentless purpose of the man , in which is exhibited no passion , in which there is hardly a touch of anger , is as fixed as the hand of Fate . No one in the town knew that the woman was his wife . She had never loved him . He had left her alone in the world . But she was his wife ; and , as the injury had been done to him , the punishment should follow from his hands ! When he finds out who the sinner was , he does not proclaim him and hold him up to disgrace ; he does not crush the almost adored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He simply lives with his enemy in the same house , attacking not the man 's body ,  --  to which , indeed , he acts as a wise physician ,  --  blit his conscience , till we see the wretch writhing beneath the treatment . // hester sees it too , and her strength , which suffices for the bearing of her own misery , fails her almost to fainting as she understands the condition of the man she has loved . Then there is a scene , the one graceful and pretty scene in the book , in which the two meet ,  --  the two who were lovers ,  --  and dare for a moment to think that they can escape . They come together in a wood , and she flings away , but for a moment , the badge of her shame , and lets down the long hair which has been hidden under her cap , and shines out before the reader for once ,  --  just for that once ,  --  as a lovely woman . She counsels him to fly , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had come , and seek for rest away from the cruelty of his tyrant . When he pleads that he has no strength left to him for such action , then she declares that she will go with him and protect him and minister to him and watch over him with her strength . Yes ; this woman proposes that she will then elope with the partner of her former sin . But no idea comes across the reader 's mind of sinful love . The poor wretch can not live without service , and she will serve him . Were it herself that was concerned , she would remain there in her solitude , with the brand of her shame still open upon her bosom . But he can not go alone , and she too will therefore go . As I have said before , the old man discovers the plot , and crushes their hopes simply by declaring that he will also be their companion . Whether there should have been this gleam of sunshine in the story the critic will doubt . The parent who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his frown by any glimmer of parental softness . The extreme pain of the chronicle is mitigated for a moment . The reader almost fears that he is again about to enjoy the satisfaction of a happy ending . When the blackness and the rumbling thunder-claps and the beating hailstones of a mountain storm have burst with all their fearful glories on the wanderer among the Alps , though he trembles and is awestruck and crouches with the cold , he is disappointed rather than gratified when a little space of blue sky shows itself for a moment through the clouds . But soon a blacker mantle covers the gap , louder and nearer comes the crash , heavier fall the big drops till they seem to strike him to the bone . The storm is awful , majestic , beautiful ;  --  but is it not too pitiless ? So it is with the storm which bursts over that minister 's head when the little space of blue has vanished from the sky . But through all this intensity of suffering , through this blackness // of narrative , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself says , " a lively sense of the humorous again stole in among the solemn phantoms of her thought . " He is always laughing at something with his weird , mocking spirit . The very children when they see Hester in the streets are supposed to speak of her in this wise : " Behold , verily , there is the woman of the scarlet letter . Come , therefore , and let us fling mud at her . " Of some religious book he says , " It must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous school of literature . " " We must not always talk in the market-place of what happens to us in the forest , " says even the sad mother to her child . Through it all there is a touch of burlesque , 2-not as to the suffering of the sufferers , but as to the great question whether it signifies much in what way we suffer , whether by crushing sorrows or little stings . Who would not sooner be Prometheus than a yesterday 's tipsy man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ridicule the very woes which he expends himself in depicting . As a novel " The House of the Seven Gables " is very inferior to " The Scarlet Letter . " The cause of this inferiority would , I think , be plain to any one who had himself been concerned in the writing of novels . When Hawthorne proposed to himself to write " The Scarlet Letter , " the plot of his story was clear to his mind . He wrote the book because he had the story strongly , lucidly manifest to his own imagination . In composing the other he was driven to search for a plot , and to make a story . " The Scarlet Letter " was written because he had it to write , and the other because he had to write it . The novelist will often find himself in the latter position . He has characters to draw , lessons to teach , philosophy perhaps which he wishes to expose , satire to express , humor to scatter abroad . These he can employ gracefully and easily if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he must concoct something of a story laboriously , when his lesson , his characters , his philosophy , his satire , and his humor will be less graceful and less easy . All the good things I have named are there in " The House of the Seven Gables " ; but they are brought in with less artistic skill , because the author has labored over his plot , and never had it clear to his own mind . There is a mystery attached to the house . That is a matter of course . A rich man obtained the ground on which it was built by fraud from a poor man , and the poor man 's curse falls on the rich man 's descendants , and the rich man with his rich descendants are // abnormally bad , though very respectable . They not only cheat but murder . The original poor man was hung for witchcraft ,  --  only because he had endeavored to hold his own against the original rich man . The rich men in consequence die when they come to advanced age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright in their chairs , to the great astonishment of the world at large , and with awful signs of blood about their mouths and shirtfronts . And each man as he dies is in the act of perpetrating some terrible enormity against some poor member of his own family . The respectable rich man with whom we become personally acquainted in the story ,  --  for as to some of the important characters we hear of them only by the records which are given of past times , - begins by getting a cousin convicted of a murder of which he knew that his kinsman was not guilty , and is preparing to have the same kinsman fraudulently and unnecessarily put into a lunatic asylum , when he succumbs to the fate of his family and dies in his chair , all covered with blood . The unraveling of these mysteries is vague , and , as I think , inartistic . The reader is not carried on by any intense interest in the story itself , and comes at last not much to care whether he does or does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book lies elsewhere ,  --  that he must seck it in the characters , lessons , philosophy , satire , and humor , and not in the plot . With " The Scarlet Letter " the plot comes first , and the others follow as accessories . Two or three of the characters here drawn are very good . The wicked and respectable gentleman who drees the doom of his family , and dies in his chair all covered with blood , is one Judge Pyncheon . The persistent , unbending , cruel villainy of this man ,  - -  whose heart is as hard as a millstone , who knows not the meaning of conscience , to whom money and respectability are everything ,  - -  was dear to Hawthorne 's heart . He likes to revel in an excess of impossible wickedness , and has done so with the Judge . Though we do not care much for the mysteries of the Judge 's family , we like the Judge himself , and we like to feel that the author is pouring out his scorn on the padded respectables of his New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the superiority of his own country ; no man could be more sarcastic as to the deficiencies of another ,  --  as I had reason to discover in that affair of the peas ; but , nevertheless , he is always throwing out some satire as to the assumed virtues of his own immediate countrymen . It comes from him in little touches as to every incident he // handles . In truth , he can not write without satire ; and , as in these novels he writes of his own country , his shafts fall necessarily on that . But the personage we like best in the book is certainly Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon . She is a cousin of the Judge , and has become , by some family arrangement , the life-possessor of the house with seven gables . She is sister also of the man who had been wrongly convicted of mnrder , and who , when released after a thirty-years ' term of imprisonment , comes also to live at the house . Miss Hepzibah , under a peculiarly ill-grained exterior , possesses an affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps a shop ,  --  a cent-shop , a term which is no doubt familiar enough in Xew England , and by which it would be presumed that all her articles were to be bought for a cent each , did it not appear by the story that she dealt also in goods of greater value . She is a lady by birth , and can not keep her cent-shop without some feeling of degradation ; but that is preferable to the receiving of charity from that odious cousin the Judge . Her timidity , her affection , her true appreciation of herself , her ugliness , her hopelessness , and general incapacity for everything , *cent*shop*keeping included ,  --  are wonderfully drawn . There are characters in novels who walk about on their feet , who stand upright and move , so that readers can look behind them , as one seems to be able to do in looking at a well-painted figure on the canvas . There are others , again , so wooden that no reader expects to find in them any appearance of movement . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanity , which are put into their places and which there lie . Miss Hepzibah is one of the former . The reader sees all round her , and is sure that she is alive ,  --  though she is so incapable . Then there is her brother Clifford , who was supposed to have committed the murder , and who , in the course of the chronicle , comes home to live with his sister . There are morsels in his story , bits of telling in the description of him , which are charming , but he is not so good as his sister , being less intelligible . Hawthorne himself had not realized the half-fatuous , dreamy , ill-used brother , as he had the sister . In painting a figure it is essential that the artist should himself know the figure he means to paint . There is yet another Pyncheon ,  --  Ph*be Pyncheon , who comes from a distance , Heaven knows why , to live with her far-away cousin . She is intended as a ray of sunlight ,  --  as was Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more successful . As the old maid Pyncheon // is capable of nothing , so is the young maid Pyncheon capable of everything . She is , however , hardly wanted in the story , unless it be that the ray of sunlight was necessary . And there is a young " daguerreotypist , " - as the photographer of the day used to be called ,  --  who falls in love with the ray of sunlight , and marries her at the end ; and who is indeed the lineal descendant of the original ill-used poor man who was hung as a witch . There is just one love-scene in the novel , most ghastly in its details ; for the young man offers his love , and the girl accepts it , while they are aware that the wicked , respectable old Judge is sitting , all smeared with blood , and dead , in the next room to them . The love-scene , and the hurrying up of the marriage , and all the dollars which they inherit from the wicked Judge , and the " handsome dark-green barouche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ideas which the reader has formed respecting them , are quite unlike Hawthorne , and would seem almost to have been added by some every-day , beef-and-ale , realistic novelist , into whose hands the unfinished story had unfortunately fallen . But no one should read " The House of the Seven Gables " for the sake of the story , or neglect to read it because of such faults as I have described . It is for the humor , the satire , and what I may perhaps call the philosophy which permeates it , that its pages should be turned . Its pages may be turned on any day , and under any circumstances . To " The Scarlet Letter " you have got to adhere till you have done with it ; but you may take this volume by bits , here and there , now and again , just as you like it . There is a description of a few poultry , melancholy , unproductive birds , running over four or five pages , and written as no one but Hawthorne could have written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the author pretends to ask why the busy Judge does not move from his chair ,  --  the Judge the while having dree 'd his doom and died as he sat . There is a ghastly spirit of drollery about this which would put the reader into full communion with Hawthorne if he had not read a page before , and did not intend to read a page after . To those who can make literary food of such passages as these , " The House of the Seven Gables " may be recommended . To others it will be caviare . " Mosses from an Old Manse " will be caviare to many . By this I intend no slight to the intelligence of the many readers who may not find themselves charmed by such narratives . In the true enjoyment of Hawthorne 's work there is required a peculiar mood of // mind . The reader should take a delight in looking round corners , and in seeing how places and things may be approached by other than the direct and obvious route . Ko writer impresses himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the reader must consent to put himself altogether under his author 's guidance , and to travel by queer passages , the direction of which he will not perceive till , perhaps , he has got quite to the end of them . In " The Scarlet Letter , " though there are many side paths , there is a direct road , so open that the obstinately straightforward traveler will find his way , though he will not , perhaps , see all that there is to be seen . In " The House of the Seven Gables " a kind of thoroughfare does at last make itself visible , though covered over with many tangles . In the volume of which I am now speaking there is no pathway at all . The reader must go where the writer may choose to take him , and must consent to change not only his ground , but the nature of his ground , every minute . This , as the name implies , is a collection of short stories ,  --  and of course no thread or general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short narratives are altogether various in their style , no one of them giving any clew as to what may be expected to follow . They are , rather than tales , the jottings down of the author 's own fancies , on matters which have subjected themselves to his brain , one after the other , in that promiscuous disorder in which his manner of thinking permitted him to indulge . He conceives a lovely woman , who has on her cheek a " birth-mark , " so trifling as to be no flaw to her beauty . But her husband sees it , and , seeing it , can not rid himself of the remembrance of it . He is a man of science , concerned with the secrets of chemistry , and goes to work to concoct some ichor by which the mark may be eradicated . Just as success is being accomplished , the lady dies under the experiment . " You have aimed loftily , " she says to her husband , at her last gasp ; " you have done nobly . Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not told ; but the idea left is that , seeking something more than mortal perfection , he had thrown away the happiness which , as a mortal , he might have enjoyed . This is transcendental enough ; but it is followed , a few pages on , by the record of Mrs. Bullfrog , who had got herself married to Mr. Bullfrog , as the natural possessor of all feminine loveliness , and then turns out to be a hideous virago , with false hair and false teeth , but who is at last accepted graciously by Bullfrog , because her money is real . The satire is intelligible , and is Hawthornean , but why Hawthorne should have brought // himself to surround himself with objects so disagreeable the reader does not understand . " The Select Party " is pleasant enough . It is held in a castle in the air , made magnificent with all architectural details , and there the Man of Fancy , who is its owner , entertains the Oldest Inhabitant , Nobody , M. Ondit , the Clerk of the Weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a young American , of course ,  --  and sundry others , who among them have a good deal to say which is worth hearing . The student of Hawthorne will understand what quips and quirks will come from this mottled company . Then there is an Italian , one Rappacini , and his daughter , weird , ghostlike , and I must own very unintelligible . The young lady , however , has learned under the teaching of her father , who is part doctor , part gardener , and part conjurer , to exist on the essence of a flower which is fatal to everybody else . She becomes very detrimental to her lover , who has no such gifts , and the story ends as a tragedy . There is a very pretty prose pastoral called " Buds and BirdVoices , " which is simply the indulgence of a poetic voice in the expression of its love of nature . " The Hall of Fantasy " is a mansion in which some unfortunates make their whole abode and business , and " contract habits which unfit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but these are few ,  --  possess the faculty , in their occasional visits , of discovering a purer truth than the world can impart . " The reader can imagine to himself those who , under Hawthorne 's guidance , would succeed and those who would fail by wandering into this hall . " The Procession of Life " is perhaps the strongest piece in the book ,  --  the one most suggestive and most satisfactory . Hawthorne imagines that , by the blowing of some trumpet such as has never yet been heard , the inhabitants of the world shall be brought together under other circumstances than those which at present combine them . The poor now associate with the poor , the rich with the rich , the learned with the learned , the idle with the idle , the orthodox with the orthodox , and so on . By this new amalgamation the sick shall associate with the sick , the strong-bodied with the strong , the weak-bodied with the weak , the gifted with the gifted , the sorrowful with the sorrowful , the wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is a specimen of Hawthorne 's manner in bringing the wicked together : " The hideous appeal has swept round the globe . Come all ye guilty ones , and rank yourselves in accordance with the brotherhood of crime . This , indeed , is an awful summons . I almost tremble to // look at the strange partnerships that begin to be formed , reluctantly , but by the invincible necessity of like to like , in this part of the procession . A forger from the State prison seizes the arm of a distinguished financier . . . . Here comes a murderer with his clanking chain , and pairs hixuself ,  --  horrible to tell ! - with as pure and upright a man , in all observable respects , as ever partook of the consecrated bread and wine . . . . Why do that pair of flaunting girls , with the pert , affected laugh , and the sly leer at the bystander , intrude themselves into the same rank with yonder decorous matron and that somewhat prudish maiden ? " The scope for irony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this was unbounded . There is a droll story , with a half-hidden meaning , called " Drowne 's Wooden Image , " in which Copley the painter is brought upon the scene , so that I am led to suppose that there was a Drowne who carved head-pieces for ships in Boston , and who , by some masterpiece in his trade and by the help of Hawthorne , has achieved a sort of immortality . Here the man , by dint of special energy on this special job ,  --  he is supposed to be making a figure-head for a ship ,  --  hews out of the wood a female Frankenstein , all alone , but lovely as was the other one hideous . The old idea , too , is conveyed that , as within every block of marble , so within every log of wood , there is a perfection of symmetry and beauty , to be reached by any one who may have the gift of properly stripping off the outlying matter . " P. 's Correspondence " is the last I will mention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend in Boston from his madhouse chamber , imagines himself to have met in London Byron , Burns , Scott , and a score of other literary worthies , still alive as he supposes , but who by the stress of years have been changed in all their peculiarities , as men are changed when they live long . Byron becomes very religious , and professes excessive high-church tendencies ,  --  as certain excellent and over-liberal friends of mine have in their old age become more timid and more conservative than they who were to the manner born . Hawthorne adds to this the joke that all his own American literary contemporaries ,  --  men whom he knew to be alive , and with whom he probably was intimate ,  --  are , alas ! dead and gone . The madman weeps over Bryant , Whittier , and Longfellow , while he has been associating with Keats , Canning , and John Kemble .

I have space to mention but one other of our author 's works ; " The Marble Faun , " as it is called in America , and published in England under the name of " Transformation ; or , The Romance of Monte Beni . " The double name , which has given rise to some confusion , was , I think , adopted with the view of avoiding the injustice to which American and English authors are subjected by the want of international copyright . Whether the object was attained , or was in any degree attainable by such means , I do not know . In speaking of " The Marble Faun , " as I will call the story , I hardly know whether , as a just critic , to speak first of its faults or of its virtues . As one always likes to keep the sweetest bits for the end of the banquet , I will give priority of place to my caviling . The great fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The author , in giving the form of a novel to the beautiful pictures and images which his fancy has enabled him to draw , and in describing Rome and Italian scenes as few others have described them , has in fact been too idle to carry out his own purpose of constructing a tale . We will grant that a novelist may be natural or supernatural . Let us grant , for the occasion , that the latter manner , if well handled , is the better and the more efficacious . And we must grant also that he who soars into the supernatural need not bind himself by any of the ordinary trammels of life . His men may fly , his birds may speak . His women may make angelic music without instruments . His cherubs may sit at the piano . This wide latitude , while its adequate management is much too difficult for ordinary hands , gives facility for the working of a plot . But there must be some plot , some arrangement of circumstances , with an intelligible conclusion , or the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost , who ,  --  or shall I say which ? - is made on all occasions to act as a Deus cx machina , and to create and to solve every interest , we should know something of the ghost 's antecedents , something of the causes which have induced him , or it , to meddle in the matter under discussion . The ghost of Hamlet 's father had a manifest object , and the ghost of Banquo a recognized cause . In " The Marble Faun " there is no ghost , but the heroine of the story is driven to connive at murder , and the hero to commit murder , by the disagreeable intrusion of a personage whose raison d ' *tre is left altogether in the dark . " The gentle reader , " says our author as he ends his narrative , " would not thank us for one of those minute elucidations which are so // tedious and after all so unsatisfactory in clearing up the romantic mysteries of a story . " There our author is , I think , in error . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require from him some explanation of the causes which have produced the romantic details to which they have given their attention , and will be inclined to say that it should have been the author 's business to give an explanation neither tedious nor unsatisfactory . The critic is disposed to think that Hawthorne , as he continued his narrative , postponed his plot till it was too late , and then escaped from his difficulty by the ingenious excuse above given . As a writer of novels , I am bound to say that the excuse can not be altogether accepted . But the fault , when once admitted , may be well pardoned on account of the beauty of the narrative . There are four persons ,  - -  or five , including the mysterious intruder who is only , I think , seen and never heard , but who is thrown down the Tarpeian rock and murdered . Three of them are artists ,  --  a lady named Miriam , who is haunted by the mysterious one and is an assenting party to his murder ; another lady named Hilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tower surrounded by doves ; and a sculptor , one Kenyon , also from the States , who is in love with Hilda . The fourth person is the Faun , as to whom the reader is left in doubt whether he be man or Satyr ,  --  human , or half god half animal . As to this doubt the critic makes no complaint . The author was within his right in creating a creature partaking of these different attributes , and it has to be acknowledged on his behalf that the mystery which be has thrown over this offspring of his brain has been handled by him , a writer of prose , not only with profound skill but with true poetic feeling . This faun , who is Count of Monte Beni ,  --  be he most god , or man , or beast ; let him have come from the hills and the woods and the brooks like a Satyr of old , or as any other count from his noble ancestors and ancestral towers ,  - -  attaches himself to Miriam , as a dog does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which there is a longing for kisses and a hope for marriage , but with a devotion half doglike as I have said , but in its other half godlike and heavenly pure . He scampers round her in his joy , and is made happy simply by her presence , her influence , and her breath . He is happy , except when the intruder intrudes , and then his jealousy is that as of a dog against an intruding hound . There comes a moment in which the intrusion of the intruder is unbearable . Then he looks into Miriam 's eyes , and , obtaining the assent for which he seeks , he hurls the intruder // down the Tarpeian rock into eternity . After that the light-hearted creature , overwhelmed by the weight of his sin , becomes miserable , despondent , and unable to bear the presence of her who had so lately been all the world to him . In the end light-hearted joy returns to him ; but the reason for this second change is not so apparent . The lives of Kenyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are commonplace between man and woman , the manner in which they are told is very beautiful . She is intended to represent perfect innocence , and he manly honesty . The two characters are well conceived and admirably expressed . In " The Marble Faun , " as in all Hawthorne 's tales written after " The Scarlet Letter , " the reader must look rather for a series of pictures than for a novel . It would , perhaps , almost be well that a fastidious reader should cease to read when he comes within that border , toward the end , in which it might be natural to expect that the strings of a story should be gathered together and tied into an intelligible knot . This would be peculiarly desirable in regard to " The Marble Faun , " in which the delight of that fastidious reader , as derived from pictures of character and scenery , will be so extreme that it should not be marred by a sense of failure in other respects . In speaking of this work in eonjunction with Hawthorne 's former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful change which he effected in his own manner of writing when he had traveled out from Massachusetts into Italy . As every word in his earlier volumes savors of New England , so in " The Marble Faun " is the flavor entirely that of Rome and of Italian scenery . His receptive imagination took an impress from what was around him , and then gave it forth again with that wonderful power of expression which belonged to him . Many modern writers have sought to give an interest to their writings by what is called local coloring ; but it will too often happen that the reader is made to see the laying on of the colors . In Hawthorne 's Roman chronicle the tone of the telling is just as natural ,  --  seems to belong as peculiarly to the author ,  --  as it does with " The Scarlet Letter " or " The House of the Seven Gables .
