txt We like Gen. Grant ; but we care far more for Republican ascendency than for any man 's personal fortunes . It is in our view of great importance that the opposition shall be kept out of power . while it is of comparatively small moment that A. or B should tenant the White House . For a Democratic national triumph means a restoration to power of those who deserted their seats in Congress and their places under the last Democratic President to plunge the country into the Red Sea of Secession and Rebellion . Though you paint an inch thick , to this complexion you must come at last . The brain , the heart , the soul , of the present Democratic Party is the rebel element at the South , with its Northern allies and sympathizers . It is rebel at the core today , hardly able to reconcile the defeats of LEE , JorixSTON , BRAGG , HOOD and PRICE , and the consequent downfall of its beloved Confederacy , with its traditional faith in Divine Providence . It would hail the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Appomattox surrender . It would come into power with the hate , the chagrin , the wrath , the mortification , of ten bitter years , to impel and guide its steps . It would devote itself to taking off or reducing tax after tax until the Treasury was deprived of the means of paying interest on the national debt , and would hail Me tidings of national bankruptcy with unalloyed gladness and unconcealed exultation . Whatever chastisement may be deserved by our national sins , we must hope that this disgrace and humiliation will be spared us . ? Tne above is from the Tribune  --  obviously from the pen of Mr. GREELEY  --  Of February , 1871 . We commend it to the careful attention of our readers . Is it less true in 1872 than it was a year ago ? How do the Democrats like the description of them given by the present candidate for their votes ?
