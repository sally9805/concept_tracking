ARTICLE 111. - YALE COLLEGE-SOME ! TIIOUGIITS RE SPECTING ITS FUTURE . SECOND ARTICLE . In the last number of the New Englander we made some suggestions in respect to the peculiar and distinctive work of the new era , on which the friends of Yale College believe it to be about to enter . The limits of the Article , which was then published , allowed us only to consider this work in a single line , or in one of its departtnents ,  --  namely , that of unifying the institution , so as to make it no longer a Collegiate school , with certain " outside " departments loosely attached to the central body , but a University of coiirdinate and coequal branches . Unless this end is accomplished-we believe we express the sentiment of every friend of the College , whose mind is not unduly under the influence of erroneous ideas derived from the past  --  a University , in the best sense of that word , can not exist in New ilaven . The time has come when a step forward in this direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the institution will fall backward , sooner or later , into an inferior place . It will belong rather to the class of mere colleges , than to that higher class which will , in the future , deservedly have the higher name . This work of unification is , also , the first work that should be undertaken and carried out . It is essential to the noblest growth of the institution , and it is essential that it be done at once . It is , therefore , most proper that , in any discussion respecting the coming era , this subject should hold the first and most prominent place . But it is-as we intimated at the close of of our previous Article , and as all are aware-only one among a number of impoitant things which need to be accomplished . We trust it will not be deemed out of place , therefore , if we ask the attention of our readers , at the present time , to another point connected with this most interesting subject-the work to be done in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // to suitable provisions and arrangements for those " graduated " students , who are pursuing a general and non-professional course of study . This class of persons have peculiar claims on the care and interest of the governing powers of the institution , whatever may be the light in which we look at them . To those who think only of the collegiate or acedemical department , and believe the other schools to be of little or no importance , the young men , who , having just taken their first degree in arts , propose to continue their past studies , can hardly fail to be objects of regard . The existence of such a body of young men residing at the college is an honor to their instructors , as well as a continual inspiration to the under graduates who are following them . To those , on the other hand , who have larger views and who wish for a university , such graduates are of still greater consequence . They form one of the essential parts cf the university , without which its life can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those-if any such there can be-who have no care for the character and form of our higher institutions of learning , but yet desire the progress of literature and scholarly refinement in the country , it will be a matter of no slight moment to give this class of students the greatest advantages , since on them must largely depend all hopes which go out toward this end . And yet it is not strange that they have been the latest class even of graduate students to be provided for . Our country has made but slow progress , in the past , toward the higher regions of literary refinement . Another and more fundamental work has been essential to its earlier life . The various learned professions have , indeed , long since become necessary , and , accordingly , provision has been made at our educational institutions for those who would enter them . But scholarship , in those other fields which are less immediately connected with the every-day work of life , has been left to the older nations . Its importance has not been appreciated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , consequently , been little demand for it in the public mind , and little or no facilities for attaining it have been offered , evc*n in those colleges which have begun to develop themselves outward toward the university idea . Within the last few years , however , there has been a great // advance in this direction . We have begun to feel that our country must not be a place for the exercise of practical energy , merely , and that learning must not be limited to those alone who are lawyers or preachers , but that we must be a nation of th' truest and noblest culture-that scholars must find their home here , and must be honored here , as truly as in Europe . The call for a higher education in this field has , therefore , begun to arise . Our universities must have a department not only separate from the collegiate school , but also from the professional schools , which shall draw into itself many of the best minds and carry them onward in their scholarly culture . It is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were among the earliest , if not the very earliest , in the country to hear this call . When it had come only from two or three , as it were , scattered here and therewhen the great body even of our educated countrymen had no sense , as yet , of the need of any such thing-they organized a new branch of the institution for these higher liberal studies . The Department of Philosophy and the Arts was created in 1846 . It opened the way for the pursuit of natural science in its vurious departments , thus meeting the demands of the times in this direction . But , at the same time , it offered more advanced instruction in philosophy , and philology , and history , and similar studies to the graduates in arts , and to others who might desire it . Of what this Department , in what we may call its philosophical and philological branch , has already accomplished , very favorable testimony has been borne by the presiding officer of our sister university at Cambridge . Persons among our own graduates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it affords ,  --  as one of the number , the writer of this Article-can bear , from their own experience , a witness which , if not as honorable , is , if posssible , even more heartfelt . l3nt bow little , we must all say , has it done as yet compared with what could be desired . How great is the work which opens before it in the future . In organizing this Department of Philosophy and the Arts , the College authorities , as we intimated in our former Article , made the institution complete im its parts . They gave to the growing University the Philosophical Faculty of the German Universities . But they were // unable to do anything more than this-except iii the Scientific section of it , where the wonderful developments and demands of the age have carried forward the growth very rapidly . The want of the necessary funds rendered it impossible to make this faculty altogether distinct from the academical , and the want of appreciation of high scholarship in these philosophical and philological studies made the number of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , therefore , passed away and we still see only the small beginnings-two or three young men entering this section of the Department from year to year , and no instruction except from professors who are overburdened with other work . All honor to the Trustees of the College , it becomes all its friends and all the friends of education to say , that they saw so early , and made so early provision for , the new needs of the country . All honor , also , to the instructors for what they have accomplished under circumstances no more favorahle , than have been , as vet , enjoyed . But no one can fail to see that the work of this part of the institution is , mainly , a work of the coming era . Much more must be done , in the future years , than has hitherto been done , or the guardians of the interests of the University hereafter will , in this , regard , prove unequal in xxisdoni and energy to th6se who preceded them . But the great question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wkat is to be its work . What then , *n t*4i8d*partment of which we are now speaking , is to be done , to promote its efficiency and to make it in reality what it already is in name ? The first thing , as we conceive , is to provide further instruction . All that is now done is to offer assistance in their studies in the higher Philosophy , Mathematics and Philology , to such young men of proper previous attainments as may desire it . This assistance is to be given by Professors who have duties , which afford them abundant employment , in the academical or scientific schools . In the practical working of the matter , therefore , the necessary tendency of things is to make it as small as possible . lie a large extent , at the present time , it does not amount to positive instruction , but is only a permission given to the student to call on and consult the professor , when occasion may require . Such a permission is a far smaller advantage // than it might seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that the professors are known to be pressed with other work , and the students , having most of them just graduated from the college , and having thus hardly escaped their feeling of awe toward the older members of the faculty , will scarcely approach the instructors with the perfect freedom that could be wished . The Professor gives his invitation , indeed , but the student either knows , or feels , that it is given with a certain reservation . An overworked man , he says to himself , who sets me no particular time for visiting him-whom I may find , when I call at his room , occupied with other things , or even with other students  --  the necessity of whose life compels him , it may be , to do much outside of his own special sphere , in order to support his family-such a man can not wish to see me often . lie makes his offer of advice and help with as good heart as may be possible , under the circumstances . I do not doubt this  --  but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I should take from him , unbroken . I will wait for another day . I will pass over the present need . I will get on by myself as best I can . It is almost inevitable that he will reason thus , not once , but many times . These thoughts will rise as a hindrance in his way almost as often as he feels the want of asssistan Ce , and the result will be that his visits to his instructor will become very infrequent-perhaps , even more and more infrequent , the longer his course of study continues . The offered aid will be unused , and the student will be left to himself . Now we do not say , at this point of our discussion , that anything better could have been done in the past . We have been in the early days  --  the beginningsand it is enough that the beginnings have been made . We must not look for the full completion of the plan , as yet . But - with every allowance and with no disposition to find faultit must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the institution is to grow , and to become what it may be and ought to be . There must be not only the offer of advice and assistance , when it is sought for ; there must be definite and regular instruction , with responsibility on the part of the student . There must be lectures or recitations in connection with these studies as regularly as in the theological and law // schools . There must be somewhat of systematic organization , or there will be no permanent and large success . A much more regularly organized section of the university is the first thing which , as it seems to us , is required , if proper provision is to be made for the class of graduated students , to whom we are referring . We shall not , of course , be misunderstoocj as urging any prescribed course of study for all the students , or any abridgment of personal freedom . This we have no wish for , and , certainly , it can not be regarded as essentiaL But the section , whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and its instruction should be systematic and positive ,  --  as much so as any other of the higher departments of the University . In order to the accomplishment of this end , it is of the highest importance that new professorships should be established , the incumbents of which should have no duties outside of this particnlar section . If the time of a Professor of Greek is needed for the instruction of students in the undergraduate department , who are in the rudiments and the early stages ,  --  surely , the graduates , who wish to enter more fully into the genius of the language , and to become real scholars , ought not to be compelled to help themselves altogether , except so far as they may snatch an hour or two from his scanty leisure . They ought to have the highest order of instructor whom the University can command  --  a man who should be devoted to them , as fully as they may need him . The leading Greek scholar in the whole institution should be with them . And so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we are ever to hope for the highest scholarship in this country-if we are ever to give to culture its own proper place-we must accomplish the end in this way . We must not linger in the lower regions and give our thoughts wholly to the younger students . We must make the more full and complete provision for those who are pressing further onward and are to do most in their work . But it will , doubtless , be said , that while all this is very good as a theory , it can not be accomplished for lack of funds . Professorships can not be established without money , and there is no money . We , however , are speaking of the future-of // the work of the opening era-and , as we have already stated , one of the great things to be done in that era is to get money for the whole University . If the officers and friends of this college are to sit down in despair , with the feeling that its pecuniary resources can not be enlarged , they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essential thing for future progress , and it can be obtained , if judiciously and earnesdy sought . Our suggestions are made on the assumption that this vital necessity is to be secured ; and we say , that , on this assumption , these new professorships are imperatively required . The instruction in the higher philology and philosophy , &amp;c. , can not be left , always , to professors of the academical or other departments , who are assigned to this e*rtra duty , in addition to the performance of all their other work . As well might the heological school hope to reach its highest growth with no professors of its own . The remnants of a man 's time and strength , after his daily labor is ended , are not and never can be sufficient for the greatest work possible to his powers . And yet , we must , of course , freely admit than a time must inter vene betbre these new professorships can be established . It may be , at the best , some years before the funds of the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tlieref'ore , be looked at , and we must inquire how the efficiency of this section of the institution can , even now , be increased . The course already adopted at Harvard University , gives a hint , at least , as to what may be done . So far as we understand the Harvard scheme , it seems to us to be open to some objections in minor points , but its introduction is an evidence of the energy and wisdom of the President of that institution . As a recent writer in the " Nation * has suggested , courses of lectures by the le ding professors at *7ale might be established ; and , we may add , familiar exercises in which the students should come into personal connection with these professors , and should discuss with them the topics of interest connected with their studies or reading . Other eminently-qualified persons might , also , to a certain extent , be called in from outside of the college , to aid in the work . The range of subjects might be a wide one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minds . The fees for attendance on these lectures // might be fixed at such a sum as would not be burdensome to the hearers , and , thus , would not shut out those of limited means . Tn this way , some slight compensation could be made to the instructors  --  but we can hardly doubt that the satisfaction of seeing the evthwiasm of the students , and the growth of their numbers , would be a sufficient reward , until the time of more abundant resources should cotue . The gentlemen-at least , those among them who were connected with the University , and we should say that these ought to he the larger or the more efficient part-might meet together as a faculty , and encourage and help each other in this way . We are persuaded that-while entire success can not be attained , until new professorships , as indicated above , are established  --  a great deal more can be done , than has yet been done , with the means already at our disposal . In a few years , with such arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , that the number of young men who would ent r upon these courses of study , instead of being two or three as now , would be ten or twenty times as many . They would be not only graduates of this college , but grad nates of other colleges as well , who would gladly come here to carry onward their education in the midst of these higher advantages . They would be representatives of every class in the country , who wish to gain a culture which they have never yet gained avd can not gain elsewhere . Why should not this step be taken at once ? The present is as favorable a time as can ever offer , for the first onward movement . If it is made , not only will great good be done to many individual minds , and to time University as a whole ; but the manifestation of energy and the beginning of success will render the gathering in of funds for the future and for the more perfect work a thing both easier and more certain of accomuplishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more successful . To him that hath shall be given , is a principle of the widest application . There are , however , some other things which may be done , besides the providing of further instruction . Encouragements and helps may be given to students , and , thus , the number of students may be increased . According to the present arrangement of things , no certain advantages are offered to young // men enti3ring upon this course of study . The present aids - of a pecuniary nature are less , even , than those afforded to undergraduates , while the prospects for the future are , by no means , so sure as those opened before the professional and scientific students . We think something may be done . and ought to be done , within a few years , with reference to both these points . At present , all which the college has , to give , in this section of the department of Philosophy and the Arts , is the income of three scholarships  --  the largest income of the three being only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual fee for instruction , the student who holds this best of the scholarships finds himself with only twenty dollars as the proceeds of it . Certainly , an aspiring and enthusiastic youth-whose means are limited-will not find much encouragement to continue his classical or philosophical studies from such a source as this . He will feel himself compelled to give up these studies of his choice , and enter upon some other which either afford him ctreater assistance at once , course , may or , at least , may compensate him by the larger rewards which it will secure to him in after years . The present inducements of this character we may , therefore , say are nothing . So far as our knowledge extends , no one has ever been led to remain at Yale College , after graduation , by these existing scholarships . But little competition has been known in the case of that one among them , the income of which has depended altogether upon continued residence at New Haven . It has been sought for only by those who , on other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them been regarded as a matter of not much moment . Twenty dollars or a hundred and twenty , in these days , are not worth much striving forand the honor of obtaining that for which there is no competition , is not great enough to call fortl* any considerable effort or enthusiasm . The founders of these scholarships deserve the credit of their work , and , especially , of their appreciation of this great need of the University . But the coining era can not be content with no greater things than these . The establishment of fellowships , which shall produce , according to the common phrase , " a living income , " is a matter of the highest importance . The foundation of each of these fellowships // should be from ten to fifteen or twenty thousand dollars . The time of holding them , also , should be lengthened from two years , us in the case of the existing scholarships , to four-or even six years . They would , thus , become really valuable , and would be a powerful stimulus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to competition in every year , would be of the greatest possible service . It would benefit not only the successful candidate , but others likewise . It would , in many cases , be the means of drawing both the unsuccessful and the successful ones into this section of the University . The means for such fouadations should be earnestly solicited . They can be secured , as we believe , at no very distant day . But here again we must admit that there will be an interval of time before this result can be reached . Can not anything be done in this interval ? Perhaps not in the way of pecuniary aid . In other ways , however , we are sure that a beginning may be made at once . It appears to us , that the prospects for the future for this class of students might be rendered much brighter and more certain than they now are . At present , a young man in this department of study is in the most uncertain of all positions . He has not a fraction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his powers in after life , which a lawyer or a minister may have . This , no doubt , is largely owing to circumstances beyond control . The age of scholarly culture is only just dawning , and the places for scholarly men are comparatively few . We do not see , however , why the Tutorships or Assistant Professorships in the college might not be regularly filled from students of this class . On the present system , the elections to the Tutorship are made from among the highest on the list of " appointments " at Commencement . Two or three years after graduation , the valedictorian or salutatorian of a class is called to this office of instruction , because he had such a rank as a scholar in his college course , and because the Faculty judge , from what they remember of him , that he will discharge its duties well . It can be no wonder , surely , if , on such a system , mistaken choices are sometimes made . Yaledictorians are , now and then at least , not distinguished as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by no means , certain to be so three years afterwards  --  and even less certain to be good teachers . But if this important office of instruction is filled in the way we suggest , the candidates will be all of them persons who are known to be continuing their studies , and to be making real progress . They can be observed by the college authorities , * they go forwa1rds . The best among them cami be choseii . The appointment can become a reward , the hope of which will make all of them as good as possible . An arrangement of this character will tend toward beneficial results for the college itself , while it will , at the same time , encourage the students of the Department . It will encourage them , because these students , looking s they naturally will toward an academic or literary life , will hold such an official position in very different esteem from their college classmates who become doctors or merchants . They will find here a stepping-stone to a higher position , or a preparation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College might , also , systematically aid , so far as in their power ,  --  and might let it be distinctly knoxvn that they would aid ,  --  these students to obtain places as teachers , or other more purely literary posts , elsewhere . It can not be doubted , that this is the class of men who ought to be teachers . The gr wth and neekis of the country are such , now , that teaching is beginning to be as much a profession as the ministry is . Why should not the profession be filled , like that of the ministry , from those who have been specially educated for it ? If , in these ways , the prospects for the future of these graduate students could be made more certain than they now are , the influence of such greater certainty would be , undoubtedly , to increase the number of young men who would thus devote themselves to general studies . Our Universities must , it is true , wait for their highest success and most perfect development , until the demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , continually , toward the higher demands , by keeping steadily in advance of the present public sentiment . They must provide every inducement , which they can , even now *nd must furnish all possible aid , if they ate to fulfill their mission . It is thus , that they are to prepare the // way for the better future , as well as to be ready for it when it comes . There is another thing , which , we think , can be done , and done immediately , for the growth and success of this section of the University . Students , if they are to enter upon these higher studies in philosophy , philology , &amp;c. , need not only the encouragements of present aid and future rewards . They need , also , ctn inspiration to make them ready to choose the course , which thus offers itself to them . They need , in their undergraduate life , to have their love for the studies awakened , so that they shall be glad to go forward in them . Especially is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of graduation , are somewhat prone to like mental and moral philosophy-studies which makes them realize , more than any others , the intellectual powersjust maturing within themwhile , in regard to the mathematics , the gift for these is a coinparatively rare one and is usually accompanied , where it exists , by its own inspiration . The almost universal complaint , on the other hand is , that there is little enthusiasm for classical studies ; and great nurribers even of college graduates are declaring , largely on this account , we believe , that they ought not to be required in a collegiate course . We do not propose here to discuss the general question respecting these studies . So far as our present purpose is concerned , this question may be settled in either way . It is enough for us to take tbe general admission , that it is well to have a class of classical students , and , if so , to make then , as ardent in their work as pos. sible . But , if this be admitted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University to awaken this ardor in such minds . If there are to be a goodly number of these students in the section devoted to the higher general studies , it must be thus awakened . But how shall this object be accomplished ? A step has been taken at Yale College , already , in connection with this matter , which is likely to be helpfhl to the end in view . The students are not compelled to go forward , as they were formerly , all together-and , thus , no faster or far ther than the slower ones could advance . They are arranged in divisions , according to their scholarship , and the higher // ranks make correspondingly greater progress . The results of this experiment-which met objections from some persons of great wisdom , at its first suggestion-have been even more favorable , if we mistake not , than most of the college officers anticipated . But there are other steps which , we think , still need to be taken . The classical languages , as we conceive , are taught with too exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every body , who knows anything on this subject , knows that these languages , like all others , must be studied and nuderstood in their construction and all their grammatical minuti , if they are to be thoroughly acquired . All persons , also , agree , that one of the great advantages of the study of these languages , is the mental discipline which is gained from this sort of investigation of them . But a man will never love a language of which he knows nothing but the grammar . It is doubtful if even the celebrated German professor , who lamented that he had not devoted his life exclusively to the dative case , would have appreciated the beauty of such a study , unless he had learned something beyond this . And it is , by no means , strange , if young men in our colleges , whose minds have been so largely confined to grammatical points ,  --  to analysis of words and similar matters-should , at their graduation , have little enthusiasm for the classical authors , or should , at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much would men study or enjoy the modern languages of Europe , . or even our own , if this were the aim of all their reading ? In every other case , we study the grammar for the lan guage , while , in this case , we reverse the process and make the language the means and the grammar the end . We can not help believing , that there is a great mistake here , in the arraugements of our college instruction . The best scholars , even , while they are drilled in analysis and forms and rules , are most tryingly deficient in knowledge of the vocabulary of Latin and Greek . They have not learned to dispense , in any considerable measure , with the dictionary , though they may have the grammatical principles most perfectly at command . Only one-half of the work has been accomplished for them ; and , so far as the matter of their enthusiasm is concerned , only that half which is least likely to awaken it . A person who // can not lay aside his German lexicon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every page he reads , will , almost certainly , like English better . The scholar in Greek or Latin is subject , according to his measure , to the same rule . We say , according to his measure , for we fully admit , that , in the case of Greek particularly , we can not easily hope for such entire freedom from bondage , in this regard , as we often attain in German or in French . Nevertheless , we believe it to be possible that our students should know far more of the vocabulary of the classical languages , at the close of their college course , than they now do ; and , just in proportion as they do know more in this way , will their interest in these languages be increased . And while no one believes in the necessity of grammatical study more than we do , we are ready to go so far as to say , that it is better , in every point of view , for a man to be able to read fluently , at graduation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than it is for him ever to have been able to repeat all the forty or fifty exceptions to some minor rule of Latin prosody . Let us carry forward the grammatical studies as far as we can consistently with other ends-let us demand of the preparatory schools a more perfect drill in this department . But do not let us lose everything else in the pursuit of this one object . The then , of Greek and Latin , with a view to familiarity with the language as distinguished from the grammar , we believe to be a thing of very essential importance . Our college curriculum ought to include such studying of these languages as should deliver the young men , in some degree , from the bondage of school-boys , and should introduce them to somewhat , at least , of the freedom of real scholars . But not only should this be accomplished . In connection with it , another result should be aimed at , which , under the existing system , is very difficult to be attained . The mind of the student should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the grace , of the rhetorical power , of all that is beautiful in the style , of the words which he reads . These things vanish from the sight of him who is searching only amid dry details . They hide themselves in ri higher sphere . If we could suppose a person to study the poems of Milton or // the writings of Burke , as our young men , in the colleges , too generally study the works of the ancient authors-that is , if he were to read but a page or two a day , with a laborious use of the dictionary , and with his attention almost exclusively turned to the derivation of words , or the construction of sentences , or the force of the smallest particles , how little could we expect him to know of that which gives these celebrated writers their fame ! He must read long passages at oncewhole poems or orations , it may be-in order that he may understand the authors ' plan and thought , and may feel the force of what they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess himself of everything which , under the inspiration and direction of their genius , contributes to the accomplishment of their design . He must study their works as if he were to make them the models for his own imitation . le must enter into their spirit . To know the name of every rhetorical figure , and the history of every word as a mere word , in Shakespeare 's Plays is not to know those Plays as one ought to know them . Certainly , to know them thus is not likely to awaken love for them . And this , not because grammar and all that belongs to it , or with it , is not useful or essential to the highest scholarship , but because there is something higher and freer and more inspiring than grammar . Homer might as easily , as it seems to us , have produced his wonderful poems by thinking only of the force of his own particles , as the stu* dent of Homer learn to know or love the beauty of those poems by thinking only of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that kills , and the spirit , alone , that gives true life . We press this point , with something of reiteration even , because we regard it as of so great importance . If our college graduates are to have enthusiasm for classical study-if they are to receive , in their earlier course , the impulse to go onward in these studies after their graduation-if the section of our University , of which we are now speaking , is to be filled with its due proportion of ardent lovers of these ancient languages-this higher , ( or , if that word be objected to , this more love-inspiring , ) part of the study must be much more largely cultivated in the undergraduate years . Young men do not love the classics , because they do not appreciate that // which is rich and beantifnl in them . Tbey do not appreciate this , because they are not , carefully and earnestly , taught concerning it . They are not thus taught , because the established system of teaching has been founded so largely on an opposite theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language so familiarly that they naturally study them with reference to style and thought , and , thus , they come to believe in , and to be enthusiastic for , English studies , while they depreciate Latin and Greek , and think them useless or a wearisome burden . The reason of the opposite feelings , and the means of bringing them to a greater similarity , are not difficult of discovery . There was a great deal of force , as we have often thought , in the remark of a foreign acquaintance of ours , on the comparative merits of Schiller and Shakespeare . He regarded the former , he said , as a greater poet than the latter , and , then , with great simplicity and candor , added , " And the reason is , because I understand Schiller and do not understand Shakespeare. ** Let us make our college students understand the beauties of the Iliad or the Antigone , as they understand those of the noblest English poems , and they will not be content to give up their classical reading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study only grammatical rules . We add still another thing , which we think may be done in the undergraduate course to create and increase enthusiasm for these studies , and , thus , may be to the advantage of that section of the University , of which , in this Article , we are speaking . According to the present system , as it seems to us , the student is confined too entirely to the work of mere reci* tation . He translates a passage of a few lines , or answers certain questions of his instructor , and this is all . He has little or no opportunity to ask questions himself , or to suggest points of discussion which may have interested his own mind . Only one half , therefore , of what is desirable is accomplished for him . We believe , that the other half is greatly needed . A young man in college , who knows that , in the recitation or lecture-room , he must be limited to those matters which , in carrying forward hi* own plan , the professor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands made upon him , but he will not be likely to go beyond the routine of these // things . He will follow his teacher and depend wholly upon him , without the independent awakening of his own mind . He will lose the inward stimulus which comes from the knowledge , that every inquiry of his own suggestion can present itself for discussion and decision . Bat , on the other hand , if the instructor is ready to answer as well as to ask questions , and if time is given for the stndent to say what his own investigation impels him to say , it is almost beyond question that he will look at points which are outside of any mere routine . He will investigate the difficulties which he meets . He will inquire into this and that topic which , though not in the immediate line of the daily task set before him , are naturally suggested by it . He will be continually incited to raise questions before his own mind , and to try to answer them , because he knows that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will be aided by his instructor . He will be glad to learn new things connected with his study , continually , and , as he is learning them , his love for the study will constantly increase . We can not help believing , that , under such a system as this , five minds would be awakened to enthusiasm , where one is , at present . And this is what we want . The ends of education are not attained , when a certain kind of mental discipline is given and everything besides this is neglected . The implantation in the soul of love for the study is , perhaps , better than all things else ; such a love as will inspire the student to continue his work , in after years , and will make knowledge seem to be a thing infinitely to be desired  --  a reward compensating for every labor and bringing a most perfect satisfaction . Would that such love might be implanted in the soul of every student ! It would be worth the loss , even ,  --  if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be gained , as we believe , without any such loss . It may be said , indeed , that the time is wanting for the accomplishment of both these objects , and that it is better to secure one of them perfectly , than to make but half-way work with both . We admit that the time is very fully occupied It is for this reason that we think a large increase in the number of instructors , in the academical department , is imperatively required . The students need to be divided into smaller // sub-divisions , where there can be freer opportunity for all of which we have spoken . But a beginning can be made , we think , even now . If even one exercise in each week could be taken from the ordinary recitation work and devoted to such discussion or questioning , or if one-fourth part of every recitation hour could be thus employed , the results would more than justify the outlay . At almost any sacrifice the results ought to be secured . XXTe are not here discussing this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with the under*raduate department , with reference to themselves and to their own importance . We have only in view , at the present time , the relation of them to the growth of the higher department of philology and philosophy . It is sufficient , therefore , to hint at what is needed , and to show what would be its bearing on the end to be desired . Another time and place would be more suitable for a full development of the whole subject . We would , only , add that we would not speak exclusively of the classical studies . The same thing may be urged , to a greater or less extent , with regard to every branch which is to be pursued in this higher department . More inspiration and enthu* siasm need to be imparted in the earlier course , if there is to be any fullness of growth in the later course . The preparation of this character must be made in the part of the University where the education begins , in order that the part , where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do its work for the greatest number and with the most perfect success . We wish it to be borne in mind , also , that we would not demand too much at once . The changes , which are needed ,  --  if our views are correct ,  --  can not be made in a moment . The full and satisfactory accomplishment of them will require the progress of years and a large increase of means . A University can not grow into perfection in a year or in a score of years . It can not do with ten thousand the work which requires twenty thousand . It must move gradually , and must wait , often , for opportunities and possibilities as yet unrealized . No greater unreasonableness can be manifested than in the way ot indiscriminate fault-finding . The men of the past generations could not do what we can , and we can not // do , to-day , what may be an easy work for those who shall come after us . In our discussion , at this time , we are only endeavoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be taken now . The coming era has its peculiar work . Its dawning is upon us . How are we to meet it ? What courses of action shall we enter upon , and what shall we try to do in each one of them as we first enter upon it ? If we may divide the Department of Philosophy and the Arts into two sections , and , for the purposes of our present thought , call the section devoted to general studies , ( not within the field of Natural Science ) , the Department of Philosophythe great work of the coming years , of which we now speak , is the work of strengthening this department . It has had a name to live , thus far . It needs to live in reality . Even in its imperfect state , it has accomplished some praiseworthy results . It needs , with a more perfect organization , to do a larger and better work . The university needs to grow into completeness , i this section of its life . And , if it does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people-in the future , more , perhaps , than any n*ind can measure or estimate . We are aware that against all which we have said some persons may urge , that the attempt is useless-that such high education is best obtained in Europe , and that students will , certainly , go there , if they desire it . We believe this to be true , to a certain extent , and we believe that our young men ought to go to those older countries , for this object . But this need not prevent our doing all we can at home . If the Universities abroad are to be better than ours , for a hundred or five hundred years to come , or for all time even , there is still no reason why our own should not be made as good as possible , in every part . The more a young man knows when he goes to the European universities , the more good his sojoorn there will accomplish for him . The longer he can study at homewithin certain limits  --  the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , who have been in Germany , know how many American students there lose one half , or more than one half ; of what they go thither to gain , because of their imperfect preparation for their work . They have not made progress enough at home // to know what they need , and , much less , ho wto get it when they enter upon their course there . There is , as it seems to us , therefore , abundant work for this department of our own University . It will at least qualify its students to go abroad , if it can not secure them what can be given abroad . It will do much to accomplish the result which we think must be hoped have escaped their immaturity . The restless spirit which makes us impatient to be preachers or lawyers  --  to be " settled , " as we say , in some great business-as soon as possible after manhood commences , must , it would seem , give way as our nation grows older and more popnlons* When it does , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . They will have a broader and larger education than they are now willing to wait for . The wide-spread want of confidence in every man who knows anything , in any department , which we see in our country now , will give way to a juster estimate of things . Even public office , it is to be hoped , will open itself only to those who are , in some measure , qualified for it . But all this is not be secured without any efforts or means for securing it . The popular mind must be educated through the higher education that is given to the more favored classes at the Universities . The better influences must come from these higher sources . There is , then , as it seems to us , abundant ground for every effort to develop the department of which we speak . It is a way in which we are to move onward towards the completeness of ' the University itself . It is a way in which we are to gain for culture its true place in the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give to many an ardent youth one of the greatest blessings that can be bestowed upon him . It is a way in which -- if that result is ever to be attained-we are to put ourselves , at some future time , in this regard , on a level with the European world . We have referred , in these pages , to this section of our University and to what should be done for it , not because we regard it as of more importance than the professional and scientific schools , or than the Aca dernical department , but be cause it is the section which , as yet , is least perfectly developed . // Elsewhere , we have not only the form , but , in some measure , the actual and successful organization of the parts of the complete University . Here we have the form , but , as yet , little more . The entire working power has been from outside of the section itself , and the results have been very limited . Believing , as we do , that the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a college with outside schools , but a university composed of coordinate and co-equal branches - it becomes us , in any more particular discussion of that work , to consider , at the outset , that branch which has attained the least completeness . If we are deficient anywhere , in the form of the University , certainly , one of earliest works to which we are called is , to fill out the deficiency . If we have , in any part , the form without the full'ness of the reality , we should , as soon as possible , attempt to reach that fullness . So the great end is to be accomplished . The weaker parts , also - as we have said in our previous Article-need the first thought and the most tender care . Do not let us neglect anything , whether it be weaker or stronger-but , while we give thought enough to that which is already moving on successfully , let us bestow especial attention on that which needs helping that it may move at all . This is the part of the wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardian of any work , for the accomplishment of which the varied parts must move on together in a successful way . The officers of a university must obey the great general laws of human life , if they would honorably and usefully discharge their trust . Moreover this section is the one which , in a certain sense , seems to gather into itself , more than any other , the university spirit . Culture for its own sake , and not merely for its practical uses , - culture as a good in itself-this is one of the mottoes of a University . Not to despise-rather to glory in the uses of knowledge and its beneficial influence on mankind-but , at the same time , not to despise , but to glory in knowledge as the enrichment of the man 's own soul , this is the spirit ot the halls consecrated to learning . The section of the University , where the student is learning only for learning 's sake-where his studies are , least of all , connected with the practical works // of life ( except , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - this section is the sanctuary , as it were , of this spirit , and ought to be guarded with jealous care , and adorned with everything that is beautiful , by those who watch for the welfare of the whole University . We hope and believe , that those who may have in charge the interests of Yale College will not lose sight of this great work of the coming era . It is one which may appropriately follow , or connect itself with , or even make a part of , that which we set forth in the last number of the New Englander , and without which , as we believe , the glory of the future will be lost .
