" THE COUNTRY GIRL " has held the stage in one shape and another ( but always on the same lines ) for over two hundred years . It was first called " The Country Wife , " was written by William Wycherley , in his thirty-fifth year , and was produced at the Theatre Royal , in Drury Lane , in 1675 , exactly two hundred and nine years ago . The cast on this interesting occasion was as follows : MR . PINCHWIFE Major Mohun . SPARKISH Joe Haynes . HARCOURT Mr. Kynaston . HORNER Mr. Hart . MISTRESS PINCHWIFE Mrs. Bowtel . ALITHEA Mrs. James . LUCY Mrs. Cory . The celebrated actor , Quinn , was also one of the notable performers of the part of Pinchwife . When Garrick became manager of the new or second Drury Lane Theatre , Wycherley 's comedy had been in disuse for nearly half a century  --  and he altered and adapted the popular old piece for his own company , producing it in 1766 . He entirely reconstructed several of the scenes , and altered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which he played himself ) ; Mrs. Pinchwife he changed into Peggy Thrift ( which Miss Hopkins , the original Lady Teazle , played ) ; and Horner , which he cleansed and brightened , and called Belville . Garrick also altered the name of the old play , and gave it the title of " The Country Girl . " The most important revival of this play , however , took place in 1785  --  also at Drury Lane Theatre  --  where the afterward famous Dora Jordan made her first appearance in London . This was just ninety-nine years ago . During Mrs. Jordan 's lifetime the play was very popular . Few actresses attempted it after her death ; the last time it received any notable revival being at Covent Garden , 1828 . In this country " The Country Girl " was first played at the John Street Theatre , in 1789 , and since then it has not been acted for very nearly half a century , the last recorded performance being at the Old Park Theatre , in 1839 ; and the first performance which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given at Daly 's Theatre , and which almost took the town by storm . The freshness , the novelty , and the quaintness of the performance was a surprise to everybody who had been accustomed to associate the name of " old comedy " with all that is dry , old-fashioned , and stiff . That rare comedian of the old school , Mr. Charles Fisher , gave one of his best studies of character in his portrayal of the gruff curmudgeon Moody ; while the quintessence of violets was in Miss Ada Rehan 's embodiment of " Peggy , " in which she exemplified at once the charm of the new school of natural acting accentuated by an intuitive knowledge of that abandon to the part portrayed , which seems to mark all that we know or read of the best examples in the old school . One of her critics wrote thus of Miss Rehan 's performance : " A more absolutely charming recklessness of innocence has never been portrayed in our time . Miss Rehan appears to know exactly what the beaus of two hundred years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes may be taken as the first exemplification of that strange , delightful thing that Shakspere called ' a coddling '  --  a something wholly indeterminate in our time . The delicious waywardness and wantonness of her legs  --  which are as weakly lawless as boneless innocence can make them  --  gave a ceaseless flutter to the play . They flitted like moth 's wings everywhere . " The fop of our ancestors , portrayed by Mr. Parkes in this performance , was not less universally praised . In fact the whole comedy , as played by Mr. Daly 's company , came upon the town something in the nature of an old treasure long overlooked , newly found , and heartily welcomed . A few words about Wycherley , who originated the piece over two hundred years ago , may not prove uninteresting : William Wycherley was born about the year 1640 , and was the eldest son of Daniel Wycherley , of Cleve , in Shropshire . At the age of fifteen he was sent to France , where he became a Roman Catholic ; but , on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen 's College , Oxford , he returned to the Protestant faith . His genius and gaiety introduced him to the most celebrated characters of the reign of Charles II . He was the prime favorite of the celebrated Duchess of Cleveland , the companion of the witty and dissolute Villiers , Duke of Buckingham ; and so high did he stand in the esteem of his sovereign , that , being ill of a fever at his lodgings in Bow Street , King Charles did him the singular honor of a visit , when , finding his health much impaired , he commanded him to take a journey to the south of France , at the same time ordering him the sum of five hundred pounds to defray the charges of his journey . A premature marriage with the Countess of Drogheda lost him the favor of the king , who justly considered it the duty of a subject , on whom he had lavished so much kindness , to have acquainted him with the circumstance . This unfortunate event , and the extreme jealousy of his wife , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a source of perpetual disquiet , which , however , received a temporary relief by her death . But his title to her fortune being disputed , and being unable to defray law charges and other incumbrances , he was thrown into prison . In this state he languished for several years . The bounty of King James II . was ineffectually exerted to release him ; and it was not until his father 's death that he became finally emancipated . Being resolved to die married , though , after his matrimonial endurances , he was unwilling to live so , he entered a second time into that holy state ; and eleven days after the celebration of the nuptials , on the 1st of January , 1715 , he died , and was buried in the vault of Covent Garden Church , London .

HARCOURT and BELVILLE enter , L. Har . Harcourt ( R. ) Ha , ha , ha ! and so you are in love , cousin  --  not reasonably and gallantly , as a young gentleman ought , but sighingly , miserably so : not content to be ankle-deep , you have soused over head and ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much in that condition , indeed , cousin , and nothing can save me . Sighs and crosses , R. Both sit . Har . Harcourt No , not if you whine and sigh , when you should be exerting everything that is man about you . I have sent Sparkish , who is admitted at all hours in the house , to know how the land lies for you , and if she is not married already . Bel . Belville How cruel you are  --  you raise me up with one hand , and then knock me down with the other ! Har . Harcourt Well , well , she sha n't be married . Enter WILLIAM , L. Wil . William An odd sort of a person , from the country I believe , who calls himself Moody , wants to see you , sir ; but as I did not know him , I said you were not at home , but would return directly .  --  And so will I , too ! said he , very short and surly ; and away he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , Will  --  I 'll see him when he comes .

Harcourt We must suppose the worst , and be prepared for him . Tell me all you know of this ward of his , this Peggy  --  Peggy what 's her name ? Bel . Belville Thrift , Thrift , cousin . Har . Harcourt Ay , ay , Sir Thomas Thrift 's daughter , of Hampshire , and left , very young , under the guardianship of my old companion and acquaintance , Jack Moody . Bel . Belville Your companion !  --  he 's old enough to be your father . Har . Harcourt Thank you , Dick ; he has greatly the advantage of me in years , as well as wisdom . When I first launched from the university into this ocean of London , he was the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years ; but , all of a sudden , he took a freak ( a very prudent one ) of retiring wholly into the country . Bel .

Crosses , L. Har . Harcourt And are you so young , so foolish , and so much in love , that you would take her with half her value , ha ? Bel . Belville I 'll take her with anything  --  with nothing . Har . Harcourt What , such an unaccomplished , awkward , silly creature ! He has scarce taught her to write ; she has seen nobody to converse with but the country people about ' em ; so she can do nothing but dangle her arms , look gawky , turn her toes in , and talk broad country .

Belville I saw her three times in the country , and spoke to her twice ; I have leaped an orchard-wall , like Romeo , to come at her ; played the balcony-scene , from an old summer-house in the garden ; and , if I lose her , I will find out an apothecary , and play the tomb-scene , too . Crosses , R. Har . Harcourt Well said , Dick ! this spirit must produce something ; but has the old dragon ever caught you sighing at her ? Bel .

What , your cousin , too ! and a little dumpish , or so ? you have been giving him a lecture upon economy , I suppose ; you , who never had any , can best describe the evils that arise from the want of it . I never mind my own affairs , not I  --  Crosses , C. " the gods take care of Cato . " I hear , Mr. Belville , you have got a pretty snug house , with a bay-window that looks into the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very convenient , and well-imagined ; no young handsome fellow should be without one . Har . Harcourt ( L. ) You vain fellow , you ! Prithee , do n't teach my cousin your abandoned tricks  --  he is a modest young man . Spa . Sparkish ( R. ) May be so  --  but his modesty has done some mischief at our house  --  my surly , jealous , soon-to-be brother-in-law saw that modest young gentleman casting a wishful eye at his forbidden fruit , from the new tavern-window . Bel . Belville ( R. ) You mistake the person , Mr. Sparkish  --  I do n't know what young lady you mean . Har . Harcourt Explain yourself , Sparkish ; you must mistake  --  Dick has never seen the girl . Spa . Sparkish ( C. ) I do n't say he has ; I only tell you what Moody says . Besides , he went to the tavern himself , and inquired of the waiter who dined in the back-room  --  No. 4 ; and they told him it was Mr. Belville , your cousin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to know of it , faith ! Crosses , L. Har . Harcourt He kissed his hand , indeed , to your lady , Alithea , and is more in love with her than you are , and very near as much as I am ; so look about you  --  such a youth may be dangerous . Spa . Sparkish The more danger , the more honor : I defy you both  --  win her and wear her if you can . Dolus an virtus in love , as well as in war . Crossing , C. Poor Alithea grows impatient  --  I ca n't put off the evil day any longer . I fancy the brute , her brother , has a mind to marry his country idiot at the same time . Har . Harcourt I thought he had married already . Spa . Sparkish No , no , he 's not married ; that 's the joke of it . Bel . Belville No , no , he 's not married . Har . Harcourt Hold your tongue ! Elbowing BELVILLE . Spa . Sparkish Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Crosses , C. by the by , he intends calling upon you , for he asked me where you lived , to complain of Modesty , there . Bel . Belville I thought you said just now that he was not married . What does he want to complain of me for ? HARCOURT still makes signs to BELVILLE . Spa . Sparkish You must know , my booby of a would-be brother-in-law hath brought up this ward of his ( a good fortune , let me tell you ) as he coops up and fattens his chickens  --  for his own eating ; he is plaguey jealous of her , and was very sorry that he could not marry her in the country , without coming up to town ; which he could not do , on account of some writings or other . So what does my gentleman ? he persuades the poor silly girl , by breaking a sixpence , or some nonsense or another , that they are to all intents married in heaven , but that the laws require the signing of articles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has made her call him husband , and Bud , which she constantly does ; and he calls her wife , and gives out she is married , that she may not look after younger fellows , nor younger fellows after her , egad ; ha , ha , ha ! and all wo n't do ! Crosses , L. Bel . Belville Thank you , sir  --  what heavenly news ! Aside . Har . Harcourt What an idiot you are !  --  And so , then , you make but one trouble of it  --  and are both to be tacked together the same day ? Spa . Sparkish No , no , he ca n't be married this week ; he blames the lawyers for keeping him in town ; besides , I am out of favor , and he is continually snarling at me and abusing me for not being jealous . Knocking at the door , L. There he is  --  I must not be seen with you , for he 'll suspect something ; I 'll go with your cousin to his house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make a visit to my wife that is to be ; and perhaps we shall show young Modesty here a sight of Peggy , too . HARCOURT crosses to WILLIAM . Enter WILLIAM , L. Wil . William Sir , here 's the strange odd sort of a gentleman come again , and I have shown him into the fore-parlor . Spa . Sparkish That must be Moody ! Well said , Will  --  an odd sort of a strange gentleman , indeed ! We 'll step into the next room till he comes into this , and then you may have him all to yourself  --  much good may it do you ! Skips back , then turns again to BELVILLE and takes his arm . Remember that he is married , or he 'll suspect me of betraying him . Exeunt SPARKISH and BELVILLE , R. Har . Harcourt Show him up , Will . Exit WILLIAM , L.

By thy long absence from the town , the grumness of thy countenance , and the slovenliness of thy habit , I should give thee joy  --  you are certainly married . Moo . Moody My long stay in the country will excuse my dress ; and I have a suit at law that brings me up to town , and puts me out of humor  --  besides , I must give Sparkish ten thousand pounds to-morrow to take my sister off my hands . Har . Harcourt Well , never grumble about it  --  what 's done ca n't be undone ; is your wife handsome and young ? Moo . Moody She has little beauty but her youth , nothing to brag of but her health , and no attraction but her modesty  --  wholesome , homely , and housewifely , that 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look , Jack . But , prithee , why wouldst thou marry her , if she be ugly , ill-bred , and silly ? She must be rich , then . Moo . Moody As rich as if she had the wealth of the Mogul  --  she 'll not ruin her husband with a million of vices she never heard of  --  then , because she 's ugly , she 's the likelier to be my own ; and , being ill-bred , she 'll hate conversation ; and , since silly and innocent , will not know the difference between me and you ; that is , between a man of thirty and one of forty . Har . Harcourt Fifty , to my knowledge . MOODY turns off and grumbles . But see how you and I differ , Jack  --  wit to me is more necessary than beauty ; I think no young woman ugly that has it ; and no handsome woman agreeable without it . Moo . Moody ( L. ) ' T is my maxim  --  he 's a fool that marries ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know the town , Mr. Harcourt ; and your cousin . Crosses , R. , and sits . Har .

Moody I have no curiosity , so give yourself no trouble . You have heard of a wolf in sheep 's clothing , and I have seen your innocent cousin kissing his hands at my windows . Har . Harcourt At your sister , I suppose : not at her unless he was tipsy . How can you , Jack , be so outrageously suspicious ? Moo . Moody Rises . I confess my visit to you , Mr. Harcourt , was partly for old acquaintance sake , but chiefly to desire your cousin to confine his gallantries to the tavern , and not send ' em in looks , signs , or tokens , on the other side of the way . Going . Crosses , L. Har . Harcourt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . Well , I 'll tell him , ha , ha , ha ! Poor Dick , how he 'll stare . Shall we dine together at the tavern , and send for my cousin to chide him for his gallantry ? Ha , ha , ha ! we shall have fine sport . Moo . Moody I am not to be laughed out of my senses , Mr. Harcourt . I was once a modest young gentleman myself , and I never have been half so mischievous before or since , as I was in that state of innocence .  --  And so , old friend , make no ceremony with me  --  I have much business , and you have much pleasure ; and therefore , as I hate forms , I will excuse your returning my visit , or sending your cousin to satisfy me of his modesty  --  and so your servant .

Peggy How should he be afraid of my loving another man , when he will not let me see any but himself ? Ali . Alithea Did he not carry you yesterday to a play ? Peg . Peggy Ay ; but we sat amongst ugly people : he would not let me come near the gentry , who sat under us , so that I could see ' em .

Belville As you are not mercenary , Mrs. Lucy , I ought to be the more generous : give me leave to present you with this trifle Gives a ring. , not as a reward for your services , but as a small token of friendship .

Look ye , sir  --  do n't grin ; for , if you dare show your teeth at my misfortunes , I 'll dash ' em down your impudent throat , you jackanapes . Dances up and down . Spa . Sparkish Quite calm . Very fine , faith  --  but I have no weapons to butt with a mad bull , so you may toss and roar by yourself , if you please . BELVILLE appears C. L. Bel . Belville ( C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moo .

BELVILLE and PEGGY come forward . Moo . Moody I am stupefied with shame , rage , and astonishment  --  my fate has o'ercome me  --  I can struggle no more with it . Sighs . I will hurry down to my old house , take a twelve-month 's provision into it  --  cut down my draw-bridge  --  run wild about my garden  --  which shall grow as wild as myself  --  The other characters are in a cluster , C. then will I curse the world , and every individual in it ; and , when my rage and spirits fail me , I will be found dead among the nettles and thistles ; a woful example of the baseness and treachery of one sex , and of the falsehood , lying , perjury , deceit , impudence , and All laugh .

SPARKISH staggers to seat L , perceives ALITHEA , gets up with difficulty and resigns the chair to her . PEGGY comes forward and addresses the audience in the following EPILOGUE . But you , good gentry , what say you to this ? You are to judge me  --  have I done amiss ? Bud was so passionate , and grown so thrifty ,  --  ' T was a sad life ,  --  and then , he was near fifty ! I 'm but nineteen  --  my husband , too , is young . Have I ,  --  pray , ladies , speak , done very wrong ? Great folks , I know , will call me simple fool , Marriage with them 's a fashion  --  soon grows cool ! With half my fortune I would rather part , Than be all finery , with an aching heart . For such strange country notions do n't abuse me ; And , as I know no better , pray excuse me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SPARKISH . BELVILLE . PEGGY . ALITHEA . HARCOURT .
