txt If the report which is circulating in Washington , and which our correspondent sends to us this morning , is true , it affords one more proof that the Democrats can do nothing to'give the country honest money . The report to which we refer is that Mr. THUR. - MAN 'S friends have become alarmed at the strength which ex-Gov . ALLEN shows in the primary meetings of the party in Ohio , and that they have prepared , with Senator TilintmAN 's approval , a resolution on the financial question intended as a bid for the support of ALLEN 'S followers . This resolution favors the substitution of legal tenders for the national bank notes in such quantities as the needs of business may require . If ALLEN 'S supporters were to be gained by a declaration in favor of the abstract ideas which the venerable ex-Guveruor is supposed to represent , they could not ask anything more pronounced than this . It is the essence of ALLEN 'S Voluminous speech es boiled down to the smallest possible dimensions . It is the Ohio platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which ho very nearly succeeded in carrying the State . It is in entire harmony with the wild and vicious harangues which " Can . " CARY made in the same canvass . It quite agrees with the extremest teachings of the Cincinnati Enquirer . In short , it is the simplest and completost possible declaration in favor of inflation , repudiation , and ruin . We sincerely hope that a man who has given the public so many occasions to think well of him has not made this useless sacrifice to the insatiable spirit of error which possesses his party in his own State , and . which is likely to control the National Convention . Yet we are compelled to admit that there is little difference between what Mr. THURMAN is now reported to have done and what he is perfectly well known to have done in the recent past . The step from the Payne bill , which the Senator supported in the Democratic caucus , to the resolution with which he is now credited , is not a one , and is to one who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descensus axerni . Mr. THURMAN has already shown himself so painfully anxious to sacrifice everything that was necessary to secure his nomination to the Presidency that he has very little loft to offer . Mho has really made up his mind that there is a lower level which ho must get down to in order to secure the object of his ambition , we can not see how he could roach it more readily than , by some such proposition as it is now alleged that ha has made . But no one not blinded by passionate aspiration for political honors could fail to see that this last degradation is gratuitous and useless . Even if it wore possible by this moans for the Ohio Senator to attract a few of the votes intended for his more reckless uncle , lie would find that , like TARQUIN , he had " won what he would lose again . " . The support of these men would be fatal to him in the East , and , indeed , among all reasonable friends of sound finance . But he can not secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They know perfectly well what they- desire . It is a man who believes as they do , who is sincerely possessed with their crazy notions , who can say , as ALLEN said last Fall , that there is no difference between a paper dollar and a gold dollar , and who would never be troubled with any scruples in regard to the full accomplishment of their policy . May understand that tale essential value of hard money is to Senator TnURAIAN literally a " conviction , " ? an idea which has conquered his intelligence , and which he can no more surrender at will than he could give up his knowledge that the earth is round or the sun heti . They do not , trust him , and can not , The very course by which ho essays to win them is proof that he is not to be relied on , and that ho may betray them , as he has betrayed his hard-money following , if the occasion should offer for him to do so . The indications are numerous that Mr. THURMAN can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he can not , it will be for reasons which will make the inflation element in the Democratic National Convention extremely powerful . Those who insist that TILDEN is to walk over the course at St. Louis , and receive a nomination on a hard-money platform , will be sorely disappointed .
