txt The investigation into the causes of the removal of Mr. Welles from the Wardenship of Auburn Prison , which was begun by the special committee of the Senate this evening , developed some interesting facts . Smith M. Weed , the Mephistopheles of the TildenRobinson clique , appears again as the nimble agent to carry out the conspiracy of his chief . Mr. Pilsbury was reluctantly forced to admit that the first man that suggested to him the necessity or removing Mr. Welles was Weed . This occurred at an interview between Pilsbury and Weed hero in Albany , immediately after the November election . On the same day Pilsbury telegraphed to Mr. Welles to come to Albany forthwith . Mr , Welles arrived in Albany Sunday morning , at daylight , on Nov. 16 . He went immediately to the Albany Penitentiary , where he met Mr. Pilsbury , and the following conversation took place , as testified to by Mr. Welles : " My question to Mr. Pilsbury was , ' Why have you sent for me I " I am in trouble , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . ' He said , I am in trouble ; I no sooner get out of one scrape than I am in another . ' I then said , ' Is it in relation to the charges the Governor holds over you ? They are settled , are they not I ' He said , ' Yes , ' ' What is it then7 ' I said . He re . plied , ' They want Auburn Prison . ' I said , ' Who wants Auburn Prison ? ' He replied , ' I received a dispatch from Smith Weed yesterday directing me to come to Albany . I was at Sing Sing with my family . I came up in response to the telegram and saw Weed . Ho notified me that I must have your resignation . I told him that I could not remove Mr. Welles ; that ho was one of . my best officers . I then said : " Does the Controller ask it Does the Governor ask it 1 " Weed replied : " I am authorized to speak for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire of thorn . " I then went to Controller Olcott , and had a talk with him . After some conversation , I asked the Controller if he know anything about the matter , and ho said he did . I asked if it met his approval , and he said it did . I then told him I thought 1 could secure your resignation . ' " In reply to this narrative , the witness said he told Pilsbury to tell them they could not have Auburn Prison . lie continued : " I then said to him , ' Yon have told me what they want ; now what do you want 7 ' He said , ' I have n't told you what / want . ' I replied that there was only one way in which they could get Auburn Prison , and that was by Pilsbury 's removal . I would not resign . He replied , ' Well , if you do n't resign , I sha n't remove you . ' I replied , ' Very well . ' We then had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . During this conversation I told him that ho would weaken himself by removing me . I alsomsked him why he was compelled to do this . He replied , ' The charges against me were suppressed with the understanding that I was to do what they required . ' " Mr. Welles 's straightforward , frank manner of testifying impressed every one that he was telling the literal truth and narrating the conversation as it actually occurred . Moreover , his testimony conforms to all the circumstances attending his removal . Of course , Pilsbury and Weed deny that politics had anything to do with the removal , but the time and manner of it . and the appointment that was made to fill Mr. Welles 's place , all go to show that it was done for political reasons , and no others , and was , therefore , a clear violation of the law . Moses , who was appointed to succeed Welles , was the editor of the Tilden newspaper in Auburn , and was also a member of the Democratic State Committee . ills vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the organization of the State Committee , and the charge is that it was secured by a promise of Welles 's place . At all events , it is admitted , oven by Pilsbury himself , that he removed one of the most competent and honest men he had , and a life-long friend and relative , to make room for a man who had never had any experience in State Prison management . The only reason Mr. ? Pilsbury was able to give for such an extraordinary act was that Mr. Welles and the clerk of the prison , one Underhill , appointed by the Controller , did not agree very well . But it was shown that their differences had all been amicably settled three months before Welles was removed . Besides , it will naturally occur to every one . why was not the clerk removed instead of the Warden , as his services were of minor importance to the Warden 's ? . Weed was asked the question why ho did not advise the Controller to remove his clerk instead of advising the Superintendent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in prison management . Weed hesitated , and finally stammered out that " his advice was n't asked about the clerk . " The investigation will bo resumed next Thursday . Smith M. Weed testified that after Mr. Pilsbury told him of the annoyances he had because of trouble between Welles and Underhill , the clerk at Auburn Prison , ho Mr. Weedj recommended Wellos 's removal , as it would relieve Pilsbury from the charge of nepotism , Welles being Pllsbury 's cousin . The following correspondence from Pilsbury to Welles was then road by the latter : OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT or STATE PRISONS , ALBANY , N. Y. , Nov. 19 , 1876 . DEAR LEW : Can not you find your key now ? Have looked in vain . You take the wrong view about " resignation . " It is different from my ease , in which charges had been made that were not true . As to you , no charges are brought against you . It is simply a question as to whether , with the existing feeling between yourself and certain departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that you should do so . I feel , under all the circumstances , that I must make a change , not that there is the least fault to be found with your official management , but for ' the sake of harmony . and because others have become firmly convinced that the public interest will suffer from the personal feelings and animosity now existing at the prison and in Auburn . I therefore still think that it is best for all parties that you send in your resignation to take effect Dee . 1 . We have been friends from boyhood , and you know that I would not ask you to do a wrong act or one that could harm your future . My only object is harmony , when It is imperatively necessary for the welfare of the prisons and all connected with them . I expect your parents hero this afternoon All well , and all send love .

DEAR LEW. : I returned from New-York . Saturday night . To-day I have endeavored in vain to arrange matters . As I wrote you before . the feeling against you is very strong , and it is utterly impossible to have peace or harmony as matters stand , and I must have the support , confidence , and co-operation of both the Governor and Controller to succeed in my duties . I regret it exceedingly , but they have been informed that you have repeatedly declared in Auburn and New  --  Fork that yOu " did not care for the place , and was ready to leave it any time , " &c.; Your resignation has not yet been received , but 1 suppose it will reach me before the 80th . By this mail I forward Mr. Moses his appointment . You are well aware I thoroughly anpreciato the manner in which you have discharged your official duties , and that my only reason for the change is that the publics interests demand perfect harmony between all connected with the government of the prisons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office . If you wish you can have the appointment . In my opinion it is a very desirable position . You will be responsible to me alone , and no trouble can possibly occur between you and any State officer . I regret that the contractors have interfered in this matter at all , No one knows better than yourself that when they endeavor to " rue a prison , it is the end of all government and discipline . They can rest assured that no matter who is Warden , be will be required to carry out ' my directions and keep the discipline up to the present standard or vacate his position .
