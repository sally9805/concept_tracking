txt We are to have an American Jacobin society . To a native-born American , who has never felt the iron heel of oppression or the grinding weight of any despotism , there is something very odd about the revolutionary spirit of some of our imported fellowcitizens . A man who has regularly paid his taxes , and has seen them returned to him in the cost of the Police which protects him at night , the roads on which he travels , and in schooling for his children and the ma chinery by which he secures his rights from invasion , does not feel very much oppressed . To be sure , an imported thief may get into the Municipal Government and rob the City Treasury into which his taxes have gone , or he may have his head broken by a locust club in the hands of a brutal Irish policeman , and at such times he begins to think , with Truthful James ; that " civilization is a failure . " But outside of cities in which the foreign element dominates politics and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the times are hard and money is scarce , it is thought a proper thing to talk of a revolution . A year or two since , when the condition of business was discouraging and wages were low , it was proposed to set up in this City an imitation of the Paris Commune . The queer people who headed the movement , like the founders of the Theosophical Society , wanted something distinctively foreign and brie-a-brae-ish . So they hired a hall , hung up bloodred flags , talked vociferously in French , Irish , German , and bad English , and paraded about the streets on sundry occasions . They carried a Phrygian cap on a pole , cried " Vivo la Commune ! " and said and did many things which would have been striking and picturesque in a spectacular drama , but which were excessively funny in the broad daylight of the streets of New-York . Some of them talked of making bitrricades  --  tearing up the Belgian pavement to get " rocks to heave " at the Police , and rifling the banks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings . A few of those hula= tics were arrested , more of them were laughed at , and when , just as the midsummer madness . was subsiding , DENIS KEARNEY came here to fan the flames , his ribald nonsense fell on unheeding ears . We can imagine that men who were brought up under the despotic rule of the last NAPOLEON , or who have looked across the immense gulf which divides European pauperism from European aristocracy and royalty , might continue to howl against the rich and influential , long after they had settled in the United States . It is the force of habit . As the Irishman said , during the late civil war , when asked how he should vote , " Ag'in the Government . I 've always been ag'in the Government in the ould country . " And one can understand how weak-headed Americans , tickled with any new thing , should be drawn into a movement which has the attraction of novelty , and which gives them a chance to take into their own experience some of the romanticism of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as they have heretofore only read of in the books . All this seemed quite delicious to some of these enthusiasts , and they doubtless were able to persuade themselves that they were very much oppressed indeed , especially in the matter of beer , which that greasy citizen , SCHWAB , persisted in selling for five cents a glass , instead of giving to suffering humanity without money and without price . In New-York , there are no palaces , thrones , or dynasties to destroy . If the lunatics of the Caf6 International had organized a mob to set things right , they would have been puzzled to know where to begin their work . It would have signified nothing if they had put a Phrygian cap on the head of a captive Mayor , as they did on the wig of LOUIS CAPET . We can fancy that Mr. SMITH ELY , who was then magistrate , would have thought such a proceeding a good joke . There are no thrones to throw into the streets , no emblems of power to tear from the walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , the mob might have blown up Mr. MULLETT 'S granite Post Office , as a faint imitation of the destruction of the Bastile . But that would not have troubled anybody but the distinguished architect , whose rare talent for vituperation would have dispersed any mob not wholly destitute of the common instincts of humanity . But in California the case is different . There the Chinese are recognized as the creatures of the moneyed oligarchy . The foreign gentleman from Ireland regards the foreign gentlemen from China as the outgrowth of a plutocracy which , unless radical measures are adopted at once , will eventually make it impossible for a humble laborer to earn the price of a pint of whisky without working for it . Mr. DENIS KEARNEY 'S secret organization , as he has just informed the public , is to be known as " The Jacobin Society . " Mr. KEARNEY , in the course of his extensive reading , ( for he can read , ) has found that there was , somewhere , a revolutionary society known as " The Jacobins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they flourished nor why they were thus named . Nevertheless , " Jacobin " has a delightfully melodramatic sound , and it well comports with the object of the society , which is avowed to be " to hang every and any merchant who should employ Chinese , or in any way encourage Chinese labor . " At . the recent election in California , out of a total poll of 161,294 votes , 883 votes were cast in favor of Chinese immigration . The Jacobin Society , of San Francisco , will not have an extensive hanging-match . If the vote above mentioned represents the actual strength of the American-Chinese element in the State , DENIS 'S job will be speedily performed . And as the men who favor Chinese immigration are in a hopeless minority , their resistance will not be protracted . When tyranny is thus summarily dispatched on the other side of the continent , let us hope that the Jacobins will come this way . Our tyrants also are foreign . But they do not come from Asia .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
