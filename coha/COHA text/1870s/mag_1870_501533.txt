IN the traditionary history of Denmark the story is told of a nobleman who lived at some time after the successful invasions of England by the Danes , and who , being an able and a valiant man , attained distinction , according to the standard of those times , by feats of arms on sea and land which nowadays would be called piracy and robbery . He and his younger brother were made , or made themselves , co governors of the province of Jutland-that part of Denmark that lies nearest Norway . The fame of this nobleman  --  the elder-became so great , and his prowess and his enterprise made him so feared by the rulers of neighboring countries , that the King of Norway , being the most disturbed and clesiring to bring matters to an issue , desperately challenged him to single combat , the conditions of which were that a part of Norway corresponding in importance to the province of Jutland should be set up as a stake against the latter , and that both should be the prize of the survivor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King of Norway was slain , the lands which he had staked on the issue becoming thereupon a part of the realm of Denmark . The Kino* of the latter country , who was called , as his proudest distinction , The Dane , as being the first and foremostof his nation , seeing the martial and political importance of this nobleman , and seeking to bind him firmly to his interests and to forestall any ambitious projects which he might form , gave him his , daughter in marriage ; and on the death of the father , the successful adventurere in virtue of his connection with Geruth or Gertrude , for so the princess was called , and by reason of his being foremost in martial prowess and all kingly qualities , claimed and received the throne of Denmark . For dynasties were not fixed among the Scandinavian and Teutonic races in those times , and regular family succession was not settled . The crown was elective ; but unless there was some good or cogent reason to the contrary , the election was likely to fall upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a point of much importance in the sequel of this story . After his elevation the new King seemed to fulfil all the hopes which his previous conduct had awakened . He was beloved of his courtiers and his nobles ; and by no person did he seem to be held in higher estimation than by his wife , through whom , in a great measure , he attained the throne , and whose fondness for her splendid lord and master was exhibited so openly as to be the subject of general remark . No king could have fairer prospects of a long and happy reign , or of leaving with greater assurance of certainty his sceptre and kingdom to his son and heir . For Gertrude had brought him a son , who was called Amleth , Hamblet , or Hamlet , a lad of high promise , but whose life came through grief disappointment , turmoil , and disaster to a tragical ending , partly through the villany of his uncle and the wantonness of his mother , and partly through a defect of his own nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his brother , to whom he was much inferior in all points of mind and soul and body that go to the making of a noble man , and moved , too , by one of the meanest of all passions , ambition , which seeks not goodness and greatness with a single eye to be good and great , but strives for superiority to others , set his bad heart upon the attainment of his brother 's throne ; and as his first step toward the accomplishment of his purpose , he sought to win the affections of his brother 's wife , she who was both by birth // band , she consented to , or at least winked at his murder by her paramour , who at once took his brother 's place upon the throne , and like his brother confirmed his seat by a marriage with her , which took place within a few weeks of the death of her husband . At this time Hamlet was a student at college , or at school , the name then given to the highest institutions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it could not have been more than twenty years . For we are told that the new King was looking forward with apprehension to the time when his nephew should come to man 's estate ; he is spoken of as the young Adonis of the North , and his affection is called a violet in the youth of primy nature ; and all the many references to his age at this time show that he was on the threshold of early manhood . Chief among his friends and companions at the university was a young gentleman of no estate , but of a noble soul and of a simple , strong , and steadfast nature , named Horatio , who seems to have been somewhat older as well as more staid than himself . Two others , very much his inferiors , named Rosencrantz and Guildenstern , were also his companions . Even at college the young Hamlet , with an innate disposition to criticise all things , seems to have studied the characters of those around him ; and he had preferred Horatio , not with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered in him certain admirable qualities-fortitude , good faith , firmness of will , and a calm serenity of disposition . Hamlet was intellectually fascinated by a character which he appreciated none the less , but rather the more , because it was the opposite to his own ; while Horatio was pleased with the affability , the princely courtesy , the high discourse , far-reaching thought , and subtle insight of Hamlet . The death of Hamlet 's father brought the youthful prince from the university to Elsinore , the capital of Denmark , whither he went filled with two conflicting thoughts , grief for his father and expectation of succeeding him on the throne . For one of Hamlet 's passions was that form of ambition which consists in a love . of dignified position and power , although he was without the enterprise and the hardiness of nature which would enable him to win these for himself . He loved to be gracious and courteous to those around him ; and he desired to stand upon the elevation coming from which his grace and courtesy might be highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring which were necessary to the thrusting of another down who stood in his place , however wrongfully . This partly because of his youth and his studious habits , but partly also because of his mental constitution . He arrived at court barely in time for his father 's funeral , and found his uncle already in possession of the throne with the consent and hearty support of all his father 's nob ! es and courtiers , and even of his father 's widow . His mother , whom he expected to see plunged in an overwhelming sorrow , surprised and disgusted him by an unconcealed fondness for his uncle , and offended him no less by the willing consent which she gave to the extinction of his own present hopes of the succession . The swift marriage of his mother to his uncle rounded and perfected this outrage by its complete disregard of his father 's memory , and by the stability it gave to his uncle 's position on a throne which Hamlet had looked upon as his own almost certain inheritance . For in him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the royalty in Denmark* Thus sorely smitten in his two tenderest points , he went about the court // moodily , making a show of his anger and his grief ; saying little , doing no , thing , fretting and sneering , but not forming any designs for the vindication of his fatlier 's memory or the attainment of his own ambition . For his was one of those natures into which wrong enters like a thorn to wound and rankle , not as a spur to rouse endeavor . In this he was very unlike young Fortinbras , the son of the King of Norway , slain by Hamlet 's father , who , although a delicate and gentle prince for those rough days , being yet full of spirit and promptitude of soul , seized this moment when the court of Denmark was in a disturbed Condition , over which Hamlet was musing and fretting , to set on foot a warlike enterprise for the recovery of the territory which had been lost to Norway by the slaying of his father . The threatened war and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and darkened the royal honeymoon with serious alarm . Hamlet was soon followed to Elsinore by his friend Horatio , who arrived there , if not in time for the late King 's funeral , at least for the new King 's marriage of Queen Gertrude . Soon after his arrival , and before he had found an opportunity of seeing his friend the Prince , who , absorbed in his melancholy reveries , seems not to have known or at least to have noticed the presence of his school-fellow , Horatio was told by two soldiers of his acquaintance , gentlen* en , but of no rank , of a strange appearance which they had seen as they kept watch on a platform of the castle . A ghostly figure had passed and repassed them near the hour of midnight . Clothed in complete steel , it moved silently before them ; and from the lifted beaver looked out the sad face of the dead King of Denmark . Horatio joined them on their watch that he might see the apparition . It came , passed solemnly before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was spoken to , and disappeared at the sound of the midnight cock-crowing . Deeming such a visitation portentous , Horatio determined to inform young Hamlet of it ; for he was sure that the ghost , although dumb to others , would speak to him . The next day he found the Prince alone in the hall of state . The new King had held a formal audience that day , had despatched ambassadors to Norway to check the project of young Fortinbras , and had endeavored , with the Queen 's aid , to rouse Hamlet from the moodiness which so troubled the guilty mind of the murderer and usurper . To win the Prince to acquiescence in the new state of affairs , he had assured him of his succession , and had begged him to remain at the court as the first of subjects , the King 's chief counsellor and heir . He need not have feared any untoward consequences from Hamlet 's lonely coo'itations ; for the Prince had already , in spite of his grief and his anger , and the disturbed state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death and acquiring the crown he so much desired , and which at least made it becoming that he , the first subject in the kingdom , should be present at the capital , determined , in weak despair and dejection of soul , to return to the university . Suspecting him and fearing to trust him out of sight , the King , with the Queen 's help , dissuaded him from this puerile purpose . The audience ended , the court withdrew , and Hamlet , left alone , fell , as his wont was , into reverie ; and his thoughts were not of the means by which he could obtain what he thought his right  --  the throne  --  but of his mother 's sin against sentiment , and of his own disgust , and of his weariness of life . He was ignorant thus far of the adultery and the murder ; yet he fed the bitterness of his soul by thinking that he longed to commit suicide . To this mood lie was brought not only by his mother 's conduct and his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of his position , and his habit of *vatching and pondering the conduct of all around him . Hence came his soul 's tedium and his fanciful // dallying with the thought of a self-sought death . His weariness of life Came of too much observation and reflection ; for it is sadly true that they enjoy life most who know and think the least about it . In this mood Horatio found the Prince , and greeting frankly and heartily , although respectfully , the close friend who had parted from him hardly a month be. - fore , he was surprised to be received , although with perfect courtesy , yet not with instant and complete recognition . This was the result of no hauteur or affectation on the part of Hamlet , but of an inability , common to natures like his , to break off their musings , and , except upon great occasions , bring their faculties suddenly to bear upon what is newly placed before them . Hamlet welcomed Horatio , and then fell into his accustomed jeering . For , as to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chiefly a cynic and a humorist . His irony was fine and cutting , but his humor was often broad . Himself an accomplished and elegant gentleman for his time , a thoughtful man , and of good impulses , he walked through life looking about him with a fine scorn of all that was inferior to himself ; and to this he gave utterance in polished jeers and bitter ridicule . It was only when he was alone , or with some trusted friend like Horatio , or favorite humble follower like a certain player whom he admired , that he gave serious utterance to his sad philosophy . And this was rarely ; for he loved and admired few men well enough to talk with them earnestly and admit them to real acquaintance with his soul . Hamlet was much disturbed by Horatio 's story , and determined himself to watch for the apparition . It came ; he recognized it instantly as his fathers ghost , and following it alone to a retired place , there learned from it that his father had been murdered by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even during his life , for her brother-in-law . Shocked by this revelation , and roused by the exhortations of his father 's spirit , Hamlet , on the impulse of the moment , which with him was always equally strong and evanescent , devoted himself to the fulfilment of the ghost 's command . He declared in his heart that he would give up his contemplative , inactive life , and wipe out of his memory all saws , that is , all the sententious maxims that he had formed and cherished there ; and the formation of this resolution reminding him of his cherished habit , and causing him to think how valuable and pleasant these saws were , he at the next moment took out his note-book and wrote down the maxim that a man might smile and be a villain . Then when his companions joined him he immediately began to jest ; and although he was then sure that what the ghost said was true , as sure as he ever became afterward , and that according to the moral notions of that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he should slay his uncle at his first opportunity , he , now seeing that the usurper had reason to hate and fear him , and being willing to shelter himself from the monarch 's malice , and hoping also to divert attention from himself while he thought about thinking what design he ought to form for the avenging of his father , resolved to feign madness ; and he made Horatio and the others swear to keep the vision and this resolution secret . And instead of rejoicing , he cursed himself that he was born to such a duty . Now , there was in the court of Denmark , in a position like that of chamberlain , an old nobleman named Polonius , a politician , crafty , prudent , full of worldly wisdom , and withal a very accomplished gentleman , bust pompous in manner , in thought somewhat over-subtle , and in speech too wordy . He had a son , Laertes , a young man of good heart and high spirit , and a daughter , Ophelia , a fond , amorous , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and easily rebutted . // Thrown into Hamlet 's company , his comeliness and courtesy won her to lo*e him after her feeble fashion , and he , first allowing himself to be loved , came at last to love her in return , and even to talk to her of marriage . Poloni us sent Laertes to Paris , and , fearing that Hamlet did not wish to make Ophelia his wife , comnianded her to break off her intercourse with him , which she did without much pain or remonstrance . This gave Hamlet a good opportunity to begin impressively the play of his feigned madness ; and some time after the appearance of the ghost , we know not how long , but long enough for Laertes to have become in need of money at Paris , and to have formed new friends and new habits , the Prince startled poor Ophelia by coming before her in a slovenly dress-he who was usually a dainty man in his apparel  --  and by wild and melancholy actions ; after which he left her sighing deeply , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , immediately concluding that the Prince was mad for his daughter 's love , spread the report about the palace . The King , however , ever apprehensive through conscious guilt , came to fear that Hamlet 's apparent madness had another cause ; and after it had continued some time longer , he sent to the university for the Prince 's friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern , to perform the double office of diverting him and being spies upon his conduct . They came , and time enough had elapsed by their arrival for the accomplishment of the purpose of the embassy to Norway , the ambassadors and the young noblemen reaching Elsinore at the same time . On the day that both had audience , Polonius , that he might show the King that Hamlet was *ad because Ophelia had repelled his love , proposed that a meeting should bc contrived between the two at which himself and Claudius should be hidden observers . The King consented , not believing that Hamlet was love-crazed , but hoping to get at the truth by the help of this new spy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an encounter of wits with him , in which he was badly worsted ; for the Prince indulged his humor to the utmost , and , under cover of his feigned madness , mocked and jeered the old chamberlain to his face , with a rudeness and cruelty which , had not his pretended condition apparently voided his conduct of malicious purpose , would have been brutaL When the old man retired , Rosencrantz and Guildenstern came in , and Hamlet fell to jesting with them , and finally into the utterance of his scornful , misanthropic musings . And he told them , as he told many others on various occasions , that he had sunk into melancholy . Indeed , he accused himself of insanity to divers persons until almost the day of his death ; a sure evidence , if they had but known it , that he was not mad ; and indeed so weak was his purpose that he confessed with particularity to Guildenstern and Rosencrantz , as well as to Horatio and to his mother , that he was feigning madness for a purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his own great secret , but went about making others swear that they would keep it for him . While he and his college friends were talking , a company of players arrived at the palace , and the Hamlet who had just avowed that the earth and the heavens held neither beauty nor joy for him , had the new-come ministers of pleasure immediately before him , and began to speak , and to criticise and quote , finally causing the principal player to recite part of a scene . He treated his old favorites in the princely way that sat on him so well , and showed thekindly good nature which was one trait of his character by forbidding the chief actor to mock Polonius . He would sneer at him himself under cover of his feigned madness , for that took away the appearance of purpose which is the life of insult ; but he would subject him to no coarser treatment at the hands of his inferiors . With // a purpose half formed , he asked the player if he could study a speech which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Hamlet fell again to thinking about what he should have done and had left undone ; and because his intellect was ever brighter and higher than his moral nature , he saw himself in his own mind 's eye a weakling that he despised . The player , in reciting his speech , had assumed the passion of the part with such fervOr and seeming reality that his words pierced Hamlet 's heart like an unseen dagger , and he reproached himself bitterly that he had done nothing . And so , feeling that he deserved that self-reproach , because he was sure that his uncle had killed his father , whose death was vet unavenged , he immediately and with much earnestness called upon his brain to furnish him with some device by which he could be made sure that his father had been killed by his uncle ; and thereupon he fell back upon his halfformed resolution to have the play of a murder represented before the court at Elsinore , subtly suggesting to himself thatperhaps the ghost was a devil , and that he ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meantime he continued to muse upon the emptiness of life , its rooted wrongs and endless evils ; and he thought , not how to do what he had sworn to his father 's spirit , but whether it would not be better to turn his dagger against himself , and thus escape the duty set before him ; and then , ever forethinking although never forecasting , he saw that death , although it would relieve him of his present perplexity , would leave him he knew not where ; and he concluded not to die until he had thought somewhat longer over the advantages of dying . One day while he was musing in this fashion , the King and Polonius watching in concealment , Ophelia appeared . She had not seen him for many a day , and had long desired to find an opportunity of returning him his letters and his gifts . Hamlet at first spoke her fair , and in forgetfulness that he was mad ; but soon remembering his cue ( it being suggested by her presence and her mention of his love tokens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his bitterness of soul , lie mocked and flouted this poor girl , denying his love for her , and satirizing her sex in her person ; telling her that he was mad , and that the folly and wantonness of women had made him so , bidding her go to a nunnery lest she should become the mother of such a poor thing as a man , and declaring that there should be no more marriages in Denmark . His conduct on this occasion was so hard and cruel , and so far from any semblance of madness , that some of those who have studied his case have concluded that he must have discovered that the King and Polonius were overhearing him , But there is no warrant for such an opinion , which indeed is suggested only as a support to the indefensible assumption that Hamlet being good at heart , his conduct must have been always thoroughly estimable and consistent ; whereas there are no graver offences or grosser errors than those into which men fall from lack of resolution . This poor Hamlet saw himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horatio , whom he loved and trusted more than any other person in the world , he told him that he had chosen him because of his resolute firmness and serenity of soul ; and he declared that of all men those were blessed who were so constituted that they could not be made the sport of fortune , and that the man whom he took to his inmost heart must be one who , like Horatio was not the prey of his own emotions . The play accomplished all that Hamlet expected of it ; that is , it assured him of what he knew perfectly well before-that his uncle had killed his father . The King fled from the representation of the murder , the performance stopped , and the court rose and went out in confusion . Hamlet burst forth into exclamations , // and began to talk with Horatio about the event , when he suddenly broke *ff with a light jest and called for music . Then Rosencrantz and Guildenstern came to him with a message from his mother bidding him come to her chamber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to jest and jeer , telling them in earnest , however , that is , with purpose , that they should believe him two things : first , that he was mad ( a sure sign that he was sane ) , and next , that his grief was that he had been disappointed of the throne . True , he had the King 's word for the succession ; but he said , " While the grass grows the steed starves . " The musicians whom he had called for , entering then with their pipes , found that he had already changed his purpose ; he wanted no music ; but the sight of the instruments suggested to him a mode of showing his former friends that he saw through their design . He asked them to play upon the recorder , and they being obliged to refuse because they had not the skill , he burst out upon them in anger , telling them that he saw they were trying to play upon him , and that they would find him harder to play upon than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far his complaisance would lead him to acquiesce in any folly the Prince might utter ; and finding that it knew no bounds , he concluded that the general belief in his madness was well established . Left alone by Polonius , he immediately began to assure himself how very terribly he felt , communing with himself ; as he always did , in a very high style and with a vivid imagination . He thought at this time that he could drink hot blood and do some act so terrible as to aifright the face of nature ; but he did nothing but muse and talk after his old fashion . For on his way to his mother 's chamber he passed the King 's oratory , and there saw him alone , exposed and praying . The thought at once occurred to hin* that here was his opportunity . But hardly had he half drawn his sword when he thought of a good reason for putting off the execution of his purpose . It was that if he killed the King at prayer he would send him to heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to rightly avenge his father he should kill his murderer at some time when dying he would go straight to hell !  --  a revelation of a fiendish malignity of purpose , if it revealed any purpose whatever . But it revealed none . On the contrary , it merely showed Hamlet 's lack of purpose . He pretended to deceive h*mself with this argument , when all that he really wished was to shuffle away from and procrastinate what he felt to he his solemn duty . When Hamlet reached his mother 's chamber , Polonius had hidden himself behir*d the hangings to give the Queen the moral support of the consciousness of his presence . But the Prince being very violent in his manner , as Was now his way with women ( for the effect of his rankling wrong sho*ved itself in this perversion of his nature ) , she cried out for help , and Polonius answering , Hamlet on the instant whipped out his sword , and , with his customary jeer upon his lips , killed the old courtier on the spot , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had slain him on a momentary impulse , and had thus relieved himself of the intolerable irksomeness of keeping himself up to the sustained . purpose of executing a fixed resolution . The son rated the mother roundly for her sin , and still more roundly for her bad taste in leaving so handsome and gallant a man as his father for such an ugly , vulgar fellow as his uncle . While he was thus thinking of his father , and excited by the recital of his mother 's conduct , he became the victim of an optical delusion-such a one as troubled Macbeth , a Scottish usurper who saw again and again the figure of a man named Banquo , whom he had caused to be slain . While Hamlet was speaking to his mother about the father whose ghost he and // Horatio and Bernardo and Marcellus had seen upon the platform , he thought he saw the ghost enter the chamber , and thought he heard him speak and chide him that he had let so long a time pass by while he was vexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dulling the edge of his purpose . But it was not the ghost . For the ghost was visible to every eye , and this that Hamlet saw was invisible to his mother . The ghost wore armor ; but Hamlet saw his father " in his night gown . " That was not what we call now a night shirt ; for until a very late period people wore no night dress , but lay in bed quite naked . A night gown was until comparatively late years what we call now a dressing gown , or robe de chambre ; and Hamlet , in his mother 's chamber , merely fancied that he saw his father dressed as he had often seen him there in his lifetime . When he was about to part with his mother , he entreated her to refrain herself from his uncle 's bed that night ; but he seemed to desire this in a great measure lest the King should wheedle her into a confession of the fact that her son was only craftily feigning madness . And in the consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind than that from the lime we hear of him until his death he was perfectly sane , and a man of very clear and quick intellectual perceptions-one perfectly responsible for his every act and every word ; that is , as responsible as a man can be who is constitutionally irresolute , purposeless , and procrastinating . They have done him wrong who have called him undecided . His penetration was like light ; his decision like the Fates ' ; he merely left undone . The Queen kept Hamlet 's counsel better than he kept it himself and reported to the King that he was as mad as the raging elements . But the King seeing , like Polonius , a method in his madness , and determining that in any case it would be better that he should be put out of the way , sent him to England with IRosencrantz and Guildenstern with sealed letters , pretended as a demand for tribute , but really asking that the Prince should be put to death immediately . A&amp; Hamlet went to the port whence he was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were Norwegian forces , led by young Fortinbras , the son of the man whom Hamlet 's father slew ; like Hamlet , the heir to his father 's and his uncle 's throne , and the counterproof of Hamlet in this story . They were going to fight for a little patch of ground not worth the cost of the expedition ; and yet the Polacks in possession were prepared for a desperate resistance . When they had passed by Hamlet sent his companions forward , and began , after his fashion , to pry into his own motives , and he discovered and confessed to himself that his habit of thinking and thinking , instead of thinking and doing , had made him to all intents and purposes a coward . And he mercilessly scourged himself in thought , that he had not slain his uncle and seized the Danish throne , for which he had cause , and will and strength and means . For it must be remembered that Hamlet never doubted for a moment that it was his duty to avenge his father 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that from the time of receiving that lesson his thought should be only to do justice on his father 's murderer . Poor fellow ! his thought and his intent were just as they ever had been , the straws of every gust of accident . Being suspicious of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern as the instruments of his uncle , he purloined their letters , opened and read them , and promptly wrote one ordering them to be put to death , sealed it with his father 's seal which he carried with him , and putting this in place of the other , sent them to the fate to which they knew they were taking him . By this little trick he saved his life , and rid himself of two double-faced companions whose fate can not be mourned . His action here was // 1370. ) prompt , but it hardly deserved the name of action . It was the instant fruit . of one of those impulses upon which irresolute men sometimes act , without thought and without purpose , and which are little more significant of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alligator 's jaws or the spring of a serpent . An accident brought Hamlet back to Demmark while his companions went on to their graves in England . During his absence Ophelia had become insane and had , drowned herself unwittingly , and Laertes , having returned from France , had attempted a rebellion in revenge for his father 's death at the hands of one of the royal family . Him the King , being informed of Hamlet 's unexpected appearance at Elsinore , had induced to undertake the death of his father 's murderer , the plan being that in a fencing match before the court between Hamlet and Laertes , the latter should wound the former with a poisoned and unbated foil . That Hamlet would accept the challenge there appeared to be no doubt . For he was a skilful swordsman , and was vain of his accomplishment ; so much so indeed that , in the midst of all his trouble about his father 's death and his mother 's marriage , the praises of Laertes ' fencing , brought from Paris by a French gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire that Ophehia 's brother might return that he might challenge him ; and he , the sworn avenger of his father , he who had a kingdom at stake , kePt himself well in practice for a bout with foils . Coming to Elsinore after the discovery that the murderer of his father and the seducer of his mother had also treacherously sought his life , he met 1-lorati6 , and strolled with him into a churchyard , and there began musing upon life and death , and fell into bantering with a clown whom he found digging a grave . Seeing a funeral of some state approach , in which the King and Queen and the court appeared , he retired with Horatio and watched the rites . But it was not until Laertes came forward as chief mourner and spoke of his sister , that Hamlet suspected that he saw the burial of Ophelia . Then with a tremendous revulsion of feeling he broke forth into passionate exclamations of love and grief ; and then , too , at that strange , unfitting time , he claimed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dane . The sudden turmoil in his unstable soul caused him to pour out this turbid mingling of passionate grief and disappointed , weakly self-asserting ambition . Laertes sprang at his throat with the fier&amp;e sharp cry , " The Devil take thy soul . " Hamlet faced him , for he was no co*vard , and now was roused to frenzy ; hut in his very reply , meant to be a threat , he went into a brief egoistic explanation of his own character and motives . The foes were separated , and Hamlet left the churchyard . The challenge to the fencing match was sent by a fop whose exquisiteness appeared no less in his speech than in his clothes and his conduct ; and him Hamlet , with yet another grief laid upon the burden of his soul , amused himself with , caricaturing his speech to his face , probing him with irony , and making him go through his little paces unsuspicious of the exhibition he was making . The challenge was accepted ; and not only was Hamlet wounded with the poisoned foil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen , who was present , was poisoned by drinking from a goblet prepared for her son , to make his death the surer . Then Hamlet , learning this from Laertes , on the impulse of the moment , with no thought of his long-deferred purpose , and no reference to his father 's fate and his mother 's crime , but in momentary resentment of that immediate treachery , rushed upon the King and with his last strength slew him . Cut off thus in the early prime of his manhood-for by this time he had come to be // thirty years old-he yet felt , even in the agonies of an envenomed death , that this was the only possible solution of his perplexity , and that to see life fade away was happiness . For seeing Horatio seize the poisoned goblet to drink the dregs that he might be with his friend in death , he tore it away from him , and begging him to live and vindicate his honor , he said , in the words put upon his gasping lips by him who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warning to all after ages : fever thou didst *iold me in thy hears , Absent thee from felicity awhile And in this h*wsh world draw thy breath in pair To tell my story . That story I have now told-how lamely and inadequately no one can know better than myself ; but as here presented it may help those who can read it as I do to comprehend the lesson that it teaches : that a man may have kindliness , and grace , and accomplishment , high thoughts and good impulses , and even a will that can stand firmly up against attack , as it were leaning against opposition , and yet if he have not strong , urgent , exclusive desire , which compels him to put his impulses and will into action , and seek one single object , if indeed he be not ballasted with principle and impelled by purpose , he will be blown , about by every puff of fortune and be sucked down into the quicksand of irresolution - that it is better , with Fortinbras , to make mouths at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously into the invisible future ; - that , in the words of the wicked King , which give the key of Shakespeare 's meanin , That we would do We should do when we would . For this would changes , And bath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues , are bands , are accidents And then this sleould is like a spendthrift sigh That hurts by easing . They may understand , too , how difficult it is for an actor to embody a personage who is of a high mental and moral type , and yet whose characteristic trait is a negative quality , so difficult that to present such personage satisfactorily demands a genius almost corresponding ( I do not say equal ) to his by whom it was created . First among the representations which in our day have approximated the almost unattainable ideal of this character stands the thoughtful , sensitive , graceful , and courtly impersonation of Edwin Booth . RICHARD GRANT WHITE . // EW YORK lies , like a Neapolitan lazzarone , with its head on the grass and N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers of Central Park to the waves which wash the Battery ( and can not wash it clean ) may at the present hour be called the full stretch of the city . But as there are many of our citizens who , although having no claim to be likened to oldest inhabitants , can remember when the Astor House was rather an up-town institution , it is obvious enough that even those among us who are not particularly young may reasonably expect to see the day when Central Park shall literally justify its title and be actually the core and centre of the busy , dense , and populous portions of the city . In population New York may already claim to rank as the third city of Christendom , and its rate of progress in the future is certain to be far greater than that of Paris , and likely to be sqrnewhat greater than that of London . Let us see how this latter city has grown , and the facts may help us to form an estimate of the probable growth of New York in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population of London numbered 958,863 souls . In sixty years an increase of more than threefold had taken place , for the census of i86i returned a pol ) uiation of 2,813,929 . The growth of the British metropolis during that time was remarkably steady and unifcrm . The average percentage of increase during each ten years was 32.24 . The next census of London , that which is to be taken during the coming year , will probably give a total of four millions  --  a population rather greater than that of Denmark , Greece , and the Papal States put tog*ether , crowded into the vast city which lies at either side of the Thames . London , then , in i8oi , was as nearly as possible just the equal in population of New York at the present day . In i86i this city had a population of 813,662 ; to-day it is doubtless somewhere between goo , ooo and i , coo , ooo . The average increase of New York during each ten years from 1820 to i86o was larger than that of London ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not likely to be maintained , and merely take the progress of London as the basis of our calculations , we may safely venture to predict that th' opening of the twentieth century will see over two millions of inhabitants housed within our city . Probably within forty years from that time New York will be as populous as London is to-day . Of course , if we were to take in the popula* tion of adjacent towns which belong to what may be called the New York system , the point of increase we have mentioned would be attained at least twenty years sooner . Making our calculation as moderate as possible , it seems evident that ourselves and our successors have to prepare to find accommodation within the next sixty or seventy years for a population of four millions in the city of New York . Thereupon arises the question , What is to be the t ' *ture New York ; in what direction is it to stretch itself out ; what ground is it to cover , and how are its inhabitants to get through its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no great commercial city-ever had so magnificent a situation as that which was given to New York , and which even New York , do what she would , has not been able utterly to spoil . A city with two magnificent river-frontages running its whole length ; with a bay hardly excelled in beauty by that of Naples or of Dublin ; with the brightest of green woods still spread ing luxuriant within sight almost of its streets on the Jersey shore ; with *i*er
