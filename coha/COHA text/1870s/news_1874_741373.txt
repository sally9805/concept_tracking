txt We trust that Congress , in deciding whether it will interfere in the affairs of Louisiana , and order a new election in that State , will carefully consider the question of its power and jurisdiction . This question must be settled before any other can fairly be entertained . We have already pointed out that , in our opinion , the case is one in which the Constitution does not warrant any action by Congress ; and in support of this conclusion we have called attention to the history of the only clause on which the advocates of such action rely at all -- viz. , the clause guaranteeing to every State . a republican form of government . Some light is thrown on the scope and meaning of this clause by what is known as the " Dorr rebellion in Rhode Island . " The present advocates of a new election under Federal control in Louisiana justify the course they propose by the assertion that there is no republican government in Louisiana , because the present State officers were placed in power without the assent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum and substance of their case . There is nothing more in it . If Congress can not act on this general power in the matter , it is conceded that it can not act at all . It is not denied that the Constitution of Louisiana is as clearly republican as that of New York . It is not alleged that that Constitution has been replaced by another , of antirepublican character . It is simply held that in one State election , the will of the people did not get expressed according to the forms of law  --  that in one instance the governmental system of the State miscarried . It is not even claimed that the officers actually in possession are not the choice of a great majority of the people . On the contrary , it is asserted that they are , and that a majority of the legal voters of Louisiana at the last election desired to vote for them . It is only claimed that this majority did . not cast their votes and get them counted in the manner provided by law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of only a few months stand- ing , of officers exercising powers which the people have not conferred on them in the usual legal way . The Rhode Island case was a very different one . There the Government was , if anything ever - was , uurepublican in essence , whatever it may have been in form , or whatever view the Federal Government may have taken of it . It depended upon a charter of CHARLES II. , issued more than a hundred years before the Revolution . Under it six representatives were given to Newport , four each to Providence and . two other places , and two each to all other towns . The control of the suffrage was absolutely in the Legislature , which had bestowed . it on the owners of $134 worth of real estate and on their eldest sons . As a result , the majority of the Assembly was elected by towns in which only one-third of the Men over twenty-one years of age resided , and of this number only one-third were legal voters , so that a majority of one House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ordinarily regarded as the people . The " Dorr rebellion , " as it was called , was an attempt to replace this form of government by a new one which , though not originating with the de facto Legislature , had actually received a large majority of the votes of the people , and probably of the legal voters . Under this Constitution State officers were chosen and undertook to act . The old Government appealed to the Federal Government against " threatened " domestic violence , and the President announced his intention to support the old Government if it became necessary . Thereupon the new Government dispersed. , In this case the President decided , in pursuance of the discretion vested in him by law , against what , according to the Democrats of this clan was , beyond all question , a republican Government . The ease came up for review in the Supreme Court , and that court decided , in an opinion delivered by Chief Justice TANEY , that the President had an absolute right to adopt the course he did . Congress was appealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive action in the matter . A committee of the House of Repteseutatives , iu reporting on the case , held this explicit language : The Constitution " vests in the Congress of the United States a supervision over all the State Constitutions , so far as the ascertainment of their republican character is concerned . And when these Constitutions do not provide for a republican form of government , it is the duty of Congress to set it aside , and to recognize and enforce one which possesses this republican character . This act of supervision implies the prior action of the people , or of a party assuming to be tho people . And further than the exercise of this supervision the committee contend that Congress has no power and can not go . " We do not pretend that this precedent is strictly analogous to the Louisiana case . We are clearly of the opinion that it is not so . But it bears this relation to that case : It is an instance of refusal on the part of the Federal Government to support a claim for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , and of the actual interference by the Executive in an opposite sense . It may be said that even if this precedent were more closely analogous than it is , it would have no binding force in respect of the present Congress  --  and this is true . Each Congress must ultimately judge for itself what is its duty in the matters brought before it . But in forming such judgment , it may properly seek guidance from the history of similar cases . And certainly it will find in this one no encouragement to rashly assume the exercise of doubtful powers . Such an assumption is always dangerous , and threatens mischief which can not readily be calculated . We venture to ask those who shall decide this matter in Congress , whether it is wise to advance unnecessarily toward Federal interference in State affairs f There has already been some doubtful action in that direction . Can we afford , on any plea yet presented , to go any further I And in this particular instance , is it right to conclude that the remedy for existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the State ?
