txt The Evening Post very properly coupled itself with the World yesterday , in the course of an argument in favor of the authors of the Broadway extension and Croton water swindles . Both have , in fact , been pursuing identically . the same policy for months past . The Post did its utmost to help the Tweed faction during the Fall elections ; and its columns have been choked since with " Ring " advertisements . It is as much a Ring journal as the World itself . It has also been hard at work for months past abusing or misrepresenting the President and his Administration . On national subjects it is a " sore-head ; " in local affairs its opinions may be always anticipated from the fact that it is bribed by the Ring with advertisements . Consequently what it says is not entitled to be received . with much deference . But there is one point raised by it which may be worth a brief reply . The Post alleges that we defended the new City charter while it was passing through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration , which was formed . in accordance with it " There is here willful misrepresentation or shameful ignorance . The local " Administration " now in existence is something very different from that which was promised . to us under the new City charter . Take a single instance : A distinct pledge was given that there should be no change in the Central Park Commission . This pledge was given to Mr. PETER COOPER , and Mr. NATHANIEL SANDS came to us and assured us that it was a bong fide pledge  --  and moreover he pledged his word , or rather the word of the Citizens ' Association , that a good City Government should be given to the people if Republicans consented to support the new charter . Under these pledges , our opposition was disarmed . At that time , who would have . dreamt of doubting the wisdom or good . faith of the Citizens ' Association , of Mr. PETER COOPER , or of Mr. NATHANIEL SANDS ? Let people who still believe in that clique ask themselves how little reason we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , what happened ? Every pledge given to the Cooper set , and by them conveyed to us , was deliberately broken . The Central Park Commission was shamefully dispersed . The men who made the Central Park what it is were all sent to the right-about . The whole affair was practically put into the hands of " PETE " SWEENY and " Tole FIELDS ' Messrs . OLMSTEAD and VAUX have been dismissed , and all kinds of jobs have been made ready . for the Park . Wait and see  --  the public will know more on this subject before long . Now , this is only one example of what has been done . And . yet the Post has the assurance to say that we are inconsistent , because we did . not oppose the new City charter , and . do oppose the " Ring . " We did not oppose the charter , because lying pledges were made to us about an honest Government . We do oppose the leaders of the City Government because they are swindlers and thieves . and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us access to his books . As for the Post , let it come into Court with hands free from City bribes , if it wants to carry weight with it as a witness .
