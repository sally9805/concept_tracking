txt We may appeal to any fair-minded person to decide whether the opposition which the Republican Party and the Administration have lately encountered does not pass the legitimate bounds of political discussion . Everybody knows that a public man must make up his mind to be exposed to a good deal of sharp criticism . lie is quite certain to offend a good many persons from the start , and some of these persons Win in all probability be able to find access to the columns of a newspaper , and take good care to throw as much dirt as they possibly can . He will also have adversaries of a much viler kind , who will turn innocent actions into crimes , invent all kinds of lies about him , and spare no one connected with him  --  man , - woman , or child . The necessity of facing this ordeal deters many men from entering public life at all , and drives a good many out of it when once they have entered it . Among instances of the latter kind is that of Vice-President COLFAX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his principles , and undoubtedly qualified to render substantial services to the country . He has announced his intention to withdraw from politics at the expiration of his present term of office , simply because of his ' disinclination to spend any more of his life in an atmosphere of slander and misrepresentation . Nor can this be construed into a sign of weakness . A man is bound , no doubt , to face fair criticism , but he is not bound to be forever the target of professional libelers , blackmailers , and all kinds of knaves . He owes , after all that can be said , something to his own sense of self-respect . Now , of this kind of " opposition " Gen. GRANT has had rather more than his full share , as everybody will admit . Some people he provoked by refusing to place them in lucrative offices . They have ever since been at work upon his character , laying on a coat of black paint here and daubing it with pitch there , until the portrait has become a hideous caricature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation was trying to devise methods of testifying to Gen. GRANT its sense of the high services he had rendered . No new light has been thrown on those services since . They are as deserving of praise and gratitude now as ever they were . It is largely owing to Gen. GRANT that we are today a great people , and not . as the Demorats wished to make us , a collec- tion of small Governments and . " independent " States . Posterity will rank Gen. GRANT among the greatest commanders of his ago  --  the moat indomitable in adversity , the most magnanimous in victory . Yet it is this man , and within five years of the close of the war . that Senator SUMNER can dare to call incapable even as a soldier , utterly unworthy of respect or confidence . If Senator SUMNER had said that in May , 1865 , what would have been the general verdict on his behavior ? Yet that portion of Gen. GRANT 'S career to which Mr. Summit 's criticism was addressed stands the same now as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood when the surrender of LEE , after a struggle of unparalleled intensity  --  for there has been nothing in the war between Germany and France at all comparable with it ? brought peace once more to the country . People are blessed with very short memories in these days  --  but is it creditable to us that Gen. GRANT 'S character should thus be exposed to every reckless calumny , and scarcely a protest raised against the outrage ? Let it be remembered that he has done nothing whatever to deserve the obloquy now heaped upon his head by Republican papers like the Evening Post . When you sift the complaints about him they amount to this ? he has , not appointed some men to office , who were thought by their friends to be deserving of preferment ; and he has appointed others who were thought to be undeserving . Was there ever a President of whom the same thing could . not be said ? Look on the other side of the account . The debt has been largely reduced ; so has taxation ; public credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon up Gen. GRANT 'S faults , why not place these great results of his Administration to his credit I Simply because it is almost impossible now adays to obtain justice for a public man during his lifetime . There must always be an opposition ; and in a newspaper age , opposition can speak with ten thousand voices , where sixty years ago it could find but one . We have mentioned . Gen. GRANT 'S name , bat what we have said about him necessarily applies also to the Republican Party , for the two are linked pretty closely together , and . must necessarily be so until March , 1873. to say the least . It is astounding to find Republicans persevering in a course which any man possessing a grain of sense must see is calculated to force the country into the abyss of Democracy . We are to change GRANT for HOFFMAN , and put Twiaain and SWEENY with as much power over the nation as they have over New-York City  --  for that is what the election of a Democratic President with Tammany 's money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party today one-fiftieth part so powerful as the Tammany gang . They will find a large part of the money for the next election . and . they will not do so without exacting an equivalent for it . Republicans who want free trade , and Republicans who want to " take vengeance " for one grievance and another , would . absolutely rather see a Democratic President elected than be deprived of their hobbies . Then they turn round and . say . " are we not to criticise our party and the President ? " We reply , criticise them by all means , but at present you are only trying to undermine them for the gratification of your own whims . We have no desire to see the President enjoying immunity from fair criticism . We simply think it an act of justice to weigh his actions impartially , and not beset his path in the spirit of assassins . The Republican Party will triumph with its next candidate , whoever he may be  --  or if it does not , farewell to that prosperity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Evening Post save that the best men in the Democratic Party are coming to the front . Everybody knows this to be a misrepresenta- tion
