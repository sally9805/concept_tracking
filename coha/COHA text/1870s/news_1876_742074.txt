txt The collapse of the market values of the stocks of the coal roads leading to this City possesses a public interest that transcends the limits of Wall street , and deeply concerns the entire country . That collapse is the penalty of the violation of a principle of business . The - wisdom of the world has for ages familiarly expressed it in the proverb that the shoemaker should stick to his last . To illustrate the error of the administration of the coal roads : Suppose a railroad running through a region perfectly adapted to the culture of Spring wheat should , in addition to its legitimate business of the transportation of passengers and freight , undertake to cultivate these lands. , Suppose that the majority of the Board of Directors were finally persuaded to believe that an immense increase of income to the company , could be annually derived from opening and working th , eso lands , and harvesting and marketing the wheat . Suppose that the company was by vote made a farmer , and sot to plowing and seeding 500,000 acres . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock should hasten to get rid of it . The stock should instantly and steadily fall on the bare news that the corporation had gone outside of its legitimate business into an enterprise foreign to the objects for which it was created , which could not be economically prosecuted by it , which was full of hazards , and which ? would inevitably bankrupt it if persisted in . The marketing of the wheat when harvested is but one of the hazards the agricultural railroad would have to encounter . To this the experience of every railroad in Minnesota , Wisconsin , Illinois , and . Indiana which has purchased wheat to make freights / to shipping ports on Lakes Superior and Michigan bears ample testimony , and should carry its own moral . Every one lost money , and some of them immensely . A railroad is a common carrier . Its business is to carry the passengers and freight that naturally come to its line . It violates the law of its being , and therefore the law of its success , when it creates traffic for its trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must inevitably come to grief . The collapse of the values of the coalroad stocks was due to the violation of this sound principle of business . The roads became operative miners and merchants . Their investMonts became immensely increased ; they assumed enormous indebtedness ; their corps of laborers was multiplied a hundredfold ; their business made complicated and wasteful beyond the grasp of any govdiming hand . or head . Over and above all , these common carriers took the risks of flue= tuatiug markets : which nothing could insure thorn against , oven temporarily , save another wrong to the public , a combination of similar interests , and a resulting monopoly of an article Of prime necessity for human use . Turning a common carrier into a coal merchant is a gross enough violation of a principle of economy . But in the case of these coal roads the common carrier was made to take stock to the amount of tens of millions of dollars in the passions and ca-. prices of the most turbulent and . unmanageable body of laborers on this continent . These common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions , strikes and riots of the Welsh , Cornish , and . Irish miners of the Pennsylvania coal-fields . The market for their'profits was built on a combination of naturally hostile interests and a monopoly of a raw product . This market endures so long as demand equals supply ; so long as manufacturing labor is fully employed , and industry is profitable . But when cotton and woolen mills , blast furnaces , foundries , rolling mills , and machine shops , and the innumerable mechanisms for supplying human wants become still , and : the male and female laborers of entire States become idle or employed on half or quarter time , and every interest suffers sympathetically with this paralyzed or diminished industry , the combination breaks , and the monopoly slips through fingers that have lost the strength to hold it . In such times jealousies , rivalries , and personal dislikes wedge combinations faster to pieces than a memory of past advantages and the remoteness Of future benefits can hold them together . In such times the coalmerchant railroad can not sell its coal ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its debts . It is compelled to throw its coal into the market to bring what it will fetch . Then comes the punishment of stockholders for their neglect to control their agents , the Boards of Directors , and to confine the shoemaker to ' his last . The bears of the Stock Exchange tear their property down from .. par to 25 , and make other exhibitions of its fall from sound worth through bad management and violation of the laws of business . With equal right could the owners of the railroads on the south shore of Lake Superior , associating with the Chicago and North-western Company , have bought up and monopolized the iron and copper deposits of Michigan . If they had foolishly done so , in order to give traffic to the ' associated roads and to add to the profits of transportation the royalty on the minerals and the profits of mining , where would they have been now ? Every one of them would be under foreclosure . It may be laid down maimn axiom in railroading that all investments of capital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , periodically become unproductive or die . Stockholders may be presumed to be able to take care of themselves . But in behalf of the public we have a duty to perform in regard to this vicious violation of the true principles of railroad management . No common carrier railway company has the right to buy and work coal property , pine forests , or mines of iron , copper , gold ; or silver . The British statutes of mortmain , framed to prevent a monopoly of the lands of the Kingdom by an engrossing Church , were founded in public policy and were obviously right . The railway ownership of great coal properties is accompanied by the power of immense moneycapital and all the evils of an irresistible monopoly . These powerful corporations ( ) an hold and carry vast stocks through ordinary times , and put prices on them far beyond the legitimate profits that belong to the mining and delivery of coal . They prevent competition . They increase the cost of the fires on the hearthstone and under the pot . They add to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element . They restrict manufactures . They put on the coal at the mouth of the mine an illegitimate profit . They add an illegitimate profit to the fair rate of its transportation . In slack times , instead of allowing coal to fall to its value , they hold it up by closing the mines or stopping carriage . They constantly and mischievously interfere between the demand and supply . They violate public policy . They make - themselves obnoxious to the common law of England and ' the United States , and the codes of every civilized country on the globe , which forbid the acquisition and use of property to the detriment of the people at large . Laws should be enacted in every State of the Union forbidding railroad corporations to own real estate not essential to or granted for their construction , and necessary to the movement , use , and . repair of their stock and the storage and handling of their freight ; and especially ' inhibiting them from owning or working mineral lands and manufacturing for the general market .. In the interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strictly restored  --  the people supplying freight , the common carriers carrying it .
