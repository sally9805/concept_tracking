txt An interesting compilation of statistics bearing upon the homicidal tendencies of the people of Kentucky will be published to-morrow . It represents thorough investigations among the records of 20 counties , taken at random , of the State . The work occupied a special correspondent three months . The figures are entirely accurate . The aim was to ascertain how many murders and murderous assaults had been committed in each county in a given number of years , and what legal punishment , if any , was the result . In 20 counties the records of indictments alone show , 717 homicides in an average period of five years , an average of 36 to each county . Against all this there is , the offset on the side of the law 's vindication of only one capital punishment and three life-terms in the Penitentiary . About a dozen convicted murderers received sentences of from three to five years in Jail or prison . In a few cases , where the offending party was a negro , summary justice was meted out with rope , without waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any means cover all crimes of murder and malicious shooting and stabbing in the 20 counties , as they are confined to court records , and very many criminals have never been brought before courts . The period covered in uo case runs back to the unsettled time of war , so that the figures give an actual exhibit of the present status of crime in Kentucky . The same ratio carried throughout the State would show 3,668 shot and stabbed in personal encounters in five years . In Breathitt County , 800 persons , out of a voting population of 1,300 , are under indictment for crime ; in Clay County , 530 out of 1,600 ; in Jackson , 154 , out of 790 . Ten counties , with a voting population of 11,584 , have 2,840 persons under indictment at a single term  --  over 24 per cent . Only two men had been hanged by law in Kentucky in 10 years .
