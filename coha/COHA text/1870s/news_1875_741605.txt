txt The documents in the case show some phases of character which are so common to mankind that we need not be so much surprised at Mr. Licx 's taking back his millions as we were at his original gift . The donor had accumulated his large fortune by his own thrift , Tabor , and shrewdness ; he had few near relatives ; he was far advanced in years , sick , and not likely to live long . It seemed a fit thing to Aiim that he should give away his property , ( after providing for his few remaining years , ) in such a way that it should accomplish certain desirable ends . Accordingly , after mature deliberation , and , as we understand , without seeking much counsel , he selected seven estimable citizens of San Francisco , who should do for him what he felt he no longer had the mental and physical energy to do for himself  --  invest his millions for the benefit of mankind . He would see his accumulations munificently scattered and bearing fruit even during his lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless mankind after his death ; but ho would refresh his declining years with the sweet satisfaction that the work was prosperously going forward , and that no accident could defeat his magnificent plans . It would have been unnatural if the aged . philanthropist had not anticipated the glow of satisfaction which the applause of the world would have aroused in Ins heart . It is seldom that men have four or five millions at their sovereign disposal ; it is very seldom indeed that men give away any such sum during their lifetime . JAMES LrcK had the money and . he gave it away . But it happened that he did not immediately die . He is still an invalid , confined to his room , but he is able to talk with people and read the newspapers . When the long murmur of applause died away , it was succeeded by whispers of disapprobation , which did not get into the newspapers , but were not the less vexatious . It is said that some well-meaning but indiscreet people remonstrated with him . It is quite possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pans in Senegambia thought that spending four hundred thousand dollars for bronze statuary was a wicked waste of money . It is possible that they said as much to the bed-ridden donor . If there were any relatives who were put off with a few thousands , when they thought they had a right to expect hundreds of thousands , they were sure to have made themselves heard . But , according to local accounts , the still active , though weakened , mind of this old . man of business yet lingered with his gold . He parted with the coin in a gush of enthusiasm ; he missed the care and management of it when it was gone . If any of us should come back to earth after death , we might be a little annoyed to see other people meddling with things once exclusive , ly ours . The Trustees of the Lick estate were not accountable to Mr. LICK . Practically , he was a dead man ; and the public ? we may almost say the world  --  looked to his appointed agents for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who had taken a discount from immortality refused to remain on the mortuary upper shelf where he had put himself . It worried him to see his property managed , as he thought , without close economy . He thought that some of the prices for which it said were too low . Other details , approved by wise business men , met with his disapproval . He seems to have thought that - the Trustees were his agents , not accountable to art , science , literature , and benevolence , in whose interest they had accepted a gift of millions of money . They declined to submit their judgment to his . He asked them to resign . They could not have said , " For all practical purposes you are dead ; and . you can not come back to life and resume the property which you have absolutely bequeathed to humanity and civilization . " So they civilly said : We have no power to resign and reconvey to you the subject of trust . " Thereupon the philanthropist revoked his deed . We have no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very . fact that he fretted over the management of the property gave him a reinforcement of vitality . The dissatisfaction with which he regarded the way things were going acted like a blister on a torpid limb . He forgot his infirmities in his mental heat . While be fretted he grew better . He reconsidered the past , and took a new lease of life . Whatever now becomes of the original intention of the donor of millions , the glory of the thing is forever destroyed . No future munificence can restore the applause . The action of the Trustees , so far as it has gone , is ratified ; but there is an uncertainty - whether science is to have its costly telescope and observatory , humanity its asylums , and art its monuments . Some of these things were assured in the hands of the Trustees . These gentlemen are men of business and unblemished repute . Perhaps it was not certain that their experience in funds , real estate , and mer7 chandise had fitted them to superintend the plans for great works of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more likely to make a wise and discreet disposition of the money than Mr. LICK could have done , even at his best . The misfortune of the whole affair is not so much that there is a possibility that the money will not now be used beneficently , as that the revocation will have an unfortunate effect on rich men inclined to give liberally . At any rate , it will check that sort of ante-mortem munificence , of which Mr. LICK has been an illustrious , though fleeting , example . Evidently , it is not wise for a man , in his lifetime , to put his property out of his control for-the benefit of the world at large . If he has not the wisdom and unselfishness to spend the bulk of his fortune for public purposes , let him enjoy its possession while he can , and leave it for others to lay out in specific purposes when he can not come back and reclaim it . It is not in human nature to give up to strangers the absolute control of the product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimated , Mr. LICK has found new strength in the struggle which he has had with himself since his original deed was executed , we may recommend his case to the attention of infirm rich men , who think they are ready for eternal things because temporal things have lost their zest .
