DEFECTS OF THE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM . THE advantages of the present National Banking System are so great and obvious that criticism has been almost smothered . The improvement upon former systems , under which each State regulated the affairs of all the banks situated within its limits , is apparent to alL No unprejudiced man would for a moment wish us to return to the condition of affairs which existed prior to the passage of the National Currency Act ,  --  when the currency of every State , almost of every bank , had a different quotation , when " wild cat " banks flourished and " red dog " currency abounded , and when counterfeits were so numerous that none but the most experienced judges could hope to escape occasional imposition . The bank currency of many States was not , it is true , obnoxious to all these objections , but the state of the circulation of the country at large was deplorably bad . Now , on the contrary , the country possesses a bank currency which is uniform , amply secured , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counterfeiters ' arts . More important still , it answers almost all the purposes required of any circulation , is available for the payment of taxes , and practically , though not legally , of most private debts , and is for nearly all the needs of the community as useful and valuable as the currency of the government itself . Dazzled by all these conspicuous advantages , most people have , without reflection or investigation , concluded that the National Banking System is an unmixed good , never stopping to inquire whether these advantages may not be offset by defects as great , though not so striking , or may not have been purchased at the sacrifice of some of the good features which existed in the former system , faultful though it was . We are convinced that the system established by the National Currency Act possesses such grave defects , and is ingrafted with such anomalous provisions , as to almost counterbalance its manifest merits . To show what these defects are it will be necessary , in the first place , to briefly set forth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SYSTEM . The National Currency Act of June 3 , 1864 , which , with some amendments , still remains in force and is the basis of the system , provides for the issue of $300,000,000 in circulating notes by National Banks organized as therein provided . These notes are secured by the deposit with the Treasury Department of one hundred dollars in United States bonds for every ninety dollars in notes issued , and are to be redeemed in lawful money of the United States on presentation at the banks . It is also required that each bank shall at all times keep on hand an amount of lawful money of the United States , equal , in certain cities where banks are permitted to redeem for those in other parts of the country , to twenty-five per cent . of its circulating notes and deposits , and in all other cities to fifteen per cent . of those liabilities , three-fifths of which may consist of the balances due from the banks which redeem for it . The interest on the bonds deposited is paid to the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the distribution of the circulation among the different Sections of the country , but by an amendment // approved March 3 , 1865 , it was en-acted " That one hundred and fifty million dollars of the entire amount of circulating notes authorized to be issued , shall be apportioned to associations in the States , in the District of Columbia , and in the Territories , according to representative population , and the remainder shall be apportioned by the Secretary of the Treasury among associations formed in the several States , in the District of Columbia , and in the Territories , having due regard to the existing banking capital , resources , and business of such State , District , and Territory . " A similar provision was contained in the act of February 25 , 1863 ,  --  the original National Currency Act , which was superseded by the act of June 3 , 1864 ,  --  but for some reason was omitted from the latter act . The act of June 3 , 1864 , also declares that the circulating notes of National Banks " shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States in payment of excises , public lands , and all other dues to the United States , except for duties on imports ; and also for all salaries and other debts and demands owing by the United States to individuals , corporations , and associations within the United States , except interest on the public debt and in redemption of the National Curre*icy . " An act passed July 12 , x87o , provides for $54,000,000 of National Currency , to be apportioned among those States and Territories having less than their proportion under the apportionment provided for by the act of March 3 , r86* but as it does not alter or affect the general characteristics of the system , it does not require separate consideration . Briefly recapitulating these prominent features of the system , we find provision made for a bank currency , fixed in amount , apportioned half according to population , and half in the manner which a certain government officer shall deem best , secured by stocks in the custody of the government , but drawing interest for the banks , and by lawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lawful money , and receivable in payment of all currency dues to and from the United States . From a consideration of these provisions of law , what , let us now inquire , would any ii*telligent , unprejudiced man of sound judgment , familiar with the principles of political economy and the history of banking systems , have predicted would be the practical operation of the system thus inaugu rated ? He would have predicted , first , from the limitation of the bank circulation to an arbitrarily fixed amount , that the system would build up a mighty monopoly-hydra-headed , and all the more dangerous for that reasontenacious of its privileges and clamorous for further concessions , and of such gigantic power as to control all political and legislative action , where its own interests should be concerned . He would have predicted , further , that the operation of this limitation , coupled with the crude provisions for the apportionment of the currency , would cause banks to spring up like mushrooms in places where there would be no legitimate business foundation for such enterprises , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their applications , would be left unprovided for . He would have predicted still further , that the provision for the receipt of the National Currency in payment of all currency dues to and from the government would make it in effect a legal-tender for all private debts , and , in conjunction with its limited amount , would , at least while the government receipts and disbursements should continue as large as they were certain to be for many years , give it such a circulation that the banks would be practically freed from the responsibility of redeeming it . He would have predicted , finally , that , the banks being certain under the operation of such causes of receiving double interest upon the capital invested , the business would be exceedingly profitable , and that the returns would show fat dividends and rapidly augmenting surpluses . Just these results , which might have been foreseen upon a careful study of the provisions of law which created the system , have actually followeAfi . It has probably occurred to many that the banks were wielding more power and reaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public interest in the subject does not appear to have been awakened to the extent which its importance demands . Probably most who have thought about it at all have believed these evils to be inseparable from any banking system , and , finding the present one free from most of the annoying defects of its predecessors , have been content to bear with those which , however injurious they may be in their aggregate effect , detract but little from individual comfort or convenience . The annoyance of being unable to pass a note without a " shave , " because it was issued by some Western State Bank , or of thumbing a bank-note detector amid the hurry of business , to determine // whether some doubtful-looking shinpiaster was genuine , was a direct and palpable evil which the meanest intellect could appreciate ; but being insensibly taxed to contribute to the profits of the stockholders of National Banks is so easy and comfortable a mode of being robbed , that the victim is insensible of the process . It is like having one 's pocket picked without discove+ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginary predictions , we find that the defects of the system fall under four heads : Monopoly ; Unfair Apportionment of the Right to Issue Circulation ; Irredeemability of the National Currency ; and Excessive Profits of National Banks . These we shall take up in their order . MONOPOLY . There can be no doubt that the National Banks-at least in the Northeastern States , where the principal portion of the banking capital of the country lies , and where the apportioned amount of bank circulation was long since issued-constitute a true monopoly . It would be idle to say that they do not constitute a monopoly because of their number ,  - -  because the business of banking is not confined to one or a few . The essence of a monopoly , as the word is now used , does not consist in the limitation of the privilege of conducting a business to a small number , but in its being limited at all , either as to the amount of capital which may be invested in the business , or as to the number of persons who may prosecute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State who are debarred by law from engaging in any business on the same terms as any other persons , so long that business , whatever it may be in name or appearance , is in fact and in essence a monopoly in the hands of those who are allowed to engage in it . And in proportion as there is a desire to extend a business so limited beyond the hands of those who may be authorized by law to prosecute it , that monopoly will become odious and oppressive . Applying these principles to the National Banking System , the conclusion can not be resisted , that if any citizen of the United States is debarred by a national law from prosecuting the business of banking on the same terms as any other person in the United States , that business is a monopoly . Viewed in this light , the business of banking under the National Currency Act is a monopoly in all of the Northeastern States of the Union . The national circulation allotted to those States by law , or by the apportionment made An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by organizations earliest in the field , the business of issuing circulating notes is confined to those organizations . National banks may , it is true , be organized and commence business in those States , but they must forego the privilege of issuing notes , unless they can buy up , as has sometimes been done , the circulation of some defunct or moribund bank in the same State , and , returning it to the Currency Bureau at Washington , obtain in its stead new notes to be issued by themselves . The business of issuing circulating notes is monopolized by the associations organized prior to the exhaustion of the amount of banking circulation allotted to the States in which they may be situated . That the national banking interest has grown to be one of great influence in the National Legislature , no one who has watched the course of legislation upon the subject will deny . No other influence than this stands in the way of the repeal of the arbitrary limitation upon the bank circulation of the country , for no other interest could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Currency ' Act should be thrown open to all on equal terms , the profits of the National Banks now established could not fail to be reduced . Competition , that healthful element of all legitimate trade , would be stimulated , and new banks would be organized , until the number should be so increased that the profits derivable from banking under the national system would be assimilated in rate to the profits of other kindre4*nterprises . It is not a matter of surprise that the banks already organized , knowing this , should use every effort to keep newcomers , with whom they would be obliged to share their profits , from the field . How great an influence they are able to exert in this direction may be estimated from a consideration of the fact that nearly every city and thriving village has one or more National Banks , the stockholders and officers of which are usually the most active and influe'itial men in their several localities . Such h*en as these are not to be disregarded in political movements and combinations , and their influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their interests . In this manner they are enabled to largely control the legislation affecting the banking interest . There are few members of Congress who would not be guided in their votes upon a banking measure by the expressed wishes of the national bankers In their districts . These statements are not intended to be construed as strictures upon either the national bankers // or the members of Congress . In so acting they are guided merely by that consideration for their own interests which is the uniform law of human nature . The fact , however , that the National Banking System furnishes incentives to such action is here adduced as one of its defects , which it should be the policy *f wise legislation to remove while the evil is yet in its infancy , and before it becomes too strong-if the hour be not already too lateto be eradicated by anything less than a popular uprising against the whole system . For it must be remembexed that monopolists are no exception to the rule that " power is ever at war with its own boundaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresponsible power , to grow more and more grasping and dictatonal , until at last , blinded by success and license , they carry their exactions to such lengths that they fall victims to the popular resentment which they have provoked . The founders of the National Banking System were doubtless actuated by pure and patriotic motives , but it may prove that they have summoned a genie too powerful for them or their successors to control . An illustration of the influence of the National Banks in shaping legislation favorably to themselves may be found in the fact that upon the maturity of the compound-interest notes , which had been available under the rulings of the Treasury Department for their lawful money reserves , they were able to secure the passage of an act which provided for the issuing of an anomalous kind of obligation ,  --  known as three-per-cent. certificates ,  --  to take the place in their reserves of the matured notes , which had of course ceased to draw interest . The act was passed avowedly for the purpose of providing the banks with notes which should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves , and , while meeting the requirements of law in that particular , should yield them interest . Such a measure is utterly indefensible . Its tffect is to cause the people of the United States to pay interest to the banks on the reserves which the law , founded on a regard for the security of their creditors , compels them*to hold , and which , but for the suspension of specie payments , would be required to be entirely composed of gold and silver coin . A still more recent illustration of the rapacity of the banks is furnished by the bill to provide an " elastic " currency , introduced by Gen. Butler at the last session of the XLIst Congress , which , like most measures of that gentleman , has provoked much comment . It provides for an unlimited issue of bonds or notes bearing three and sixty-five one-hundredths per cent . interest per annum , in lawful money , which shall be furnished at par in exchange for United States notes at all of the Government sub-treasuries , and shall be redeemable on presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank interest has promised this measure its support , provided that it shall be so amended that the proposed bonds be available for the reserves of the banks . This is decidedly the most rapacious proposition which has been presented on behalf of the banks . Should it be adopted , the United States would be required to pay three and sixty-five one-hundredths per cent . annual interest on every dollar held in the bank reserves . The present law is sufficiently odious , but , fortunately , only about twenty-three and one-half millions of the three-per-cent. certificates are now * outstanding , and this amount is being steadily reduced under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury . The proposed new issue , on the other hand , being obtainable at any time , to any amount , in exchange for United States notes , is limited only by the demand . The first and probably about the only result which would follow the adoption of the bill , as proposed to be amended , would be the conversion of the whole legal-tender reserves of the banks into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of additional annual burden upon the people of the United States , in the form of interest paid to the banks on their reserves . The defeat at the same session of Congress , through the influence of the banks , of the bill for the renewal of the bank circulation , is another instance of their greed and power . There was and could be no doubt of the necessity of the measure , which is evidenced by the daily experience of every one ; but the banks were unwilling either to forego the profit derived from the sheer wearing-out of their notes by protracted use , or to submit to the expense of furnishing new ones , and the bill was consequently doomed to defeat . So , too , during the pendency of the funding bill , the banks were able to secure the rej ection of every feature which they considered unfavorable to their interests . This result was achieved through the efforts of a committee , representing nearly all the National Banks in the United States , who formed a lobby too powerful for Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks was so perfect and their power so // DEFECTS OF THE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM great as to render almost hopeless any effort to curtail their profits or franchises . The facts that many members of Congress are officers of National Banks , and that a still larger number are stockholders in those institutions , have doubtless not been wholly destitute of influence upon legislation affecting the interests of the banks . UNFAIR APPORTIONMENT OF THE RIGHT TO ISSUE CIRCULATION . The organization of National Banks in places where no banks existed before , and where no increase of legitimate business would warrant their establishment , has been frequently noticed . Illustrative instances will probably be called to mind by nearly every reader . A comparison of the list of National Banks with that of the banks which existed prior to the passage of the National Currency Act , after making due allowance for increase of trade and wealth , will amply demonstrate this . That , on the other hand , places in need of banking facilities have been left unprovided for by the National system , is evidenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Northeastern States have been refused by the Comptroller of the Currency , in consequence of the exhaustion of the quotas allotted to those States , and that many banks have been organized and have begun business without obtaining their proportion of circulation , while others still have found it profitable to buy the circulation of closing banks at a premium , for the purpose of obtaining for it from the Currency Bureau new notes to be issued by themselves . That these results are due to the imposition of a limitation upon the amount of the bank circulation of the country and to the conseonent enhancement of the profits of the banks , is easily demonstrated . The national banker reaps double interest on his money-one on the bonds deposited for security , and one on the circulation issued to him upon those bonds and used by him in his business . Granting , what for most country districts-where the banks organized without a sufficient basis of legitimate business are commonly situated-is an extravagant estimate , that the taxes would consume the profit derived from circulation , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business should be more than sufficient to pay expenses , the investment in the stock of the bank would be more profitable than United States bonds , and would consequently attract capital . As the expense of conducting country banks is very light , it might well happen that a bank would be a profitable investment to its stockholders in a place where ; without the advantage given to it by the double interest , the legitimate banking business would be inadequate to support such an enterprise . Such being the case , it would unquestionably ensue , since the distribution of the currency was made  --  and could be practically made in most instances-on scarcely any other rule than that of " First come , first served , " that many banks , attracted by the certainty of a paying profit on a very small business , would be established in places not transacting sufficient business to warrant their establishment , if unsupported by the double interest derived from bonds and circulation . Supposing the circulation allotted to a State to be no more than sufficient to meet the requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that such banks should be established , places in need of banking facilities would be deprived of their proper proportion of banking capital , and the privilege of issuing circulation would be unfairly apportioned . A distinction should be made between an unfair apportionment of the right to issue circulation and an improper distribution of the currency itself . The former does not necessarily imply the latter . Circulation , wherever issued , will gravitate to those places where it is needed for the operations of trade . Banks may be established on the prairies of Nebraska or the alkali plains of Nevada , but if there is not sufficient local business to employ their circulation it will flow to the great centers of - trade as certainly and as irresistibly as the Mississippi flows to the Gulf . Banks do not create capital , but are simply one of its forms of investment . Capital must exist before they can be established , and although they may provide a means for its temporary distribution , through the agency of loans , they can not directly add a dime to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be needless , yet the prevalent ignorance of their existence is almost daily exemplified in the press and in the halls of legislation . Not long since many members of Congress from the West and South vehemently advocated a redistribution of the bank circulation in the interests of those sections , on the ground that , being poorer than the East , they should have a greater proportion of circulation , in order to correct the inequality in wealth ! Inasmuch , therefore , as the circulation  |p05-sesses  the power of distributing itself , the unfairness of which we speak extends only to the apportionment of the right to issue it . But , although the circulation eventually flows // to the places where it is needed , the granting of the privilege of issuing it to banks in localities where it is not required for legitimate business operations is none the less injurious in its effects . The banks thus situated are compelled to make use of their circulation in some profitable manner , in order to pay dividends . If it is not taken up by legitimate business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks can not afford to keep it idle in their vaults , and the temptation to lend it at profitable rates in furtherance of hazardous schemes , when no other means of obtaining a profit on it presents itself , can not be resisted by the ordinary bank manager . It may be that the circulation , instead of being employed at home in this manner , is deposited at interest with banks situated in the great centers of business . The evil is not , however , obviated by such a course . The banks with which it is deposited are compelled , in order to cover themselves , to keep these deposits constantly employed in some manner which will bring in a greater rate of interest than that paid for them . If there is sufficient demand for money for proper purposes to keep the whole amount in use at paying rates , no bad results ensue ; but if , as must often happen , the entire sum is not taken up in this manner , the only alternative for the banks , in order to save themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . It thus appears that the unfair apportionment of the right to issue circulation is almost certain in any case to foster speculation . IRREDEEMABILITy OF THE NATIONAL CURRENcY . The worst feature of the present bank circulation is its irredeemability . Although nominally redeemable in United States notes by the banks which issued it , and their redeeming agents , yet so slight a portion of it is sent in for redemption that the banks are practically freed from the responsibility of redeeming their notes . When this state of things is analyzed , it discloses the fact that the whole national bank circulation of the country is , in effect , a permanent loan , without interest , from the people to the banks . This statement may be rendered clearer by an illustration . A national bank is organized with a capital of one hundred thousand dollars , which is invested in United States bonds and deposited with the Treasury Department at Washington as security for circulation . In return for this deposit there is delivered to the bank ninety thousand dollars in circulat ing notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in discounting paper , making loans , and in other profitable ways . If these notes remain in circulation for an indefinite time , there can be no question that for that time they are quite as useful and profitable to the bank as if they were United States notes , or any other circulating representative of value . If the reader should be so fortunate as to be the owner of one hundred thousand dollars in United States bonds , he would not be able-provided that he is not a national banker  --  to realize more than a single interest on the investment . He might deposit them as collateral to his notes , as the national bank virtually does , but , unlike the bank , he would be compelled to pay interest on the notes , so that the interest derived from his bonds would be offset by the interest exacted on the money borrowed . Manage it as he might , he would find himself able to reap interest but once on his hundred thousand dollars . But the national bank , with the same amount invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to the interest on its bonds , ninety thousand dollars more which it can use for purposes of profit . For all purposes of benefit to it , these ninety thousand dollars constitute a loan to the bank , for an indefinite period , without interest . But a loan supposes not only a borrower but a lender ; - who is the lender in this case ? Certainly , it will be said , no one is the loser , and if the national bankers are the gainers it would be ungenerous to grumble at their good fortune . Let us look into this a little . A moment 's reflection will convince any one that inasmuch as the national bank , without any greater merit or effort , possesses so large an advantage , in the profitable use of its capital , over all members of the community whose capital is otherwise invested , this advantage must be gained at their expense . Its undue proportion of profit must be compensated by the decrease of the profits of others . The bank produces nothing ; it adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an instrument for facilitating trade and exchange . On whom then does the loss fall ? At whose expense are the unnaturally increased profits of the banks realized ? The answer , in the light of what has been said , is obvious : the loss falls upon the whole community-upon every person by whom a bank note is received or held . There is no escap ing this conclusion . If A. takes B. 's note without interest , and gives him in return for it its face value in money , trade , or credit , which B. can use to his profit , it is clear that // B. 's profit is at A. 's expense . A. has taken an obligation from B. which yields no profit to the taker , and by so doing has enabled B. to realize a profit . Just this is what every person who takes a bank note does . He gives value , either directly or indirectly , to the bank , upon which it can realize profit , and takes in return an obligation of the bank which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the lenders to the banks , lenders without interest of the whole amount of the bank circulation of the country . But , it may be objected , no one feels this burden ; no one 's profits are perceptibly diminished by it , and therefore no real larm is done . These facts , so far from being a palliation , are but an aggravation of the evil . Self-interest may be trusted to impel men to resist unjust taxation which is plain to be seen of all men , but the enemy to be feared is the one that comes , like the vampire , in the dark , and saps the victim 's life-blood without his knowledge . How great a tax upon the industries of the country the bank circulation is , may be realized when it is stated that , according to the report of the Comptroller of the Currency for i8 70 ,  --  an authority by no means hostile to the banks ,  --  the average profit derived by national banks from their circulation is 5 per ct . per annum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onehalf million dollars-about the present amount of national currency outstanding-is sixteen million three hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars . This , then , is the trifling tax which the people of this country pay for the maintenance of the national banking system . Sixteen and one-third millions taken each year from the hard-earned profits of the people and transferred to the coffers of the banks ! Let no one then delude himself with the idea that no harm is done by this tax . The diversion of sixfeen and a third millions of dollars every year from its proper channel can not fail to work serious injury to the industrial interests of the country . So great an amount annually deducted from the earnings of labor and legitimate trade , and added to the profits of capitalists , however slight its apparent effect upon each individual may be , must inevitably , in its aggregate result , be vastly detrimental to the true interests of the country . For it must be borne in mind that the profits of one class of the community can not be unduly and unnaturally augmented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the remainder of the community . The productions of the country have a certain value , out of which the wages and profits of all members and classes of the community must be paid . No class can appropriate to itself more than its share of that value without injury to other classes . Any system which unduly adds to the profits of the capitalist subtracts an equal amount from the earnings of the producer and the laborer . It behooves us next to inquire to what causes is due this irredeemability which is so disastrous in its results . The main causes are two . One , to which allusion has already been made , is the limitation which has been placed upon its amount . The banks already organized possessing a monopoly of the privilege of issuing circulating notes , and the circulation of the country being no more than sufficient for the requirements of trade , each bank is able to keep out its whole circulation without endeavoring to push home that of other banks . The people , too , knowing that bank notes are equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , by consequence , of nearly all private debts , possess no inducement to refuse to receive them , or to present them , when received , for redetuption . And this brings us to the other and most potent reason for the irredeemability of the National Currency . This is the fact that it is made by law receivable at par in all parts of the United States for all currency dues to and from the United States . This provision , more than all others , is the fountain from which the irredeemability of the national bank circulation flows . The United States by this enactment sets its seal upon every national bank note , declaring thereby that for all purposes of the general government it is equally good with the notes of the United States . This fact , while the receipts and expenditures of the government continue so large as now , aggregating as they did no less than six hundred and seventy-five million dollars for the fiscal year which ended June 30 , 1871 , can not fail to exercise a controlling influence upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shall be receivable by every postmaster for postage ; by every Internal Revenue collector for internal taxes ; by every receiver of * land-office for public lands ; by the Patent Office for patent fees ; by the Treasury for its sales of gold ; by the War and Navy Departments for their sales of stores ; so long , in brief , as it shall be receivable by the officers of the government for all currency dues to the United States , so long will it be impossible to convince any one who holds it that there is any necessity for presenting it for redemption , and so long will its irredeemability continue , // unless , indeed , it should be overcome to some extent by the repeal of the limitation upon the amount which may be lawfully issued . EXCESSIVE PROFITS OF NATIONAL BANKS . The last feature of the system to which we desire to call attention is the result of all those of which we have treated . It is the defect which gives all the others their sting , and without which they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the national banking system , with all its disadvantageous features , enables the banks to divide . The national banks were not required to make any reports of the dividends declared by them until March 3 , i86* , when an act was passed which made it the duty of each national bank to report to the Comptroller of the Currency , within ten days after its declaration , the amount of each dividend declared by it , and the amount of its net earnings in excess of such dividend . The only information , other than that contained in the archives of the Department at Washington , which is possessed concerning these reports of dividends and net earnings , is embodied in a report made by the Comptroller to the House of Representatives on the 22d of January , 1870 , in compliance with a resolutioh of that body , passed December 21 , 1869 . It should be borne in mind that the year 1869 was not a profitable year for most business operations . The course of the price of gAd throughout the year was steadily downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most commodities and kinds of property . The remarks concerning the year I87o contained in the report of the Comptroller of the Currency for that year apply with at least equal force to the year 1869 . " The profits " of National Banks , he says , " have not been so large as in former years , owing to various causes , among which may be noted the dedine in the premium on gold , a reduction in the amount of transactions in government bonds , and cons*uent falling off in commissions , and the fact that , owing to the general shrinkage of values which has taken place , the banks generally have realized their losses and charged off the bulk of their bad debts . " And yet , notwithstanding these disadvantageous conditions , the average percentage of clear profits , including dividends and net earnings in excess of dividends , for the first dividend period of six months embraced in the Comptroller 's report to theHouse of Representatives was six and eighty-eight one-hundredths , and for the second period six and seventy-five onehundredths , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all taxes , expenses , losses , and abatements whatever , of thirteen and sixty-three one-hundredths per centum . When it is remembered that this is the average rate of net profits of all the national banks which paid any dividends at all during the year , including those unfavorably situated or badly managed , and those which had sustained losses through either mismanagement or dishonesty , the profitableness of the national banking system will be clearly realized . It is doubtful whether there is any business pursued within the United States , not favored by special legislation or attended with exceptional risk , danger , or disrepute , whose average net profits are so great as those indicated by these figures . Instances may doubtless be pointed out where certain individuals or sets of individuals , in the pursuit of some business not belonging to the classes which we have excepted , have walized higher profits ; but it would be found that when their profits had been averaged with those of the same business throughout the United States , they would fall much below those of national banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of merchants engaged , for instance , in the dry-goods trade , who had realized a much larger net profit ; but if the profits of all the dry-goods merchants in the country should be averaged ,  --  if from the aggregate profits should be deducted all the losses of merchants who had made unfortunate ventures or had failed ,  --  the average net profits would unquestionably be brought down to a much smaller figure than that shown by the dividend reports of the national banks . So , too , a business which is usually exposed to exceptional risks may in a fortunate season reap exceptional profits ; but if its profits for a number of seasons , favor . able and unfavorable included , should be averaged , the net profits would be reduced to a much lower rate . Pursuits which expose those who may engage in them to great personal danger , or are considered disreputable or unpleasant , may show a larger average net profit ; but the danger , disrepute , or unpleasantness with which they are attended may be considered as a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuits not subject to these drawbacks . The business of banking is exposed to very few risks-indeed , to no special risks . Em*bezzlement , robbery , or mismanagement may , it is true , ruin a bank ; &amp;r impair its profits or capital ; but these are disasters to which all businesses are alike exposed . So , too , a financial nanic may sweep over the // DEFECTS OF THE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM . land and involve all banks in common distress or ruin . But the effects of these are not confined to banks alone ; they affect in equal or greater degree the whole business community , with whose misfortunes the banks of necessity sympathize . But , aside from the risks to which it is exposed in common with all other business pursuits , banking is an eminently safe business , probably subjected to as few risks as any involving the investment of capital that can be mentioned . It is also in an unusual degree pleasant and honorable . Its exactions of time and labor are light as compared with other pursuits , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honored members of the community . There is , consequently , no reason in the nature of things why the profits of national banks should be so great . It would rather appear that a slight advantage in the percentage of income derived from investments in national bank stock over the legal interest on money would be a sufficient inducement to attract all the capital which would be required for the conduct of the banking business of the country . It would seem that , at the highest estimate , under a normal condition of the business , the assurance of two or three per cent . greater profit than could be realized from what are considered absolutely safe investments-* -- such as government stocks , or loans on real estate-would compensate for all the additional risk to which capital would be exposed when invested in the business of banking . This conclusion may be reasonably drawn from the laws of supply and demand . But so far from finding the result that might have been expected , under a natural and healthy condition of the business , we perceive that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average legal interest on money , and more than double the interest on United States stocks . If a simple farmer or tradesman becomes the possessor of a few hundred surplus dollars which he wishes to loan on real estate or in any other manner , the usury laws of most of the States , and usually the inexorable natural laws of trade also , limit the interest which he may receive to six or seven per cent . per annum ; while the wealthy capitalist who has been so fortunate as to invest in national bank stock may rely upon an income from the investment of nearly double those rates . Such a discrimination in favor of investments in a particular kind of corporate capital , if it can be traced to the door of legislation , is eminently unjust . Giving , as it ioes , an undue and unmerited share of the aggregate profits of tke community to a favored portion of its members , it impairs in an equal degree the profits of the remainder . Such an effect is baneful in the last degree . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enormous profits of the national banking system are due , so that , if they lie within the province of legislation , they may be corrected . We may reasonably conclude , since the profits of all enterprises under the operation of natural laws seek a common level , that these causes may be found in the legal defects of the system ,  --  in the anomalous provisions which have been ingrafted upon it by legislation . But before studying these causes let us retrace our steps and briefly consider again the three great defects of the system which we have been examining : - Monopoly , Unfair Apportionment of the Right to Issue Circulation , and Irredeemability of the National Currency . The second defect we have shown to be but a result of the first . We may then properly resort to the other two for an answer to our inquiry . We find both of these defects to pertain to the circulation , for the monopoly which the system creates is a monopoly of only the right to issue circulating notes , and not of the other branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the general law is concerned , upon payment to the Internal Revenue Department of taxes equal in rate to the duties collected by the Treasurer of the United States from national banks , may receive deposits , buy and sell exchange , bonds and securities , discount paper , loan money , and engage in any and all of the other branches of the banking business , except the issuing of circulating notes . That privilege is practically confined to the national banks by the imposition of a prohibitory tax of ten per cent . per annum " on the notes of any person , State bank , or State banking association , used for circulation . " The monopoly then only extends to the circulation , of which irredeemability is but another feature . We may therefore rightly conclude that the source of the undue profits of the national banks , as compared with other equally safe investments of capital , is to be found in their possession of a monopoly of the privilege of issuing circulating notes , and in their practical freedom , under the operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We find that these conclusions are borne out by the facts . The Comptroller of the Currency , in his report for z87o , in the following statements furnishes important confirmation of our conclusions : " The privilege of issuing circulating notes is no more valuable as a franchise under FederaJ // authority than it always has been under State authority . The profits derived from it are asually over-estimated . A fair estimate of the average percentage of profit on circulation will not much exceed five per cent. , and this is just about the average rate paid by national banks ; so that the profits derived from the business of banking depend chiefly upon the amount of deposits , which , after all , constitute the true basis of banking . " Although we have quoted this passage chiefly for the purpose of showing the estimate made of the profits derived from circulation , we can not permit its statements on other points to pass unchallenged . In the light of the previous discussion , the privilege of issuing circulating notes is indisputably more valuable under the National system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the obvious reason that the national banks are not in practice required to redeem their notes , while an amount equal to the whole volume of its circulation came into each State bank for redemption , under any well-regulated State system , every few months . The New York State banks , it is estimated , redeemed an amount equal to their whole circulation every sixty or ninety days . It is absurd to say that no more profit can be derived from a circulation , all of which remains permanently outstanding , and for whose redemption no provision is needed , than was realized from one all of which came in for redemption every few months , to provide for which the banks had to constantly keep large reserves on hand . It requires no more than the statement of these facts to convince any one that the national currency must be a source of vastly greater profit to the banks than the old State bank circulation ever was . By what process of computation the Comptroller charges the whole amount of taxation paid by national banks against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would seem to be quite as fair to charge it against the profits on deposits , and then to conclude that the circulation was the chief source of profit . The inference from his conclusions would seem to be that , inasmuch as the profit on circulation happens to be about equal to the taxation , the other items must be considered as the true sources of profit , and that therefore the entire thirteen and sixtythree one-hundredths percentage of net profit i.i properly attributable to them . The truth is that the taxes of the banks are distributed over all their sources of profit-their circulation , deposits , capital stock , dividends , and surpluses . The proper course would have been to apportion the five per cent . of taxation among these different items , and we presume from the result reached that , in making his estimate of the profit on circulation , the Comptroller did deduct from the gross profit at least its fair share of taxation . Following this course , we find that if the circulation brings in five per cent . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit must be referred to the other items . Deducting the five per cent . derived from circulation from the total net profit of thirteen and sixty-three onehundredths percent. , we find the profit on other items eight and sixty-three one-hundredths per cent. , a result widely different from that to which the Comptroller 's logic would lead us . Accepting , however , as a fact his statement that the profits derived from circulation are just about sufficient to pay all the taxes of national banks , we have a convincing proof of the unjust operation of the system . The statement , put into other words , means e*cactly this : that the national banks have been gratuitously presented by the government with a franchise the profits of which , * under existing laws and conditions , pay all of their taxes and leave the remainder of their business absolutely free from taxation . What a monstrous discrimination in their favor is this ! While all the remainder of the capital of the country is groaning under an oppressive load of taxation , the national banks alone are presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people all the taxes levied upon their immense business . When we consider that many banks throughout the country are doing a thriving business without issuing . any circulation at all , we can come to no other conclusion than that if such banks are able to make a fair profit after meet* ing all the demands of the tax-gatherer , national banks equally well situated and well managed must be able to make just about five per cent . more than a fair profit. * * It may be objected to the foregoing remarks concerning the profits of the banks , that they leave out of sight the fact that the banks have large surpluses , which are a part of their working capital , and to which should be assigned their proper proportion of profits , thus reducing the percentage of average profits . Tbis objection would be just , if its force were not almost if not quite neutralized by the following facts i . The surpluses do not entitle the banks to additional circulation , and are therefore less profitable than capital . 2 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many banks have either no circulation or a less amount than ninety per cent . of their capital , and consequently divide smaller profits than those having their full proportion . As our criticisms are leveled // REMEDIES . We have thus passed in review what , in our opinion , are the great defects of the National Banking System  --  the Monopoly of the Privilege of issuing Circulation by certain favored corporations , the Unfair Apportionment of that Privilege , and the Irredeemability of the Bank Currency , and , finally , the Enormous Profits of the Banks . It now remains for us to point out the remedies for these defects . The remedies which we shall propose have probably been foreseen by the reader from the foregoing discussion . They are simple and practicable , and , what will recommend them to most liberal minds , they tend to the freeing and not to the shackling of business . We are no believer in those cumbrous expedients of legislation which seem to spring from the notion that it is the natural tendency of things to go wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass laws which by restrictions , penalties , and like devices shall compel them to go right . We believe in most instances such laws are hindrances rather than helps . We have the most unbounded confidence in natural laws , and but very mainly at circulation , such banks should be excluded from the calculation . The total circulation of the banks at the close of 1869 was less than seventy per cent . of their capital . 3 . The banks are permitted to charge to their profit and loss accounts the premiums paid on bonds owned by them , and to report the bonds at their par value among their resources . It is not known to what extent this has been done ; but as the United States bonds held by them at the close of 1869 amounted to over $38o , ooo , ooo , the cost of which ranged from par to a premium of twenty per cent. , while their premium accounts amounted to but $2,439,591.41 , it is evident that an immense amount of premiums had been chargud to profit and loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion was so charged in 1869  --  the year whose profits we have considered . As these bonds are proba. bly now worth on an average more than they cost , the premiums paid ought not to be deducted in reckoning actual profits . 4 . As before stated , the profits of the banks in 1869 were probably not so large as usual . Although the official figures for the profits of subsequent years , on file in the Currency Bureau at Washington , can not be obtained until called for by Congress , there is good reason for believing that they show an increase over the profits of 1869. * . As also stated before , the capitals of all unfortunate , badly located , and mismanaged banks that made any profits at all were necessarily included in reckoning the average profits . For these reasons the passages relating to profits have been allowed to stand . We are calculating the profits that are due to the peculiar features of the National Banking System , and we have a right in estimating them to include only such banks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their full proportion of circulation . We do not believe that the profits of such banks have been exaggerated by us. little faith in the legislative contrivances of men , when they overstep the limit of repress ing and redressing crime and wrong-doing . It may therefore be expected that our remedies will look to the repeal of restrictive and artificial enactments rather than to the imposition of new restrictions or the adoption of new expedients . The remedies which we offer are simply these : the repeal of the limitation upon the amount of the bank circulation , and of the provision making national currency receivable in payment of currency dues to and from the United States  --  the one imposing a restriction on the freedom of business , the other giving to bank notes an artificial value which they do not really possess . The first of these proposed remedies has been advocated by many , and is known as free-banking ; the other , though quite as important , and aimed at as great an infringement of principle , we have never seen proposed . We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislation , and involving nothing but a repeal of foolish and ill-considered enactments , are a sufficient cure for all the evils that we have pointed out . Upon the larger question , whether it is desirable that any legislative sanction should be given to the issuing of circulating notes by banks , we shall not at present enter . We know that many able minds have come to a negative* conclusion ; but we also know that it is the almost unanimous sentiment of the country at this day that banks of issue are the indispensable allies of trade , and that the regula* tion of their modes of operation is a proper subject of legislation . Our remedies are proposed , therefore , for the purpose of improving the system which has been founded on this opinion , rather than of indicating what in our opinion would be a perfect system . Before proceeding to show what would be the result of the application of these remedies , it will be proper to prove that the provisions whose repeal we suggest transgress the bounds of the proper functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political economy , and that their repeal is desirable for that reason on grounds of principle , independently of their bearing upon the defects to which we have adverted . Both are , however , parts of the same result , for whenever , in the consideration of any subject , we find that principles have been violated , we shall be able to trace disastrous consequences , and , conversely , we shall usually be able to trace disastrous results back to violated prin ciples. // REPEAL OF THE LIMITATION ON CIRCULATION . Although the propriety of placing a limitation on the bank circulation of the country seems to have received on all sides almost unquestioning assent , yet it can be defended on no ground of principle or policy . It is a wanton , causeless hampering of individual freedom of action , the offspring of a misconception of the proper functions of legislation and of ignorance of the elementary principles of political economy . So harsh a statement as this demands strict proof , and it shall receive the strictest proof of which the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the foundation of our fabric of government , or more generally accepted by the leading liberal minds of the world , than that it is the natural inalienable right of every individual to pursue his own happiness or interest in his own way , provided only that he do not interfere with the enjoyment of the like right by others . This principle is the corner-stone of the American system of government , the one which former builders had indeed rejected , to the detriment and downfall of their superstructures , but which our forefathers wisely made the head of the corner , to their imperishable glory , and to the solidity and permanency of the fabric which they reared . So long as it shall remain in place , our liberties are safe ; but if ever it shall be wrenched from its position , the downfall of popular freedom will inevitably follow . Our first step , then , in examining any act of legislation , should be to test it by this important and fundamental principle . Should it be found at variance therewith , it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this test , then , to the question before us , and conceding for the nonce that the issuing of circulating notes is a proper and legitimate business , we find ourselves unable to justify the imposition of any limitation upon the amount of circulating notes which may be issued . If it is proper at all , it is as proper for me as for my neighbor . If it is a rightful mode of earning money , it follows from the principle which we have stated that it is equally rightful for all the citizens of the State . But it may be objected that this argument proves too much , and therefore defeats itself ; that it would legitimately follow from it that all limitations upon the issuing of circulating notes should be abolished , and that whoever pleases should be allowed to issue them without the deposit of security , or compliance with any of the other restrictive provisions of the present law . Such an objection would not , however , be valid . The argument simply proves *that all persons who wish to engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are of right entitled to do so on equal terms , not that no terms at all should be exacted . The conditions which limit the issuing of circulat ing notes , by requiring the deposit of security and by kindred provisions , have been found necessary during a long course of experience to protect the public from imposition by the formation of fraudulent banks and the issuing of worthless notes . No principle is violated by their exaction , since they apply alike to all and hamper the freedom of action of no members of the community any farther than is necessary for the protection of the rights of others . They are fQunded upon the proviso of the principle which we have stated , while the limitation of the amount of circulation is capable of no such justification . We are aware that this reference to principlei will be stigmatized by some as casuistical and transcendental . It is a common practice of those who style themselves practical men , and who have never risen above the narrow circle of facts which surround them to a perception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to denounce every reference to principles as visionary and idle , and to declare that the only safe guide is experience . Such an objection , aimed as it is at the very root of our argument , deserves a moment 's consideration. - We may affirm , without risk of dissent , that certain great fundamental principles were assumed and recognized in the very inception of our system of government . It is not necessary now to consider from what source they were derived . It is sufficient for the purpose that they were recognized and adopted , that they have have been acquiesced in by all parties and classes of our people , and that they have been recognized by the whole world as the distinguishing features of the American system . Such being the fact , it follows that unless these principles can be overthrown in their entirety , any conclusion which can be legitimately deduced from them may be properly advanced as an argument for or against any measure existing or proposed , and should be recognized as possessing controlling force . In the present argument the impropriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may be issued has been legitimately deduced from one of the fundamental principles of our system of government . Until that principle shall be shown to be wrong , the conclusion , if legitimately reached , must // be accepted , despite any fancied variance with the teachings of experience . An illustration may make the last point clearer . " No taxation without representation " was the rallyingcry of the fathers of the republic . Suppose that an attempt should be made to prove by elaborate statistics , and . reference to the experience of mankind , that , as a rule , people who are taxed without representation are freer , happier , and better off in every respect than those who have a voice in the levying of their taxes ,  --  would any American deem it necessary to refute such a presentation ? He would rather think it sufficient to reply that the right to a voice in making the laws by which he is governed is inherent in every man , and that he can not be divested of it without injury to his happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposition of any limitation upon the amount of bank currency is a violation of principle , and the legitimacy of the mode of reaching that conclusion having been vindicated , it remains to be shown that such a limitation is as inexpedient as it is violative of principle ,  --  that it disregards the teachings of political economy equally with the proper functions of government . It would seem to have required but the most elementary knowledge of that science on the part of our law-makers to teach them that the amount of currency which a country requires at any time can not be determined by human intelligence . No man can estimate , with any approximation to correctness , how much currency the vast and complicated industries and trades of our country require . But even if the question should be solved today , and the amount of currency fixed at an amount sufficient to meet the present demands of trade , we should be but little better off ; for the tides of trade are constantly ebbing and flowing , and the currency required to meet its purposes varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question to-day would be an achievement of but temporary value . Next fall or next winter *t would need to be solved over again , and a new limit set to the currency , and ? . * on ad infini/um . Granting , however , that some means of ascertaining the aggregate amount of bank currency required could be devised , the apportionment of the right to issue it among the different sections of the country with any degree of fairness would be a task requiring more than the wisdom of men . Population furnishes no certain guide , for it is apparent that a poor community requires less currency to conduct its business than is required by a wealthy community . Neither does property furnish any criterion , for active capital evidently requires more currency for its operations than capital inactive . An agricultura1 community , whose products flow into the market mainly during a single season of the year requires less than a manufacturing community , of equal wealth , whose capital is turned over many times during the year . Yet , regardless of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human knowledge , our legislators have presumptuously attempted to solve them , and , adopting an odd conglomeration of the population and property bases , have decreed that half of the national currency shall be apportioned according to population and half according to existing banking capital , resources , and business . Why half was accorded to each , unless as a compromise measure , it is impossible to guess . It would seem that if either basis were the proper one , it would exclude the other , and should have been alone adopted . An apportionment solely according to either population or banking capital , resources , and business , would be consistent , however unphilosophical or impracticable it might be ; but the plan adopted is neither consistent , philosophical , nor practicable . We say impracticable , as well as inconsistent and unphilosophical , because it is impossible to ascertain what the comparative " resources and business " of the various sections of the country are , with sufficient definiteness , to make them a correct guide in the apportionment of that half of the currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that the only proper limit to such a currency is the ability of the country to make use of it . There is no better reason why the amount of bank circulation to be issued should be limited , than for an arbitrary limitation upon the quantity of wheat to be raised , of coal to be mined , or of goods to be manufactured or sold . All are alike proper and legitimate enterprises , and should alike be governed solely by the law of supply and demand . No one expresses any fear that too much wheat will be raised , yet such an apprehension would be no more groundless than that upon which the limitation of the circulation is based . The idea that the imposition of such a limitation is a proper exercise of the powers of legislation has , however , taken firm hold of the popular mind , and such is the innate conservatism of human nature , that , when such a belief has been once adopted , it is a most difficult task to lead men to look beneath the precedents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon a foundation of principle . REPEAL OF THE PROVISION FOR RECEIPT OF BANK NOTES FOR PUBLIC DUES . The provision of law which makes the national bank-notes receivable in payment of all currency dues to and from the United States seems never to have received the consideration to which it is entitled . Probably this is in part due to the fact that at the time of its adoption we were straining every nerve in the effort to prevent national disruption ,  --  willing , in order to secure that result , to sacrifice everything save honor and right . So it happened that when the national banking system was devised for the purpose , in a great measure , of aiding the government in calling to its assistance the savings of the people , by facilitating the sale of the government loans , no inducement was thought too great which was considered necessary to secure the investment of capital in national banks . Probably , too , the people , so far as they were consulted or had formed opinions , were deluded by the promise of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulate at par in every part of the country , and would be directly available for the payment of taxes without the necessity of presenting it for redemption . In this manner was inserted in the national banking system a provision whose violations of principle doubtless caused the bones of Jackson and Benton to turn in their graves . We have been unable to find , on a careful examination of the debates which preceded the adoption of the first two national currency acts , that this provision provoked the slightest dissent or even criticism . One would suppose that a recollection of the thunders of Benton against a similar practice ,  --  unsanctioned , however , by law ,  --  in the days of Jackson , and of the famous " Specie Circular " of the latter , would have inspired at least the Democratic members to protest against an infringement of what was once a cardinal principle of the Democratic faith . They contented themselves , however , with impotent protests against the invasion of " State Rights " which the measure , in their opinion , involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sacred by the footsteps of " Old Bullion " as to advocate an extension of the provision to private as well as public debts ! Like the limitation upon the amount of circulation , this feature proves , when examined , to be indefensible upon every ground of principle or policy . However well secur ' *d they may be , bank notes , whether State or National , are the notes of private corporations , whose profits the government has no right to enhance by giving increased currency to their circulation . We have seen that circulation is a source of great profit to the banks , and that in proportion as the obligation to redeem it is lessened , their profits are increased . If the government receives and pays out the notes of the banks at par , it unquestionably gives them a much more extended and permanent circulation than they would otherwise possess , and consequently contributes to the profits of the banks . In thus contributing to the profits of the banks , it adds , as we have seen , to the burdens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true interests of the country . The government should be the representative of the whole body of the people , and the guardian and conservator of their rights and interests , and it has no right by any action which it may take to add to the profits of a class at the expense of the remainder of the community . The fact that the notes are perfectly good does not affect the application of the principle . There is no doubt that A. T. Stewart 's note would be good for an amount larger than the circulation of any bank in the United States ; yet it would be considered a glaring outrage if he should be permitted to pay in his note , either with or without interest , in satisfaction of ever so small a debt to the government . Nor does the fact that the government itself holds the securities which insure the payment of the notes invalidate the argument , any more than the receipt of the note of any private individual by the government would be rendered proper by his depositing collateral to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in receiving bank notes , lends its credit to the banks to just the aThount of the notes received ,  --  a proceeding the very statement of which shows its utter indefensibility . It will be objected to the proposed repeal of this provision that the government has certified to the goodness of the notes of the national banks , and that by refusing to receive them it would be discrediting paper which it has virtually indorsed . But an indorser is not obliged to receive the note that he has indorsed whenever tendered in payment of a debt , but only to pay it in the event of the promisor 's default . Experience has demonstrated , as believed by most , that public necessity demands that bank circulation shall be secured by the deposit of securities with the government , either State or National // In the interest of the people , not of the banks , the national government , under the present system , has undertaken the trust , and has certified upon the face of each note that it is secured by the deposit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that it has accepted this trust and given this certificate imposes no obligation upon it to receive the note in payment of government dues . The certificate is plain and explicit , and neither its language nor its spirit would be violated by the refusal of the government to receive the note . The currency which their receipt and payment by the government gives to bank notes will be appreciated if it be remembered that the notes received at any point are not unfrequently transferred to another far distant before being paid out again . For instance , bank notes received by the Assistant Treasurer of the United States at New York may be transferred to the Assistant Treasurer at New Orleans , or those received at Chicago may be transferred to New York before being used in the government payments . It thus appears that , independently of the enhanced value which their availability for payments to the United States gives to the notes , the wide distribution throughout the country that the government gives to many of those which it receives lessens the likelihood of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the banks . The only argument that can be adduced in favor of the receipt of bank notes by the government is that of convenience ,  --  that it would be difficult , if not impossible , for the people to obtain currency for the payment of their taxes if bank notes should cease to be available for that purpose . While contending that principles should never be subordinated to considerations of convenience , we may neve*th*less prove that this argument is fallacious . The test of a person s ability to pay is the possession , not necessarily of money , but of capital or credit . If either of the latter is not wanting , the former , which is but their representative , will not fail to be forthcoming in some form , except in those primitive countries where trade is conducted wholly by barter . It is doubtless true that the possessors of bank notes in districts remote from banks would be unable to exchange them for United States notes with which to pay their taxes ; but if they should know that the bank notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in need of currency for that purpose , they would refuse such notes whenever tendered in payVOL . III. - 28 ment of debts due to them , and , as they might lawfully do , demand United States notes instead . And this , so far from being deplorable , would be a most salutary result , since it would limit bank notes to their proper office ,  --  that of local and temporary circulation . EFFECTS OF THE REMEDIES PROPOSED . It remains to be considered what would be the practical effect of the application of these remedies , and especially upon the defects which we have pointed out . The repeal of the limitation upon the amount of bank circulation would necessarily destroy the monopoly which the present national banks possess , and would thus relieve the system of the feature which is most odious to the American mind . Should the privilege of issuing circulation be extended on equal terms to all , and should the provision for the receipt of bank notes by the government be repealed , there could be no complaint that the benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that the business of banking was favored with special and exceptional privileges . The features of the deposit of security and of governmental supervision excepted , national banking would assume its place by the side of other legitimate enterprises . The business being open to healthful competition , ignorance , incompetency , and extravagance would be weeded out , and those banks which should be conducted with prudence and skill on sound business principles would alone succeed . If the business , thus divested of special privileges and thrown open to all , should continue to be more profitable than others , its lucrativeness could be properly ascribed only to the knowledge , skill , and experience required to conduct it . The destruction of the monopoly would necessarily be accompanied by the rectification of the present unfairness in the apportionment of the right to issue circulation . Those places which are in need of additional banks of issue , but which have been debarred by the arbitrary apportionment of the circulation from satisfying their wants , would be able , should the limitation be repealed , to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , those banks which , under the present apportionment , have been able to maintain a profitable existence upon the double interest which the investment returns , without doing sufficient business to warrant a profit , being // driven to provide for the frequent redemption of their notes ) and finding themselves in great measure deprived of one of their two principal sources of profit , would be forced to wind up their affairs and leave the field free to their more healthy competitors . The currency , no longer apportioned according to arbitrary enactments , but left to the operation of natural laws , would distribute itself in accordance with the requirements of trade . Such a distribution could not fail to be fair , because it would be healthy and naturaL Under the operation of the two remedies which we have proposed , the redeemability of the national currency would be speedily secured . The result of the removal of the limitation upon the amount of the circulation would be that new banks would spring up to such an extent that the currency would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanently carry it all . The consequence of this would be that the surplus would be sent home for redemption , and that , as each bank would wish to keep out as much of its own circulation as possible , it would strive to force in the circulation of other banks . This consequence would be aided and hastened by the repeal of the provision for the receipt of national currency by the United States , which would create a demand for United States notes for the payment of dues to the government . Persons having taxes to pay would either refuse to receive national bank notes , or , having received them , would be compelled to exchange them for United States notes , with brokers and others , who would make a business of sending them for redemption to the banks which issued them . The redeemability of the national currency having been secured , the country would possess that which so many ingenious but ill-fated plans have been formed to bring about-an elastic currency ; one which would accommodate itself to the requirements of trade ; would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency active , and contract when trade should become dull . And all this would be accomplished without the employment of any clumsy expedients of legislation , but simply by the repeal of former mistaken acts of our law-makers . Lastly , the profits of the banks under the operation of these remedies would be brought down to an equality with those derived from other similar investments of capital . The profits arising from circulation would , in consequence of the necessity of providing for its frequent redemption , be reduced to so small an amount that no bank could hope to exist on the revenue derived from its bonds and circulation , unless it should be supplemented by a much larger return from the pursuit of legitimate banking business ; while the profits on general business would be reduced by the competition resulting from the removal of all restraints on the establishment of banks . The business being open to all , capital , controlled by an intelligent self-interest , would flow into it until its profits should be so reduced that it would no longer offer special inducements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious defects of the national banking system would be remedied . The business of banking-no longer fostered by special privileges or hampered by foolish restrictions , but left , as every business should be , to the operation of those natural laws which can not be violated without disaster , but which , if not interfered with , are sure to work out vastly wiser and better results than any of the poor devices of men-would be established on a sound and enduring basis , from which it could be overthrown by no slight convulsion of trade .
