Flos It 's quite a humiliating confession , is n't it  --  to acknowledge I find it dull ? I ought to have all sorts of resources ; all well-bred young ladies are supposed to have . Cor . Courtney Corliss ( L. ) . Utter nonsense ! Seclusion is very well for age ; to youth it is a prison . The glare of the ballroom is for a young girl what the sunlight is for the flower . Flos .

Mrs. Hypatia Bargiss That 's why it vexed me so when the other publishers refused them . Gas . Professor Gasleigh Bless you ! I understand all that . You were rejected because you were n't in the literary ring . It was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " Scattered Leaflets " have been founded as a refuge for the outcasts of the pen .

Cor . Courtney Corliss Does his lordship interest you so much ? Flos . Flos Is n't it quite natural ? The story sounds like a fairy-tale ; so unlike our matter-of-fact customs . A noble earl falls in love with the portrait of a girl  --  with her portrait only  --  without knowing anything about her  --  without caring for anything except that he loves her ( significantly )  --  and not even asking who she is  --  what she is  --  sends his messenger to find her and  --  Cor .

Courtney Corliss The one thing without which there can be no happiness . Let me quote from Heine ,  --  " Angels call it Heavenly bliss , The demons call it Hell 's abyss , But mortals call it Love . " Flos . Flos ( laughs ) . Ha , ha , ha ! Oh , love ! ( Crosses to L. ) Ha , ha , ha ! Love , to be sure ! Excuse me for laughing . I know nothing about it , although the novels I 've read are quite full of the subject , and very charming it is there . But what little I 've seen in real life appears to me utterly unreliable . Cor . Courtney Corliss ( rises ) . Why , Miss Florence ? Flos . Flos ( s arcastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too high a value on their love and too little on ours . They think it sufficient to come grandly forward , after a severe internal struggle at giving up their freedom , and say to the girl : " I love you .

Mrs. Hypatia Bargiss Is it necessary to do that at night ? Gas . Professor Gasleigh The nature of man is furtive , like the savage beast . At night it emerges from its den and prowls . We have tracked it to its lair . I may incidentally mention that we have gone where , if we were not poets , we could not have ventured with propriety . Mrs. B. Mrs. Hypatia Bargiss ( shocked ) .
