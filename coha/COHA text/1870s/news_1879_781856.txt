txt There is a wide difference among scientific men as to the origin of the common domestic step-ladder . By some it is held that the step-ladder is simply tho wild ladder of the backyard modified by centuries of domestication . Others believe that it is a hybrid between the centre-table and the chair , and that it bears only an accidental resemblance to the wild ladder . Radically different as those two theories are , there is much to be said in support of each of them . There is no doubt the step-ladder servos the same purpose within doors that is served by the wild ladder out of doors . This , however , proves nothing . The terrier dog and the cat are both used for , rat-catching , but no one pretends that they are nearly related . That there is a resemblance in name between the step-ladder and the wild ladder is also without any real bearing upon the question of the relationship of the two . The horse and the saw-horse are both familiarly known as horses , but no one imagines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step-ladder is descended from the wild ladder , the comparative anatomy of the two must furnish the best and almost the only conclusive evidence . Now , we find that the anatomy of the stepladder bears scarcely any resemblance to that of the wild ladder . The former is quadrupedal , the latter bipedal . This alone fixes an enormous gulf between them , and there is probably no learned Darwinian who would admit that a quadruped can be directly developed from a biped without passing through any intermediate stages . In the wild ladder there is not the faintest rudimentary suggestion of a hinge , while the fore-legs of the stop-ladder are swung upon well-developed hinges . The difference between the hinged step-ladder and the unhinged ladder is as wide as that between the vertebrate horse and the invertebrate saw-horse . So far as the evidence of anatomy is concerned , we must admit that it directly contradicts the supporters of t he theory that the step-ladder is derived immediately , or even remotely , from the wild ladder . Let us turn for a moment to the consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ages preceding the step-ladder it was a common practice for the housewife who wished to take down the curtains to place a chair on the centretable and then to mount from one to the other . It is claimed that we have here the true origin of the step-ladder . Like the table , it is quadrupedal , and the germ of its steps are contained in the two steps which are formed when a chair is superimposed upon the table . Comparative anatomy , as well as hypothetical history , supports the theory that the step-ladder springs from the union of the chair and the table , although it must be confessed that it does not throw any light on the origin of the hinges , which formone of the leading characteristics of the step-ladder . Although the testimony of comparative anatomy seems fatal to the theory of a close relationship between the step-ladder and the wild ladder , the moment we investigate the moral qualities and compare the habits of the two we find a startling resemblance . The ladder is uniformly wild and dangerous . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounts upon it , and it frequently falls upon unoffonding persons with every symptom of murderous fury . It is also nocturnal in its habits , and will frequently wander miles away during the night . So well known is this habit , that careful men habitually chain up their ladders or lock them in the barn . There was a minister in a Long Island village who neglected this precaution only for a single night last Winter , and in the morning his ladder had disappeared . A week . afterward it was found in the back yard of a deacon who resided five miles from the minister 's house , and who asserted that the ladder followed him home one night , in spite of his utmost efforts to drive it back by throwing stones at it and requesting it to " scat . " In the step-ladder we find precisely the same characteristics , In spite of its inoffensive look , it delights to do all the injury in its power . In addition to the modes of attack practiced by the wild ladder , it uses its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Spring and Autumn , when curtains are taken down and picture-frames are dusted , the surface of the ladies of the household is to a large extent black and blue with the bruises thus inflicted . The step-ladder , with atrocious cunning , often lies down at . night in the upper or lower hall , to wait for . casual victims .. The man who gets up in the night with a view either to cats or robbers , and walks within the clutches of a stepladder stretched at full length on the floor , is generally au unrecognizable mass of bruises , broken glass , and spilled kerosene by the time that help comes to release him . Men taw been known to tangle themselves up so inextricably with a prone and vicious stop-ladder that they have continued . to fall over it for hours at a time . Among the whole family of domestic furniture , there is none that compares in subtile malignity with the treacherous and cruel stepladder . That the step-ladder will roam vast distances if loft unfastened during either day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be left it will never be found in the same place unless it has been securely fastened . Many a man has left a stepladder in the front parlor when summoned to cease hanging pictures and to come to dinner , but almost invariably he has found that ladder - either in the attic or down cellar when the dinner has come to an end . Step-ladders loft incautiously on the front step of New-York houses have been known to wander from house to house throughout the entire block , and there is one stepladder in East Twenty-second-street which is so well known to the Police that it has been seized and carried to the station-house as a vagrant . at least a dozen times during the last ten years . We thus see that while the step-ladder seems to be anatomically related to the table and chair , it is morally closely allied to the wild back-yard ladder . From which has it been developedl We are ' yet far from being in a position to decide this question , and for the present we must leave the scientific mon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitless years .
