txt A recently issued official digest of the English census of 1871 affords the materials for making a comparison of some important features in the social statistics of Great Britain and the United States . The relation between population and the numbers of inhabited houses in any given locality has always been held to have a direct bemingupon the moral and sanitary condition of the community . But , as the English digest puts it , a house is a very variable unit . " The ordinary house varies in size and structure in town and . country-Lin its cubical contents , in its hearths , in its doors , and in its windows ; so that to give a correct view of the accommodation which houses afford the population , a special inquiry is indispensable . " It is only , therefore , with certain qualifications due to varieties of structure that a fair comparison can be made between the relative proportions of population and inhabited houses in different countries , or in different parts of the same country . The English census enumerators were instructed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the external and party walls of every separate building , and precisely the same method was adopted here . Apart from the very decided differences existing between the town architecture of the two countries  --  differences which tell unfavorably against the United States  --  it may fairly be concluded that whichever country has the smallest proportion of people in each separate dwelling has , so far , a sanitary . and moral advantage over the other . In both countries the growth of wealth and intelligence has , at each succeeding census , found one of its most convincing proofs on the diminishing proportion of persons to houses . The English census of 1811 showed that there was an average of 5.45 persons to every dwelling in the country , while the census of 1871 shows that the proportion has in sixty years been reduced to 4.98 persons to each dwelling . In 1850 the census enumerators of the United States found a proportion of 5.94 free persons to each dwelling , while in 1870 , in spite of the addition of the former slaves to the enumeration , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , though still having ten per cent . more people to each house than the English average , - we have reduced the pressure of population upon houses exactly as much in twenty as the English have in sixty years . In both countries the number of persons to a family has shown a corresponding ratio of decrease . In 1851 , the average number of persons in each family in England was 4.83 , and in 1871 it had fallen to 4.41 . In the United States the average number of persons to a family was , in 1850 , 5.56 ; in 1860 , 5.28 , and in 1870 , 5.09 . The official digest from which we have quoted affords some instructive data for comparing the relative density of the population of London and that of New-York . As we have frequently pointed out in these columns , the overcrowded condition of the dwellings on this island is without precedent in this or any other country . There are in New-York 14.72 persons to each dwelling . The American cities which come nearest to this figure are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati , 8.81 ; Brooklyn , 8.64 ; Lawrence , Mass. , 8.40 ; Jersey City , 8.37 , and Worcester , Mass. , 8.35 . In the British metropolis there are 417,767 inhabited houses to a population of 3,254 , - 260 , being in the proportion of 7.79 persons to each dwelling . With an average density of population which is exceeded by nine large citic6 of this Union , Loudon has no separate districts - where the poor are huddled into so small compass as they are in several of the wards of New-York . There are six wards in this City in which there are upward of twenty persons to each dwelling . These are the Fourth , with 24.61 persons intlach house ; the Seventeenth , with 24.05 ; the Tenth , with 21.90 ; the Sixth , with 21.52 ; the First , with 21.05 , andthe Eleventh , with 20.81 . In the worst district of London , St. Giles , the proportion of persons to each inhabited house is only 11.73 , and in the district which ranks next  --  Westminster , namely  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are but live wards in NowYork  --  the Second , the Third , the Twelfth , the Fifteenth , and the Twenty-second  --  in which the ratio is so low as this , and in the first two of these the sparsity of population is solely due to the necessities of warehouse accommodation . The wonder with which we regard the exceedingly low death-rate of the British metropolis , as compared with that of our large cities , is somewhat diminished in view of facts like these . The inevitably fatal results of a slight rise of temperature in NewYork become intelligible when we remember how impossible it is to keep little children from being first enervated and then poisoned by the foul and heated atmosphere of overcrowded tenements . We must find . some means of spreading our population over a larger area before we can have either a clean or a healthy City , and before either the moral or the political life of New-York will be susceptible of lasting improvement . All these things are closely related , as most people know . The difficulty is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true measure of the social and political dangers whose existence is proved by such figures as we have quoted .
