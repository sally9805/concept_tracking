FRENCH AND GERMAN. * By far the cleverest and most entertaining book that we have to notice this month is Sardou 's new play , Rabagas . The author is a well-known and experienced playwright , who has already lashed the follies and extravagances of the Second Empire with a dramatic success and a lack of moral improvement in his victims that might well make reformers despair if they were not generally made of very stern stuff , and did not go on their way in ignorance of the latest pieces of the theatres . In this play he strikes at higher prey than frivolous wearers of silks and satins , namely , at examples of the political levity of the French . He turns to ridicule both l*mile Ollivier and Gambetta , while many less known Frenchmen may well feel their cheeks burning as they read his satire of their frenzies . It is simply the story of a turncoat , Rabagas , who is tempted from the position of demagogue by cheap bribes and gross flattery , who finds himself tricked by other machinations , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good by to those who have ousted him at the close of the play , announces that he intends to depart from Monaco , where the scene is laid , for the only country where talents like his are duly valued ; they all ask him what country he means . He replies , " France , " and with this last epigram the curtain drops . Running through the play is a little love-story that probably adds to the interest when it is acted , though to the reader it is of no great importance . We have not space enough to quote half of the epigrams that the play contains , or to do more than call the reader 's notice to the Polish general who is to head the insurrection , and who has three thousand decorations but not a change of linen , and who , at the entrance of the police , hides under a table . The whole comedy is full of the keenest satire . In the history of the stage this piece , * All books mentioned in this section may be had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . Rabagas .

The English stage is in about as prosperous a condition as sculpture is in Washington ; in Germany it is better , but in France alone does the drama really exist . That it will languish there without government aid seems certain , but the last few years , at any rate , have produced rich fruits . This , for obvious reasons , is almost the only political play of the day in France ; but the author brings to it the experience of many years , during which he has profited by intelligent criticism and keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , with due humility , to posterity . In fiction we have found but little that is new , and less that is good . Inveterate readers , whose minds are seared by a long course of French novels , may perhaps read Adolphe Joanne 's Albert Fleurier . It is a novel belonging decidedly to the second class , but , on this very account it serves to show , by the care with which details are managed , the smoothness of the dialogue , the lack of creaking in the machinery of the plot , how much such respect on the part of the author for the reader is valued among a certain people which it is the fashion nowadays to decry for their frivolity . To the careful student of literature such novels are of importance , as are galleries of the paintings of second-rate men to the student of art , but no one wishes to write stories that may serve as literary warnings . No one feels flattered at being called an excellent example of mediocrity , one would rather be a first-rate villain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that George Sand has written another novel , Francia , which is told with all of that author 's admirable limpidity , as simply , smoothly , and clearly as if it had been all done at one breath . Whether the breath were worth taking is another question . Those who ignore what English readers would call , with the utmost mildness , lack of good taste , or who explain their fondness for such novels by alleged deep-seated psychological interest , will find the story readable , others will not . The volume contains a charming proverbe , as clever as need be . In poetry there is Victor Hugo 's new book , L'Anne'e Terrible . It is not easy to read it with due reverence . The author 's bombast , ranting declamation , noisy selfcomplacency , and rhyming billingsgate demand in the reader very ardent faith and Recent Literature . // Art . a great aversion to the ludicrous before he can admire the poem .

The book contains four short martial tales , praising highly the military valor of France . They THE establishment of Art Museums in New York and Boston constitutes , let us hope , the first step in the direction of a satisfactory development of the fine arts in this country . Among these it is to painting that we have probably to look for the greatest achievements in the approach . ing century . The history of this art in America has been a peculiar one . There are not wanting instances of genius bursting up spontaneously from the rugged soil of the Colonies or the early States ; the sense of beauty , and the instinct to express its perceptions pictorially , exist abundantly among 371 are of no special merit . The Introduction , in which he takes occasion to explain the military decay of his country , contains some intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there devoted himself to the study of the German nation . He has embodied his results in a volume called L'Allemagne en 1871 . He is not favorably impressed by what he saw . The Germans seem to him to lack polish , as well as more important virtues . He says that the nation has made no advance since the first century of our era . Nowhere , to our knowledge , has there been such an exhibition of poor taste , of petty spite , as in this book ; it is very much what the once notorious Belle Jloyd might have written seven years ago about the North . With all its gross faults , it contains , however , some sparks of truth . Even the prejudiced enemy may see glar. ing faults . Turning to the much.abused Germans , we find Vischer 's Der Krieg und die Kunste , a singularly German treatment of war , inspired by a desire to catalogue the effects it has had upon all the fine arts . For instance , the Iliad is a great poem ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good paintings of battles , etc. , etc . The same spirit , the scoffer would say , might persuade one to write about the lesthetical side of the recent hot weather , of railroad accidents , horse-cars , etc. , but it is not likely that an American would do it . ART , us . But none of our native painters have been able to find nourishment for their artistic faculties in this hemisphere . Europe draws them like a magnet ; and West and Copley are regularly included in the British school of the last century . Stuart is in reality an English painter ; and it is impossible to suppose that Allston could have left us the riches he did , without long and i*enewed foreign study . Those Who stand highest in our traditions , then , belong virtually to the art of other lands . Nor have we yet succeeded in obviating this anomalous condition . The men of the most aspiring // 372 and delicate genius still escape to France , 6r England , or Italy , as of old . Our academies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best minds ; and there is no doubt that increased facilities for instruction in technicalities will greatly assist in checking this exodus of genius . But here is not the solution of the difficulty . Neither academies nor museums alone can wholly bring about the desired change , though both can assist , and the latter especially . It is not that our artists refuse to stay with us , if we but give them the slightest encouragement . On the contrary , we believe there are many instances of painters who , pecuniary necessities apart , would prefer to dedicate their art to the honor of their own country , and of men who remain here at the expense of their better artistic possibilities abroad . But they want a social atmosphere favorable to artistic growth , and a solid and appreciative support . The avenues to the future greatness in art of this country must be paved with gold . Wealth is indeed already scattered before the advancing divinity , but not always wisely . Government patronage , in a country where the people profess to govern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But unfortunately " the people " are content to pay a great deal for the privilege of sounding again and again this watchword , and leave the governing power meantime to expend vast sums upon works which , by unworthy representation , rather injure the aspect of art , the acquisition of anything valuable being chiefly a matter of chance . It is therefore to co-operative agency that we have to look for help . Under this head fall the new Museums of Art . These institutions are calculated to organize wealth and taste in the community , and thus , while gathering materials for the artist 's study , to engage the popular interest , thereby stimulating such general movements as can alor* insure the advancement of painting to a thorough success in this country , . The New York Metropolitan Museum has brought together an extremely useful gallery of pictures . The Boston Museum of Fine Arts , on the other hand , has recently put on exhibition at the Athen*um a collection embracing something over five hundred objects of art , the . chief strength of which lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of sculpture , including under this term carved wooden furniture and some fine Italian medals of the fifteenth September , century , as well as a brief series of plastercasts from reliefs in marble by several Italian sculptors , from Orcagna to Benvenuto Cellini . About a half-dozen only of pictures are displayed . Thus it will be seen that the Boston Museum begins its work with materials which will make its influence upon pahAing rather more indirect than that of the Metropolitan Museum . But it has secured , in the pottery from Cyprus , and the admirable loan collection from T. G. Appleton , Esq. , of Gr*co-Italian fictile vases , objects which it *jll perhaps be more difficult to obtain hereafter ; while , with proper means and due effort , opportunities will no doubt be found to gradually render complete the pictorial department . In its present state , however , the collection contains illustrations greater in variety than that of the Metropolitan Museum , and if not so complete in respect of painting , it will still justify the chairman of the committee on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microcosm , well calculated to teach the visitor something of the character and quality of the art-industry of many nations during a long period of the world 's history . " The Appleton collection exhibits , besides three small vases from the prehistoric inhabitants of Southern Italy , very perfect and interesting amphor*e , together with a variety of mixers , pitchers , saucers , and perfume-bottles , from the four epochs of the art interveningbetween the prehistoric period and the first century before Christ . The trustees are also fortunate in the possession of a large Gobelin tapestry executed in the seventeenth century . The design represents France crowned by victory , and , with its gorgeous scarlet and indigo blue melting through the somewhat faded fabric , and its border of flowers and fruits , through the maze of which peeps an occasional parrot , will open to the uninitiated eye a pleasurable view into this kind of artistic activity . At last , after long waiting , Ward 's statue of Shakespeare has been set up in the New York Central Park , and it is time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how near the artist has come to doing what he set out to do , to measure the degree in which - the work is likely to satisfy the world , ready enough and willing , no doubt , to see Shakespeare embodied , if it might be , but evidently unwilling to commit herself to an almost impossible experiment . At last , however , here it is ; and young America , with the enthusiasm , the consciousness of strength , and the rashness that belong to // youth , has done and dared the dangerous task , and has crowned Shakespeare with high festival in his proudest public place , before France , or Germany , or even England has so much as begun to talk about a statue to him . No doubt , the purpose did the country honor , and , fortunately for us all , those whose earnest love for Shakespeare gave us the statue , found a man to make it as earnest as themselves . Mr. Ward 's previous works had not very clearly pointed him out as the man best fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work had been not at all " ideal , " but decidedly " realistic . " His first statue - that of Simon Kenton , a figure offered , just before the outbreak of the war , to the legislature of his native State of Ohio for a place in the rotunda of the capitol , and not accepted in that moment of confusion and huge war appropriations - was the first statue made by an American that gave piimise of a brighter day . It embodied his Western feeling for the pioneer ; not the pioneer of Cooper and the sentimentalists , but the real pioneer whom Ward had seen and loved , to whose race he belonged . In its intention it was worthy to be placed by the side of the St. George of Donatello : it was as simple , as direct , as manly as that . It had not the ideal charm , nor the trace of that influence that all the Italian Renaissance work borrowed from the air in which it grew , but it was marked with high-breeding in its simplicity and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the State of Ohio can not afford to let such a statue , so produced , remain forever an unfulfilled possibility . " The Freedman " was Ward 's first attempt at an ideal figure , and was a disappointment to those who had not discriminated . " The Freedman " is well modelled , and the motive is expressed with sufficient clearness , but perhaps it would not be in the power of any sculptor to express that particular motive with simplicity . If Ward had been asked to make a statue of a particular negro doing a certain thing , we believe no man in our day would have been likely to perform the task better than he . But this figure is not real , it is an allegory , and Ward showed in it , what he has since showed in his " Genius of Insurance , " that the making of allegories is not what he was born for . But , then , we may safely ask , who in our time could have done it better ? To embody an allegory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong 373 faith ; it never has been done , and never can be done , to order . Ward only failed where almost every man since the fifteenth century has failed . We wish he had not tried , and we wish too that there were some redemption in his failure . Then came the " Soldier of the Seventh Regiment " ; and that being a subj&amp;ct to kill the ideal in any man 's mind , if once it had entered it , Ward made little of it beyond a good-looking young man , the type of a regiment of goodlooking men . Made as it was , however , just at the close of the war , one i'aturally looked in it for a type of something more heroic , and looked for what Ward probably never tried to put there . A Joseph Curtis , a Winthrop , a Lowell , a Shaw , either one of these splendid types of the part played in the war by the young men of America , would have been a worthier subject , and might have produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . We do not reckon it a piece of good fortune for Mr. Ward that this work of his has been set up in the Central Park . With the exhibition , in the plaster , of the " Indian Hunter , " Ward 's fame may be said to have become national . Up to this time he had produced nothing that could give him a place apart . Few people out of the circle of his friends had ever seen the " Simon Kenton , " and , with all its merit , that was a youthful work , more valuable for the promise in it than for the performance . But the " Indian Hunter " was ripe fruit . Evidently , the man that made it was one of those that knew . It met all demands , and was the ideal in reality . The poet was pleased , the matter-of-fact man content , the child excited . Here was the living Indian of the West brought before us by one who had known him intimately , and behold - be was the Indian of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indian Hunter ' * belongs to Ward and nature . We have seen it stated somewhere that " the pose is said to be borrowed . " We do not think it just to a man like Ward to make such an assertion in such a way . Either say outright who charges that the pose is borrowed , and from what it is borrowed , or , say nothing . Mr. Ward , who is frankness itself , and , as everybody who knows him knows , very candid in talk about his own work , never hinted at any other figure as having suggested his statue ; and without ' pretending to an exhaustive knowledge of the world of art , we will venture to deny that there is any such figure in existence . // Art . Mr. Ward has never been in Europe , and as our collections of casts from the antique sculpture - for we have no originals - include only the famous statues , where could he have found an original that with his intimate knowledge of Indians would have seemed to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Indian Hunter , " being precisely the attitude which Ward had himself seen the Indians take in hunting. , belongs to his statue by right , and we are very sure its originality will never be seriously questioned . The same , too , with the muscles , which , we are told , are not Indian muscles . But ought not the work of an earnest , studious man , which represents a subject he is familiar with by actual experience , and in which he takes a lively interest , to be trusted rather than the criticism of persons who do not profess to have had his opportunities , and who have not the motive and the cue that he had , to hold the mirror up to nature ? Certain it is , that the " Indian Hunter " is full of life and purpose , and in all sincerity , having seen whatever has been done by the men of our time , we know not one that could bear away the palm from it for elegance , for truth , for fire , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shake . speare would be roughly handled , for , in truth , what subject could be chosen outside the range of the so-called sacred subjects , that should challenge like this ? And the difficulty is not far to seek ; it shows itself as soon as the subject is named . Is it the ideal Shakespeare or the real Shakespeare that the artist is to give us ? Is it the ideal author of the body of poetry we call " Shakespeare , " or is it the native of Stratford , William Shakespeare by name , upon whom , for lack of a better , we have fathered all this splendid progeny ? Now , those who had studied Ward 's work from the beginning ought to have known that the ideal Shakespeare was beyond his reach , as it was beyond the reach of any man that lives , or of any man that ever did live . The limited service Ward tried to render us was this : to make , by the aid of the Stratford bust , the Chandos portrait , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Shakespeare ,  --  a figure upon which it might be agreeable to look , and looking , conjure up all that is connected in our minds with that name , all that we know of the plays and poems by our own experience ; a statue that should resemble the September , real man Shakespeare , who , if he did not himself write all that is set down to him , wrote some of it , and was the friend of the best men of his time , and was at least reckoned worthy , by one of the wisest and greatest among his companions , of words so warm and tender as these : " I did love the man , and dd honor his memory on this side idolatry as much as any . " It seems to us that W4rd has well accompli*shed what he set out to do ; and if he has felt , as no doubt he has , and makes us feel too , the limitations of his own nature , we must not make it a point against him : another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should have been no better off . We are told that the statue is six and a half of its heads in height ; and that this ratio would have " made an old Greek faint " ; and another writer , or , as is most likely , the same writer in another place , makes the statement that Mr. Ward 's statue is six and a half heads in length , while the " Apollo Belvedere " is eight , and adds : " It is difficult to conceive what purpose the artist could have had in view in this radical departure from all received canons of proportion , when he could have had no knowledge of his original to warrant it . " Now it would be easy to show that the best authorities are in dispute as to the whole subject of the proportions of the human figure ; that though there was , most likely , some law which the Greeks , whether working in Greece or in Italy , followed in making their statues , yet we do not know what the law was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most careful measurements of the famous statues . The measurements themselves vary , and even those statues whose height is the same vary materially in the proportions of the other divisions of the body . Vitruvius , it is true , tells us that the figure , according to the famous canon of the sculptor Polycletus , now lost , was eight heads high , yet the actual statues all fall short of that in measurement . Vitruvius , who was an architect and knew nothing practically of sculpture , gives a very confused account of the canon , and as to measuring by the head , any one who attempts it practically will acknowledge how impossible it is to obtain accuracy . Beside , even if the ancients as a rule followed this canon of Polycletus , yet there were orthodox and heterodox ; and several sculptors - Lysippus chief among them - tried his hand at improving upon it . The tendency in the developement of art seems // Art . to have been , to lengthen the lower limbs , and it is to be observed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Renaissance in France and Italy . But we see it plainly enough in the " Apollo Belvedere , " a late Roman work made of Carrara marble in the time of Nero , though probably by a Greek sculptor , in the " Huntress Diana " of the Louvre , and in the lately discovered " Athlete using the Strigil " by Lysippus , now in the Vatican . Now with all this confusion , uncertainty , and disagreement , it is going out of the way to take Mr. Vard to task for not obeying a law whose terms no one knows , and by which , even as guessed at , or interpreted , sculptors of our day are not bound , and do not pretend to be bound . But the objection seems downright silly when we reflect that Ward had not the intention to make an ideally perfect human figure , but a characteristic human one , and that he must have taken the head - all he had - for a scale and standard of the body , and made the body such a one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not wish to take the attitude of a champion of Ward , whose work is his best defence . But justice to him can only be done by trying to find out what was his intention in any particular work , what seems to be his aim in his work generally , and then looking searchingly to discover how near he has hit his mark . All who know the private history of this statue of Shakespeare know that Ward has given the best study he is capable of to reconciling the known portraits , and that he believes in the German mask as a veritable mask taken from the dead face of Shakespeare . Now when he came to model this head , he must put it upon a trunk and legs that seemed to him made to support it and be controlled by it ; probably it never entered into his mind to compare it with the Apollo , or the Faun , or the Antinous , or to apply to it any scale whatever but the scale of proportions he always carries in his eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reason , carries his own . He tried to make the parts of his figure correspond to each other , and it is whether or not he has succeeded in doing this that we must question , not whether he has put an Apollo into doublet and hose . 37* Certainly , the statue is not free from a suspicion that the sculptor saw too much of Edwin Booth while modelling the figure , and fixing its attitude . Probably it is not well that it should remind us of Hamlet , as he enters , reading . But , after seeing the statue many times , and studying it long , we do not find this impression gaining ground. ; it can not last when our regards are constantly drawn to the head , where all traces of any known person are quite lost in the individual characteristics that make up Mr. Ward 's " Shakespeare . " The drapery is well managed on the whole , though we could have wished that the cloak had not been caught up on the arm , but suffered to hang as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pose , which gives the ever so slightly theatrical look to the figure . But drapery has , once or twice , troubled Mr. Ward . The " Indian Hunter " should in a strict adherence to facts have been stark naked ; the original model was so , for Mr. Ward , and others who know Indians as well as he , never saw an Indian hunting in any other state than naked ; but a fear of prudes , male and female , made him present the Indian with the fur fig-leaf which at present covers his loins . However , the fur fig-leaf is perhaps better than a tin one , and we suppose it must have come to that . In the " Seventh Regiment Soldier , " too , there seemed no good reason for turning up the corner of the overcoat skirt , and there was no reason but the conventional advice of somebody to break the lines a little , no matter whether logically or not . And now we have this Elizabethan cloak , which seems to have been as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's : neither of them knows what to do with it . But , after all these drawbacks , there remains to us in this statue an impression of so much manliness , sincerity , and right . thinking in the sculptor of it , and of so much beauty and strength in the lines and masses , of so much lightness in the poise , with the pleasant sense , not of motion , but of a motion arrested and soon to begin again , we can not but acknowledge that the excellences of the work outweigh its faults by far , and that it must be long before any sculptor will give us a more satisfactory Shakespeare than this of Ward's. // Music . September , MUSIC . AT last the Jubilee is over . The monster whose coming v*as heralded some m*ths ago by such portentous rumblings in and about the Hub , and whose fitful career was anxiously followed by the eyes and ears of so many thousands , has in its turn become a thing of the past . Its career has been at times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oppressive one . But if the monster came in like a lion , it certainly went out like the mildest of lambs and even in its leonine days of vigorous youth , its roar was neither so terrible nor so lion-like as thosewho like roaring might have desired . It lacked the very vital principle of success , namely , unity of purpose . Got up as a business enterprise by a company , many of whom were little conversant with and even little interested in music , the " World 's Peace Jubilee " was accepted by the public as a distinctly musical festival . The national or international phaseof it , which , in the end , turned out to be the most interesting part of the whole , was at the outset thoroughly mistrusted by ninety-nine people out of a hundred and however sincere Mr. Gilmore may have been in making it , to the best of his abilities , a genuinely international affair , which sincerity we see no reason to doubt , the " World 's Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival " was considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the circumstances as good a name as any other . As the Jubilee stood face to face with the public , the musical part of it held the first place . We fully believe that the projectors and promoters of the affair did their best , according to their lights , to make the musical part of it as good and as generally enjoyable as possible , and that the higher musical education of the mass of our people was one of their objects . After dispassionately looking back upon the whole Festival , we feel less and less inclined to quarrel with the fact that it was , after all , principally a business enterprise . In a young , democratic country like ours , these speculations in art , or , as Berlioz says , ces manages de convenance en/re Z'art et la barse indivstnie , are inevitable . Art in any shape can nowhere live without money , and in a country where the tendencies are strongly utilitarian , and where four fifths of the people are , at the very best , only willing * take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onlynegatively to encourage her by not running her down with their railroads and steamboats , or grinding her to atoms between the cog-wheels of their factories , we poor art-lovers and artists should only be too thankful when men who have the means think it worth their while to invest in art-stock instead of in railway bonds ; and although the manner in which they handle our poor goddess is at times rough and even insulting , we must believe that they mean her no harm , and can only wish that , even in our own interest , they found her a more paying speculation . There was a deal of humbug about the whole affair , to be sure ; butall the musical enterprises ever set on foot in this country that have not been composed at least of one third part humbug , could be written down with a swan-quill on a sheet of ladies ' note-paper . We think the Jubilee , on the whole , a failure , as whatever results were attained were vastly disproportionate to the means employed . We have hinted that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose in the whole scheme , The thing tried to be too many things at once . It tried to combine a musical festival with a sort of all-the-world 's Fourth-of-July ; even the musical part of it was with too indefinite an artistic purpose . The programmes were from the first rather generally conciliatory than guided by any artistic principle , either good or bad ; there was a want of backbone about the musical management of the whole . One of the most amiable features of the Festival was the great expenditure , both of pains and money , lavished on the production of Handel 's " Israel in Egypt , " even in the face of a certainty that the oratorio would be a dead l ) ecuniary loss . So far from thinking that a whole day was given up to the performance of a great classic work merely " to lend respectability to the affair , " as some people imagine , we believe that the committee were too well impressed with the " respectability " of the whole Festival to think for a moment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its reputation from scandal . We think rather that the production of " Israel " sprang from an honest de // sire to conciliate a taste that was known to exist in our more musically cultivated cities , and which , if the committee did not sympathize with , they at least respected and looked up to . The importance given to Verdi 's Anvil Chorus was a like attempt to conciliate a taste of a different order , which , judging from the experience furnished by the previous Jubilee in 1869 , was a strongly predominating one . We take " Israel in Egypt " and the Anvil Chorus as the two opposite magnetic poles of the Jubilee . What one attracted the other repelled . The two elements were essentially antagonistic , and could not be made to harmonize . The other choral portions of the programmes ranged themselves on a scale of attractiveness between these two points . The most interesting as well as the most successful part of the Jubilee was the appearance of the French , English , and German bands . Apart from the musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them and the audience was in itself something worth witnessing . This was particularly noticeable in the reception of the English band . The whole audience seemed to welcome them as brothers and kinsmen ; and when at last they responded to the continued applause with the " Star-spangled Banner , " which was in turn answered by " Auld Lang Syne , " a feeling came over all present deeper than that to be roused even by the noblest music . Considered musically , the French band was the most artistic . The only defect noticeable in their playing was one which we are too ignorant of the capacities of wind-instruments to know whether to attribute to the natural , unavoidable imperfections in the instruments themselves , or to some shortcoming in the players . This was a certain exaggerated , almost gasping sforzando , which at times recalled the asthmatic crescendo and diminuendo of a harmonica . As their playing was in other respects so perfect , we are inclined to think that this was the unavoidable result of trying to force wind-instruments out of their proper use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , to imitate the peculiar stirring accent of the strings when strongly attacked by the bow . The Germans played with great fire and precision , but in loud passages they greatly overblew their instruments , especially their low brass , which made the quality of tone coarse and blaring , and many of those deli37 7* cate effects of light and shade so xoticeable in the other bands were wanting in their playing . There was a stirring , martial , warlike spirit in their playing which was well in accordance with our ideas of the Prussian Army ; and they even played Strauss waltzes as if they were marching to battle . So long as they played military music , this was all well enough and there was something characteristic in it ; but their renderings of other music were generally coarse both in conception and execution , the opening chords of the Egmont Overture , for instance , sounded as if they were trying to blow down the walls of Jericho . The man with the cymbals was in particular a terrible fellow , and seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overture by the Germans was in strong contrast with the playing of some selections from " Lohengrin " by the Frenchmen , which shortly followed it . This was almost the perfection of playing , never lacking life or emphasis ; yet throughout , even in the ball-music ( which , by the way , was taken in a most furiously rapid tempo ) , full of delicate lights and shades , and in fine , full , unforced tones . One of the best bits of playing during the Festival was the performance of the Semiramide Overture by the English band , which was very spirited and full of finely marked contrasts . The double-tonguing of the clarinets , in the allegro was , indeed , something marvellous . At times the tempo , especially the accelerando at the end , smacked rather more of the band-master than of the cultivated orchestra-conductor ; but this , after all , is a matter of taste , and from all accounts Rossini himself was not averse to a little exaggeration of " effects " now and then by way of spice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducting . There was a demoniac , electric/e ne sais quoi about the man that was peculiarly fascinating . 1-us command over the orchestra was simply wonderful ; they were like an instrument with him , and he played upon the men under his bdton just as much as he played upon the violin in his hands . Hearing his waltzes led by himself , after having heard them played by Thomas 's orchestra , was like hearing our old friend of the ball-room , Mr. J. S. Knight , play them , after the matter-of-fact strumming of some school-girl . The ingenious person who first hit upon the idea of having piano-forte solos in the Coliseum , may safely lay claim to a certain amount of not unamusing originality . Of // Music . the three pianists who performed , we most sincerely pity Madame Goddard , and regret that she should have been led into playing on such an occasion , or have been in any way associated with such pianists as Herr Bendel or Mr. WehlL Really fine pianists who are at the same time conscientious artists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetness wasted on the desert air . As for Herr Bendel , be seems to have for once got into the right place . He is well known in Germany as what a Western critic once called , not infelicitously , " a first-class ivory-thumper , " and the Coliseum gave him ample opportunity of showing off his powers to advantage . We heard him some three years ago in Berlin play Weber 's C'oncertstiick in a most disconcertingly astounding manner ; and comparing his recent performances at the Jubilee with his playing then in a room of more limited dimensions , we have come to the conclusion that he is one of those virtuosi to whose playing " distance lends enchantment . " We would not by any means say " the farther off the better , " but we think that what Mr. Wegg calls the " mellerin ' " influence of a reasonable distance , say half the length of the Coliseum , might always be grateful to the ears of his audience . The first time we heard Mr. Wehli , several years ago , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the variety theatre , and not the concert-room , and we find that that opinion strengthens with time . Another of the mistakes of the Jubilee was Madame Rudersdorff 's singing . She simply could not fill the house with her voice , and she was compelled to force her tones until her singing became a positive screech . As with Madame Goddard , it was only painful to see such a genuine and accomplished artist , in the highest sense of the word , placed in such a false position . Madame PeschkaLeutner 's singing was in every way a charming success . Her rich , telling voice easily penetrated every part of the building , so that little even of her most rapid passage-work was lost by anybody . But the most significant thing in the whole Jubilee was that the very point that was trumpeted forth in all the announcements as the greatest musical attraction , the one element that was to have made a " Peace Jubilee " grander and more imposing than all other musical festivals , turned out to be the thing of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Septemker , This was the monstrous size of the whole thing . In this last Jubilee , as in the previous one , the mass of singers had to be distributed over so large a space , that any precision of attack was physically impossible ; there was not and could not be any clearly defined outline to the singing , but everything was blurred and indistinct . Pieces with little melodic outline , such as the chorals and psalm-tunes , suffered least from this , but even here the effect was not so good as when similar pieces were peformed at the Handel and Haydn triennial festivals by an incomparably smaller chorus in a smaller hall . This vagueness of outline was so great , that it was wellnigh impossible to judge of the merits of a composition heard then for the first time . One thing sounded about like another . Theh again , it is impossible to keep so large an audience quiet , and the constant running up and down stairs , the walking in the corridors , and the talking and even whispering of so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music from having its full effect . And now a word as to the advisability of jubilees of this sort from a purely musical and educational point of view . First , as to the good they do . It may be safely said that fully half of the members of the chorus would never have become acquainted with much of the better class of choral music but for these festivals . The months spent in careful rehearsal of even one Bach choral , and a few Handel , Haydn , and Mendelssohn choruses , can not fail to be of great benefit to a large class of music-lovers who would otherwise in all probability never have studied anything better than common choir psalmody or poor street ballads . The performances of the foreign bands were no doubt of benefit , and we hope to see some consequent improvement in our own bands in future . So far , good . But , on the other hand , great harm is done by creating in the general public an unnatural and perverted appetite for what is merely big , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity rather than an appreciation of quality . Even though a large mass of the public probably heard fine specimens of classic music for the first time on coming to the Jubilee , the performance of the music was , from the nature of things , so vaguely imperfect and ineffective that little if any real good can be hoped from their making its acquaintance in such a manner . Enterprises like // Science . the Jubilee are only pardonable on the supposition of a very low degree of general musical culture in the country , and we think that the small success of the last one , as compared with the Festival in 1869 , shows that our people have already made great advance in musical culture . We are not prepared to deny that the first Jubilee may have been an important agent in educating them up to this point . If it was , it certainly did a good work , and Mr. Gilmore should now be content to repose on his fairly earned laurels . But for the future it must be borne in mind that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . S C I E N C E. IN 1835 Auguste Comte observed that there will probably never be any such thing as a science of sidereal astronomy ; for without measuring the distances of the stare and ascertaining their actual motions , we can not even be sure that the law of gravitation prevails beyond the limits of our solar system ; and up to 1835 all attempts at measuring stellar distances had proved abortive . In less than four years , however , the first step was taken toward founding a science of stellar astronomy , when Bessel ascertained the distance of the star 6i Cygni . The obstacles which he overcame were such as might well have seemed insurmountable , and it is but slowly and with uncertain steps that astronomers have been able to extend his researches . The measurement of the distance of 6i Cygni - the nearest star in the northern heavens - was indeed followed by the determination of its real transverse motion , which was found to amount to about fourteen hundred and fifty millions of miles per annum , or about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in reality tells us next to nothing concerning the structure of the sidereal system , and the hosts of similar facts which we need are extremely hard to gather . Without knowing the distances of the stars , we can not translate their apparent motions into their real motions ; and of the five thousand eight hundred and fifty lucid stars which can be seen by the naked eye , there are not more than twenty of which we have as yet been able to estimate the distance , while in only ten or eleven cases has the distance been satisfactorily determined . In the next place , even when we have obtained the amount of a star 's real transverse motion , as in the case of 6i Cygni , we have got but half-way toward a knowledge of its total actual motion . For obviously the star 's apparent transv*se motion may be due either to a real motion which is at right angles to the line joining the earth and the star , or - which must be much oftener the case - it will be due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same line . In the latter case we can ascertain but one of the elements of the diagonal motion , that , namely , which may be called the thwartmotion . The other element , namely , the motion towards the earth or away from it , can not of course be determined by observation , as it does not affect the star 's apparent motion . When a railway-train at a long distance is directly approaching us , it has no apparent motion , it seems to stand still ; and if it is approaching us diagonally , all that part of its motion which is britiging it nearer to us is subtracted from the apparent motion it would have if viewed from a point at right angles to the track upon which it is running . In short , it is only thwart-motion which can make any object directly inform our eyes that it is changing its place . This statement , however , is not rigorously correct . If a train is coming directly toward us as we stand in the depot , its approach is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partly from the increased size of its image upon the retina . When we look at the stars , however , we do not have these helps to our vision . If a given star is coming straight toward us at the rate of forty miles per second , a comparison with neighboring stars will not help us at such an enormous distance . And , as for intensified retinal impression , if a star were to move toward 379* // Science . us at this rate of speed , a thousand years would hardly suffice to make an alteration of two per cent in its brilliancy . To measure the rate of direct ap*sroach or recession of a star would , therefore , seem to be forever impossible . And as this element of direct approach or recession must enter into the motion of all stars whatever save the few which may be supposed to move precisely at right angles with reference to the earth 's position , it would appear to become questionable whether we can ever get any available knowledge of the behavior of the bodies constituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , to be justified in his bold assertion , that we are never to have a science of stellar astronomy . But it is rash to seek to set limits to the possibilities of human achievement . Here , from the quarter least expected , a ray of the needed light has been shed upon this most difficult problem . As the doe , in the old fable , keeping her sound eye landward , was at last shot by archers passing in a boat , so Nature has here been forced to render up her secret in the most unlooked for way . Through the amazing results obtained by spectrum analysis it has turned out that our heavier difficulty has become the lighter one , and that the direct approach or recession of a star is actually easier to measure than its thwart-motion ! Properly to exhibit the character of this most brilliant discovery , we must beg leave to recall to the reader a few considerations of which he may not otherwise bethink himself . If the waves of a river , blown by the wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is swimming , it is obvious that the white crests of any two consecutive waves will seem to the swimmer to follow each other more slowly than would be the case if he were swimming in a direction parallel to the direction of the wave-fronts while , if he were swimming in a direction contrary to the motion of the waves , the crests would pass him with an apparent increase of speed . And manifestly , the more rapidly the waves appeared to pass , the narrower would the waves seem to be ; and the slower the waves , the broader would they seem from crest to crest . Now the case is essentially the same whether the waves in question be those of a river , or those atmospheric waves which are known as sound , or those molecular waves which are known as light . Sound-waves travel , of course , much faster than the waves of water , September , namely , twelve hundred feet per second . Yet if from any source a sound of uniform pitch be emitted , the pitch of the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recedes from the source of the sound , provided his rate of movement bears some appreciable ratio to the speed of the sound-waves . It is thus that when a railway-train is rapidly approaching us , its steam-whistle , though mainfaining a uniform pitch , *yet seems to sink by a fifth or an octave . In the case of a star moving directly toward us or away from us , the same principle holds good ; yet it would seem impossible that the motion of a star , however rapid , could bear any appreciable proportion to the enormous velocity of light . A speed of forty miles per second , when compared with the speed of light , is as that of a snail to that of an express-train . Nevertheless , when we consider the inn*r structure of a ray of light , we find that assistance is obtainable from this quarter . It was some time since suggested by M. Doppler , that the color of a star may depend upon its motion . If a star can be supposed to approach us so swiftly that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce upon our retinas the effect of orange light , and so on through the spectrum , then the star 's change of color , resulting from the loss of its red rays , will afford an index of the rate of speed at which it is nearing us . But this reasoning is fallacious , because it loses sight of an essential fact . Below the extreme red rays of the spectrum , there are numberless dark rays , with wave-lengths greater than are cognizable by our retinas . Obviously the general shortening of wavelengths occasioned by the star 's swift approach would so shorten these dark waves as to enable them to produce in us the sensation of red light , so that the color of the star would remain unaltered . Ar , d in the case of a receding star the result would be the same , since the lengthening of the waves answering to dark rays above the violet end of the spectrum would keep up the supply of the violet portion of the star 's light . We cite this erroneous suggestion of M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason of its very erroneousness , and because the reader , having duly considered it , will the better understand the ground upon which rests Mr. Huggins 's magnificent discovery . Though it is not true that the color of a distant object will change with its motion towards or // Science . away from the observer , it nevertheless happens that the lines of the spectrum cast by the object will be shifted in position as the object draws near or recedes . Here , a , s Mr. Proctor observes , in his lately published volume of " Essays on Astronomy , " we have at once a most delicate means of detecting stellar movements of approach or recession . If in the spectrum of a star we can see a recognizable group of lines , or a line recognizable by its strength , and if in any way we can prove that this line does not hold the exact position which it has in the solar spectrum , then the change of position must be looked upon as due to the star 's motion towards or from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces no change whatever in the star 's color , brings all the lines into new positions , and any one line , marked enough for ready examination , suffices as well as a hundred to determine the existence of such a change . " The rapid approach of a star , causing a general diminishing of wave-lengths , shifts tho lines upward toward the violet end of the spectrum ; while when the star is swiftly receding , the lines are shifted down toward the red end . Four years ago Mr. Huggins , working upon these general principles , found that the F line in the spectrum of Sirius was displaced downwards , being removed by about one two hundred and fiftieth of an inch from the corresponding line in the spectrum of hydrogen . From this accurately measured displacement Mr. Huggins was enabled to calculate a recession of rather more than forty-one miles p*r second ; which leads to the result , after taking into account the earth 's own motions , that Sirius is travelling away from us at the rate of twenty and five tenths niles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us , but diagonally , and as this is one of the few stars whose distance has been measured , we are able also to calculate its 381 transverse motion ; so that , as a final result , we find that the star is moving through space in a given direction at the rate of thirty-three miles per second . In one case , then , the problem of stellar motion was solved by Mr. Huggins 's discovery of i868 . But during the present year Mr. Huggins has obtained a large number of striking facts by this same ingenious method of research . He finds , for example , that Arcturus is approaching us at the rate of fifty miles per second , with a thwart-motion of about the same speed . And , having with , equal success measured the motions of many other stars , he observes a general tendency among the stars in one portion of the heavens to approach the solar system , while in the oppos4te quarter the stars are receding from us . Moreover , the results obtained by Mr. Huggins thr*v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , it is shown that five stars in the constellatioa of the Great Bear are all receding from the solar system at the common rate of thirty miles per second . In view of these results , - obtained by attacking the great problem upon what was apparently its least vulnerable side , - we may reasonably hope erelong to be in possession of data sufficient to constitute a genuine science of sidereal dynamics . It can hardly be doubted that , with the aid of Mr. Huggins 's marvellous disclosures , and of other discoveries . to be obtained by the prosecution of the same method , we shall eventually know enough o* the true motions of the stars to be able to frame some theory of the mutual relations among the forces which impel this stupendous system of worlds . Already there begins to be detected a complexity of arrangement and behavior among the members of the starry universe sufficient to carry our speculations far beyond the point at which they were left by the painstaking researches of the elder and the yot*nger Herschel. // POLITICS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been as uncertain as that of the hero in Charles Reade 's novels . It has been left for dead and rescued so many times , that the public have ceased to take much interest in its condition . Thrice has ie been saved by the masterly inactivity of Mr. Gladstone , thrice by the presence of mind of General Schenck , and latterly the tribunal of arbitration at Geneva has been saving it , when it was supposed to be utterly and hopelessly dead . Exactly how this final restoration to life will turn out does not quite appear , nor whether it is yet safely past all its perils ; whether Malice domestic , foreign , tory , naught Can harm it further , or whether General Butler and Earl Russell still have power to vex and torment it . Many humane persons had hoped that a vote in the House of Commons or another ultimatum from Washington ( say the tenth ) would finally put the poor sufferer out of its misery , and leave the way clear for a permanent settlement on a better basis . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestly the wish of both governments to have the skeleton at least of the treaty preserved , its complete failure Would be such a political dead loss to both , that it has long been plain no pains would be spared to keep it alive kt least till the close of the parliamentary session , and of our Presidential campaign . Whether the decision of the arbitrators , throwing out the indirect claims* , will do more than prolong its existence until Congress meets again , will depend somewhat on the result of our election . After all that has passed , the downright refusal of the English nation to submit a part of our case to arbitration at all , followed by so much petty and higgling nego* tiation , and by several very questionable letters and declarations of General Schenck , it is by no means so certain as it once was that the United States , under a new administration , would accept an unfavorable decision by the arbitrators as final . Mr. Greeley is understood to be utterly opposed to the whole course of our government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated for the Presidency . Should he be elected , and should his election happen to place Mr. Sumner in the State Department , all that has yet been done to save the unlucky treaty might still prove useless . The re-election of General Grant , we presume , would be held to indorse all the acts of his administration which it had not then repudiated ; but as it is not probable that Mr. Fish and Mr. Bancroft Davis will continue in office , if General Grant does , there is no certainty that the new Secretary of State will follow in the steps of his predecessor . However gratifying , therefore , the complete settlement of our controversy with England might be , and however well disposed the Geneva tribunal may be to settle it , we can not see that they are likely to do so , at their present rate of activity , before the November election shall come on ; perhaps to give the question an entlirely new aspect . But it seems to be decided that each portion of the treaty is to stand or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disposal of the Alabama claims , the other matters at issue may perhaps go on to a complete settlement while this Gordian knot is still as fast tied as ever . The Geneva arbitrators have kept their own counsel since their first decision , ruling out the indirect claims , was made public ; and though we have rumors that they are reducing very much our claims for direct damages , there is as yet no certain information on the subject . Apathetic as our people have become respecting the treaty and its practical results , it is far from certain that they would acquiesce in a verdict at Geneva by which - to quote the coarse but expressive language ascribed to Mr. Evarts , one of our counsel - we should both lose our money damages and be *chiselled out of our grievance . " This new danger to the " amicable settlement " which the treaty aims at has already begun to excite the apprehensive minds of the Tory newspapers in London , and ought not to be quite overlooked on our side of the ocean . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the treaty negotiation have long since evaporated in the handling , and we have come down to the boldest prose in our treatment of the matter on both sides . American diplomacy is largely responsible for this fine example of natural disillusion ; it lost a great opportunity to be magnanimous , to secure the good-will of other na 382* September , // Politics . tions ; and the curse of a granted prayer may yet be keenly felt by our negotiators when they come to sum up , a year or two hence , the whole result of their long labor . But we will hope for better things ; partly because Mr. Adams has now quite as much voice in the decision as Mr. Fish has . ALTHOUGH the country has seen , in the twenty Presidential elections that have occurred since Washington 's first term ended , almost every phase of political contest of which it was deemed capable , we are having this year a new campaign , of which the beginning and progress have been unlike anything before seen . At first , Presidential candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were selected neither by conventions nor congressional parties , but indicated by their own prominence before the country . Washington , Adams , and Jefferson are examples of this ; the first and perhaps the grossest illustration of the modern doctrine of availability , however , appeared in the union of the Federalists in i8oo- upon Aaron Burr in opposition to Jefferson . After Jefferson 's administration the custom prevailed of making the Secretary of State a candidate for the Presidency , and this had become important enough in 1827 , when Henry Clay was Secretary , to call out from the partisans of Jackson a protest against handing down the office in this way , by a sort of legitimate succession . Amos Kendall , then editing a Kentucky newspaper , and a bitter enemy of Clay , spoke of him and John Quincy Adams as " mayors of the palace , " who in the Presidency of their chief , had plotted to gain the sovereign power for themselves . The danger was not a very alarming one , and since Adams 's time very few Secretaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , but after a long interval , and so did Buchanan , who was Mr. Polk 's Secretary ten years before he was elected over Fremont , in 1856 . But neither Harrison , nor Polk , nor Cass , nor Taylor , nor Scott , nor Pierce , nor Fremont , Lincoln , Douglas , Breckenridge , Bell , McClellan , Grantf nor Seymour had been Secretary of State , and only two or three of them had been in the Cabinet at all when they were candidates for the Presidency . Nor did Webster , or Calhoun , or Marcy , or Seward - all able Secretaries - ever come to be Presidential candidates , in the modern sense of the word , after 1828 ; that is , they did I 383 not obtain the sanction of a party caucus or convention . The national convention , properly speaking , is but thirty-two years old , for it did not become an established institution till 1840 , when Harrison was nominated over Clay and Webster , as Taylor was in 1848 , and Scott over Webster in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real leaders of a party are as likely to draw blanks as prizes , and which is not favorable to the selection of great men as Presidential candidates . With the exception of Clay in i8* , and Lincoln in i86o and 1864 , no first-rate man has received the nomination in such a convention of either party ; the ordinary result being men , like Polk and Pierce , or Scott , Taylor , McClellan , and Grant , who were either mere party instruments , or men with a military reputation , but of unknown political qualities . This year the cut-and-dried partisan conventions were anticipated by the irregular and eccentric Cincinnati gathering , which , by a sort of accident , put in nomination a man as unique as the occasion of his appearance . For Mr. Greeley had been a party leader for thirty years , and yet had no party when he was nominated ; he is not a first-rate man , though the equal in ability of any of our later Presidents save Lincoln ; yet he defeated Mr. Adams , who is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused every Democratic aspirant for the nomination to vanish from the field ; so that the Baltimore Convention literally did nothing but ratify the proceedings at Cincinnati . Mr. Greeley has developed unsuspected strength as a candidate , so that , as we write , the election is as doubtful as any that the present generation of voters can remember . It has become quite common to say , in view of the rapid and apparently firni concentration of parties on Mr. Greeley 's support , that , " unless something unforeseen should happen , " he is in a fair way to be elected . This may be true ; but the unforeseen is sure to happen this year , and from the present aspect of the campaign no safe conclusion can be drawn . In fact , if ever the Horatian virtue of nil admirari and the Indian 's resolution not to be surprised at anything were in request , it is in this year of 1872 , which has been one succession of surprises , politically speaking , from the beginning until now , and which promises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with open-mouthed wonderment over England 's reception of our " case " under the // Pditics .
