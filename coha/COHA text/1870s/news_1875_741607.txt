txt The rapid-transit fund which was started in TILE TIMES of Jan. 18 , by a modest subseriatim of $1,000 from Mr. JAMES M. DRAKE , has already , within eleven weeks , reached a total amount of $300,000 . While it would be easy to show that at this rate of progress it will take a very long time to raise three millions of dollars , it must be remembered thatin a movement of this character the most formidable difficulties are those to be encountered at the outset . The New York capitalist of the period is a very cautious person , strongly disposed to suspect all quick-transit schemes of being organized . in . the interest of some worthless invention , or of some needy corporation which is kept behind the scenes . It takes a long gum to convince him that men will devote time and energy to such a work with no other motive save that of public duty , and he is greatly disposed to wait till names of the highest financial standing are subscribers . It was obvious from the start that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised above $1,000 before the scheme could fairly be considered a practical one . The active support of several hundreds of small propertyowners was not , indeed , to be despised , but if a rapid-transit road . is ever to be built , it must be with the aid of men who can put down $50,000 with as much ease as the majority of those interested in the success could subscribe $500 . To Mr. MORRELL must be accorded the credit of fairly recognizing the necessity of heading the list with a number of first-class names and large subscriptions . He undertook to find twenty-five capitalists willing to subscribe , at the start , $10,000 each , and of these he has already obtained twelve . His list is headed by Ilinam W. SIBLEY , WILLIAM BUTLER DUNCAN , and HORACE B. CLAFLIN , and . it is proposed to place as many of these subscribers for $10,000 as will agree to serve on the Board of Directors . The names of all of them are of a character calculated to give the scheme a secure hold upon public confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscriptions is only limited by the degree of favor with which they regard the financial prospects of the undertaking . On Tuesday next it is proposed to proceed to the election of Directors , and by that time substantial additions will probably be announced to the subscription list . Meanwhile , the association continues its wise policy of incurring none of that preliminary expenditure which has been the ruin of several promising rapid-transit schemes . No money is to_the be paid out till the subscription lists have been closed , and till every stockholder has been afforded an opportunity of participating in the election of officers to whom the spending of his money is to be intrusted . Committees like that which starts for Albany today , to be heard in regard to the provisions of a general local railroad law , pay their own traveling expenses and hotel bills . The association engages no " skilled talent , " and employs no special counsel . It has taken in hand an enterprise of the foremost importance to the interests of this City , and it looks to the people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad lobby , or influences emanating from the holders of existing charters , shall be permitted to obstruct a scheme framed solely in the public interest . The legislation needed for the organization of the corporation , whose materials are now being brought together , is of a very simple character . Its progress ought to be carefully watched by every one who has the slightest interest in saving the people of New-York from an incalculable waste of time , and the real estate of New-York from rapid depreciation .
