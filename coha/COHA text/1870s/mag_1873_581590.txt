CULTURE AND PROGRESS . A New Language Wanted . A NATION stepping out of semi-barbarism into the civilization of America and Western Europe finds great difficulty with its language . What wonder ? It is as though Henry III . of England should suddenly arise from his dusty tomb , and ask what we nsean by " railroad , " " electric telegraph , " and " frictionmatches . " For , before Henry had come to the throne , or Saint Louis of France had gone on his first crusade , Japan had an ancient history , a language and literature . Columbus was not born when Marco Polo , hospitably entreated at the court of Kublai Khan , caught from the returning and ( we regret to say ) lying warriors of the great monarch the first reports which Europe ever heard of the wonderful power , riches and learning ofthe kingdom of Zipangu . Before the reigns of the Doges of Venice reached their acme of splendor , Japan boasted a line of kings whose origin stretched away into dim traditions . And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the borders of Poland and the coast of Silesia to the Amoor and the Yellow Sea , " that the Japanese were organizing armies which preserved the proud integrity of their rich empire , and beat back , discomfited , the far-swarming hosts of the great Khan . This is the nation-old when our forefathers clad themselves in the skins of wild beasts-which emerges from its hoary seclusion and asks us what we mean by " railroads , " " electric telegraphs , " and " friction matches . " What shall be done for a people which has 380 sinograms , four alphabets , and at least one unwritten language , and is destitute of a word for " saleratus ? " The plain difficulty is , that Japan has suddenly come out csf the Tenth Century , and has neither voice nor language for the common things of the Nineteenth Century . She has entered the family of so-called civilized nations ; shall she give up her own tongue , or invite us to learn hers , as we take to French and German ? This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the question for us to think of learning Japanese . With persistent industry , it is said , seven // 77 ' years will suffice wherein to acquire a tolerable fluency in speaking and writing the language of business Japan . Scientific Japan has its own graphic system ; its sinograms are known as Ta/and Sso . Then there is the Ratakana alphabet of forty-nine letters , in which no hooks are printed , but which is used for business writing . Love-letters and novelettes are found executed in the Firokana alphabet or writing of women ; and a third , called the Munyokana , or myriad-leavesletters , embalms in its bewildering curves and flourishes the sublime thoughts of the poets of the Sunsource kingdom . We , who find fault with our twentysix letters , and dock the tails of all words of more than two syllables , will never get on with this complex language . The Japanese are too proud to adopt any native slang for the technical terms of the English and French . They have no native word for " steamship ; " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke " and " junk , " and so get over the difficulty by calling an American frigate a " smoke war-junk . " This sort of thing may do for the childish Marquesans or simpleminded Kanakas ; the quick-witted , haughty Japanese will not endure it . Turn into the newly-awakened antique kingdom the inventions and discoveries of photography , ether , nitro-glycerine , electricity , inflammable gas , printing and steam machinery , with all the jargon and technical terms with which these things have enriched our own language ; you see how the bewildered Japanese learner literally lacks words to express his wonders in his native tongue . He is the contemporary of Henry III . dazed in a Birmingham factory or a Chicago railway depot . It is not surprising , then , that mental and material progress in Japan demands some other vehicle of expression than that used when Ghengis Khan cast enviaus eyes on the islanded empire . The nation has , somehow , got ahead of its language . They are talking of adopting ours ; but they do not like its irregular verbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verbs are all regular ; in fact , the derivative is unmistakably traceable through all its forms . For example : S/at , inferior ; Sta/va , humility ; s/a/no , humble ; s/a/ni , humbly ; s/at-nisheru , to humble ; s/a/-ninaru , to be humbled , etc . Or , again , yoino , to read ; yomi , reading ( substantive ) ; yomi/e , reader , etc . If a Japanese attempts our language he immediately desires to make all the verbs regular , and push the derivatives through all compound forms . He says " speaked " for spoke ; " heated " for beaten ; " goed " for went . An umbrella is " a roof or shelter to carry in the hand . " It is impossible for him to see why it should be called an umbrella ; or , being called so , why a parasol should not be called an uns-something else . Thus , many of the difficulties of our dear mother-tongue dawn on us when these Orientals , in despair , propose a compromise in some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tough cough and hic-cough plough me through . " Given the pronunciation of the first word , and they will construe the line : " Though the to co and hicco plome thro . " Attacking the verbs , the student will thus render a nursery rhyme " John , John , thepiper 's son , Stealed a pig and away be runned . The pig was eatcd and John was bested , And John runned , bellowing , down the street . " We must leave our new neighbors to work out this problem for themselves . It is a pity that we can not meet them half-way , and give our language a little of that simple euphony which would make its acquisition easier for them , as well as for our own infant learners . The punitory miracle at Babel has set up barriers all about us . How shall we beat down the wall for our allies in Japan ? The International Metric Commission . IN 1870 the French Government invited other Governments to send scientific delegates to a Commission , which it proposed should meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , to take the place , as In/erna/jona ? S/andards , of the old ones constructed in the beginning of this century , as the fundamental standards of the Metric System of Weights and Measures . The primary object was stated to be the construction of a m ? /re * traits , or meter defined by lines drawn on the bar , representing with all possible exactness the length comprised between the end surfaces of the original meter , which is an end-measure , or m ? tre * bou/s . The latter form of a measure is more convenient than the former for many purposes , such as the measure of geodetic baselines ; but the very mode of its use by contact , renders its absolute permanence doubtful , exposing it to compression or abrasion , while the line-measure is subjected only to optical comparison . The existing standard , the me*tre des archives , in fact exhibits on its terminal faces slight depressions , or at least a visible change in the appearance of the original surface , where the contacts have been made , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries are found , when compared among themselves , not to bear the stated relations to each other , with that degree of exactness which the present state of science demands . This circumstance was the primary occasion for the call of the International Metric Commission , composed of many eminent savans of Europe , such as Delaunay , Le Verrier , Fizeau , Deville , Airy , Miller , Struve , Jacobi and Foerster , the United States being represented by Professors Henry and Hilgard. - A session was held in August , 1870 , but owing to the Franco-German war it was of short duration , resulting in the appointment of a committee for preliminary research relative to the form , material , and methods of construction and comparison of the new standards . It was also resolved that not only one but a considerable number of new standards should be made , // of which one should be chosen as the ultimate appeal , to be preserved under especially guarded conditions to secure its invariability , while the others should be distributed to the countries represented . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined the details of the work to be done . The principal conclusions are as follows : The international meter is to have the length of the meter of the archives , at the temperature of melting ice ; its material will be an alloy of platinum and iridium in the proportions of 9 to i , which is quite hard and rigid ; its form will be similar to an H beam , hut with the sides sloping outward from the mid-rib , whose upper surface is iu the plane of neutral fibers , and will bear the lines that define the standard length . The rate of expansion by heat will be determined for each standard between the limits of o ' and 40 ' Centigrade . Several copieswill be preserved at avery nearly constant temperature , as tests of the invariability of the prototype , and to this end it is also proposed to procure a quartz crystal of 42 inches in length , recently discovered in Switzerland , and mark on it the length of the standard . The international kilogramme will be an exact copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter , have its standard weight in a vacuum . Its material will be the same as that of the meter ; its form , a cylinder of equal depth and diameter . Its relation to the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at maximum density will be ascertained with the greatest attainable precision-that being the theoretical definition of the kilogramme , which there is reason to believe is not , however , fulfilled with perfect exactness by the existing standard . The Commission proposes that the new prototypes , together with their tests of invariability , and apparatus for comparison , be preserved in an International Bureau of Weights and Measures , to be founded and maintained at the common expense , where the final comparisons of the several national metric standards and their future periodic verifications may be made ; and where the existing standards other than the metric , and the measures used in geodetic operations in different countries may be accurately compared , and their expansion and other relations determined . To this end the Commission has asked the French Government to invite a diplomatic conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a measure would serve to maintain invariability and precision in all kinds of standards , and would promote that approach to general uniformity which is admitted to be desirable by all , even by those to whom the practical difficulties in the way of a general adoption of the metric system of weights and measures in our own country appear insuperable . The subject of Metrology is one in which all nations are alike interested , and it appears desirable to have a common point of contact . The proposed establishment would form the nucleus or model for future co operation in matters of science having international importance . Our share of the annual expense of maintaining it would be insignificant , being estimated at about eight hundred dollars . It is to be hoped that the Government will respond to the proposition , which is supported by the unanimous assent of the men of science in our country . Edward Lytton Buiwer . BuLwEa 's literary life extended over nearly half a century . He produced his first , and in all ways his worst novel , Falkiand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving when he died , a few weeks ago . Those forty-five years coincided with the busiest period of the busiest modern age , full of material progress and social disquiet , little favorable to the highest literary achievement . They accompanied , perhaps occasioned , the change that elevated the novel from the mere task of amusing , to the function of instructing by presenting life in little to a public too restless to be pleased with didactic appeals . And after impartially weighing the claims and the performance of Bulwer , it must be said that his share in aiding this important transformation was small . He deserves no blame for not understanding the transition , nor foreseeing that the fashion that had deserted Scott would come round in his lifetime to Bronti* and Eliot . Even had the prescience of that change been given him , he lacked the power wielded by Thackeray and Dickens in shaping it . The whole world was not made kin to him , as to them , by any touch of nature . The old order of things claimed him in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew men by fancy-studies , not by contact with them . The artist who refuses to take his brush from the studio into the fields , who copies old forms and inspires them only with his own consciousness , * will never found a schooL When Bulwer began to , write , the morals of his society were what the Regent* had made them , and its tastes such as Byron had formed . Power was in the hands , directly or indirectly , of his order , who thought revolutions vulgar and laughable , Brougham a bore , with his crotchets of reform and education , and the poor an inconvenience always , sometimes a curious spectacle* The complete . ness of that world apart occupied by English upper life is carefully and naturally depicted in Robert Ward 's extremely clever novels , Tremaine and De Vere . Bulwer had a keen insight into the structure of that particular world , and a comprehensive glance over its superficial features . But he had , besides , a romantic ideal of what humanity within those limits ought to be  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also the novelist 's power of combining plots and devising situations , for the complete effectiveness of which he needed to go outside of that world which he did know , into a lower one of which he knew nothing but what the police reports told him . Still , the conception of his works was by no means commonplace . What he took from // the silver-fork school of sprightly triflers , like the anonyrsious author of Cecil /he C'oxcomb and The Peer , was only for embellishment . Nor was he an adventurer , forcing a position by such pinchbeck amalgams of political folly and aristocratic tinsel as served for advertisements to his compeer , D'Jsraeli . Even if he had not learned to write so much better , as he afterwards did , it could never have been his fate to crown his literary career with a novel like Lotliair  --  a production quite unintelligible , unless we impute a Machiavelian purpose to its otherwise trashy flunkeyism , and judge it to be , like Beaumarchais ' Figaro , a pasquinade for revenge and an incitement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulwer ' s lighter genius . There are two other novels of this period , that give even a clearer view of his characteristic powers and defects , one of which has been greatly praised where it is a failure , and the other neglected on account of its merits . Eugene Aram is a closet study , elaborated without experience , of the darkest traits in human nature . It is an impossible combination of opposites , a futile effort to fuse aspiration and avarice , fine instincts and base greed , scholarly culture and coarse desires , Saint Paul and Satan . Godoe*j5hin came earlier , immediately succeeding Falkiand . It contains the germ of almost all the best of Bulwer 's conceptions . Saville , the kindly epicurean ; Godolphin , ambitious , brilliant , prematurely wise , a successful failure in life ; the Italian gypsy traviata ; the heroine , Sheridan 's daughter , tender and resolute , giving up love for power , and regaining it too late ,  --  all these reappear , singly or distributed among several figures , in the most finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude , but not glaring , and therefore perhaps it is little noticed , although it is the seed-plot of so much that afterwards ripened . And it is less disfigured than the more conspicuous novels of his early period by the undeniable fustian , the affectation of paradox , and the shallow trifling with moral distinctions , which clung to his style and blinded the better public to his real merits long after he had shown himself capable of higher things . A/hens was a fortunate subject for Buiwer . The work deserved its reputation , and his habits of study made its process of constructing , by recomposing the past , easy and naturaL He had to group lay figures , all distinct if not all heroic , and to portray embalmed manners and institutions not palpitating with the puzzling complexity of modern life . The grandeur of that past age , with all its littleness faded away , suited his romantic genius , not as yet patient of the labor of penetrating the poetic reality of the present time . The like fitness won him like success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with darker strands of Egyptian lore into the tissue of pure romance in the classic Last Days of Pompeii . In the confused splendor of Rienzi he brightened the twilight of the middle ages with the magical radiance shining around the name of Rome , in one of the strangest passages of her history . And his treatment of national subjects in historical romance , though less free in fancy and restricted in plan to real occurrences , raises the half mythical personages of the old annalists into dignity and vividness . If a touch of the mock- - heroic still lingers about them , it is nature exaggerated , not flattened and faded , as in James ' s goody chronicles  --  the rinsings of Scott , with now and then a drop of genius such as redeems his Phil*p Augustus and One in a Thousand . These early English romances made the transition easier for Bulwer to the grave and later fictions which have added most to his fame . There was a particular quality of mind , and a peculiar store of studies which Bulwer found a use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean his love of the mysterious , and his acquisitions in the learning of the regions of the supernaturaL These seem oldfashioned enough , when we recall the broad light of common day that our modern novel sheds into every cranny of life . But that sentiment of mystery , even if detected by science lurking in the nerves or the digestion , will never vanish from human emotions , and Bulwer knew how to conjure with it skillfully and potently . Some of the most natural and elevated passages in his cruder early works take the form of appeal to this sentiment . There is nothing in the theatrical gloom and sheet-iron thunder of Southey 's Domdaniel poems that brings a creeping shiver as does the shape haunting Glyndon in Zanoni . Up to a certain point , the ground-idea of A S/range Story is worked out into a subtle and fascinating spell over the reader 's fancy . And any one who has not shuddered at midnight while hearing that most wonderful of all gl*ost-stories , " The House and the Brain , " well read aloud , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood when first thrilled with the feefaw-fum of The Castle of Otranto . But in every one of these works the mental defect attending the quality that inspired them is most conspicuous . It is a want of the sense of symmetry , an eagerness to press the effect too far , which leads him on to force the supernatural into palpable presentation , instead of leaving it in suggestive dimness . So that in Zanoni the stalking shape on Vesuvius , and the stampede of wild cattle upsetting the camp-kettle at the close of A S/range Story , though seriously meant for powerful strokes , only cause an explosion of laughter . Bulwer 's larger experience and his ripened genius , chastised by criticism and stimulated by the fame of rivals , produced works of a kind and degree of excellence that his early promise gave no reason to hope for . The Cax/ons begins the series , pure and simple in tone , though wanting artistic finish , and unpleasing , even if faithful to truth of manners and worldly prudence , in its ministry to class pride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life and stature of an enduring heroic figure as anything that Bulwer ever wrought . And his strength and range are nowhere so well shown as in his treatment , in the two succeeding novels , of the manifold varieties of English // life , managed as it is without trenching in the least on the field or borrowing at all from the manner of his two great compeers . The semi-tragic swell and exaggerating touch that seem ineradicable are here toned down till they hardly offend , and all the finer qualities of nature and mellower experience of life come brightly out , even to genuine tenderness and wise *hurnor . Upon these novels and his later occasional papers on life and manners , their author 's solid claim to eminence may safely rest . Admirable as Bulwer 's versatility is , it is doubtful whether his poems by themselves would ever have made him a great name . As the work of one so diligent and so brilliant in other fields of literature , they give him the advantage of an added reputation which his rivals in fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of sympathy with the German poet 's simpler and more honestly romantic genius . Though always clever and often felicitous , they show no possession by the true inspiration the original sprang from , and in some instances completely miss its genuine sentiment . In the worldly wisdom and manly philosophy , however , of Horace , fresh for all ages and especially harmonizing with Bulwer ' s mental temper , he found an agreement in taste that gives great charm to his translation of the Odes . Their spirit and meaning is all there , though under a form in many cases so unfortunately chosen , with the rash hope of attaining impossible metrical effects , as to cramp and stiffen the expression . That more definite system of savoir vivre embodied in the Epistles and Satires , and teaching that , though all is vanity , all need not be vexation of spirit , would have found in Bulwer a congenial interpreter , and one must regret that this task did not employ the care and time given to the elaboration of a less calm and more bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commended  --  and they did succeed . That is to say , they still hold the stage , and will bear the hour 's study behind the footlights , because they are pure romance , the romance of love in Melnotte and the romance of ambition in Richelien , and because these things please as illusions when they would be rejected as unrealities in a novel of practical present life . This is what Bulwer has left to be judged by , for his parliamentary course can hardly be called a career , and counts for nothing . Judgment was spoken during his whole life very frankly and very variously . To some he was a prose Byron , to others a conscious charlatan . The turgid phrase and sham sentiment that many derided seemed to many the lofty eloquence of noble thought . Those inculcations of worldly wisdom commended by his admirers , his harsher critics stigmatized as corrupting egotistic lessons . When Thackeray outlined that side-splitting caricature which the satirist afterwards repented of and the sufferer forgave , there were more who laughed with the rising genius than there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborated those stinging lines that revenged the novelist 's spiteful attack upon himself , the general voice reproached the serene laureate for an unworthy ebullition of wounded vanit*t . Between opinions so diverse the mean is usually safe . And friends and enemies agreed at last in this-that whatever blemishes disfigured his earlier performances , his morality grew purer , his views of life more just , his purposes higher and his execution finer , as his genius purged and chastened itself in the latest years . His literary life was so long and so progx*ssive that he can hardly be called either the last of the oldfashioned novelists , or the first of the new . Nor is any fair comparison possible between l3ulwer and Thackeray or Dickens , since their several conceptions of their art and processes of working these out were utterly diverse . W*. ni'y - :onounce the two latter more natural a1id real , but we can not judge the former less true to his ideal . Take , as studies of contrast rather than comparison , characters almost at random from the pages of either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lumley Ferrars matches Carker , yet how unlike they are ! Pathos and innocence are the life of Nydia as of Little Nell-but how differently ! One is the ideal slightly veiled in reality  --  the other the real poetized . And Uncle Roland and Colonel Newcome  --  but no ! nothing in modern fiction reaches the height of that sad , no. ble figure . In fine , Bulwer wrote throughout a transition stage in English literature . He never quite forgot the ways of its beginning , nor quite attained the standard of its close . He was incomplete , because the period was unsettled ; and in filling up the gap between the novel of philandering and the novel of philosophy he used materials unfit to raise a symmetrical enduring monument for his name . His better influence is too recent to be strong , and his worse example already almost forgotten . The light he threw on life shone poetic , if often unnatural . His extravagances were but distortions of the belief that the world can and should be brighter , and men less commonplace than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of manners , which his great rivals could brighten with the touch of romance and exalt by aspirations towards an attainable ideaL In turning away from that ideal to the bald realism of certain living writers , do we not lose by the exchange of a picture 's glow and soul for the dead precision of pho-tography ? Darwin on " The Expression of the Emotions . " THE verdict of posterity upon Mr. Darwin 's new work , The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals ( D. Appleton &amp; Co. ) , will , we apprehend , be in the main unfavorable-so far , at any rate , as concerns the author 's scientific reputation . Prof. Agassiz has recently characterized the Darwinian hypothesis as " a mire of mere assertion ; " and this strong language has been undoubtedly to a great extent justi. fled by both the Descent of Man and the present work . The subject of Expression is in itself a most interesting one , and those who have read Mr. Darwin 's pre // vious works will not need to be told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner in which he has presented it to the world . The careless reader , also , who reads without much thought , and who swallows any assertion that may be made with sufficient confidence , will doubtless rise from the perusal of the present work with the full conviction that Mr. Darwin has pwved his point . No man ever possessed a more wonderful power of accumulating all the facts which bear upon a given subject , and in marshaling these facts in a given order so that all shall point in one direction ; and in none of his previous works is this power more conspicuously manifested . We may here also state , that Mr. Darwin shows no diminution of the candor which has always impelled him to speak out openly , and to point out what he conceives to be the special difficulties of his own theory . Nevertheless , when we fairly examine Mr. Darwin 's work , the net results of his labors are by no means very great . If we accept his premises , then we shall unquestionably accept his conclusions ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , so far as mere logic is concerned , his armor may be regarded as proof against attack . In too many instances , however , his premises are not such as would be admitted by the generality of scientific men , and in a still larger number of instances he merely substitutes one form of words for another , without achieving any actual improvement of our knowledge . To talk , for example , of certain expressions being due to an " excess of nerve-force " may doubtless sound very well in the ears of the uninitiated ; but it in reality explains nothing , owing to our total ignorance of what " nerveforce " is , how it is generated , or what is its connection with the body or with the mind . The weakness of Mr. Darwin 's theory , in fact , appears to arise from a cause , which would at present more or less affect all theories as to the nature of the expression of the emotions in man and animals . No such theory can , in our opinion , have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive theory as to the connection between spirit and matter , between the immaterial essence and the corporeal instrument . It need hardly he said that the present record of human knowledge contains hardly even a vestige of such a theory ; and in the absence of this it seems almost futile to speculate on the essential nature of the expression of the emotions . We can doubtless observe and note how this or the other emotion is expressed by man or by any animal , what muscles are brought into play in each successive phase of feeling , what attitudes the body assumes , and what is the effect upon the nervous or circulatory systems . Mr. Darwin 's book is a rich repertory of such facts , and those who have recourse to it for observations of this kind alone will assuredly not be disappointed . But no store of facts , however extensive , will of themselves form a theory , and at present we have nothing but the facts to go upon . We are absolutely and entirely ignorant of the nature of the connection between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to discover why certain special muscles are contracted in anger , or why the heart should beat wildly under the influence of terror . Still less can we determine what it is that enables us to form some judgment , and often a very accurate one , as to the character of a perfect stranger , simply by looking at his face when in a state of perfect repose . Indeed , the general , undefined , and yet distinct impression that we receive from any personality with which we are brought into contact , without any direct acquaintance , is a much more wonderful and inexplicable thing than all the expressions of the special emotions put together . For obvious reasons , however , Mr. Darwin does not attempt to grapple with this fact , since , though closely related to the subject of Expression in general , it is not capable of being made to fit in with his theory . It were hopeless , in the limits at our disposal , to attempt any detailed criticism of Mr. Darwin 's work ; but he lays down three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate , worth stating . The first of these is what he calls the " principle of serviceable associated habits , " according to which " certain complex actions are of direct or indirect service under certain states of the mind , in order to relieve or gratify certain sensations , desires , etc. ; and whenever the same state of mind is induced , however feebly , there is a tendency through the force of habit and association for the same movements to be performed , though they may not then be of the least use . " This principle is simply the " utilitarian " doctrine of morals carried into a fresh department ; and though it may explain some expressive actions , and especially such as are more or less automatic or habitual , it certainly will not apply to many of the cases brought forward by Mr. Darwin . Upon this principle , many of the actions by which we express our emotions stand upon the same level as the action of a dog when he turns round and round before lying down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog was wild , and used to trample down the grass to make his bed . It is under this head , therefore , that Mr. Darwin tries to bring his theory of the expression of the emotions to support his theory of the descent of man from a common stock with the monkeys . He tries to prove that many expressions of the emotions are merely modifications of primeval habits possessed by man when he was in " a much lower and animal-like condition , " and when these habits were of direct and actual service to him . We can hardly blame Mr. Darwin for taking up this position , since his firm belief in the truth of his own theory fully justifies his doing so . Those , however , who reject Mr. Darwin 's theory as to the descent of man , as an unproved and unprovable hypothesis , based in the main upon unsupported assertions , are not likely to view with great favor his " first principle " of Expression . The second canon of Expression is termed " the principle of Antithesis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with the first principle , to " certain habitual movements which // were primarily , or may still be , of service ; " but when " a directly opposite state of the mind is induced , there is a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance of movements of an exactly 6pposite nature , though these have never been of any service . " The best possible example of the supposed working of this principle is to be found in the actions exhibited by a dog in approaching a friend or foe respectively . In the latter case , the animal walks upright and in a stiff and cautious manner ; his head is slightly raised ; the tail is held erect and is quite rigid ; the hairs bristle , especially along the neck and back ; the ears are pricked and directed forwards ; and the eyes have a fixed stare . On the other hand , if the dog be approaching a friend , his bearing is the reverse of all this . Instead of walking upright , the body sinks , or even crouches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is depressed and wagged from side to side ; the hair becomes smooth ; the ears are depressed and drawn *backwards ; and the eyes lose their fixed and staring expression . That the facts are as stated by Mr. Darwin is indubitable ; and it is brought home to our minds in an exceedingly appropriate and forcible manner by four very excellent drawings of dogs in the two states of mind in question . We fail , however , altogether to perceive that he has proved that his theory is any explanation of the facts . Indeed , it is only too clear that he has only had recourse to this principle as a last resort , from the impossibility of explaining the facts upon any known law . We do not say that the " principle of antithesis " is absolutely without foundation ; but we do say that Mr. Darwin has failed to bring forward any valid evidence in its support , and that its application under any circumstances must be of the most limited character . The third principle is termed the " principle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle , certain expressive actions depend entirely upon the constitution and structure of the nervous system itself , and have been from the first indepenient of the will , and to a large extent of habit . Thus , when the brain " is strongly excited , nerve-force is generated in excess , and is transmitted in certain definite directions , depending on the connection of the nerve-cells , and partly on habit ; or the supply of nerve-force may , as it appears , be interrupted . Effects are thus produced which we recognize as expressive . " As examples of the alleged working of this law , Mr. Darwin brings forward , amongst others , the blanching of the hair under terror or grief , the trembling of the muscles from fear , joy , or excessive anger , the blush of shame , the convulsive movements of agony , and the like . This third principle is an admirable example of how to give an explanation which is no explanation , of explaining the obscurum per obscurius . It is quite true that we do not know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fear or joy ; but it is a very poor explanation to tell us that it is caused by the generation of " an excess of nerve-force or by the interrupted supply of nerve-force to the muscles . " We do not feel bound to admit , with Mr. Herbert Spencer , that it is an " unquestionable truth that , at any moment , the existing quantity of liberated nerve-force , which in an inscrutable way produces in us the state we call feeling , must expend itself in some direction - must generate an equivalent manifestation of force somewhere . " We do not feel bound to admit , with the same authority , that an " overflow of nerve-force , undirected by any motive , will manifestly take the most habitual routes , and , if these do not suffice , will next overflow into the less habitual ones . " We confess that we do not think our present acquaintance with " nerve-force " to be of such an intimate nature as to warrant our speaking so positively as to the manner in which it " must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being " undirected by any motive , " or even as to what are its " habitual routes . " We are inclined to think that these definite and dogmatic modes of stating opinons upon very obscure subjects are too often only a cloak by which man endeavors to conceal from himself the knowledge of his own ignorance . When we know what is the nature of the bond between the soul and the brain , and how each is enabled to react upon the other , then we may be in a position to adequately discuss what expressions are due to " the principle of the direct action of the nervous system .

In the initial chap . ter we have a short discussion of the underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full allowance is made for the influence of those forces begotten of the Revival of Learning , to which Mr. Lecky attributes so great a power , the Reforma-. tion is shown to be connected with the Bible , to be in the domain of the church , in the subject-matter of religion , to be in and through men of a religious feeling , and with a religious end in view . Having thus sketched the general character of the Reformation , the author discusses the rise and fall of the papal hierarchy through the centralization of nations , the special causes and omens of a revolution in the church , and then tells the story of the Reformation in Germany , Switzerland , Scandinavia , Hungary , Geneva , France , the Netherlands , England , Scotland , Italy and Spain . Then follows the narrative of the counterreformation in the Roman Catholic Church and the struggle of Protestantism in the 17th century . The work is concluded by three masterly chapters on the Protestant Theology , and on the relation of Protestantism to the civil authority , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George P. Fisher , D.D. , Prof. of Ecclesiastical History in Yale College . Scriboer , Armstrong &amp; Co. 1573. 776 // The " solidarity of peoples " is not a figment of the imagination ; nor is the solidarity of religious , moral , civil , social and aesthetic truth . And the unity of human nature forbids that we should regard the religious contests of the past as void of instraction for the present and the future . We speak and read of Humanism , Protestantism and Romanism , too much as if these themes were merely abstract and scholastic , and too forgetful of the fact that generations of men have had their whole life determined by one or other of these systems , that we ourselves are controlled by one of these forces or by their resultant , and that our children 's children are to be affected for weal or woe by the adoption or rejection of principles whose value can now in some degree be seen and felt in consequence of their long trial and probation . It is a favorite idea with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American soil the appropriate place for a searching criticism of the pait in creeds of every kind and color , with the distinct design of saving the true for future embodiment in civil , social and religious life , and of destroying the false . In our land and day every creed , every church , every science , and every man stands equal before the law , and free from fetters , and fearless of pains and penalties ; many are quietly slipping or openly cutting the cables which have moored them to authority and precedent , and preparing , at least for a season , to stand with Luther , " under the wide heaven . " The vast population of our future is to live under the moulding influence of institutions , civil and religious , whose character must be largely determined by the ideas and convictions of the present generation and the next . The value of a past idea and of an old conviction is of course to be partly made clear by its history and its results . A wise people or a wise man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . Hence the importance of history , of fair , wise and conscientious historians . Unless the absurd ground be taken that the whole past is worthless , and is to be abandoned to oblivion , we shall do well to adopt the principle which obtains in conservative Surgery , in the endeavor it makes to preserve every particle of healthy flesh and function , and to eliminate disease alone-an analogy which holds also in the point that , as conservative surgery is impossible on the field of battle , and must wait for peace and quiet , so conservat*e and healing handling of the body of doctrine and opinion must wait until the smoke of conflict is dispelled , and the boom of guns is hushed . From this point of view we regard the work of Dr. Fisher as exceedingly timely . He has traversed three centuries with a grave , reverent and cautious tread . lie has seen with his own eyes , and weighed in the scale of his own judgment , and decided with his own conscience everything in his path , whether it weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or against the system to which he himself adheres . In selecting facts which are representative in the vast series , facts which interpret the character of the systems which be . got them , and in the arrangement of these facts so that they shall exhibit the life and force of truth , Dr. Fisher has shown remarkable skill . Rarely has a historian exercised so great a self-restraint , yet seemed to need to exercise so little , in keeping the color of his own views out of his narrative , in letting the facts speak their own meaning without the aid of the showman 's stress or emphasis or pointer . His materials he has studied thoroughly , what he saw he has painted truly , with taste and judgment he has hung his pictures ( each a monograph ) , and has left them to interpret each other and to make their own appeal to the candid judgment of men . And it is our earnest conviction that this work is adapted not only to confirm the friends but to conciliate the enemies of the Reformation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines are put down , the author of this book has trusted to a " plain , unvarnished tale " to put them down . Prof. Schdrer has said : " It is of the nature of a conviction to aspire to win proselytes . " Dr. Fisher is not a man without convictions ; yet there is evidence in every line of his work that he would have his proselytes enter at the gate of truth alone , and not at the door of his argument or persuasion . For proof of the merit we claim and of the approbation we challenge for this work , let the reader observe the critical and candid spirit with which the author weighs the characters of Calvin , of Cranmer , of Luther , of Erasmus , of Knox , of William of Orange , of Henry VIII . ; let him note the careful study of motives which led to the abjuration of Henry IV . ; let him observe the foreground view of the iconoclasm of the 1-lugnenots and the excesses of the Anabaptists , whilst the background of their provocations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free , full and just handling of the Puritan controversy , of the persecutions by Protestants , and their own censorship of the press , when the power was in their hands ; let him observe the wise discussion of the relative claims of the Renaissance and the Reformation to be the parent of modern free thought ; in short , let him note on every page of this book the setting given to truth as a priceless jewel whereVer found , by whomsoever held . We commend this book with its lessons of historical wisdom alike to the statesman , the Protestant , the Catholic , the Rationalist , and the Humanist-the communicant in the church of " Sweetness and Light . " In our boyhood we fondly supposed that the American people had learned many of these lessons finally and forever . Maturer years have taught us that ever and anon fresh instruction is needed even in long-accepted and widely-received tin th . Indications are not wanting that the present is such a time of need . Among many other lessons taught by this retrospect of three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of church and State is wisest for us and truest in itself ; that the great doctrine of toleration is the product of the party most persecuted ; that it is not wise to govern too much ; that persecution lends effectual help to any cause ; that dis // organizing theories prevail most where the human mind has been longest repressed ; that even wise innovation must make haste slowly , and expect only a gradual victory over habit and prejudice ; that zeal for outward conformity is an easy pathway not only to cruel persecutions even by good men but also to skepti , cism ; that while there is great danger in blending a political and a religious question in the same contest , it must be done if religion seizes an advantage with the hands of the State ; that it is a mistake to suppose that the decay of corrupt forms of Christianity is the disappearance of Christianity itself ; that arrested development in morals or in religion is strictly analogous to arrested development in the physical man ; that the establishment of any principle as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the usages and customs by which it has expressed itself ; that the social blending of religious bodies is important to the permanence of the political fabric which gives them a common shelter ; that in proportion as Protestantism plants itself on the Bible , it gains as a cause and gains as a religion also ; and that human nature in the long run proves itself a dangerous subject on which to make experiments . These are only a tithe of the lessons of this noble work . Such a book assures its own place . It is a " standard " from the hour of its publication . Morris 's Latest Poem . * THIS is another of those delicate myths of No-land that Mr. Morris 's tireless fancy spins out with an unbroken stretch of tenuous thought . It is , like the rest , fine as the gossamer , sprinkled with sparkles of morning dew , that drops lightly on fresh grass-bladesas beautiful and unserviceable as that fabric of cobweb and pearls . These are just the qualities of his verse that we do not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enough of metaphysical verse twisted into subtle disquisition by knots of paradox ; and too much of that sensuous melody that sets words afire with passion , or drugs and drowns them in languor . Morris 's lines flow refreshingly cool and limpid after all those puzzles and throbs of the spasmodic school . To pass to him from Swinburne is like dipping into a mountain brook after being showered with the hot bursts of a geyser . The thought , too , is as simple as the form , and if its iteration grows a little monotonous through a quantity of verse so facile and fluent that one wonders why it ever ends , rather than how it runs so long , still the diversity in repetition is wonderful . Not that his range of language is wide ; for except an occasional quaintness of epithet , and here and there a half-obsolete turn or phrase rescued and well-placed , there is no remarkable richness of diction . The sameness of substance is concealed by the device of turning an un changing thought in all possible lights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought , of the same familiar words with all their associations , aids in producing the effect of persistent calmness in variety . Variety in unity is one of the definitions of the beautiful : but it would lead us farther than our limits permit to explain why we think that Morris 's poetry does not rise so high as to merit this description , which certainly differs from the modulated uniformity that he deserves and wins praise for attaining . From dwelling on the bare simplicity of the thought that Love is enough , the poet takes care not to tempt us away by any lavish picturesqueness of description such as warms and colors his earlier poems . The proof that it is so sufficing must of course be reached through contrast . If love is to be known as out weighing all the other joys and glories of earth , nothing but their possession and loss can test its worth . So the only figure in the poem that stands out less shadowy , than the rest is a prince , Pharamond , who is won away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vision of.a remote and unknown beauty , which he follows through wanderings and misery , attaining at last and enjoying it , and then returning to find his kingdom usurped , and not worth regaining , since Love is enough , with no other thing added . To have made this quest the framework for tales of perilous adventure and strange temptation met with knightly constancy would have been quite in the vein of the poet 's earlier work . But the hardships that befell the errant lover are barely hinted , not even sketched , and the rapture that rewards him is shaped into no clearer material form than a waking stir , a touch , a few spoken words , can give to his dream that vanishes again almost as soon as it is embodied in a woman 's presence . His treatment *f the subiect is more metaphysical and less concrete even than is usual with him , in this respect , that the Spirit of Love appears literally from time to time on the stage , holding the clew and giving the explanation of the successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poem almost wholly wants the action and coloring that relieve the singular unreality of the author 's former figures revived from fable , it is scarcely necessary to add that the result , though still pleasing and graceful , is jejune and thin . It is the demonstration , traced as abstractly as it is possible to be done with the slightest touches of image and illustration , that Love is all-sufficient . And the same peculiarity is maintained through this poem which it seemed from the beginning must be fatal to any per . manence of interest or fame for the author . As if aiming to make the creations of his fancy as shadowy and unlike human ones as possible , he carefully withholds from them the least semblance of humanity that does not touch this present life alone , and concern a spirit and work that end with it . A phrase or two of Scripture , curiously and naturally enough wrought into the verse , brings with it a passing association * Love is Enoug-k : or , the Freeing of Pharamond : A Moreality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher and remoter aspirations  --  but the range of the whole , as always , is sedulously kept as if within a mortal horizon that bounds and terminates life . Even with this restriction , the theme is a very noble one , and it is illustrated with very pure and noble trains of thought . It is high praise for an author that he charms and attracts by his mere poetic graces and subtleties , while exalting love as the master-motive of human action , and leaving in us the faith that loyalty to it , even through bitterness and grief ; is sure of its reward . An American-French Novel . THE late struggle of French and German armies on French soil has not , as yet , been greatly celebrated in poetry or fiction . Native writers must regain their breath before they can do justice to the subject ; and no foreign pen can ever limn correctly any great feature of the contest . MM . Erckmann-Chatrian 's story of the Plebiscite is the best literary achievement which has issued from the minds of men disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much a novel as a history . That a young American should have the courage to take up any part of the tragedy which ebbed and flowed around Paris during The Siege is sufficiently characteristic of youth and Americanism ; both these are audacious . Mr. Edward King has made a story based on incidents immediately synchronous with Ducrot ' s last sortie from Paris ; he calls it Kentucky 's Love ; or , Roughing It Around Paris . ( Lee &amp; Shepard . ) It is a weak title for a strong book . It is a strong book ; it opens with a crash and bang of artillery , a galloping to and fro , and a hissing of bullets overhead most distracting . It is due to the author to say that he keeps up the crashing and banging , the galloping and the bullet-whistling to the very end . The key may be pitched too high ; but it is never lowered to the dull level of normal life-which is conceding something to the author 's skill . If a player bounds on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece , as Charlotte Cushman used as Meg Merrilies , we see that great power will be required to maintain the subsequent action at so lofty a height ; otherwise , the pyramid stands on its apex ; we have reached the climax prematurely and there remains naught but superfluous lagging on the stage . Mr. King gives us plenty of blue-fire and alarums in his opening chapters ; but he skillfully substitutes a human interest for the dominant war-chords with wl*ich his book opens ; and we are led out of the danger of arms into the mazes of a love-story , of which the interest never flags until our unhappy and somewhat exasperating hero is dragged out of the Seine-dead as a door-nail . The plot of the story is wildly improbable ; but it is pervaded with so much local color and realism that one forgets probabilities in its deceptive atmosphere . Margaret , the heroine , is an absurd impossibility ; her adventures are as fantastic as those of a Japanese fairy ; but the wintry parks of Versailles , the tender beauty of the landscape near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving infantry and cavalry are all painted with such extraordinary fidelity that we think everything must have happened just as related ; it is the Special Correspondent writing out one of the plots of the elder Dumas . Though the movement is hurried and even feverish , the author takes ample time to garnish his tale with many charming pictures . He has an artist 's appreciation for color and atmospheric effects . There are landscapes that might have been painted by Achenbach , and single figures which remind one of Toulmouche . Moreover , the heart of the story beats regularly to its close ; and the ending is traditionally correct . The marrying is in the right place and by the right people ; the knotty threads are judiciously snipped and appear no more to mar the beauty of the web . Kentucky 's Love is a notable story because it shows great power . To be sure , it is the power which we recognize in the bold , rude sketch of an untaught hand ; but it is the hand of genius , for all that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone up ! Let us be thankful that our young author has so much of promise in him , and so little to discourage . This slender book is but a sketch ; its informing purpose is taken from a - recent tragedy , which itself was so full of stress and strain , that no mortal man can found upon it any fiction that shall rival its own great mournfulness . But it reveals a power of delineation , a vigor of style and tenderness of affection which augur well for the future success of the author , when he shall have been ripened and chastened by experience and study . The Home . WHEN one considers the condition of ignorance and helplessness in which many a young couple , at the outset of their married life , undertake the serious work of establishing a home ; and when one remembers how much of meaning that word has or ought to have , the necessity for such a little volume as has lately appeared in Putnam 's Handy Book Series , will be sufficiently evident . ( The Home : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; By Frank R. and Marian Stockton : Putnam . ) The little book is not much bigger than a tract , and not so big as an average Sunday-school book , but it has in it so much of suggestiveness of a wholesome and practical sort , that if there were envy in the souls of such religious corporations as manufacture books and tracts , ( if ; being corporations , they could be presumed to have souls at all , ) they might well be jealous of the usefulness of this manual . It deals , to be sure , only with the externals of the home ; it has no words of high morality or of religious edification . But when one remembers how much the happiness of home d*pends on these externals , and how much more likely it is that the household will be virtuous and beautiful if the house is well chosen , well furnished , and well ordered , it will be // seen that this volume will be all the surer to do good for the reason that its aim is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible Revision . To those who wish to know precisely what has been undertaken by that illustrious company of scholars in England and America , in whose hands the revision of our English New Testament is already making progress , a volume just now issued from the press of Harper &amp; Bros. will give all necessary information . ( The Revision of the English Version of the New Testament , with an Introducti*n by Philzp Schaft D. D. Harper &amp; Bros . ) The book consists of three distinct treatises , each of which might make a good-sized volume , and any one of which would be of uncommon value . The first is by Dr. Lightfoot , whose learned labors as a commentator on the Scriptures entitle him to speak with authority on such a subject . The second is by Dr. Trench , the Archbishop of Dublin , whose name at once suggestS the most finished and elegant criticism in regard to the use of the English language . The third is by Dr. Ellicott , the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol , of whom it is enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this volume places him . We have thus , in the compass of a few hundred pages , not only the suggestions of these scholars as to what the work of revision ought to be , but also examples of revision so numerous and so detailed that , until the work is finished , this volume is worthy to take rank among the books indispensable to a coinplete critical and exegetical apparatus . The indices are so many and so full , that the use of it for purposes of exegetical study will be very easy . Students in seminaries , pastors in their studies , will be glad to have it at hand , and to accept it as an earnest of the good work which is being accomplished by the company of judicious and devout revisers who are already busy . That their work is a good one ( which some have doubted ) this volume is by far the most satisfactory evidence that has yet been furnished . Mrs. Oliphant 's " At His Gates . " * MONEY , besides working so many other wonders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole class of novels turns . Conceive a man of enormou* wealth , not inherited , but accumulated , which presupposes a brain large enough to control and distribute it well ; provide him with luxurious tastes , a selfish heart , and easy principles , and all the elements of a romance of modern life gather about him of themselves . Such a man is a sort of omnipotence , essential to every class , and affecting a thousand individuals . And if he sets his will to living splendidly at their cost , risking their ruin , it must be a very poor novelist that can not construct a respectable story out of the mere play and crossing of his business connections . An ordinary writer , of course , runs the risk of shaping such a plot so as to produce only commonplace situations , from the crude contrasts of wealth and poverty , vulgarized. by their auriferons atmosphere . Mrs. Oliphant 's true and delicate perception of character raises this contribution to the romance of bankruptcy far above that dull level . It is a triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her former admirable fictions were so fine , yet various , like an elaborate embroidery upon the plain canvas of Miss Mitford , that there was danger lest the device of attaching the fortunes of all her personages to those of a fraudulent banker might lower and narrow the influences traced in their development . But within the range so chosen she employs all the nice discrimination and consistent sequence that always make her sketches of men and women individual and coherent . She deals with moral positions more than material ones ; the springs of the lives she depicts are more studied than their framework . Their mere circumstances fall naturally into the background , and the alternations of fortune appear as the results , not the creators , of character . This is particularly the effect with the women , of whom there are two very well defined types in this novel , standing out so independent of their surroundings that we feel each might pass into the worldly condition of the other , yet remain essentially unchanged . The heroine , Helen Drummond , a bourgeoise child of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genius disappoints her , consents to his becoming a director in a banking business for which he is ludicrously unfit , under the control of her cousin , Burton . The conflict in her feelings between gratitude for her husband 's affection , and half-romantic contempt for his mere talent , is skillfully traced . The cousin , her rejected lover , is the millionaire of the story , lavish , ostentatious , taking credit for the good his money can not help doing , partly the dupe and partly the accomplice of his associate Golden . His patronage of Helen in her good and evil fortunes betrays by subtle suggestion the coarse satisfaction of a common nature taking its revenge for her e*trly rejection of him . Less is made of Golden than might have been , though quite enough of him is hinted . Mrs. Oliphant is so good in many better things that she wants sympathy for being good at villains : The banker 's wife , Mrs. Burton , is passionless , feelingless , a mere mental machine , a Rochefoucauld in petticoats . Though quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , she does nothing to check them , busy with pitiless analysis of every one and everything , and content if her formulas applied to life work out the result in each case that everything is natural , because everything is bad . Burton , of course , makes a timely escape with his millions from the crash of the bank , of which Golden contrives to shift the blame upon the inexperienced Drummond ; and he , in turn , sinking under disgrace , attempts a suicide in which he * At his Gates : by Mrs. Oliphant . Scribner , Armstrong &amp; Co . Being the first vol. in S. , A. &amp; Co. ' s " Library of Choice Fic-ion- ' , // is supposed to succeed . His wife devotes herself to subtle feminine revenge , by disturbing the Burtons ' plans of family aggrandizement , a course which Mrs. Burton calmly inspects , accepts as quite natural , and coolly promotes in part , out of dislike to her own daughter . Meantime Burton 's reckless frauds involve his fortunes , and though Helen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she withdraws from her schemes , it is too late to prevent his dishonorable ruin . Its occurrence reveals Drummond 's innocence , and restores him to Helen after his seven years ' absence from England . In those years Golden has contrived to save a good deal of money by successive misfortunes in business , has escaped expulsion from his clubs , and , having run away with Burton 's daughter , takes up his tranquil abode in Italy . As 1-lelen , the creature of impulse and feeling , is contrasted with the cold , calculating banker 's wife , so Golden finds his nobler. opposite in the carefully drawn figure of Stephen Haldane . A dissenting preacher of great power and promise , he becomes one of Burton 's victims , and suffers a severer blow from sudden disease , which paralyzes his useful activity , and confines him helplessly for the rest of his life to his couch . The patience and serenity with which he maintains his difficult position in poverty among his less intelligent brethren and his commonplace exacting flock , never cherishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight but masterly touches . Quite as nice discrimination is shown in the management of the minor characters that help the action of the story , too many and too distinct to be separately noticed as they deserve within our limits . This novel , like others founded upon the fluctuations of fortune in its narrow sense , gives a complete answer to those who reproach Tame with laying so much stress on the . enormous power of wealth in England , and designating it as the spring of that incessant desperate struggle throughout the social scale , which im. partially decrees all good things in life to those who can keep up , and utter hopelessness to those who go down . But it does far more , with a higher object . Admitting for the purposes of her art the inexorable control of money in our day , and accepting it as almost the modern embodiment of the Fate that was believed of old to rule mortal actions , the author finds in resistance to its dominion occasions for celel ) rating the endurance and courage and aspiration that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Bushnell 's poem , " Absence , " wherein the words are arranged correctly ; - which , owing to an infirmity of the types , was not the case in the original publication in our March num. her Gone is the nameless charm that hinds The outer world in kinship blest ,  - -  The interchange , the light refrain ; And twixt our sonla , that once were near , Lie leagues of stirless atmosphere , Asleep upon a silent main : Nothing to-day its heart-mate finds , Nor any answer to its quest . s@@85620 THE RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS . THE golden sentence in the second Inaugural of President Grant , in our judgment , was , in more senses than one , that in which he avowed his anxiety to bring our currency to a fixed ( gold ) value . It was the expectation of the country that this consummation , so devoutly to be wished , would be reached during his first Presidential term . The preservation of the faith of the nation by paying its debts in coin , when due , was almost ostentatiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of principles , which raised him to power . That this has been neglected till a terrible financial panic forces attention to it , is deeply to be deplored ,  --  nay , to vast multitudes it is the one profound regret in regard to the movement of our National politics . Of course we still more deeply deplore the developments of bribery , embezzlement , and rapacity in public office . But this we conceive has closer implications with the demoralization involved in this virtual , if as yet partial , repudiation of some of our national promises , than might at first sight appear . If the nation has promised , and does promise in its legal tender notes to pay three hundred and fifty millions of dollars , be the same more or less , and not only declines , but makes no serious attempt , or indication of a decided purpose , to pay them , is it keeping faith ? Is it practicing honesty ? Is it not delinquent in duty ? Is it not setting an example of faithlessness through its government , the supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread its gangrene through its people , officers and servants of every grade ? How deplorably do the States lately in rebellion , but subdued and reconstructed , follow this great example in reference to their own debts ? We plead for the resumption of coin payments , at the earliest day practicable without producing serious financial stricture or commercial panic , because the national faith , morality , and honor require it . Surely the faith and honor of the nation require that it fulfill its promises and obligations voluntarily assumed . But this is precisely what the nation promises in its legal tenders . It promises to pay dollars . What dollars ? Surely coin dollars , precisely what had always been meant by the dollars promised on every bank-bill or other paper then circulating as currency . Th'at this is so , and can not be otherwise , appears . i . Because no other conceivable meaning attaches to the word . 2 . The legal tender act did not undertake to demonetize the precious metals , or abolish the coin standard of value . It was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by requiring the nation 's , and other , creditors , for the present distress , to accept , in lieu of money , or rather as money , the promise to pay that money-no time of payment being named because it was the mutual understanding of all that it should be done as soon as government could command the means . It was like the case of other debtors of ample ultimate means which they can not for the time realize in cash , whose creditors are therefore compelled to take up with promises to pay cash in future , instead of getting it at once . That this is so , appears still further from the fact that the government even then maintained the coin standard without interruption in paying the interest and principal of the public debt , and in its receipts for custom dues . By excepting these from the operation of the legal tender measure , it most emphatically declared that measure exceptional and temporary-only for the present exigency  --  and this was still further indicated by making these legal tenders // themselves , convertible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin . Thus coin was recognized as the true and enduring standard . It is therefore past all doubt that the greenback promises to pay dollars , are promises to pay coin dollars to the bearer on demand , at the earliest time reasonably practicable . If there could be the shadow of doubt on this subject , Congress , speaking the mind and will of the nation , removed it in the solemn declaratory enactment which was the first bill signed by President Grant after his accession to the Presidency . As follows : " NONE of said interest bearing obligations not already due shall be paid or redeemed before maturiay , unless at such time United States notes shall be convertible into coin at tile ottion of the holder , or unless , at such time , bonds of the United States bearing a lower rate of interest than the bonds to be redeemed can be sold at par in coin ; and the United States also solemnly pledges its faith to make provision at the earliest practical period for the redemption of United States notes in coin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputed longer what the nation has promised ? or that it pledged itself to redeem these promises at the earliest practical period ? What efforts have been made to redeem these pledges ? The process contemplated in these promises has been completely reversed ; not an effort has been made , or a step taken towards " the redemption of United States notes in coin. ** But means ample and more than ample to do this have been applied to redeem " those interest bearing obligations not already due , " which it is declared shall not " be paid or redeemed before maturity , unless at such time United States notes shall be convertible into coin at the option of the holder . " Nor has the other alternative allowing such redemption occured-for notoriously the new five per cent ; could not be " sold at par in coin . " The syndicate who paid nominal par , paid really between 98 and 99 through a dexterous arrangement for a three months ' use of the money without interest . We have little doubt that if government had fulfilled its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have saved far more than the cost in the better terms it could have made for exchanging at a lower rate of interest its obligations not yet due-as we trust will yet more decisively appear . Why the government during the last four years should thus have goi'se back upon its own solemnly declared purpose , policy and promise , has not yet appeared . We can conceive no shadow of a reason for it . Still further , the legal tender act was nothing else than an extreme exercise of the war power , in order to save the national life . From overbearing necessity it took this method of raising a forced loan to be repaid at the earliest practicable moment , by a law impairing the obligation of contracts , such as the constitution expressly prohibits any State to pass . It destroyed the obligation of the contracts on the part of debtors to pay coin dollars . While justifiable as the exercise of a war power , and as one of the anomalies of war , ( inter arma Zeges silent ) , its indefinite continuance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , is no more defensible than continued conscriptions , military occupation and seizure , martial law , or suspension of habeas corpus . We plant ourselves first of all then here , on this perfectly impregnable position . The national faith is pledged . National morality requires the fulfillment of the nation 's promises " at the earliest practicable period . " Not to struggle for it , with all its power , is national dishonor . This is enough . If all other arguments were adverse , this more than outweighs them . Even if it could be shown , as it can not , for the contrary is true that it is hostile to national wealth or material interests , still the national faith , honor , and morality are more and higher than all these . What ! will the nation unhesitatingly spend hundreds of millions to vindicate the honor of its flag against insult , and shall it grudge any sacrifices necessary to keep its word and pledge of honor untarnished ? If once the mind of the nation is brought fairly to apprehend and face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt the issue . But we are prepared to vindicate this measure from the lower stand-point of expediency as respects the material interest of the nation . Indeed , in the long run , honesty is always the best policy for na* tions as well as individuals . The credit of the government would be so improved that it would speedily gain more than the cost of resumption in the improved terms it could make with its creditors . There is no question that the rates at which government can borrow , as in the case of individual borrowers , will be low in proportion to the confidence of lend* ers in the markets of the world , that it will religiously and punctually discharge // every pecuniary obligation or promise according to the tenor thereof . And on the other hand , in proportion as a nation staggers at or shrinks from the fulfillment of any of its promises , or leaves their fulfillment in doubt , will its credit be lowered , and the cost of , or interest on , all its loans enhanced . This is self-evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this on our own nation parried by the claim that our gold-bearing bonds and legal-tender notes stand on a different footing , and that the non-payment of the latter is no argument against the certain payment of the gold explicitly promised in the former . For have we not proved that the nation has just as explicity pledged itself to pay the latter in coin as soon as practicable ? Jf therefore , it shrinks from doing this , or attempting to do it , " at the earliest practicable period , " what guarantee have lenders that it may not shrink from paying other dues , when it becomes severely onerous ? In our judgment , there is not the slightest question that the resumption of specie payments would enable the government at once to fund the national debt in the markets of the world at lower rates of interest . Not only so , but our own people would much more eagerly seek these securities , both on account of the increased credit of the government , and because , even at a higher specie price , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . As we now write , with gold ruling at xi6 at j*7** if a creditor collects a mortgage in legal tender and invests it in U.

This he will be slow to do , when so many forms of perfectly secure investment are open to him , which will yield him from 7 to 8 per cent , and in the end make good , and more than make good , the original investment . A 5 , probably a 4 ' 2 , if not 4 per cent. , gold interest , U. S. bond at par , free of taxation , would be a favorite form of investment , in multitudes of our tax-ridden towns-and with free banking organized with proper safeguards , a still larger stimulus would be givento the home demand for these securities . This brings us to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expedient and economical* not only for the government and for the people as represented and acting through the government , but for the people in their private material interests , and in all their business transactions as concerned in the production , exchange , and consumption of commodities . i . Our present inoonvertible and capriciously fluctuating currency greatly enhances the risks and other costs of legitimate business , and consequently the cost of all articles of subsistence . Over and above all other risks is that arising from the varying premium on gold to the importer , who must pay for his goods in gold or its equivalent at the price of purchase . Now , suppose that between the day of sale in this country , On time , for currency prices , and of getting his pay with which to discharge the foreign debt incurred in the original purchase , the price of gold rises five or six per cent. , as more than once within the past twelve months , there is that amount of loss from this source . This repeated upon the vast amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their capital repeatedly during the year , is enough to make all the difference between large profits and heavy losses as the result of their trade . It makes no difference in the end , as to the ultimate effect on the cost of trade , if the importers sell exclusively for specie . The effect of this is to transfer the risk to the jobbers . It falls upon some stage of the trade so long as our legal currency is not of the standard adopted by the whole commercial world , or in any fixed ratio of approximation to it . Now , risk always enhances the cost of business , and of all the goods which that business is instrumental in bringing to the consumer . The profits , in the long run , and taking the average of business , must be so gauged as to insure against it , even as they must suffice to cover all kinds of risk or insurance-in other words , the expense of keeping the capital good , besides a net gain after these and all other expenses are paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects our exports , here bought and sold on our legal tender basis , but exchanged in the markets of the world upon a gold basis . *This paper was written when gold was ruling at these rates , and subject to the other phenomena noticed hereafter . The recent financial panic has served to illustrate and confirm several positions taken in this paper , and in that on Banking and currency in the April number of this Magazine-both written months before its occurrence // It throws another uncertain element , therefore , into all domestic products which enter the markets of the world . Thus all commodities of home or foreign production become dearer to the consumer , in consequence of the uncertainties and variations which aggravate the hazards and cost of trade . And this pernicious influence penetrates every industrial occupation , every department of production , and exchange . How greatly has it aggravated the unsatisfactory results of business for the last year ? 2 . This is closely connected with one of the financial pests growing out of our irredeemable currency  --  the gold exchange of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the legitimate trade in specie rendered necessary in such circumstances , ( this were enough , ) but upon all manner of piratical raids and tricks to aggravate it . It opens a new field to the Nimrods of Wall street . The supply of gold is usually so closely graduated to the exigencies of the demand to settle foreign balances , that it is as easy to force an artificial scarcity and rise of price , by purchasing and segregating a few millions of it , as to tighten the loan market by locking up greenbacks , and forcing the banks below their legal tender limit , which disables them from further loans . Our inconvertible currency generates a class of speculators who thrive by preying upon the commerce , the industry , and the resources of the country . Their vocation is to unsettle values , and foment financial derangements . This sort of speculation , after luxuriating upon real and groundless panics and disasters of the war , which it used every bad and lying device to aggravate , reached its malign climax during peace , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation . But it is constantly felt now as a disturbing force , producing twinges and strictures of its own , which aggravate all other causes of financial disturbance in the country . Now , a return to the coin basis would make an end of this most mischievous , often nefarious , occupation . 3 . For the reasons already mentioned , it would abridge the scope of vicious speculation . We say vicious speculation , for there is such a thing as legitimate speculative investment in commodities , which , there is reasonable ground for believing , will rise in price , without incurring unwarrantable risks , or resorting to gambling adventures , or unprincipled methods of enhancing prices . But there is an illegitimate speculation , which differs little from gambling , and tasks the energies and resources of large numbers of men . A few of these , like keepers of gambling-houses , win large fortunes , and swallow up the fortunes of the great mass , who are enticed , by their glittering success , to make a like plunge for fortune , which is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gambling speculators work unmitigated evil . They force stocks , and other commodities which they touch , up or down , by devices wholly irrespective of their real value ; by monopolizing a given kind , and tempting large numbers to agree to sell and deliver the article to them at a certain figure , they themselves , meanwhile , having so manipulated or monopolized it that the dupe of their tricks is compelled to buy of them , at rates far above what they agreed to pay him , in order to fulfill his contract . Or vice versa ; they ' agree to sell for delivery at a future time , at what seems a low rate , to others whom they tempt to agree to take it at this rate . Then they resort to the opposite device of contriving by various arts , prominent among which are damaging fictitious reports , for the purpose of unduly lowering the price ; so that thus they may buy at a low rate what others have agreed to take from them at a higher rate . This gambling speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects-ihoral , economical , commercial . It has all the pernicious excitements of gambling . It instigates a multitude of immoral strategems . It contributes in no way to the production of a tittle of wealth . It subserves no end useful to society . It is simply a process by which a class of men , who contribute nothing to the support of society , manage to seize the wealth produced by others . The railroads , for example , that have been so largely gulped by speculators , were the products of the industry , earnings , and savings of others . The collossal fortunes of the former consist of what they have wrenched , by the deal and throw of their cards , from the vast number of weaklings foolish enough to play with them , and of the earnings of others who sunk their money and labor in the road thus passed into the possession of the speculator . As a stupendous example , whose money built the Erie Railroad , and who have made fortunes by grasping or robhing it ? Prolific , // however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our main topic into any lengthened discussion of this or any merely subsidiary point . It may safely be assumed that gambling speculations are among the great moral , social , and financial evils of the country . Now , an inconvertible currency , of variable and uncertain value , immensely increases the facilities and temptations to a vocation which thrives on uncertainties . That specie payments would put an end to such speculation , and its enormous evils , it would surely be chimerical to maintain . That it would abate them , and the great loss to the industry and wealth of the nation caused by them , is undeniable . 4 . The mischiefs of a currency not conformed to the monetary standards of the commercial world are already developing in formidable proportions , which seem to us but the beginning of the end , in the shape which railway and other loans are taking . In order to improve our vast undeveloped regions and resources , it is necessary to attract capital here from the great loan-markets of the world . This is especially necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and projected , without which , in this era , all other means for developing resources are unavailing . In order to attract this capital , not only are high rates of interest necessary , but the medium of payment , principal and interest , must be in what the commercial world recognizes as the only money-i.e. , the precious metals . The consequence is that nearly all recent railway and , more or less , other loans , are made with the pledge of payment in gold , principal and interest . Now , these , added to the gold loans of the government , create a great and increasing demand for coin , even to meet the semi-annual interest . Only the loans of old-established and prosperous railways can of late be negotiated on any other basis . Even these are rapidly coming to it . One effect of this is already apparent , along with other causes yet tobe noted , in the frequent raising of the premium on gold , and depreciation of our currency . This tendency , it seems to us , must continue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resumption of specie payments . The disastrous consequences must be more pervading than appears on a superficial view . It not only means all the mischiefs of every kind resulting from a depreciation of the currency going lengths which none can foresee , but it means enormous and constantly-increasing rates of interest for these railway loans . The average net yield of these loans to the roads is not over eighty-five per cent . in currency . On this , seven dollars , or about eight per cent . interest , in gold , must be paid , while the ultimate payment of the principal must be in gold for their face . Now , it is easy to see that , if the gold premium advances , the annual interest charge for these loans must become prodigious . The consecfuence is that their charges for transportation must be increasingly severe , in order to keep out of bankruptcy , much more to earn any profit on the share capital . Not only so ; but these enormous rates for so large a class of the loans of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all other loans . How much they have to do with the present ( March , 1873 ) dear rates of money may be conjectured , but not certainly known . We can not forecast how far this may run . It is quite certain that , with our present currency system , railway loans will be pushed till they directly or indirectly exceed the capacity or the disposition of . the loan markets of the world to take them , or , under the thin disguise of seven or eight per cent. , gold , at our indefinitely advancing premiums , reach a grade of currency interest virtually ruinous . When these last and the following sentences were written , gold was rising at the rate of 3 or 4 per cent . a week with panicky predictions of a further rapid and indefinite rise . The default of interest payments on railroad loans has since gone so far as to render the negotiation of bonds of unfinished roads impossible . The floating railroad debentures which awaited the sale of such bonds for their liquidation have therefore gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached its terrific climax on September 20th . In its antecedents and consequents this has more than verified our predictions and reasonings. 5 . The absence of specie payments removes one of the chief checks to the excessive accumulation of foreign indebtedness , as well as other forms of feverish and exaggerated commercial action . We are not of those who entertain a rabid dread of all foreign indebtedness . So long as capital can be borrowed from the old world , at rates which enable us to employ // it in developing the resources of our own country at a profit , we hold that such use of it is alike advantageous to Europe and the United States . Indebtedness to Europe thus incurred is not a bad omen . Indebtedn ess incurred for luxuries which we con*me , but can not pay for , or for internal *rnprovements and railroads , which will riot pay interest on the loans obtained to : onstruct them , are evil , evil only , and that continually . The further it goes on the more disastrous the financial convulsion in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to a greater and more pernicious length with an irredeemable than a metallic currency . Any unhealthy foreign indebtedness of this kind is sure to make itself felt on a specie system in ways which must arrest it . The balances against us must be met in coin . This will instantly draw upon the coin reserves in banks and elsewhere , thus contracting currency and loan facilities , under the threatened danger of being compelled to stop specie payments  --  a crisis , which , under a specie system , all commercial interests must gird themselves to avert . Thus the unhealthy increase of foreign debt promptly manifests itself , and is as promptly arrested . But under an inconvertible currency it can go on much further , because more stealthily . No such crisis is at once brought on in our present monetary and commercial system . Gold indeed grows scarce . It commands an increasing premium . But this is readily paid by those in want of foreign goods or capital . Eager borrowers , for railways , or luxurious indulgence , or speculations , will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans and their interest obligations as long as they can induce lenders to trust them at whatever rates , until at last they are crushed beyond recovery by the burdens they have assumed . Is it not perfectly notorious that from 20 to 100 per cent . interest has been paid during the last year for weeks and months , in order to attract the funds of lenders ? Can legitimate business long endure such a cost of its capital ? Or can such a course of things go on without ending in the direst financial upturnings and convulsions ? And all the worse the longer it goes on ? Were it not far better that such morbid inflation of credit be quickly and sharply punctured by the inexorable demands of a specie standard , than stealthily protracted and aggravated by the insidious working of irredeemable paper ? The recent commercial crisis would have come earlier , and with far less severity , under a specie standard . A PERMANENTLY INCONVERTIBLE CURRENCY EXAMINED . But the treatment of this subject is incomplete till we consider the scheme of a currency perpetually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as the true ideal of a money system . Of this there are two principal forms . i . Those who say that we need no change in our present currency , that it is the best we have ever had , and will only be the worse for all tinkering . As to the perfection of our present currency , we add nothing to what has already been said . Argument is lost upon those who think a currency has reached ideal perfection which fluctuates several per cent . in a week , and holds over us the menace of a continual shrinkage of its value . But there is one ground of plausibility in this representation of the comparative superiority of our present currency , which is wholly disconnected with its specie or non-specie paying qualities . We refer to its being , as it always should have been , of national instead of State issue , and secured by pledge of national stocks , which make it of equal value , and current without discount , in all parts of the country . This characteristic adheres to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . of coin . This is an inestimable advantage . But it has nothing to do with the irredeemability of our currency , or rather mitigates its evils , and would be all the greater if it were redeemable . Yet , great as were the inconvenience and loss from the merely locally bankable character of the bills of the old State banks , they were very slight in comparison with the enormous evils now suffered from an irredeemable currency . We will only add , that while specie redemption will secure this in addition to all other advantages , on the other hand , the project of making our present currency forever , or indefinitely , inconvertible , promises only an increasing aggravation of the evils which we now suffer . The moment the currency comes to be regarded as permanently irredeemable , it is quite likely to enter on a course of permanent and indefinite depreciation . Its promises to pay come to mean promises to pay itself , or one promise to pay with another promise to pay , one bit of engraved // paper with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It derives its whole value from its debt-paying power arbitrarily given , in fraud and robbery of creditors . But even this constantly grows less . For in all subsequent transactions creditors will lend less and less commodities to be repaid in such a medium . Thht is , its purchasing power will decline . As this grows less , increased amounts of it are required to purchase a given quantity of goods whether for cash or on credit z. e. , it requires a greater number of dollars to pay or discharge a debt for a given quantity of comrhodities . In other words , after the robbery of successive sets of creditors by discharging their dues in a depreciated medium , debts are ultimately contracted on the basis of this depreciated currency , and it can pay for no more than iX is counted worth . A consequence of this is , that a given amount of money becomes adequate to exchange only a less amount of commodities . Hence increasing amounts are necessary to perform the exchanges of society . Therefore , unless the nominal amount be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high rates of interest in proportion to its depreciation . We have the paradox of money at once cheap and dear , but in different senses-cheap as to exchangeable value , but dear as to rate per cent . at which it can be borrowed . This is precisely the phenomenon we have been witnessing , money scarce and dear , yet constantly depreciated . This evokes aloud cry for more currency or legal tenders , which , by further diluting the money standard , aggravates all these evils . This brings us to the second project for demonetizing the precious metals , and substituting for them a permanently inconvertible currency , . which contemplates not only its indefinite continuance , but indefinite increase . It is the pet scheme of labor reformers and other visionaries . It proposes to make an end of the precious metals as money ; to have the government issue , as now , legal tender treasury notes , redeemable at all times in a government bond , at a low rate of interest , some say 2 , others 3 , others 3.65 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holder . These bonds in return to be convertible for their face in greenbacks at the pleasure of the holder . This is a bright scheme for providing plenty of money and plenty of stocks and bonds for the government and the people . But like other bubbles it quickly bursts . According to this scheme ioo dollars in greenbacks is to be worth a hundred dollar bond , yielding 2 , 3 , or 3.65 per cent . yearly of similar greenbacks . They would be of inferior value even if this rate of interest were payable in gold . But what can they be worth when it is payable only in bits of paper like themselves , forever irredeemable , and irrelative to coin or other substances of real value ? The value of any promise to pay a dollar depends wholly on its adequacy to secure what it promises , and is proportional to the prospect , the immediateness , or remoteness of its convertibility into it . Aside of this it is a nullity , no better than any other bit of paper . The value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt-paying power ; also their convertibility during the war into goldbearing bonds at 5 and 6 per cent ; their limitation in quantity to something like the amount of specie that would take their place if abolished ; and above all , to the expectation of their being paid in coin at no distant period . Remove the two latter , and the former will soon be of little avail . But it is said their value is ensured because they are backed by the faith and property of the whole nation to insure their payment . No silver or gold can be so certain and solid a security as this . It is amazing with how thin a veil of gossamer men can hide from themselves the plainest facts ,  --  especially if they do not want to see them . The whole faith and property of the nation are pledged-are they ? For what , to pay or secure what ? and echo answers , what ? Who can tell ? Why for nothing less than to pay one bit of paper with another bit of paper just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of paper are dollars . Is not the word engraved on them , and do they not promise dollars ? But by the very hypothesis this does not mean a promise to pay a coin dollar , nor has it any reference to such a standard . It is a mere bald promise to pay it with another like piece of paper . This is all that the faith and property of the nation pledge or secure on such a system . No matter how vast or illimitable the security ; the question is , what does it secure ? If it be a promise of coin dollars , it insures the payment of them . If it be a promise of a bit of paper called or stamped " Dollar , " and that only , it secures that and that only . The mind is only bewildered here because it is called by the same name with // other promises to pay coin dollars which are good for what they promise , and therefore themselves called dollars because immediately convertible into them . But when these paper promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well be called anything else as dollars . We might invert the spelling and call them " rallods , " or Lincolns , or Thumperlandaggons , or Abracadabras . Suppose then we substitute one of these words in the mutually convertible treasury notes and bonds which this scheme contemplates , and let them read , " The United States will pay pay Five Rallods to bearer , Washington , April i8 , 1873 . " Suppose these convertible into bonds at par of like denomination , and that the faith and property of the nation are pledged to secure these " Rallods " in bonds with " Rallods " in bills , and " Rallods " in bills with " Rallods " in bonds , what does it all amount to ? The security is good enough , if anything were promised worth securing . It will secure the paper " Rallods , " worth just the paper and ink which make them . This securing of irredeemable notes by bonds at a low interest payable in these notes , and insuring the value of these bonds by their convertibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another blown out of it , which in turn rests upon the former ; like a man borrowing money on credit , and using this money to extend his credit , and his expanded credit to get more money and so on , ad infinitum ; the kite supporting its tail and the tail supporting the kite ; like a man who is excellent because he belongs to an excellent party , which in turn is excellent because composed of such excellent men ; like the earth resting on a serpent and the serpent on the tortoise  --  and the tortoise on what ? This paper rests on that paper , and that paper on this , and both on vacuity . This is no mere theorizing . It is corroborated by all experience . The French assignats of the Revolution secured by vast landed estates ; our old Continental currency , the late Confederate Treasury notes and bonds , the vast depreciation of our own greenbacks in the darker stages of the war when the hope of their redemption drooped ; their renewed depreciation as the purpose of returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cumulative and irresistible conurination of the justness of this reasoning . Here again we have to enter the lists in defense of the very rudiments of political economy on another branch of this subject , which have commanded the assent and governed the practice of the civilized nations . Under the intoxication and bewilderment of our irredeemable currency , many have been led to assert the superiority of irredeemable paper issued by government to the precious metals for the purposes of money ; i. e. , as a sta*idard of value or medium of exchange . We have , therefore , to go back to the A , B , C of the subject . The reason why they have been universally adopted for this purpose is that they combine more requisites than any other substances for fufilling it . The first and most indispensable of these is actual value equal to that of the things they exchange for . Herein is found the utter inadequacy , for this purpose , of irredeemable paper . By value we mean that in human services or products useful or desirable to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange . Beyond all doubt the precious metals have this attribute in a high degree irrespective of their use as money . Otherwise they would be unavailable for use as money . Hence mere bits of paper or marble , however stamped , are unavailable for this purpose , unless the image and superscription upon them makes them virtually redeemable promises to pay valuable things . 2 . Portability , i. e. , large value in small bulk and weight . The importance of this is obvious . Precious stones also have it , but want other essential qualities for this purpose yet to be noted . Iron and other metals which have other qualities in a good degree want this . 3 . Easy and indefinite divisibility in equal portions , or multiples of the same , or by exact degrees of fineness , with a capacity of receiving , or being separated from , alloys in mathematically exact proportions . How indispensable this is in a material to be used as a measure of value , is self-evident . 4 . Durability . This the precious metals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified . 5 . Comparative constancy and uniformity of value . Such uniformity can not be absolute with regard to any material substance or product . But on the whole , it is far more nearly so , especially from one generation or decade to another , and during the life of most contracts , than any other substance having not only value , but the other // requisites above noted to fit it to be the measure of value , i. e. , the standard by which all other values are computed . The attempt is made to confuse careless thinkers on the subject by the allegation that the precious metals are no uniform standard of value ; that they have undergone great fluctuations from age to age , and hence are no suitable standard or measure of value now , as compared with the " paper money tokens " already discussed . These irredeemable paper tickets we need not further consider as respects their intrinsic merits . We will only compare them with gold and silver in this single point of steadiness or unsteadiness in value . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively to other things , and to each other , as , from various causes the comparative labor of producing them respectively may vary . But it can be easily shown that , compared with all other articles , their value from year to year , and from one decade to another , is subject to slight fluctuations ; not enough to impair their substantial urnfor*nity of value for all practical purposes during the life of a generation , and the life of nearly all contracts between men and men ; certainly so , as compared with irredeemable bits of paper capable of indefinite multiplication . Did not legal tender-notes , during the last part of the war , lose the most of their purchasing power , i.e. , their exchangeable value ? But did the precious metals suffer a proportional decline ? Or , whatever decline they experienced , did not the inconvertible legal tenders suffer ten times as much as gold , being at one time 280 ? It is as we write these words I 12 . Which has undergone the change in value or purchasing power iiidicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely the question answers itself . Moreover , in all cases of practically illimitable issue , as in the French assignats , the Continental , and the late Confederate irredeemable paper money issue , they sink beneath all appreciable value as compared with gold and silver . There is no comparison between the two as to stability and uniformity of value . MEANS OF EFFECTING RESUMPTION OF coiN PAYMENTS . Various methods have been proposed for effecting this consummation . Certain principles may be laid down which should control it . i . It is to be accomplished by raising the government legal tenders to the coin standard . If these are redeemable in specie , all other bills , promises , contracts , *r obligations to pay money , are at once brought to the coin standard . If they remain broken promises , it matters little what else pays specie , so long as the legal tender for debts is irredeemable paper . 2 . It should be done gradually so as to cause the least possible shock or disturbance to mercantile transactions . With due notice , moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties can shape their plans and arrangements accordingly . Thus less actual disturbance to business would be caused in the process of returning to specie payments than now constantly arises from the capricious and unlooked for fluctuations of the gold premium . 3 . There must be both the declaration of the purpose and active measures to provide the means to pay specie . Both these must go hand in hand . They will be mutually auxiliary . The very expectation that coin payments are to be resumed will promote that resump. - tion , and facilitate approximation to it . Taking actual measures to provide the means for it will give the declared purpose to resume , meaning and substantive force in the view of the people . Otherwise it will as now be nugatory . The simple declaration of the purpose to resume at the threshold of General Grant 's first Presidential term had the effect to cause a gradual reduction of the premium on gold , until the treatment by Congress of proposed measures for this purpose , last winter , made it clear that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make provision for it in the future . Since that time legal tenders have been depreciating until made scarce by being locked up , during the recent panic , which drew gold from abroad to fill the vacuum , thus reducing the premium upon it . This has increased both the desire and the facilities for resumption . Such ample and effectual provision should be made for it , however , as to preclude all danger of failure , and all attempts among the harpies of the stockmarket to produce it . Combining all these principles together , we think the simple way for the government to provide means for resumption is that which it adopts for keeping faith with all creditors ; and discharging all obligations for which its immediate revenues are insufficient , i. e. , by borrowing in the markets // of the world gold sufficient to redeem its legal tenders as fast as presented , and to keep up a gold reserve in the Treasury vaults , which could at once defy and prevent all attempts of the bandits of Wall street to make raids upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the debt which the government now , in breach of its faith , forces on the people without interest , for one on which it pays interest , in order to discharge the former . This seems to us the true and safe way . The other methods proposed tend at first to counterwork themselves and produce monetary strictures . They involve some form of husbanding the gold in the country either in the Treasury vaults , or those of the National Banks . This involves keeping it out of market and thus rendering the article scarcer and dearer . This tends to increase the premium on gold and the distance between paper and coin , thus counterworking the tendency of the accumulation of gold as means for resumption , in the opposite direction . Moreover the accumulation of gold by the banks does not provide means for redeeming the Government Treasury Notes  --  the essential requisite to specie payments . Nor can they be compelled to redeem their own obligations in gold while the law makes greenbacks legal tender for all obligations due to and from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to redeem our greenbacks , at once takes their place for purposes of banking and currency to the full extent to which it is employed to retire them . Moreover , government is still at liberty to re-issue the redeemed greenbacks to any extent to which , while kept redeemable , they will keep afloat . If deemed expedient , probably when once made redeemable , as large a quantity as the present issue would easily float , and government might have nearly as large a gratuitous loan from the people as now . The currency , both metallic , and convertible paper , might be more abundant than now . The same quantity would be more serviceable because more valuable , and therefore capable of effecting a larger amount of exchanges . We see then no way of correctng our anomalous and morbid monetary phenomena short of a return to specie payments ; no safe way of effecting this without attracting some of the gold to the country , which an inconvertible currency has driven away ; no safe way of accomplishing this but by borrowing in the markets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due , as we are actually borrowing to pay those bonds not now , nor for years to come , due . This would be the surest way to obtain on the most favorable terms means to pay the debt not yet due . And we would not undertake this thing grudgingly , nor by halves . Let an unquestionably ample supply be secured to put the result beyond all doubt . The surest will in the end be the cheapest way of accomplishing it . If such a mass of coin is once accumulated as to make redemption sure in any contingency , no greenbacks will be offered in demand for coin beyond what is requisite to liquidate European balances against us . All experience proves that a perfectly convertible paper currency will in all ordinary circumstances be preferred to coin by the people. - This was so even with the currency of the old State banks having only a local credit . Much more will it be so with National Treasury notes convertible into gold , dollar for dollar . Not only will the perle prefer them for currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if instantly convertible into specie , and , like specie , made legal tender . On a specie basis , the demand for liquidation of foreign balances will be held within reasonable bounds , because , when foreign indebtedness b stretched to an unhealthy excess , it is thus speedily , as we have already shown brought to a pause . In short , the gold reserve of the government should be so ample and so practically inexhaustible as to frustrate and discourage all attempts of stock gambling harpies to exhaust or seriously weaken it . Then the occupation of these pests of trade would be gone . The same reasons urge this ample specie reserv , e in government vaults , which demand a good average reserve of genuine money in the banks . These reasons we have exhibited at length in this Magazine , and can not now repeat . This would ensure its being kept good with small replenishment and at small cost . We think favorably of the scheme which permits the government at its discretion to redeem its greenbacks in coin , or in bonds payable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest never exceeding 6 per cent . which , at the time , will command their face in coin in the open market . This secures the government against any possibility of.bankruptcy or suspension of payment . // We would not plan the administration of the National Treasury with the expectation that such an expedient is likely to be necessary in practice , except in the rarest emergencies . But the possibility of resorting to it would be a great safeguard against the occurrence of such emergencies . It would utterly disarm the great gold gamblers and other marauders on the money market , of the weapons of their warfare . The certainty of failure in any attempt to bankrupt the government would prevent the attempt , and all the inischievous fears in the commercial mind arising from the apprehension of it . We would not fix on a bond to be used for this purpose at 3.65 gold interest , or any other rate which would put it essentially below par in coin in the markets of the world . For we would have coin payments or a bana fide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , that redeeming our treasury notes with 3.65 gold interest bonds practically makes them worth about 75 per cent . of their face in gold . The only objection against this proceedure is its cost , that is , as before shown , at the worst , the cost of national honesty , of curing the morbid commercial risks , speculation , gambling , capricious business hazards now stimulated , I. e. , the cost of saving the country from untold lossesand of delivering the people from the terrible financial rule of a few audacious and unprincipled desperadoes . What these gigantic knaves gain and wrest from others by their iniquitous locking up of greenbacks , and gold squeezes , involves not merely the damage done to their immediate victims . It is a damage done to the whole trading , producing and consuming community , I. e. , the whole people ; for it perverts and deranges the common instrument of exchange and measure of value for all that they make , and buy , and sell . It thus increases the risks , perils , and costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not like poisoning a single man and doing an injury which terminates on him . It is rather like diffusing poison through the air or water of a country which sickens all , and kills multitudes . Is this great nation to quail before a few monsters in iniquity and rapacity , and suffer its business to be ravaged by them because it will cost something to defeat them , while it will save ten times that cost in the stability and safety it will impart to the business of the country ? Shall we lavish millions of treasure and blood in subduing other foes , and grudge the insignificant cost of keeping these at bay ? It is the constitutional prerogative and duty of Congress to " coin money and regulate the value thereof . " This is now largely abdicated and handed over to speculators and gamblers . So it must be , so long as anything less than given amounts of precious metals , or other tokens convertible into them , or their equivalents , are made legal tender . MUTUAL RELATION OF LEGAL TENDER TREASURY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUBJECT . The notion that the present national bank notes might with advantage be retired , and their place filled with Treasury legal tenders , at a proportionate saving to the nation , has been a favorite one-especially with demagogues who are usually incapable of more than a crude , ad captandum view of this or other subjects . It is alleged that this circulation is a pure gratuity to the banks which might be saved to the resources of the nation , enabling it to substitute non-interest bearing , for interest-bearing obligations to this amount : that thus , instead of a gratuitous loan of $350,000 which it now forces on the people , it could force $700,000,000 , on equally gratuitous terms , so saving millions of interest annually . In respect to this SUBSTITUTION OF LEGAL TENDERS fOR NATIONAL BANK NOTES we are inclined to believe first , that , if gradually done , it would do the national banks no special harm , except as it would do universal harm by unsettling values , and by greatly depreciating the value of all credits , in depreciating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague of the scheme . For government now to double , or considerably augment its legal tender notes , would be to put them beyond hope of redemption in this generation , and equivalent to a declaration of purpose to maintain a currency perpetually inconvertible . What dilution of its purchasing power and exchangeable value this would cause it is impossible to forecast . We have no heart to dwell upon the sickening prospect of social disorganization and financial chaos . It is generally overlooked by those who advocate this substitution of greenbacks // for national bank bills , that the bearing of the two sorts of currency on inflation and depreciation of the mofiey standard is very unlike . This results from the fact that the greenbacks are at once inconvertible and legal tender ; the national bank notes are not legal tender , but are convertible into legal tender . These legal tender notes are the real standard of money value ; therefore , all other notes , bills , etc. , have a legal money value , at any given time , proportioned to their convertibility into these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin , the increase of them to any extent to which due provision is made for their redemption , would have no effect in depreciating the standard of value . A dollar of them would always be worth a dollar of gold , or whatever that amount of gold would exchange for . But so long as they are at once inconvertible and legal tender , the more they are multiplied , the more do they depreciate the standard of value , the worth of the legal dollar , and expand , with empty inflation , the whole banking and credit operations of the country . If they are doubled while inconvertible , they will be twice , probably thrice , and more than thrice , depreciated , and so depreciate every other form of dollar , or paper substitute for or promise of a dollar , based upon them . Thus , for example , with legal tender in place of national bank bills in their vaults , and this legal tender now doubled , and legally admitting , as now , four times its amount of deposits in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its amount in others , the deposit movement of banks , and their discount and loan movement as founded on deposits , could be doubled also : indeed , it would require to be enlarged to cover the exchange of as much property as before the depreciation , which depreciation , in turn , this expansion would tend to aggravate . Now , the deposits form a far larger part of the national bank movement than bank-bills , especially in commercial centers-in New York city many times as much . Thus from this , as well as every other aspect of the subject , it appears that the legal-tender notes are the pivot on which the whole working of our currency system depends . If they are made sound and equivalent to specie , all other reliable promises and contracts to pay dollars are so likewise . If they are multiplied while inconvertible , they become proportionately depreciated , and drag down all else with them . CONTRARY EFFECT OF INCREASE OF NATIONAL BANK NOTES . On the other hand , the increase of national bank notes , in any normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national stocks , and an adequate legal tender average reserve , and without any increase of legal tender issues , , may tend to promote instead of hindering specie payments . For as national banking increases its volume of notes and deposits , the amount of legal tenders thus locked up in reserves is increased . This in itself tends to render them scarcer , and so dearer , and so far forth to approximate to the specie standand-only , however , on the inexorable condition that there is nd augmentation of their quantity , which always involves , while they remain ineonverti/dc , a proportionate deterioration of their quality . FREE BANKING . However this may be , on the condition of maintaining a specie standard , we are in favor of free banking , guarded by an adequate average , but not inflexible , reserve of specie , or specie-paying paper money in proportion to immediate liabilities , and with circulation secured as now by national stocks . This will supply all needed currency . It will be carried to the simple extent that combines profit with safety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other loans they want , to induce capitalists to supply them . With the above condition of national stocks pledged as security for bills , and average reserve , it will not be profitable to carry this free banking to excess . This was abundantly proved by the operation of the old free State bank system in New York State , after it was once severely limited to the stock of the State and nation as security for bills . On a specie basis , with other present safeguards , and relaxing the present inflexible for a flexible average reserve , we hold that free banking would be salutary , safe , and self-regulating . There are a few other collateral topics , pertaining to a complete view of the sub .. ject , on which we had prepared a briet discussion , which we are compelled to omit for want of space . Among these is the abolition of the usury laws , which only hamper the beneficent operation of the // free banking we have advocated , and , indeed , of the whole loan market under any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scarce and dear . It is simply a device for enhancing the cost of money to borrowers , and aggravating all other causes of financial stricture and panic . Of this the experience of the past year has furnished abundant and painful proof . Another point on which we desired to dispel some prevailing illusions is the supposed influence bank-bills , whose convertibility into coin for their face is reasonably provided for , exert in promoting commercial and speculative inflations with consequent collapses and panics . All increase of irredeemable paper money , of course , has this tendency . But as to convertible bank-bills , any undue expansion of them , by irreversible laws , quickly corrects and regulates itself . They can not inflate things more than an undue increase of the gold itself into which they are convertible , and to which , for this purpose , they are therefore equivalent . *Any such excess in any quarter quickly reacts upon itself to insure reduction to the normal amount . Moreover , so far as inflation is concerned , convertible bank-bills are only one very inconsiderable form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the chief cause of financial crises and panics . Such phenomena , as various writers , and notably J. S. Mill , have proved , may occur , and have often occurred , from the operation of simple credit , where the currency is exclusively metallic . This is given in the form of book-debt , notes , bonds , mortgages , and especially in the form of drafts , bills of exchange , checks passing as money , to an extent hundreds of times as great as all credit given in convertible bank-bills . Of course , the collapse of such an amount of credit produces a proportional explosion . Checks alone pay a hundred times the amount of debts paid by bank-bills . It came out in a recent debate in the English Parliament that , without any increase of bank circulation since 1844 , the exchanges at the London clearing house were then forty times , and are now one hundred and thirty-five times , the whole amount of that circulation . That is , checks alone do one hundred and thirtyfive times as much in effecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will simply add ,  --  the recent financial panic , so far from furnishing reason , as some maintain , for the indefinite postponement of all attempts to resume specie payments , is a most powerful argument for adopting a policy earnestly aiming at the earliest practicable resumption of them .
