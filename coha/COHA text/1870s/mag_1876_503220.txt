MORE than thirty years ago Arthur Stanley put forth the " Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold " ; since then no biography has appeared in our language to be at all compared with this life of Macaulay . This is partly owing to the interest of the subject , and partly to the skill with which Mr. Trevelyan has used the abundant material at his command . So largely is the work made up of the private journals and letters of Macaulay , that it may be regarded as almost an autobiography . The Macaulays are of Norse descent . The original Aulay , from whom the clan names itself , is said to have been Glans the Great , King of Norway , who in the eleventh century conquered and Christianized the western isles of Scotland . A century ago the pious and eloquent John Macaulay , himself the son of a clergyman , was minister of Cardross , in Dumbartonshire . Of his twelve children five deserve mention .

He died in 1836 , leaving ? 10,000 to his famous nephew , Thomas Babington Macaulay . Aulay Macaulay , eldest son of the minister of Cardross , went to England , took orders in the established Church , and acquired reputation as a scholar and private tutor . His friends be- * " The Life and Leetere e*f Lord ifacautay . " By his nephew , G. OTTO TREvELYAN , Member of Parliament for Hawick District of Burgb.s .

Among his friends was young Mr. Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple , Leicestershire .

The pleasant living of Rothsay was in his gift , and when it became vacanthe bestowed it upon his brother-in-law . Zachary Macaulay , youngest son of the minister of Cardross , was born in 1762 . At sixteen he was sent by a Scottish house as bookkeeper on their sugar plantation in Jamaica , of which he soon became sole manager . Brought face to face with West Indian slavery , his whole soul rose against it . For a while he tried to content himself , as he says , " by doing what I could to alleviate the hardships of a considerable number of my fellow creatures , and to render the bitter cup of servitude as palatable as possible . " But his stern conscience would not long permit him to act in any way as a slave-driver ; at the age of four-and-twenty he threw up his position , which would have made him a rich man in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates , among whom was Thomas Babington , had begun their long crusade against slavery and the slave trade . Many negroes had been rescued from slave ships , and it became a grave question what should ho done with them . It was resolved to establish them in a colony upon the coast of Africa , which it was hoped would be a centre from which civilization and Christianity would spread over the whole continent . For this purpose the Sierra Leone company was formed , and in 1793 Zachary Macaulay was sent out with the first colonists , // as one of the governing council of the colony , of which he was soon made governor . In a few months it had become fairly prosperous . But in September , 1794 , a French fleet appeared off the coast . The defenceless town of the freedmen was sacked and burned by the apostles of liberty and equality , and another year was required to reestablish the colony . Macaulay 's health gave way , and he was obliged to return to England . Good Hannah More , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was one of the best of women , was an oracle of the philanthropists . Zachary Macaulay was sent to visit her at Bristol . Here he fell in love with the pretty Quakeress , Selina Mills , once the pupil , now the friend of the good sisters Hannah and Patty More . His affection was returned , but her friends looked coldly upon the match . He was under obligations to return to Sierra Leone ; they would not hear of her accompanying him , and he went alone . The colony prospered under Macaulay 's governorship ; but he was wanted at home . He returned after three years , was made secretary of the company , and in August , 1797 , was married to Selina , taking up his residence in London . When his wife 's time of motherhood approached they were invited to Rothley Temple to await the event . There , in a room pannelled with dark oak , and looking out into the pleasant park , was born , October 25 , 1800 , their firstborn son , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse on the following day , breaking both his arms . As soon as he was able he returned to London , taking up his residence in a house in a narrow lane , the lower part being occupied by the offices of the Sierra Leone company . After two years he removed to the suburb of Clapham , where were the residences of Wilberforce and some of his assQciates , and where in the course of thirteen years three sons and five daughters were born to him . He also became editor of the " Christian Observer , " the organ of the " evangelical " churchmen , and in time entered into partnership with a nephew as merchants trading to Africa . If Tom Macaulay had died young , he would have deserved a place on the roll of precocious children . He learned to read literally in his cradle . Before he was four years old , his favorite books were the Bible , " Robinson Crusoe , " and " Pilgrim 's Progress . " His memory was something wonderfuL Nothing which he read seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse he would frame interminable stories out of his own head , or drawn from some book . " He talked quite printed words , " said his nurse . Good Hannah More once came to call upon his mother . At the door she was met by a fair-haired boy of four , who told her that his mother was out , adding , " If the lady will walk in , I will bring a glass of good old spirits . " When asked what he understood by the proffered refreshment , he said that it was something which Robinson Crusoe used to have in his cabin . He was taken to Lady Waldegrave 's to see Horace Walpole 's famous collection of gimeracks . A servant spilled a cup of hot coffee over the boy 's linentrowsered legs , scalding them severe ly . After a while the stately lady asked him how he was feeling . " I thank you , madam , " replied the little four-year-old , " the agony is abated . " A servant had thrown away a row of oyster shells with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst into , the drawing-room where his mother was entertaining some visitors , with the solemn imprecation , " Cursed be Sally ; for it is written , ' Cursed is he who removeth his neighbor 's landmark . ' " Before he was eight he might fairly be classed among authors . His seventh year was among the most prolific of his literary life . He set about a compendium of universal history , " in which he contrived to give a tolerably connected view of the leading // events from the creation to the present time , filling about ; a quire of paper . " He wrote a tract which a learned gentleman promised to have translated into Hindostanee , to persuade the natives to become Christians . He knew Scott 's " Lay of the Last Minstrel " and " Marmion , " almost by heart , and in imitation of them began a poem , " The Battle of Cheviot . " Three cantos of one hundred and twenty lines each had been written when he abandoned it for a loftier theme , " Olans the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poem , " which was to celebrate not only the legendary forefather of the Macaulays , but prophetically all his famous descendants down to his own father , and his uncle the general . This seems to have occupied him several months , but like his " History of England , " was never brought down " to the times of men still living . " Mr. Trevelyan gives a couple of stanzas of this poem , which thus opens : Day set on Cambria 's hills supreme , And , Menal , on thy silver stream . The star of day had reached the west , And in the main it sank to rest ; Shone great Eleindyn 's castle tall ; Shone every battery , every hall ; Shone all fair Mona 's verdant plain , But mostly shone the foaming main . " The stanzas , " he says , " each of which contains more lines than the author counted years , go swimmingly on , with plenty of animation , and no dearth of geographical and historical allusion " ; an assertion which a less judicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole poem . He might even have given us a series of hymns , and we know not how many quires of other verse , before the author had completed his tenth year . But with all his precocity , little Tom Macaulay had nothing of the prig about him , but was " as playful as a young kitten . " At twelve he was sent to a private school near Cambridge , much in favor with the pious " Clapham set . " Before he was half through his teens , he became a classical scholar , even according to his own definition of the term , " one who could read Plato with his feet on the fender . " French and Italian cost scarcely an effort , and he gave most of his time to omniverous reading , and what he had once read remained fixed in his memory . His father wished to make a young philanthropist of him-urged him to set up a Sunday school , and to distribute tracts and Testaments among the villagers . But the boy had little vocation that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much individually for any one except his father and mother , his brothers and sisters , and in later years his nephews and nieces . Years afterward he wrote , apropos of the death of Wilberforce : I called at the house where his body is lying . I was truly fond of him ; that Is , je l'aimaf comme t'on aime . And how Is that ? How little one human being generally cares for another . If I were to die to-morrow , not one of the fine people whom I dine with every week will take a c6-telette aux petete  |p018  the less on Saturday at the table towhich I was Invited to meet them , or will smile the less gayly at the ladles over the champagne . And I am quite even with them . There are not ten people in the world whose deaths would spoil my dinner ; but there are one or two whose deaths would break my heart . The boy was father to the man . We nowhere find traces of any special attachment to the friends of his youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from personal , literary , or political animosities . In all his journals and letters only two men are mentioned with anything like bitterness . He disliked Croker ; he more than disliked Brougham . Few men were ever better liked , though many men have been better loved , by his associates . No boy or man ever more warmly loved his own immediate kindred or was more warmly loved by them . Of all his kindred , the best loved were his two sisters , Hannah and Margaret , ten and twelve years his junior . Hannah , afterward Lady Trevelyan , thus writes to her son , the biographer of Macaulay : I think my father 's strictness was a good counterpoise to the perfect worship of your uncle hy the rest of the family . To us he was an object of passionate love and devotion . His unruffled sweetness of temper , his unfailing flow of spirits , // his amusing talk , all made his presence so delightful that his wishes and tastes were our law . Ills notion of perfect happiness was to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to walk all together on the common , or if it rained , to have a frightfully noisy game of hide-and-seek . My earliest recollections speak of the Intense happiness of the holidays , when he came home from school , and the saturnalia which at once set in . No lessons , nothing but fun and merriment , for the whole six weeks . Macaulay entered Trinity college , Cambridge , at eighteen . The house of Macaulay &amp; Babington was apparently prosperous . Zachary Macaulay supposed himself to be worth a hundred thousand pounds . He said he meant to make Tom " an elder son " ; and if he did his duty at the university , he should choose his own career . His career at the university was brilliant , but , measured by academical standards , not exceptionally so . Mathematics was the strong point at Cambridge , and he hated mathematics . In a letter to his mother he expresses his dislike in terms whimsically exaggerated . He could find no terms strong enough to express his detestation of that science- " if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied to the perception and recollection of certain properties in numbers and figures . " To be exempted from this miserable study , he would gladly devote himself to astrology , demonology , or school divinity , and " endeavor to adjust the relations of Entity with the two Predicaments . " All his perceptions of grace and beauty were gone or fast going , and before the end of the term his brain would be as dry as the remaining biscuit after a sea voyage . " Tell Selina and Jane , " he concludes , " to be thankful that it is not a necessary part of female education to get a headache daily , without acquiring one practical truth or beautiful image in return . " He was unfailing at lecture and chapel ; but his delight was in general reading in all languages , and in keen encounters of wit and argument with a group of brilliant young students . They would nip at midnight , often DECEMBER , prolonging the session till the bell rang for morning prayers ; or in vacation would set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , their keen discussions on poetry , philosophy , and politics mingling with the twittering of the birds in the green hedgerows . If Macaulay was second to any one in this brilliant circle , it was to Charles Austin- " Austin of Jesus " - who , as everybody said , might become anything he chose , and who became one of the most profound of English lawyers . Macaulay won his earliest academical triumph in his first year . The subject for the Chancellor 's medal for English poetry was " The Destruction of Pompeii . " He was one of the competitors , and submitted his poem to his father 's criticism . Zachary Macaulay rather sniffed at it on the ground that it lacked a moral . Torn met the charge by saying that if a subject be given which admits of none , a man who writes without a moral is scarcely censurable . He adds , however , " If my life be a life of literature , it shall certainly be one of literature devoted to moral ends . " Moral or no moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this medal the second year ; but won it the third . It is not easy to understand why in the second year he failed to win one of the three goblets given for the three best English declamations . The first prize was awarded to a kinsman of the senior Dean , who , we are told , said to Macauhly , " As you have not got the first , I suppose you will not care for either of the others . " He , however , won the prize for Latin declamation , and in the following year established his classical repute by gaining a university scholarship . The crucial mathematical examination of 1822 was approaching , and Macaulay tried to prepare for it . But it was too late to make up for lost time , and when the " tripos , " or list of successful candidates appeared , his name was not upon it . In university phrase , he was " galfed , " and thus disqualified // for competing for the Chancellor 's medals , the crowning trophies of a classical career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great trial of her life . He , however , won a minor prize offered annually for the best essay on " The Character and Conduct of William III . " This essay of Macaulay is notable as containing the germs of some of the finest characterizations in his " History of England . " Meantime the fortunes of his family began to be overelouded . The prosperity of the house of Macaulay &amp; Babington was brief . When Zachary Macaulay thought himself a rich man he had taken a handsome house in a fine quarter of London . Expenditure began to press hard upon income , and he removed to a cheaper residence . Tom 's university expenses grew to be a burden , which in 1822 he endeavored to lighten by earning a hundred guineas by taking a couple of private pupils . He also set himself at work to win a university fellowship . Twice lie was unsuccessful , the alleged ground being that his translations from Latin and Greek were couched in bald , inornate , and ungraceful English . He was successful on the third trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father he wrote : " I need not say how much I am delighted by my success , and how much I enjoy the thought of the pleasure it will afford to you , my mother , and my other friends . Till I become Master of Arts next July , the pecuniary emolument will not be very great . For seven years after that time it will make me almost an independent man . " The emoluments of a Trinity fellowship were worth having , especially as no duties were involved . They were three hundred pounds a year ; six dozen of the famous audit ale at Christmas ; and if he chose to remain at the university , stabling for a horse , " a loaf and two pats of butter every morning , a good dinner for nothing , with as many almonds and raisins as one could eat at dessert . " Tom had indeed won the right to choose his own career ; but he had to run it not only without aid from his father , but before long burdened by the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " elder son , " not in the sense which his father had intended , but in that of being the stay and support of all . The burden did not come all at once ; but he accepted it as it came , not merely patiently , but joyously , and as a matter of course . Having won his fellowship , he went to London , studied law , or at least " ate his terms , " was admitted to the bar in 1826 , and for two or three years was nominally a barrister ; but we doubt whether he ever earned a guinea by his profession . Meanwhile his course of life was shaping itself toward literature . In 1823 Charles Knight , a scheming young London publisher , had started " Knight 's Quarterly Magazine . " Macaulay was from the first one of the principal contributors . Among his articles were critiques upon the Italian poets , the " Conversation between Cowley and Milton , " and the essays upon the " Athenian Orators , " and " Metford 's Greece . " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Edinburgh Review " had lost much of its original brilliancy , and was casting about for new contributors . Early in 1825 he wrote to a London friend , " Can you not lay your hand upon some young man who will write for us ? The original supporters of the work are either too lazy or too stupid , and here the young men are mostly Tories . " Overtures had already been made to Macaulay , and in August , 1825 , appeared his first essay in the " Edinburgh Review , " the famous paper on Milton . This essay aroused immediate attention . Jeffrey wrote to him : " The more I think of it , the less I can conceive where you picked up that style . " John Murray , shrewdest of bibliopoles , declares that it would be worth the copyright of " Childe Harold " to have Macaulay on the staff of his " Quarterly Review . " Robert Hall // set himself to learn Italian , that he might verify the parallel between Milton and Dante . Macaulay himself came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under protest into the collected edition of his essays , and with the emphatic declaration that even when somewhat toned down , it " remained overloaded with gaudy and ungraceful ornameats , " and contained " scarcely a paragraph such as his matured judgment approved . " An author may per . haps be a wiser critic of his own work than any one of his readers , but his verdict is outweighed by that of a whole generation of readers . Two generations have pronounced , and we think many more generations will pronounce , a decision very different from that of Macaulay . During the succeeding eighteen months he furnished several papers for the " Review , " none of which appear in the collected editions of his works . The next which is authenticated by him is the masterly essay on " Machiavelli , " in March , 1827 . In 1828 there were four : those on " Hallam , " " Southey 's Colloquies , " " Dryden , " and " *History , " of which only the first two appear in his own collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially the one on " History , " in which he foreshadows his own theory as to the true scope of history and the manner in which it should be written . In 1828 a fortunate political accident enabled Lord Lyndhurst to bestow upon Macaulay the post of commissioner of bankruptcy , the salary of which was about ? 400 a year . What with this , his fellowship , and his " Review " papers , he had now about ? 1,000 a year ; ample enough for his own wants , and to enable him to eke out the necessities of his father , but too precarious for the furtherance of the political aspirations which he had begun to cherish . His sister writes : Public affairs were become Intensely interesting to him . Canning 's accession to power , then his death , the repeal of the Test Act , the emancipa tion of the Catholics , all In their turn filled his heart and son . He himself longed to be taking his part in Parliament , but with a very hopeless longing . This hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . In 1829 he wrote for the " Review " several papers on the " Utilitarian Philosophy of Government . " These attracted the attention of Lord Lansdowne , who wrote to him that he wished to be the means of introducing their author to public life by proposing him as a member of Parliament for Caine , a small borough of only four or five thousand inhabitants , but which returned two members , and luckily one of the seats fell vacant . The Lansdowne interest was paramount there , and a nomination by the Marquis was equivalent to an election . Macaulay took his seat in the spring of 1830 , . and soon evinced such eloquence and political capacity that no height of official eminence would seem to have been beyond the possibility of his ultimate attainment . We can here touch but lightly upon his political career , and mainly as it illustrates the character of the man . He was fortunate in the subject of his first speech . A bill had been introduced for the removal of the civil disabilities of the Jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and ho had already promised an article upon it for the " Edinburgh Review . " Sir James Mackintosh and Macaulay rose together . By courtesy of the House the floor is conceded to a member who rises to speak for the first time . In a brief speech Macaulay fairly exhausted the argument in favor of the bill . Mackintosh , who continued the debate , declared that he did so " not to supply any defects in the speech of his honorable friend , for there were none ; but to absolve his own conscience . " Those who now read his conclusive reasoning on the subject , as afterward embodied in the " Review , " may well wonder that they had to be repeated by others for six-and-thirty years before the // House of Peers could be brought to consent to the measure . He spoke no more during that session , wisely awaiting another great opportunity . This came in March , 1831 , when Lord John Russell introduced his Reform bill . Macaulaythrewhis whole strength in its favor , and his name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Burke , Fox , and Sheridan . During the next three years he was constant in his attendance and frequent in debate , and was pronounced to be emphatically a rising man . During these three years he furnished eight papers for the " Review , " among which are the magnificent essays on Hampden , Burleigh , and " The War of the Succession in Spain , " and the scathing critiques on " Robert Montgomery 's Poems , " and Croker 's edition of " Boswell 's Life of Johnson . " To a man so highly endowed , and with such brilliant prospects , London society threw its doors wide open . Rogers invited him to his famous breakfasts , and he was a welcome guest at Holland House . Lady Holland , who was quite civil to no one , was almost civil to Macaulay . He touched life at so many points , and so pleasantly at all points , that his literary , political , and social successes were alike grateful to him . Those who met him for the first time were apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macaulay , " said Lady Lyndhurst , with charming frankness , " you are so different to what I expected . I thought you were dark and thin ; but you are fair , and really , Mr. Macaulay , you are fat . " This was in 1831 , eight years before Praed had described him in " Knight 's Magazine , " under his no*n de plume of " Tristram Merton , " as " a short , manly figure , marvellously upright , with a bad neckcloth , and one hand in his waistcoat pocket . Of regular beauty he has little to boast , but in faces where there is an expression of great power , or of great good humor , or both , you do not regret its absence . " " This picture , " says Mr.Trevelyan , " in which every touch is correct , tells all there is to be told . ' * He , h6wever , adds some touches , which , for the later years of his life , render the portrait more complete . The head was massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have passed , for tolerably good looking ; but when he arose he was seen to be unmistakably short and stout . lie was eminently unhandy , could never learn to fold a letter properly , or seal it neatly . When he shaved himself lie generally managed to gash both cheeks in the operation . His wardrobe , as soon as he could afford it , was always overstocked with good clothing , and he had a special weakness for splendidly embroidered waistcoats , but no skill of the tailor could ever make him look well dressed . He was rather more than moderately fond of good living , but had a most catholic taste , relishing alike the turkey and truffles of Holland House , the roast beef , venison , and goose stuffed with onions , at Lord Essex 's , turtle soup and all piscatory luxuries with the Fishmonger 's Company- " the finest company for gourmands in the world "  --  or a bit of cheese and a bottle of ale in his own chambers . During the first three years of his political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for a short time even straitened . Government had undertaken some economical reforms , which involved the abolition of the office of commissioners of bankruptcy , and thus twofifths of his income was swept away . His college fellowship had only a few more months to run , and when that was gone he had only the two or three hundreds a year which he was earning from the " Edinburgh Review . " At one time he was obliged to sell-we hope not without the right of reclamation-the gold medals which he had won at Cambridge . But this period of pecuniary difficulty was short . He was made one of the commissioners , and not long after the secretary of the Board of Control , a body which repro- // sented the crown in its relations with the East India Company ; a position which soon led to another which was to shape his whole after life . The salary was ? 1,500 . The Reform bill of 1831 deprived Caine of one of its members , whereby Macaulay lost his seat ; but it raised the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Macaulay was invited to stand for one , and was returned . The house of Macaulay &amp; Babington , without becoming formally bankrupt , had dropped out of the business world , and Zachary Macaulay had become old , infirm , and almost blind . His wife had died in 1830 ; one of his sons had cntered the church , two others were at school , and their main dependence , and that of the sisters , was in brother Tom . The daughters of Selina Mills were half Quakers , and Margaret and Hannah had gone on a long visit to some wealthy Friends at Liverpool . Here Margaret became engaged to Mr. Edward Cropper , an excellent and prosperous young Quaker merchant . This was a rude shock to Macaulay . It ovcrset , actually or in probability , the whole scheme of domestic life which , half unconsciously , he had framed for himself . In view of the approaching marriage he wrote , we suppose , in his journal : The attachment between brothers and sisters is 50 liable to be superseded by other attachments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indispensable to him . That women should leave the home of their birth , and contract other ties dearer than those of consanguinity , is a law as ancient as the first records of our race , and as unchangeable as the constitution of the human body and mind . To repine against the nature of things , and against the great fundamental law of all society , because in consequence of my own want of foresight it bears heavily upon me , would be the basest and most absurd selfishness . I have still one more stake to lose . From that moment , with a heart formed , if ever man 's was , for domestic happiness , I shall have nothing left but ambition . The last terrible blow was the possibility that Hannah would probably marry at some time or other . To us this all seems little short of sheer nonsense . Many a man of two-and-thirty has fancied that his whole future would be a blank5 because the woman whom he loved was about to marry another . A few foolish men have gone mourning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to mind no other instance where a sensible man threatened to break his heart because a beloved sister was about to marry a man whose character and circumstances promised to render the marriage in every way a happy one . But Macaulay for a time made himself really miserable about it . The year 1833 was the turning point of Macaulay 's life . A bill was introduced into Parliament making great changes in the government of India . Among other things it provided that no native of the British territories in the East should , " by reason only of his religion , place of birth , descent , or color , be disabled from holding any place , office , or employment . " The East India Company , originally a mere trading corporation , had come to be the absolute ruler of an empire four times as populous as Great Britain . The bill deprived the company of all its commercial attributes , and vested its immense property in the crown , which was to pay the stockholders an interest of ten guineas a year upon each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of directors the function of governing all Hindostan . It was much as though the Pacific Railroad company should be deprived of the management of the road , but its directors , with their offices in Alaska , should have authority to govern all the region east of the Rocky mountains . Macaulay supported the bill with unwonted eloquence , and it passed both Houses by a large majority . The bill also provided that of the three members of the Supreme Council , one should be chosen from persons who were not servants of the company , and this member was to be virtually nominated by the crown , subject to the election of the company . This post was offered by the ministry to Macautay . There were grave reasons why he should accept it . The salary was // 801 ? 10 , 000 a year , and living upon the most liberal scale he need not spend more than half of it . He might therefore hope to return in six years with at least ? 30,000 , a sum which he said was all that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rich as the wealthiest nobleman in England . He was a poor man . The minority might any day go out of power , when he would of course lose his office , and then his only means of livelihood would be what he could earn by his pen , and he could not make a living by that and still keep his seat in Parliament . To his constant friend , Lord Lansdowne , he wrote : " Without a competence it is not very easy for a public man to be honest ; it is almost impossible for him to be thought so . " If he lost his office , he must live by his pen , and perhaps " bear from publishers and editors what Dryden bore from Tonson , and what to my own knowledge Mackintosh bore from Lardner . The thought is horrible , yet to hold office merely for the sake of emoluments would be more horrible still . " He continues : If this were all , I should feel that for the sake of my own happiness and of my public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independence . But this is not all . I am not alone in the world , A family which I love most fondly is dependent upon me . Unless I would see my father left in his old age to the charity of less near relations ; my youngest brother unable to obtain a good professional education ; my sisters , who are more to me than sisters ever were to a brother , forced to turn governesses or humble Companions , I must do something . An opportunity has offered itself . It is in my power to make the last days of my father comfortable ; to educate my brother ; to provide for my sisters ; to procure a competence for myself . I may hope by the time I am thirty-nine to return to England with a fortune of thirty thousand pounds . To me that would be affluence . I never wished for more . For a short time there was doubt whether the directors of the company would accept him . The chairman and vice-chairman were furious against him . James Mill , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other man in England , was at the head of one of the principal departments of the India House . Macaulay had assailed him in the " Edinburgh Review " with what he himself acknowledged to be " unbecoming acrimony . " Mill had the generosity to forget this , and advised the directors to take Macaulay , for , " as public men went , he was much above the average ; and if he was rejected , it was very unlikely that they would get anybody so fit . " The hostile chairman and vice-chairman resigned , and others were chosen in their places . When the vote was taken , out of the four-and-twenty directors nineteen voted for Macaulay , three against him , and two were absent . When the appointment was first proposed to Macaulay , he wrote to Hannah , telling her that all whom he had consulted advised him to accept it . Tie adds : Whether the period of my exile shall be one of comfort , and after the first shock one of happiness , depends on you . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , will you go with me ? I know what a sacrifice I ask of you . I know how many dear and precious ties you must for a tioee sunder . I know that the splendors of the Indian court and the gayeties of that brilliant society of which you would be one of the leading personages have no temptations for you . I can bribe you only by telling you that if you go with me , I will love you better than I love you now if I can . if my dear sisterwould consent togive me , at this great crisis of my life , that proof , that painful and arduous proof of her affection which I beg of her , I think she will not repent of it . She shall not , if the unbounded confidence and attachment of one to whom she is dearer than life can compensate her for a few years ' absence from much that she loves . For ourselves we fail to see any very extraordinary sacrifice in the case . If she went , Hannah would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if she did not go , slac would be separated from that brother who was perhaps dearer to her than all the others . For the rest , nothing which should involve a temporary dwelling under strange skies could well be more inviting to a young woman of one-and-twenty . But if a sacrifice ever so great had been asked , we can not doubt that it would have been cheerfully made by sister Hannah when the happiness of Brother Tom was in question . Some of Macaulay 's days in England // were given to the completion of the paper for the " Review " on " William Pitt , Earl of Chathain . " He also made arrangements to continue his contributions , for he wished while on the other side of the globe to keep himself alive in the recollection of the people of England . He sailed about the middle of February , 1834 , and on the 10th of June the vessel lay off Madras . The ship was crowded , for every civilian going out was anxious to go on the same vessel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his notice . The company on the quarter deck ( he writes ) was much on a level with the average society on an East Indlaman . Hannah was extremely social ; danced with the gentlemen in the evenings , and read novels and sermons with the ladies in the mornings . I contented myself with bcing very civil whenever I was with the other passengers , and took care to be as little with them as I could . Except at meals I hardly exchanged a word with any human being . I never was left for so long a time so completely to my own resources . During the whole voyage I read with keen and increasing enjoyment . I devoured Greek , Latin , Spanish , Italian , French , and English : folios , quartos , octavos , and duodecimos . I read the flied , Odyssey , Virgil , Horace , ( I*esar , Bacon , Dante , Petrarch , Ariosto , " Don Quixote , " Mill 's " India , " Sismondi 's " History of France , " all the seventy volumes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bibliotheca Britannica . " We must merely touch upon Macaulay 's residence in India . After spending some months with the Governor General on the highlands , he was for a time his guest in Calcutta , and November was well advanced before he selected a residence . He chose the finest house in the City of Palaces , ** and set up his establishment on a large scale , his servants numbering some three or four score . Still he found that his expenditures would be less than he expected . To his sisters at home he wrote : Money matters seem likely to go on capitally , and if I live I shall get rich quite fast . I quite enjoy the thought of appearing in the light of an old hunks , who knows on which side his bread is buttered ; a warm man , who will cut up well . This is not a character which the Macanlays have been much in the habit of sustalning ; but I can assure you that after next Christmas I expect to lay up on an average seven thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas I shall send home a thousand or twelve hundred pounds for my father and you all . I can not tell you what a comfort it Is that I am able to do this . Macaulay 's main work in India was performed in his capacity as president of the Committee of Public Instruction and president of the commission to inquire into the jurisprudence and jurisdiction of India . In the former capacity his governing idea was that " the great object of the British Government ought to be the promotion of European literature and science among the natives . " In the latter capacity , to frame a civil and penal code , easy of comprehension , which should secure equal justice and common tribunals for Europeans and natives . This last proposition was fiercely opposed by the few hundreds who , apart from the servants of the company , made up society in Calcutta , and they scat home a remonstrance against it . Macaulay 's theory of government for India would have satisfied Thomas Carlyle . In a long official report he says : We know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have the next best thing-a firm and impartial despotism . The worst state In which she can possibly be placed is that in which the memorialists would place her . They call upon us to recognize them as a privileged order of freemen in the midst of slaves . It was for the purpose of averting this great evil that Parliament , at the same time that it suffered English* men to settle in India , armed us with these large powers , which , In my opinion , we ill deserve to possess if we have not the spirit to use them now . The penal code framed by Macaulay was completed in 1838 , but never went into operation during his lifetime , having , with many revisions , been adopted in 1862 . In the judgment of men qualified to decide , it is the best code ever framed . Sir Fitzjames Stephen says : " It is to the French Code Penal , and I may add to the German Code of 1871 , what a finished picture is to a sketch . It is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and its practical success . has been complete . " Macaulay 's official labors were arduous , but not overwhelming , and were Inainly performed in his own library . His chief annoyance was the weariness of society in India . Of the great dinner parties he says : Nothing can be duller . Nobody speaks except to the person next bhn . The conversation Is the // most deplorable twaddle ; and as I always sit next to the lady of highest rank , or , in other words , to the oldest , ugliest , and proudest woman In the company , I am worse off than my neighbors . But happily the good people here are too busy to be at home . Except the parsons , they are all usefully occupied somewhere or other , so that I have only to leave cards ; hut the reverend gentlemen are always within doors in the heat of the day , lying on their backs , regretting breakfast , longing for tiffin , and crying out for lemonade . There were , however , a score or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a quiet dinner , and every Friday morning a few of these assembled at his breakfast table , where , amid conversation and discussion , the sitting was protracted till noon . He also found time to read a great deal , and he had always the society of his sister . Not altogether an unpleasant life , in spite of its minor miseries , among which was the poorness of the Indian fruits , which he says are wretched , the best not equal to an apricot or a gooseberry . He had been told that the most exquisite of treats was to eat yams and plantains and to drink palm wine . But he found that a plantain was very like a rotten pear , a yam like an indifferent potato , aud palm wine resembled " ginger beer in which the ginger had been very sparingly used . " In the mean time pretty Miss Hannah had been preparing to obey " the laW as ancient as the human race and as unchangeable as the constitution of the human body and mind . " Among the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine young fellow of eight-and-twenty , who " had distinguished himself beyond any man of his standing in India by his great talents for business , his liberal and enlarged views , and by very considerable literary merit . " Before Macaulay had fairly settled himself in his house , he found that an attachment had sprung up between his sister and Trevelyan . Early in December he wrote to Margaret : " Hannah is going to be married , and with my fullest and warmest approbation . I can truly say that if I were to search India for a husband for her , I could have found no man to whom I could with equal confidence have entrusted her happiness . I therefore gave every facility and encouragement to both of them . " Still Macaulay could not help adding a jeremiad . When Margaret was married his heart was almost broken ; but then he had Hannah ; had his other friends ; had his country ; but now that Hannah was to be married he had nothing left except the resources of his own mind and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not repine . Whatever I suffer I have brought on myself . I have neglected the plainest lessons of reason and experience ; I have staked my happiness without calculating the chances of the dice ; I have hewn out broken cisterns ; I have leaned on a reed ; I have built on the sand ; and I have fared accordingly . I must bear my punishment as I can . . - - I remember quoting some nursery rhymes years ago when you left me in London to join Hannah somewhere . These foolish lines contain the history of my life : " There were two birds that sat on a stone : One flew away , and then there was but one . The other flew away , and then there was none ; And the poor stone was left all alone . " Foolish forebodings and idle repinings , which were never to meet the eye of the one to whom they were addressed . Before the letter reached England Margaret was dead . The tidings of her death reached India a few days after the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Macaulay 's life . Hannah Trevelyan was no less a sister to him than Hannah Macaulay had been ; her husband became to him all that a brother could be , nearer and dearer , indeed , than any of his own brothers had been or would be ; their children became as dear to him as if they had been his own . The young couple took up their residence in his house . " The arrangement , " he writes , " is not so strange as it would be at home . The thing is often done here . One advantage there will be in our living together of a most incontestable sort : we shall both be able to save more money . Macaulay had supposed that his exile would last six years . Before four years had passed he had saved fully the sum he had fixed upon ; and moreover // his uncle , the General , had died , bequeathing him ? 10,000 . In all we suppose he had something more than ? 40 , 000 . His health had not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisely resolved not to risk another hot season for the sake of adding another lac of rupees to his wealth . He resigned his office . Trevelyan was entitled to a leave of absence , and early in January , 1838 , they all sailed for England . The ship was a slow sailer ; they encountered stormy weather , and were detained some time at the Cape of Good Hope , and it was nearly six months before the white cliffs of England were sighted . The first tidings which greeted Macaulay were that his father had died a few weeks before . The brave , outworn old man was buried with public honors . His bust was placed in Westminster Abbey , with an inscription in *honor of him " Who during forty successive years , partaking in the councils and the labors which , ordered by Providence , rescued Africa from her woes and the British empire from the guilt of slavery and the slave trade , meekly endured the toil , the privation , and the reproach , resio*ning to others the praise and the reward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for the future . Two years before he had written : " What my course in life will be when I return to England is very doubtful . But I am more than half determined to abandon politics , and to give myself wholly to letters ; to undertake some great historical work which may be at once the business and the amusement of my life . In England I might probably be of a very different opinion . " Soon after his arrival he sent to the " Edinburgh Review " a paper on Sir William Temple , which had been begun in India , and wrote to Napier that in the autumn he should set out for home , and return to London in the spring : As soon as I return I shall commence my " History . " The first part ( which I think will take up five 9ctavo volumes ) will extend from the Revolution to the commencement of Sir Robert Wal . pole 's long administration , a period of three or four-and-thirty very eventful years . From the commencement of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commencement of the American war it will again become necessary to be copious . How far I shall bring the narrative down I have not determined . The death of George IV . would be the best halting place . The " History " would then be an entire view of all the transactions which took place between the Revolution whichbrought the Crown into harmony with the Parliament and the Revolution which brought the Parliament into harmony with the nation . This is the first definite mention which we find of his proposed history , which would cover a space of nearly one hundred and fifty years , and according to the plan laid down , could not have been completed in less than thirty volumes . If he lived to seventy , it would require a volume a year . lie lived not quite twenty years , and wrote five , or more strictly four and a half volumes , covering a period of about seventeen years . Hardly an eighth part of his proposed work was ever accomplished , and the most important part was not even touched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met by letters from Lord Melbourne , the Premier , and Spring Rice , Chancellor of the Exchequer , urging him to return to political life . The ministry would find a seat in Parliament for him , and make him Judge Advocate , with a salary of ? 2,500 a year-probably considerably more than the entire income to be derived from his Indian accumulations . He replied that the salary was no object ; he had all the income that he needed . He would not decline a seat in Parliament ; but he would accept no office in the government which did not give him a place in the Cabinet . " The only thing , " he wrote in his journal , " that would ever tempt me to give up my liberty and my studies , is the power to effect great things ; and of that power no man has so little as a man in office , out of the Cabinet . If they take me at my word , and contrive to bring me into Parliament without office , I shall be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much expect . " For several months nothing came of this . But in time the Melbourne ministry came into close straits . In the Peers the preponderance of numbers and ability was much against them . In the Commons they were likely to need all the ability and eloquence to be found in the Whig party . A seat must be found or made for Macaulay . Mr. Abercromby , one of the members for Edinburgh , was raised to the peerage , Macaulay was returned in his place , and he was soon made Secretary of War , with a seat in the Cabinet . About the same time Mr. Trevelyan was made Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , and Macaulay was relieved of the haunting dread of being separated from his sister by her husband 's return to India . The ministry struggled on , sorely pressed by an ever increasing opposition , until June , 1841 , when it was defeated by a majority of one in a full house . They dissolved Parliament and " went to the country . " The elections were overwhelmingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir Robert Peel was made Premier , and for the next four years Macaulay was in opposition . The five years from 1840 to 1844 were the most brilliant of Macaulay 's literary life as an essayist . He wrote the essays on Lord Clive , Warren Hastings , Ranke 's " History of the Popes , " Frederick the Great , Addison , and the Earl of Chatham . In 1842 he put forth the " Lays of Ancient Rome , " portions of which had been meditated in India , and had since been surging themselves in his mind during his Italian tour and in his rapid walks through the streets of London . He was greatly pleased with their success ; but he said : " I shall not repeat the experiment ; I shall , like a wise gamester , leave off while I am a winner , and not cry , Double or quits . ' " His last essay for the " Edinburgh Review " was that on Chatham , in October , 1844 , for he had come to feel that he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he would not , as Mackintosh had done , leave behind the character of a man who would have done something if he had concentrated his powers instead of frittering them away . " The history had indeed been commenced early in 1839 . In his journal for March 9 , he notes : " Began my history with a sketch of the early revolutions of England . Pretty well , but a little too stately and rhetorical . " But the work had to be suspended while he was Secretary of War , and mainly while a leader of the opposition . In June , 1846 , the Peel ministry went down , and was succeeded by a new administration , with Lord John Russell as Premier . Macaulay was made Paymaster General of the army , a post which he selected as the one least likely to interfere with his historical labors . He had little to do except to sign his name now and then , and draw the salary of ? 2,000 a year . The acceptance of an office under government vacated his seat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was reseated . But in 1847 Parliament was dissolved , and a general election was held . An opposition made up of the most heterogeneous elements sprang up against Macaulay , and he was defeated . He could not avoid being somewhat vexed at this , the only real defeat which he had ever undergone . But on the whole he was probably quite as glad as sorry . If amends were wanting for this slight mortification , amends were abundantly made . Macaulay was urged to stand for half the places which had not chosen members . He declined all offers . Manumitted , as he believed , from all public duties , he devoted himself to his " History of England , " which now went rapidly forward . In his journal for November 18 , 1848 , he writes : I have finished the first two volumes of my history . Yesterday the sheets went to America , and within a fortnight , I hope , the publication will take place in London . As compared with excellence , the work is a failure ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . We shall soon know what the world says . He had not long to wait to know what the world would say , as first expressed in the publisher 's reports of sales . To appreciate these we must bear in mind that the book was a cost . ly one , and that the circle of readers in England a generation ago was much smaller than it now is . The upshot was , that 13,000 copies were sold in less than four months . " I am half afraid , " says Macaulay , " of this strange prosperity . " But he was quite unprepared for the reception which his book met across the Atlantic . The Harpers of Kew York had purchased the advance sheets , and with them all the rights which they could have in the absence of an international copyright law . Before the 13,000 copies had been sold in England , they wrote to Macaulay : We beg you to accept a copy of our cheap edition of your work . There have been three other editions published by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be six editions in the market . We have already sold 40,000 copies , and we presume that over 60,000 have been disposed of . Probably within three months of this time the sale will amount to 200,000 copies . No work of any kind has so completely taken our whole country by storm . Macaulay was not less gratified than surprised by this transatlantic appreciation . He writes , " I have a most intoxicating letter from Everett . He says that no book has ever had such a sale in the United States except ( note the exception ) the Bible and one or two school books in common use . " To Mr. Everett he wrote : It would be mere affectation In me not to own that I am greatly pleased by the success of my history in America . But I am almost as much puzzled as pleased , for the book is quite Insular in spirit . There is nothing cosmopolitan about it . I can understand that it might well have an interest for a few highly educated men in your country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable to the body of a people who have no king , no lords , no established church , no tories , nay , I might say , no whigs , in the English sense of the word . The dispensing power , the ecclesiastical supremacy , the doctrines of divine right and passive obedience , must all , I should have thought , seem strange things to the vast majority of the inhabitants of Boston and Philadelphia . The first installment of two volumes barely off his hands , Macaulay began to settle upon the plan of the continuation . Immense as had hitherto been the labor and research , he saw that even more would be required for the next portion , which was to treat of the reign of William . In his journal for February 8 , 1849 , he wrote : I have now made up my mind to change my plan about my history . I will first set myself to know the whole subject ; to get by reading and travelling a full acquaintance with William 's reign . I reckon that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Holland , Belgium , Scotland , Ireland , France . The Butch archives and French archives must be ransacked . I will see whether anything Is to be got from the diplomatic collections . I must see Londonderry , the Boyne , Aghrim , Limerick , Kinsale , Namur again , Landen , Steenkirk. 1 must turn over hundreds , thousands of pamphiets . Lambeth , the Bodieian , and the other Oxford libraries , the Devonshire Papers , the British Museum , must be explored , and notes made , and then I shall go to work . When the materials are ready , and the history mapped out in my own mind , I ought easily to write two of my pages daily . In two years from the time I begin writing I shall have more than finished my second part . Then I reckon a year for polishing , retouching , and printing . This brings me to the autumn of 1553 . I like this scheme much . Well nigh five years of continuous labor allotted to writing the history of barely thirteen years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work , and then it was not brought to a close . True , his labors were interrupted by a brief return to public life , which he could not have anticipated , and by failing health , which a man of fifty has reason to anticipate . We must hurry rapidly over what remains to be done . Early in the summer of 1852 Parliament was dissolved , and a new election ordered . The good people of Edinburgh had come to regret their rejection of Macaulay seven years before , and now chose him without his even going near them , or giving any pledges as to his future course . He could hardly decline such a flattering token of respect and confidence . He was to go down to meet his constituents after the election . Up to this time his health had usually been good . But now he began to complain of uneasiness and languor . Physicians were consulted , who told him that the // action of the heart was greatly impaired ; that he must have absolute repose . For some time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " twenty years older in a week . " He lived seven years longer , but was never again other than an invalid , and always worked with difficulty . He , however , took his seat in Parliament , and played a not inconspicuous part in the session of 1853 ; but it soon became evident that if his history was to go on , he must reserve all his strength for it . Finally he gave up his seat at the beginning of 1856 . Meanwhile he wrought as he could , and in November , 1855 , was able to note in his journal : " I looked over and sent off the last twenty pages . Thank God , and now for the results . " The printers had been close upon his heels , and two days after Longman was able to inform him that the whole edition of 25,000 copies had been ordered in advance . Three months later he had tangible evidence of the success of the volumes . The publishers paid him a check of ? 20,000 as a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in December . " What a sum , " he says , " to be gained by one edition of a book-I may say , gained in one day . But that was harvest day . The work had been seven years in hand . " He had heretofore occupied chambers in the heart of London . Now , at the urgency of his friends , he leased Holly Lodge , a pleasant villa and garden in Kensington , then almost a rural suburb of London : " a little paradise of shrubs and turf , " he called it , standing in a long and winding lane , whose high palings concealed from the passer-by everything except a mass of dense foliage . Ten months elapsed before he could set himself fairly at work again . On October 1 , 1856 , he notes in his journal : " To the Museum , and turned over the Dutch despatches for information about the fire of Whitehall . Home , and wrote a sheet of foolscap , the first of Part III . God knows whether I shall ever finish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The truth is , Nacaulay was now physically an old man . His purely intellectual faculties were not impaired , but the power to call them into exercise was greatly weakened . He knew that his history must be only a fragment . The most he dared to hope was to complete one more volume , bringing it down to the close of the reign of William , and this was not to be vouchsafed to him . August 28 , 1857 , is marked down by him as a white day in his life . He had staid at home , " very sad about India , " for the Sepoy mutiny was at its height , and the newspapers were filled with details of the Cawnpore tragedy . He was sitting at his solitary dinner-table , when a messenger was announced with an official letter from Lord Palmerston . A peerage was offered to him , and the Queen 's pleasure had already been taken : I was very much surprised ( he writes ) . Perhaps no such offer was ever made , without the slighest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin and moderate fortune , who bad long quitted public life . I had no hesitation about accepting , with many respectful and grateful expressions ; but God knows that the poor women at cawnpore and Delhi are more In my thoughts than my coronet . It was necessary for me to choose my title offhand . I determined to be Baron Macaulay of Rothley . I was born there ; I have lived much there ; I am named from the family which long had the manor ; my uncle was rector there . Nobody can complain of my taking my designation from a village which is nobody 's property now . It was an eminently fitting and graceful act on the part of the government . No title could indeed give new lustre to the name of Macaulay ; any title which should supersede it would have been a derogation ; but he was still Macaulay , only instead of " Tom " the prefix was " Lord . " No one expected that Lord Macaulay would be able to take any prominent part in the proceedings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once or twice on Indian affairs , should it become necessary , and hoped that he would succeed if he had voice enough to make himself heard . But the proceedings took such a turn as to // DISCEMBER , require no speech from him , and he was silent . Little work was done in 1858 . Early in 1859 Mr. ( now Sir Charles ) Trevelyan was appointed Governor of Madras , and sailed for India . Lady Trevelyan was to follow her husband in a few months , and the prospect of parting weighed heavily upon Macaulay . In October it was settled that she should sail in February . He tried to divert his mind by setting himself doggedly to reading , and above all to his history , and never accomplished more than in the next two months . On December 14 , he says : " Finished at last the session of 1699-1700 . There is a good deal in what I have written that is likely to interest readers . At any rate this employment is a good thing for myself , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After this there was written only a fragment of a dozen pages describing the death of James H. , and a few almost illegible sheets from which his sister was barely able to decipher four or five pages narrating the events of the last few days of William Ill . With these Macaulay 's work was closed , and the end was close at hand . A week later the physicians held a consultation . If the normal action of the heart could be restored , they thought all would go well . " They may be right , " wrote Macaulay , almost hopefully ; " but I am certainly very poorly-weak as a child . Yet I am less nervous than usual . I am sensible of no intellectual decay-not the smallest . " The day before Christmas he had a fainting fit , but rallied ; and his sister and her children spent Christmas day with him . He talked little , and was constantly falling asleep ; but they thought him gaining ground , and went to their home , at no great distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Holly Lodge , intending to remain to dinner . Macaulay and spoke only to answer a question . Some casual remark caused him to break down completely . The young man hurried home in alarm , and his mother at once prepared to go back with him ; but before she had left her own door a servant came with an urgent message . It was about seven o'clock , and the darkness had closed in . As they drove up the crying servants came out into the gloom , and they knew that all was over . They found him seated in his easy chair by the library table , the magazine still open before him . There was little to be told . His nephew had hardly gone when Macaulay told the butler that he would retire early , for he was very tired . The man urged him to lie down upon the sofa . He half rose as if to comply , then sank back into his chair , dead , without a struggle . They buried him ten days after , as was fitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy had there found a resting place . Conspicuous in the " Poet's* Corner , " in the magnificent chapel of Henry VII. , stands the statue of Addison . At its feet lies a stone with the modest inscription : " Thomas Babington , Lord Macaulay , born at Rothley Temple , Leicestershire , October 25 , 1800 . Died at Holly Lodge , Campden Hill , December 25 , 1859 . His Body is buried in peace , but his Name liveth for evermore . " We do not accede to the maxim that " of the dead nothing , unless it be good , " should be recorded . Perhaps it would be better if we had fewer biographies of bad men . Indeed , we believe that if nine-tenths of the biographies of good men were burned up , the world would be none the poorer . But the world is richer for this " Life of Macaulay . " Of him , living or dead , it would be hard to say anything that was not good , and of the good it is easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had occasion to show how much he had in him of the stuff of which martyrs and confessors // are made . " He indeed loved all the good things of this life : ease , comfort , the applause of his own age , and the hope of an honorable name in after ages . But he loved them with no unworthy love , and sought to gain them by no unworthy means . Had he been forced to choose whether he would forego what he desired or gain it basely , we think he would have let it go . What he wrote of Lord Holland might far more truly be said of himself : " Nature had done much for him . She had moulded him of that clay of which she is most sparing . To him she had given strong reason and sharp wit ; a quick relish for every physical and intellectual enjoyment ; constitutional intrepidity , and that frankness by which constitutional intrepidity is generally accompanied ; spirits which nothing could depress ; a temper easy , generous , and placable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of which artificial politeness is only a faint and cold imitation . " During his last few years his high spirits were , indeed , at times depressed by that slow malady which was wearing out the springs of life , and when , as he says of the dying William , " He felt that his time was short , and he grieved with a grief such as only noble spirits feel , that he must leave his work but half finished . " Not half finished-scarcely an eighth part done which he had proposed to do ; yet enough to place his name high among those which men will not willingly let die . A. H.
