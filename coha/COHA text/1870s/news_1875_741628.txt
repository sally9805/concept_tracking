txt Americans are indebted to the French fur au admirable exhibit of the relations of foreign nations to the Centennial Exhibition . The report , signed by M. LE LAFAYETTE and his colleagues on the French Parliamentary Commission , is not only marked with a spirit of amity aud goodwill to us as a people , but it presents ill the strongest possible light the advantages which foreign exhibitors may secure by representation at our Centennial Exposition ; and it sets at rest all of the objections which timid persons have raised for the benefit of hesitating strangers . It is not necessary that we should quote all the line things that have been said before now about the " traditional friendship " existing between France and the United States . The mime of the Chairman of the commission instantly revives sonic of the pleasantest inemoriea of our own history as connected with that of Franco . So long as we revere the name of WAsuisorross , that of LAFAYETTE will receive the spontaneous and hearty homage of the American people . And it is a happy chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these names are inseparably confleeted . But , whatever may be sentimentally said of our old relations with France , we have a newer right to claim her friendship and to expect from her a generous response to the invitation which we have extended to her while wo are preparing to celebrate our national Centennial . NVe have a right to expect the cordial sympathy and representation of all civilized nations . And we arc glad that we have already received from so many sources a hearty acceptance of our unaffected expressions of friendliness and welcome . It is pleasant to know that a liner feeling than that of mere interest prompts France to send a goodlyexhibit to our Exposition ; and if England demands more space at the Centennial Exhibition than at Vienna  --  as she does  --  we may honestly take this as another manifstation of the international good-fellowship in which we tuna ourselves with the peoples and powers of other lands . Coming to questions of immediate and practical moment , we find in the report presented to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs , by M. Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exact status of the Centennial Exhibition . The authors of the report have at once comprehended the somewhat anomalous relation which the Government of the United States bears to au enterprise which , according to our theory and practice , could in no case be a governmental alihir . It is not easy for people accustomed to see the Government regulate the price of daily feud and the smallest concerns of men , to understand how out own can hold itself aloof from what is coueeded to be a national affair , except in that limited degree in which our republican Ihrm permits an auxiliary sanction of a corporate work . But the French Conneissien 5 ( 1111 up the powers , duties , privileges , and limitations of the management of the American Centennial Commis. sion in a way that certainly leaves no room for future misunderstanding . They show that an act of Congress authorized the Exposition and constituted the commission which was appointed by the President ; that an Executive proclamation declared the Exposition open , within certain limits of time , to all nations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ions to princes , potentates , and powers ; that Congress had appropriated half a million for the purpose of defraying the expenses of organization , and that Congress has also made due provision for the free importation and re-exportation of all foreign goods or products dSsigued for exhibition , and not sold or consumed on American territory . Some smaller , but possibly not less important , questions have been met by the complete statement of the French Commission . It is shown that though the Exposition Company is au association incorporated under local law , rather than a governmental undertaking , pure and simple , it is amply equipped with financial securities , as well as indorsed by the Government of the United States . Ten millions of dollars , of which six millions may be claimed as subscribed , is conceded to be a sufficient capital . And it is expressly announced , on the authority of the Attorney General of the United States , that no failure on the part of the management can subject the property of foreign exhibitors to seizure on account of liabilities incurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lint to those foreigners who remember the troubles of the New-York " World 's Fair " it has its importance . Property rights in models exposed , as well as designs and trade-marks , are guaranteed so thoroughly that the French Commission say that they will follow the example of England and Austria , and rest satisfied with the expressions of assurance received from America . France has so tardily arrived at definite action on the subject of exhibiting goods at the Centennial that some delay in closing the entries has been necessary ; but it is thought that the additional three months ' grace will be sufficient to insure a brilliant display of what the commission style " the incomparable chcf8 d'ort  --  ed which adorn French museums , as well as the most . remarka ble products of ' French national manufactures of Sevres , Gobelins , and Beauvais . " To secure this a central commission for active work is asked , and an appropriation of money by the National Assembly is expected . The liberality with which space , motive power , and other necessaries are conceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual . Now , with all these facts and lucid statements , we may confidently appeal to the cordial sympathy and co-operation of the civilized world . With what sonic may consider the limitations of a republican form of government , we have been able to offer to friendly nations au opportunity for generous competition in industrial and natural products which shall be profitable , safe , and brilliant . Out first intention was a purely local exposition . It was thought fitting that our first hundred years of national existence should be rounded with a show of material wealth and progress . We do not wish to be the sole spectators of our own display . We invite . hither all people . They may bring with them their trophies iu the arts of peace . Hence our World 's Fair . It is a handsome and noble thing that our old friends across the sea have so warmly responded , . We welcome France , as we shall welcome all who choose to come .               @ @ @ @ @ @
