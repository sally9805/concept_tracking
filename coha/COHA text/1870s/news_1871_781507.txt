System . During rather more than twenty-five years the Prison Association of the State of New-York has been engaged in discharging the duties entrusted to them by their charter , " to visit , inspect and . examine all the prisons in the State , and annually report to the Legislature their state and condition , and all such other things in regard to them as may enable the Legislature to perfect their government and discipline . " Practically , the sphere of their inquiries has been coextensive with the boundaries of the Union , and . on the general question of penal discipline and criminal reform , their ? annual reports are the most reliable guides that we possess . With reference to the prisons of this State , the salutary recommendations . of this Association have , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time , we have seen spasmodic efforts , made at Albany to give them the sanction of law , but the management of our larger prisons being regarded there more as a political engine than a social problem of the highest importance , nearly every attempt at reform has fallen short of any practical result . The cardinal reform which has been persistently urged by the Association is the formation of a supervisory Board of Managers , to be substituted+ for the present Inspectors , who are practically irresponsible and . necessarily partisan . Last year the State Senate unanimously sanctioned the introduction of the amendment to the Constitution , which must precede the creation of such a body , but the Assembly failed to take any action upon it . On Friday last Mr. CAULDWELL again offered the resolution of last year to the Senate , and this time its fate was to be " laid over . " The memorial to the Governor lately issued by the Association contains an arraignment of our existing prison management , which is as severe as it is conclusive . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the three Inspectors , who , under the existing Constitution , are practically " governors of the prisons and controllers of the system . " They exercise the power of appointing some two hundred subordinates , representing gross salaries of about $220,000 a year , and their patronage is , of course , dictated by considerations which have everything to do with strengthening their party , and . nothing to do with the right government of the prisons . As the political complexion of the Board changes , so does the character of the subordinates , and a service which pre-eminently requires men of experience and character is liable to a general revolution every two years , to the very obvious detriment of the community , on moral as well as pecuniary grounds . In their carefully-elaborated statistical details , the Executive Committee of the Association make out a very strong case of mismanagement and failure against the existing system of prison management . Our legislators have verbally enunciated the principle that our State Prisons should be made self-supporting , as steadily as they have ignored it in practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the official reports showed au excess of $4,973 of expenditures over earnings , and after a twenty-three years ' trial we find the annual deficit has attained the sum of $225,061 . In fact , the figures of the Inspectors themselves show that during the period from 1847 to 1869 inclusive , the gross excess of expenditure over revenue has been close on two millions of dollars . The general importance of the question , and the necessity for immediate action to correct the growing abuses attending frequent changes of Administration , areRvery strongly urged in the " memorial . " Briefly recapitulated , its points are , that prison management involves an annual expenditure of about one million dollars , and the question occurs whether the amount shall be earned by the prisons , or be imposed as a tax upon the people ; that no supervisory power exists to determine whether the expenditures made by the Inspectors have been requisite , and have been carried out with a due regard to economy ; that the transport of prisoners now costs the State about twenty-five thousand dollars a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that amount , and that in several well-defined instances the governing power of our prisons has failed to obey the
