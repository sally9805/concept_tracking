April , PETER PITCHLYNN , CHIEF OF THE CHOCTAWS . WHEN Mr. Charles Dickens first visited this country , he met upon a steamboat on the Ohio River a noted Choctaw chief , with whom he had the pleasure of a long conversation . In the " American Notes " we find an agreeable account of this interview , in which the Indian is described as a remarkably handsome man , and , with bis black hair , aquiline nose , broad cheek-bones , sunburnt complexion , and bright , dark , and piercing eye , as stately and complete a gentleman of Nature 's making as the author ever beheld . That man was Peter P. Pitchlynn . Of all the Indian tribes which acknowledge the protecting care of the American government , there are none that command more respect than the Choctaws , and among their leading men there is not one more deserving of notice by the public at large than the subject of this paper . Merely as a romantic story , the leading incidents of his life can not but be read with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained from the man himself , they are worthy of being recorded . His father was a white man of a fighting stock , noted for his bravery and forest exploits , and an interpreter under commission from General Washington , while his mother was a Choctaw . He was born in the Indian town of Hush-ook-wa , now Noxabee County , in the State of Mississippi , January 30 , i8o6 . The first duties he performed were those of a cow-boy , but when old enough to bend a bow or hold a rifle to his shoulder , be became a hunter . In the councils of his nation he sometimes made his appearance as a lookeron , and once , when a member of the tribe who had been partially educated in New England was seen to write a letter to President Monroe , Pitchlynn resolved that he would himself become a scholar . The school nearest to his father 's log-cabin was at that time two hundred miles ofl among the hills of Tennessee , and to that he was despatched after the usual manner of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was talked about and laughed at , and within the first week of his admission be found it necessary to give the " bully " of the school a severe thrashing . At the end of the first quarter he returned to his home in Mississippi , where be found his people negotiati*ng a treaty with the general government ; on which occasion he made himself notorious by refusing to shake the hand of Andrew Jackson , the negotiator , because in his boyish wisdom he considered the treaty an imposition upon the Choctaws . Nor did he ever change his opinion on that score . His second step in the path of education was taken at the Academy of Columbia , in Tennessee , and he graduated at the University of Nashville . Of this institution General Jackson was a trustee , and on recognizing young Pitchlynn , during an official visit to the college , he remembered the demonstration which the boy had made on their first meeting , and by treating him with kindness changed the old feeling of animosity to one of warm personal friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On his return to Mississippi our hero settled upon a prairie to which his name was afterwards given , and became a farmer , but amused himself by an occasional hunt for the black bear . He erected a comfortable log-cabin , and , having won a faithful heart , he caused his marriage ceremony to be performed in public , and according to the teachings of Christianity , the Rev. C. Kingsbury being the officiating missionary ,  - -  a man long endeared to the Southern Indians , and known as " Father Kings-486 // bury . " As Pitchlynn was the first man among his people to set so worthy an example , we must award to him the credit of having given to polygamy its death - blow in the Choctaw nation , where it had existed from the earliest times . Another reform which young Pitchlynn had the privilege and sagacity to promote among his people was that of temperance , which had for some years been advocated by an Indian named David Folsom . In a treaty made in 1820 , an article had been introduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as white men , of spirituous liquors within their borders , but up to 1824 it remained a dead letter . During that year the Council of the Nation passed a law organizing a corps of light horse , to whom was assigned the duty of closing all the dram-shops that could be found carrying on their miserable traffic contrary to treaty stipulations . The command of this band was assigned to young Pitchlynn , who was thereafter recognized by the title of Captain . In one year from the time he undertook the difficult task of exterminating the traffic in liquor he had successfully accomplished it . As a reward for his services he was elected a member of the National Council , being the only young man ever thus honored . His first proposition , as a member of the Council , was for the establishment of a school ; and , that the students might become familiar with the customs of the whites , it was decided that it should be located somewhere in their country . The Choctaw Academy , thus founded near Georgetown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was for many years a monument of their advancing civilization . One of the most important and romantic incidents in Pitchlynn s career grew out of the policy , on the part of the general government , for removing the Choctaws , Chickasaws , and Creeks from their old hunting-grounds to a new location west of the Mississippi River . At the request and expense of the United States , a delegation of Indians was appointed in 1828 to go upon an exploring and peace-making expedition into the Osage country , and of this party Pitchlynn was appointed the leader . He succeeded in making a lasting peace with the Osages , who had been the enemies of the Choctaws from time immemorial . The delegation consisting of six persons , - two from each of the three tribes interested , - was absent from home about six months . The first town at which they stopped was Memphis ; their next halt was at St. Louis , where they were supplied with necessaries by the Indian superintendent ; and their last was Independence , which was then a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special civilities from a son of Daniel Boone . On leaving Independence the members of the delegation , all well mounted , were joined by an Indian agent , and their first camp on the broad prairie-land was pitched in the vicinity of a Shawnee village . This tribe had never come in conflict with the Choctaws ( though the former took the side of Great Britain in the war of 1812 ) , and , according to custom , a council was convened and pledges of friendship were renewed by an exchange of wampum and the delivery of speeches . After these ceremonies , a grand feast took place at a neighboring village on the following day ; and then the expedition continued its march towards the Osage country . For a time their course lay along the famous Santa F6 trail , and then , turning to the southwest , they journeyed over a beautiful country of rolling prairies skirted with timber , until they came to an Osage village , on a bluff of the Osage River* The delegation came to a halt within a short distance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of their original enmity , and refused to meet the strangers in council ; and as it was well known that several Osages had recently been killed by a wandering band of Choctaws , the probability of hostilities and an attempted surprise // was quite apparent . The delegation , however , proposed a treaty of peace , and after a long delay the Osages agreed to meet them in general council ; when Captain Pitchlynn stated that he and his party , the first Choctaws who had ever met the Osages with peaceful intentions , had travelled over two thousand miles hy the advice of the United States government , in order to propose to the Osages a treaty of perpetual peace . To this an orator of the Osages made a defiant and unfriendly reply , and the delegation at a second council changed their tone . Captain Pitchiynn , as before , was their only speaker . After casting a defiant look upon Be ? Oisezze* , the Osage orator , as well as upon the other Osages present , he proceeded in these words " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it very hard to restrain our ancIent animosity . You inform us that by your laws it is your duty to strike down all who are not Osage Indians . We have no such law . But we have a law which tells us that we must always strike down an Osage when we meet him . I know not what war-paths you may have followed west of the Big River , hut I very well know that the smoke of our council-fires you have never seen , and we live on the other side of the Big River . Our soil has never been tracked by an Osage , excepting when he was a prisoner . I will not , like you , speak boastingly of the many war-paths we have been up on . I am in earnest , and can only say that our last xvar-path , if you will have it so , has brought us to the Osage country , and to this village . Our *varriors at home would very well like to obtain a few hundred of your black locks , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mention these things to prove that we have some ancient laws as well as yourselves , and that we , too , were made to fight . Adhere to the laws of your fathers , refusing the offer for peace that we have made , and you must bear the consequences . We are a little band now before you , hut we are not afraid to speak our minds . Our contemplated removal from our old country to the sources of the Arkansas and Red Rivers will bring us within two hundred miles of your nation ; and when that removal takes place , we will not finish building our cabins before you shall hear the whoop of the Choctaws and the crack of their rifles . Your warriors will then fall , and your wives and children shall be taken into captivity ; and this work will go on until the Osage nation is entirely forgotten . You may not believe me , but our numbers justify the assertion , and it is time that the Indian race should begin a new kind of life . You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President ; and we now tell you that we take back all that we said yesterday about a treaty of peace . A proposition for peace , if we are to have it , must now come from the Osages . " This speech had the intended effect ; the next day negotiations were opened by the Osages ; peace was declared , and a universal shaking of hands succeeded . A grand feast next followed , and the entire Osage village , during the succeeding night , presented as joyous and boisterous an appearance as jerked buffalo-meat and water could inspire . Speeches furnished a large part of the entertainment , and to Captain Pitchlynn was awarded the honor of delivering the closing oration . He told the Osages that his people had adopted the customs of civilization , and were already reaping much benefit therefrom . They encouraged mission aries , established schools , and devoted attention to the pursuits of agriculture and the mechanic arts . He advised the Osages to do the same ; to give up war as an amusement , and the chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become a happy and prosperous people . This was their only means of preservation from the grasping habits of the white man . If they would strive for civilization , the American government would treat them with greater 488 April , // kindness , and , though they might throw away their eagle-feathers , and live in permanent cabins , there was no danger of losing their identity or name . At the end of these prolonged festivities , Be ? Oisean ' and a party of warriors selected for the purpose escorted the delegation to the borders of the Osage country , a distance of one hundred and fifty miles , During the several nights which they spent together before parting Be ? Oiseaz* was the chief talker , and he did much to entertain the whole party , while seated around their camp-fires , by relating what adventures and traditions he could remember . These he confused with facts of aboriginal history . He claimed that his people were descended from a beaver , and that the Osage hunters never killed that animal from fear of killing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe was not as large as many others , it had always contained the largest and handsomest men in the world ; that their horses were finer than those owned by the Pawnees and the Comanches ; that they preferred buffalo-meat for food to the fancy things which they used in the settlements ; that the buffalo-robe suited them better than the red blanket ; the bow and arrows were better than the rifle or gun ; and he thought their Great Spirit was a better friend to them than the Great Spirit of the white man , who allowed his children to ruin themselves by drinking the firewater . In returning to their own homes the Choctaws pursued a southern course , passed down the Canadian River , the agent leaving them at a point near Fort Gibson , and so continuing along the valley of the Red River ; and , as before stated , after an absence of several months , they all reached their cabins in safety . They had some severe skirmishes with the Comanche Indians , and two of the party got lost for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in one of the frontier cabins a bright little Indian-boy , belonging to no particular tribe as he said , carried him to Mississippi , and had him educated at the Choctaw Academy in Kentucky ; and that boy is now one of the most eloquent and faithful preachers to be found in the Choctaw nation . The expedition here sketched was the first step taken by the government towards accomplishing the removal of the Indian tribes eastward of the Mississippi River to a new and permanent home in the far West . The several tribes collected on the sources of the Arkansas and Red Rivers , and now living in a happy and progressive community , will probably number frfty thousand souls . Some eighteen thousand Cherokees and three thousand Seminoles have followed their example ; so that while thirty-six hundred of the Southern Indians are said to be living at the present time in the country where they were born , the States of Mississippi , Alabama , North Carolina , Georgia , and Florida , - seventyone thousand have made themselves a new home westward of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Henry Clay , and first made the acquaintance of the great statesman in 1840 . The Choctaw was ascending , the Ohio in a steamboat , and at Maysville during the night the Kentuckian came on board , bound to Washington . On leaving his state-room at a very early hour Pitchlynn went into the cabin , where he saw two old farmers earnestly engaged in a talk about farming , and , drawing up a chair , he listened with great delight for more than an hour . Returning to his state-room he roused a travelling companion and told him what a great treat he had been enjoying , and added : " If that old farmer with an ugly face had only been educated for the law , he would have made one of the greatest men in this country . " That " old farmer " was Henry Clay , who expressed the greatest satisfaction at the compliment that had been paid him . The steamboat. was afterwards delayed at the mouth of the Kanawha , and , as was common ow 1870. 489 // 490 such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate on the relative happiness of single and married life . Mr. Clay consented to speak , and took the bachelor side of the question , while the duty of replying was assigned to the Indian . He was at first greatly bewildered , but recollecting that he had heard Methodist preachers relate their experiences on religious matters , he thought he would relate his own experiences of married life . He did this with minuteness and considerable gusto , laying particular stress upon the goodness of his wife and the different shades of feeling and sentiment which he had experienced ; and after he had finished , the ladies present vied with Mr. Clay in applauding the talented and warmhearted Indian . When the war of the Rebellion commenced , in i86i , the subject of our sketch was in Washington , attending to public business for his people , but immediately hurried home in the hope of escaping the evils of the impendine strife . Before leaving , however , he had an interview with President Lincoln and assured him of his desire to have the Choctaws pursue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most proper one to adopt under the circumstances . But Pitchlynn 's heart was for the Union , and he made the further declaration , that , if the general government would protect them , his people would certainly espouse its cause . He then returned to the Southwest , intending to lead the quiet life of a planter on his estate in the Choctaw country . But the white men of Arkansas and Texas had already worked upon the passions of the Choctaws , and on reaching home he found a large part of the nation already infected with the spirit of rebellion . He pleaded for the national government , and , at the hazard of his life , denounced the conduct of the Southern authorities . Many stories were circulated to increase the number of his enemies ; among them was one that he had married a sister of President Lincoln , and another that the President had offered him four hundred thousand dollars to become an Abolitionist . He was sustained , however , by the best men in the nation , who made him colonel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected him Head Chief of the Choctaws ; but all this did not prevent two or three of his children , as well as many others in the nation , from joining the Confederate Army . He himself remained a Union man during the entire war . Not only had many local positions of honor been conferred upon him in times past , but he had long been looked upon by all the Choctaws as their principal teacher in religious and educational matters , as their philosopher and faithful friend , and also as the best man to represent their claims and interests as a delegate to Washington . He had under cultivation , just before the Rebellion , about six hundred acres of land , and owned over one hundred slaves ; and though he annually raised good crops of cotton and corn , he found the market for them too far off , and was beginning to devote all his attention to the raising of cattle . His own stock and that of his neighbors was of course a prize for the Confederates , who took everything , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , he acquiesced without a murmur , managing as well as he could in the reduced condition of his affairs ; and after the war , he was again solicited to revisit Washington as a delegate , in which capacity he was assigned the charge of a claim for unpaid treaty money of several millions of dollars . An address that he delivered as delegate before the President at the White House in 1855 was commented upon at the time as exceedingly touching and eloquent ; and certain speeches that he made before Congressional committees in r868 , and especially an address that he delivered in 1869 before a delegation of Quakers , called to Washington by President Grant for consultation on our Indian affairs , placed him in the foremost rank of orators. // While it is true that the most popubus single tribe of Indians now living in this country is that of the Cherokees , the Choctaws and Chickasaws , who form what is known as the Choctaw nation , outnumber the former by about live thousand , and they claim in the aggregate near twenty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attained a higher degree of civilization than any other of the Southrn tribes . The nation is divided into four districts , one of which is composed exclusively of Chickasaws ; each district was formerly under one chief ; hut now they are all ruled by a single chief or governor ; and they have a National Legislative Council . They have an alphabet of their own , and are well supplied with schools and academies , with churches and benevolent institutions , and , until lately , had a daily press . They are the only tribe Which has never , as a whole , been in hostile collision with , nor been subdued by , the United States . Have they never broken a promise or violated their plighted faith with the general government ? What certain individuals may have done during the late war ought not certainly to be charged against the nation at large . The Choctaws and Chickasaws claim for their territory , that it is as fertile and picturesque as could he desired . To speak in general terms , it forms the southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about two hundred miles long by one hundred and and thirty wide , forming an elongated square ; and while the Arkansas and Canadian Rivers bound it on the north , it joins the State of Arkansas on the east , and the Red River and Texas hound it on the south and west . These two nations , now living in alliance , consider themselves much more fortunate now than they were in the " old country , " the designation which they love to apply to Mississippi . Their form of government is similar in all particulars to that of the States of the Union . While it is true that the Rebellion had a damaging effect upon their affairs , it can not he long before they will be re Peter Pitc/djy ; uz , CJiief of the Ckoctclws. 49 I stored to their former prosperous condition . They adopted and supported before the war a system of what they called " neighborhood schools , " as well as seminaries , taught for the most part by ladies from the New England States , and intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the colleges and seminaries in the States , to which many pupils have hitherto been annually sent . The prime mover in all these educational enterprises was Colonel Pitchlynn , and it is now one of the leading desires of his heart that the good lady teachers , who were driven off by the war would either return themselves , or that others like them might be sent out from New England . In his opinion , these teachers were the best civilizers of the Choctaw nation . To New England clergymen also are the Choctaws indebted for their best translations of the Scriptures and other religious books . Their school system , which was eminently prosperous until interfered with by the Rebellion , was founded in 1842 . Up to that date the general government undertook to educate that people , and the funds set aside for the purpose were used by designing men for their own benefit . Pitchlynn well knew that he would have to fight an unscrupulous opposition , but he resolved to make an effort to have the school fund transferred from the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained an interview with John C. Spencer , then Secretary of War , and was permitted to tell his story . The Secretary listened attentively , was much pleased , and told the chief he should have an interview with the President , John Tyler . The speech which he then delivered in the White House and before the Cabinet was pronounced wonderful by those who heard it . It completely converted the President , who gave immediate orders that Pitchlynn 's suggestions should all be carried out . The Secretary fully co-operated ; and before the clerks of the Indian Office quitted their desks that night the necessary papers had been prepared , signed , sealed , // and duly delivered . Pitchlynn left Washington with flying colors , and was one of the happiest men in the land . On reaching the Choctaw country , he was honored with all the attention his people knew how to confer . On a subsequent Fourth of July he delivered an oration of remarkable beauty and power , in which he recapitulated the history of their emigration from Mississippi and after describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their new homes , and then set forth at great length his views on the subject of universal education , the whole of which , to the minutest particular , were subsequently adopted . The first academy organized under the new arrangement was named for the Secretary of War ; and from that year , until the death of John C. Spencer , that wise and warm-hearted lover of the Indians had not a more devoted friend than Peter Pitchlynn . At the commencement of the Rebellion the number of slaves in the Choctaw nation was estimated at three thousand ; and these , in the capacity of freedmen , are now waiting for the general government to keep its promises in regard to their welfare . By a treaty which was ratified in i866 they were to be adopted by the Choctaxvs and Chickasaws , and those tribes were to receive a bonus of three hundred thousand dollars ; if this stipulation should fail , the government was to remove them to some public lands , where they might found a colony ; and as the Indians have thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for the government to keep its solemn promises . These unfortunate people are said to be more intelligent and self-reliant than many of their race in the Southern States , and it certainly seems a pity that they should continue in their present unsatisfactory and disorganized condition . It is due to Colonel Pitchlynn to state , that from the beginning he has advocated the adoption of the freedmen . Ever since the removal of the Choctaws and Chickasaws to their Western territory , missionaries and school teachers have labored among them with great faithfulness , and the denominations which have chiefly participated in this good work are the Baptist , the Methodists , and the Cumberland and Old-School Presbyterians . Upon the whole , the cause of temperance has fared as well with them as with any of the fully civilized people of the Atlantic States . In certain parts of the interior alcoholic drinks are seldom if ever seen , but this can not be said of those parts bordering on Arkansas and Texas . No white man is allowed citizenship among them unless he marries a Choctaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but during the next winter no less than five hundred petitions were sent in for the same boon , which was not granted . That there has always been a want of harmony among this people on moral as well as political questions can not be denied , and the fact may be attributed to a few influential families , whom unprofitable jealousies and a party spirit are kept up , to the disadvantage of the masses . If there is anything among them which might be called aristocracy , it consists more in feeling than in outward circumstances ; for all the people live alike in plain hut comfortable logcabins , and are content with a simple manner of life . They have a goodly number of really intellectual men ; but it is undoubtedly true that , so far as the higher qualities are concerned , the particular man of whom we have been writing is without a peer . To be the leading intellect among such a people is , of course , no ordinary honor , and Colonel Pitchlynn has always cherished with affectionate pride their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet of his people and he has communicated to the writer many Choctaw legends , stored up in his retentive memory , which have never appeared in print , and which , but for Pitchlynn 's appreciation of their beauty , would scarcely have been repeated to a white man . // According to one of these traditions , the Choctaw race came from the bosom of a magnificent sea , supposed to he the Gulf of Mexico . Even when they first made their appearance upon the earth , they were so numerous as to cover the sloping and sandy shore , far as the eye could reach , and for a long time they travelled upon the sands before they could find a place suited to their wants . The name of their principal chief or prophet was Chah-tah , and he was a man of great age and wisdom . For many moons their bodies were stren*thened by pleasant breezes and their hearts gladdened by perpetual summer . In process of time , however , the multitude was visited by sickness , and the dead bodies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the shore . Then the heart of the prophet became troubled , and , planting a long staff which he carried in his hand , and which was endowed with the powers of an oracle , he told his people that from the spot designated they must turn their faces towards the unknown wilderness . But before entering upon this part of their journey he specified a certain day for starting , and told them that they were at liberty , in the mean time , to enjoy themselves by feasting and dancing and performing their national rites . It was now early morning and the hour appointed for starting . Heavy clouds and flying mists rested upon the sea , but the beautiful waves melted upon the shore as joyfully as ever before . The staff which the prophet planted was found leaning towards the point in the north , and in that direction did the multitude take up their line of march . Their journey lay across streams , over hills , through tangled forests , and over immense prairies . They now arrived in an entirely new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost care , and arose in the morning with eagerness to ascertain the direction in which it leaned . And thus had they travelled many days when they found themselves upon the margin of Pc/cr Pitchly ; zll , Chief of the Choctaws. 493 an 0-kee-na-cizillo , or great highway of water , - the Mississippi River . Here they pitched their tents , and , having again planted the staff lay down to sleep . When morning came , the oracle told them that they must cross the mighty river before them . They built themselves rafts and reached the opposite shore in safety . They now found themselves in a country of rare beauty , where the trees were so high as almost to touch the clouds , and where game of all kinds and the sweetest of fruits were found in great abundance . The flowers of this land were more brilliant than any they had ever seen , and so large as often to shield them from the sunlight of noon . With the climate of the land they were delighted , and the air they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So pleased were they with all they saw , that they built mounds in all the more beautiful valleys through which they passed , so that the Master of Life might know they were not an ungrateful people . In this country they resolved to remain , and here they established their government , and in due time made the great mound of Nun-i-wai-ya , near the head-waters of what is now known as Pearl River in Mississippi . Time passed on , and the Choctaw nation became so powerful that its hunting-grounds extended even to the sky . Troubles now arose among the younger warriors and hunters of the nation , until it came to pass that they abandoned the cabins of their fathers , and settled in distant regions of the earth . Thus , from the body of the Choctaw nation have sprung those other nations which are known as the Chickasaws , the Cherokees , the Creeks or Muscogees , the Shawnees , and the Delawares . And in process of time the Choctaws founded a great city , wherein their aged men might spend their days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their people who had long before departed into distant regions , they called this city Yazoo , the meaning of which is , Home of I/zci5coAle who are gone // Another legend , entitled Tue Overflowizg Waters , is as follows . The world was in its prime . The tiny streams among the hills and mountains shouted with joy , and the broad rivers wound their wonted course along the peaceful valleys . The moon and stars had long made the night skies beautiful , and guided the hunter through the wilderness . The sun , which the red man calls the glory of summer-time , had never failed to appear . Many generations of men lived and passed away . But in process of time the aspect of the world became changed . Brother quarrelled with brother , and cruel wars frequently covered the earth with blood . The Great Spirit saw all these and was displeased . A terrible wind swept over the wilderness , and the Ok-la-/b-ma , or red people , knew that they had done wrong , but they lived as if they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them , and proclaimed in every village the news that the human race was to be destroyed . None believed his words , and the moons of summer again came and disappeared . It was now the autumn of the year . Many cloudy days had occurred , and then a total darkness came upon the earth , and the sun seemed to have departed forever . It was very dark and very cold . Men lay down to sleep , hut were troubled with unhappy dreams . They arose when they thought it was time for the day to dawn , but only to see the sky covered with a darkness deeper than the heaviest cloud . The moon and stars had all disappeared , and there was constantly a dismal bellowing of thunder all round the sky . Men now believed that the sun would never return , and there was great consternation throughout the land . The great men of the Choctaw nation spoke despondingly to their fellows , and sung their death - songs , hut those songs were faintly heard in the gloom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grains and fruits of the land became mouldy , and the wild animals of the forest became tame , and April , gathered around the watch-fires of the Indians , entering even into the villages . A louder peal of thunder than was ever before heard now echoed through the firmament , and a light was seen in the north . It was not the light of the sun , but a gleam of distant waters . They made a mighty roar , and , in hil- , lows like the mountains , they rolled over the earth . They swallowed up the entire human race , and destroyed everything which had made the earth beautiful . Only one human being was saved , and that was the mysterious prophet who had foretold the calamity . He had built a raft of sassafras-logs , and upon this he floated above the waters . A large black bird came and flew in circles above his head . He called upon it for help , but it shrieked aloud , . and flew away and returned no more . A smaller bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beak , now came hovering over the prophet 's head . He spoke to it , and asked if there were a spot of dry land in any part of the waste of waters . It fluttered its wings , uttered a *vail , and flew directly towards that part of the sky where the newly horn sun was just sinking in the waves . A strong wind now arose , and the raft of the prophet was rapidly borne in that direction . The moon and stars again made their appearance , and the prophet landed upon a green island , where he encamped . Here he enjoyed a long and refreshing sleep , and when morning dawned , he found that the island was covered with every variety of animals , excepting the great Sizakaizil , or mammoth , which had been destroyed . Birds , too , he also found here in great abundance . He recognized the identical black bird which had abandoned him to his fate upon the waters , and , as it was a wicked bird and had sharp claws , he called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also discovered , and with great joy , the bluish bird which had caused the wind to blow him upon the island , and because of its kindness to him and its beauty , he called it Puckclze-yon-slio-ba , or the Soft-voiced PigPeter Pitchly ; ni , Chief of the choctaws. // eon . The waters finally passed away ; and in process of time that bird became a woman and the wife of the prophet , and from them all the people now living upon the earth were descended . And so ends the story of the overflowing waters , in which the reader must have noted the strong resemblance to the scriptural account of the Deluge . The most poetical of Pitchlynn 's stories is that of TAc Unknown TVo ; nan , which is as follows . It was in the very far-off times , and two hunters were spending the night by their watch-fire in a bend of the river Alabama . The game and the fish were with every new moon becoming less abundant , and all they had to satisfy their hunger was the tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as they reflected upon their condition , and thought of their hungry children , they were very unhappy , and talked despondingly . But they roasted the bird before the fire , and tried to enjoy their repast . Hardly had they commenced eating , before they were startled by a singular noise resembling the cooing of a dove . Looking in one direction they saw nothing but the moon just rising above the thick woods on the opposite side of the river . Looking up and down the stream , they could see nothing but the sandy shores and the dark waters which were murmuring a low song . They turned their eyes in the quarter directly opposite the moon , and there discovered , standing upon the summit of a grassy mound , the form of a beautiful woman . They hastened to her side , when she told them she was very hungry , and thereupon they ran after their roasted hawk and gave it all into the hands of the woman . She barely tasted the proffered food , but told the hunters that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not forget them when she returned to the happy grounds of her father , who was the Hosk-lal-li , or Great Spirit , of the Choctaws . She had one request to make , and this was , that when the next moon of midsum 495 mer should arrive they must visit the spot where she then stood . A pleasant breeze swept among the forest leaves , and the strange woman disappeared . The hunters were astonished , but they returned to their families , and kept all that they had seen and heard hidden in their hearts . Summer came , and they once more visited the mound on the banks of the Alabama . They found it covered with a plant whose leaves were like knives of the white man ; and it yielded a delicious food , which has since been known among the Choctaws as the sweet toucka , or Indian maize . Like the foregoing in spirit is this little story about the Hunter of tke Sun . The Choctaws were always a grateful people , and once , after enjoying a rich harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their leadin prophet descanted at great length upon the beauty of the earth , attributing the blessings they enjoyed to the sun . They knew that the great luminary came from the east , but none of them had ever found out what became of it when it passed beyond the mountains at the close of day . " Is there not , " said the prophet , " among all my people a single warrior who will go upon a long journey and find out what becomes of the sun ? " Then it was that a young warrior named Ok-la-no-wa , or the traveller , arose and said , " I will go and try to find out the sleeping-place of the sun , and if unsuccessful will never return . " Of course , the saddest mourner that he left behind was the girl whom he loved , and to whom he had presented a belt of scarlet wampum . After many years the traveller returned to the region of his birth , but so many changes had taken place that he felt himself a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember anything about his exploit was a very old woman , and although she was really the girl he had loved in his youth , she talked a great deal about the longlost Ok-la-no-wa , and laughed at the idea as foolish that he and the old man present were the same . The old man Pc/cr Pitc/dy ; zn , Chief of /kc Choctaws. // spent the entire winter in telling the people about the wide prairies and high mountains he had crossed , about the strange men and animals that he had seen , and that when the sun went out of sight in the evening it always sank into a blue sea ; but the old woman would not listen , and remained in her cabin , counting the wampum in her belt ; and when spring came the old man died , and was buried in the mound of Nzuz-i-waz-ya , and before the end of the corn-plantin* moon the aged woman also died , and was buried by her loving friends by the side of Ok-ia-nowa in the mound of Nun - i - real - ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the sun , they think of the hunter of the sun , and of the girl he loved , with her belt of scarlet wampum . But in the way of a love legend the folloxving account of the Nameiess Choctaw is perhaps as good a specimen as the writer can submit ; and with this he will conclude his chapter of Choctaw lore . There once lived in the royal Indian town of E-ya-sho ( Yazoo ) the only son of a war chief , who was famous for his handsome form and lofty bearing . The old men of the nation looked upon him with pride , and said that his courage was rare , and he was destined to be an eminent warrior . He was also an eloquent orator . But with all these qualities he was not allowed a seat in the councils of his nation , because he had not yet distinguished himself in war . The fame of baying slain an enemy he could not claim , nor had he even been fortunate enough to take a single prisoner . He was greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been abandoned , according to an ancient custom , and he had not yet won a name worthy of his ability , he was known among his kindred as the Nameless Choctaw . In the town of E-ya-sizo there also once lived the most beautiful maiden of her tribe . She was the daughter of a hunter , and the promised wife of the Nameless Choctaw . They met often at the great dances , but , in accordance with Indian custom , she treated him as a stranger . They loved , and one thought alone entered their minds to cast a shadow . They knew that the laws of their nation were unalterable , and that she could not become his wife until he had won a name in war , though he could always place at the door of her lodge an abundance of game , and could deck her with the most beautiful wampum and feathers . It was now midsummer , and the evening hour . The lover had met his betrothed upon the summit of a hill covered with pines . From the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch - fire , around which were dancing a party of four hundred warriors . They had planned an expedition against the distant Osages , and the present was the fourth and last night of the preparation ceremonies . Up to that evening the Nameless Choctaw had been the leader in the dances , and even now he was only temporarily absent , for he had stolen away for a parting interview with his beloved . They separtaed , and when morning came the Choctaw warriors were upon the war-path leading to the head-waters of the Arkansas . On that stream they found a cave , in which , because they were in a prairie-land , they secreted themselves . Two men were then selected as spies , one of whom , the Nameless Choctaw , was to reconnoitre in the west , and the other in the east . Night came , and the Indians in the cave were discovered by an Osage hunter , who had entered to escape the heavy dews . He at once hastened to the nearest camp , told his people what he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave . At its mouth they built a fire , and before the dawn of day the entire Choctaw party had been smothered to death by the cunning of their enemies . The Choctaw spy who journeyed to the east had witnessed the surprise and unhappy fate of his brother-warriors , and , soon returning to his own country , he called a council and revealed the sad intelligence . As to the fate of the // nameless warrior who had journeyed towards the west , he felt certain that he too must have been overtaken and slain . Upon the heart of one this story fell with a heavy weight ; and the promised wife of the lost Choctaw hegan to droop , and before the moon had passed away she died and was buried on the spot where she had parted with her lover . But what became of the Nameless Choctaw ? It was not true that he had been overtaken and slain . He was indeed discovered hy the Osages , and far over the prairies and across the streams was he closely pursued . For many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choctaw finally made his escape . His course had been very winding , and when he came to a halt he was astonished to find that the sun rose in the wrong quarter of the heavens . Everything appeared to him wrong and out of order , and he became a forlorn and bewildered man . At last he found himself at the foot of a mountain which was covered with grass , and unlike any he had ever before seen . It so happened , however , at the close of a certain day , that he wandered into a wooded valley , and , having made a rude lodoe and killed a swamp rabbit , he lighted a fire , and prepared himself for at least one quiet supper and a night of repose . Morning dawned , and he was still in trouble , but continued his wanderings . Many moons passed away ; summer came , and he called upon the Great Spirit to make his pathway plain . He hunted the forests for a spotted deer , and having killed it , on a day when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that night supped upon a portion of the animal 's flesh . His fire burnt brightly , and , though lonesome , his heart was at peace . But now he hears a footstep in an adjoining thicket ! A moment more , and a snowwhite wolf of immense size is crouching at his feet , and licking his torn moccasins . " How came you in this strange country ? " inquired the wolf ; and the poor Indian told the story of his many troubles . The wolf took pity upon him , and said that he would conduct him in safety to the country of his kindred ; and on the following morning they departed . Long , very long was the journey , and very crude and dangerous the streams which they had to cross . The wolf helped the Indian to kill game for their mutual support , and by the time that the moon for weeding corn had arrived the Choctaw had entered his native village again . This was on the anniversary of the day he had parted from his betrothed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Time and suffering had so changed the wanderer , that his relatives and friends did not recognize him , and he did not make himself known . Often , however , he made them recount the story of her death , and many a wild song , to the astonishment of all , did he sing to the memory of the departed , whom he called by the name of I ; , zma , or the idol of warriors . On a cloudless night he visited her grave , and at a moment when the Great Spirit cast a shadow upon the moon he fell upon the grave in grief and died . For three nights afterwards the inhabitants of the Choctaw village were alarmed by the continual howling of a woW and when it ceased , the pine forest upon the hill where the lovers were resting in peace took up the mournful sound , and has continued it to the present time .
