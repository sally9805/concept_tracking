txt A verdict has just been rendered by a jury in the Superior Court , before Judge SEDOWICK , which is sure to give satisfaction to a very large number of persons . The plaintiff ; a boy of thirteen years , sued , through his guardian , a butcher named RODMAN , to recover $5,000 damages for injuries sustained to his head in a " run-over accident , " the result of reckless driving on the part of . a young man in the employ of RonsuN . The " accident " occurred in Seventy-seventh street in this City . The defense Was that RODMAN 'S assistant had been taking a ride for pleasure , without the sanction of his employer , when the boy was knocked down and run over . Counsel , in his argument , submitted that , as a consequence , the employer should not be held responsible . The jury thought differently , however , and gave the plaintiff a Verdict for $1,250 . Now , as a matter of fact , it is well known that during the past year a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' carts while driven at a furious pace . That more cases in which serious injuries were inflicted have not occurred has been due entirely to luck . The butcher-boys are notorious for recklessness in the use of the whip . Their loads of meat once delivered , they give rein to their well-fed horses , and , with their caps pulled down over their ears , dash through the moat populous thoton.ghfares like - wild Indians . Their favorite drives are the avenues at the east and west sides . The policemen seldom etteceed in bringing them to the right-about , for the reason that , short of firing at them with their revolvers , it would be well-nigh impossible to do so . Thns far the most severe " ran-over accidents " have occurred in the east-side avenues . Avenues A and B swarm with children at nearly all hours of the day . The flying butcher 's cart sometimes literally mows them down . The parents of children injured in this manner are usually either too poor to go to law for the recovery of damages , or too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institute proceedings . Hence the comparative infrequency of such actions . The result in the case referred to , it is to be hoped , will inspire more confidence in our courts . There is no remedy so effectual as the one which involves a lightening of the purse of the offender , or , should he have no purse to lighten  --  the person responsible in law for the offense . If every " boss " butcher in the City could be made to believe that the employment of careless assistants was to cause a serious inroad on the annual profits of his business , the butchers ' carts would soon be among our most carefully-driven vehicles . It will not take many verdicts like that which was rendered in the Superior Court last week to effect such a result . It would be hardly fair to the butcherboys to charge- that they are the only reckless drivers . The drivers of stages , street ears , trucks , wagons and hack carriages , it sal* , e ' is but right to sal* , are quite as indifferent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause we can not say , but it is , nevertheless , the fact , that most men who drive horses through our streets have the greatest possible contempt for pedestrians . They look upon them as interlopers who have no no right to delay their progress by crossing streets . As a consequence of this very absurd opinion , it is often about as much as a man 's life is worth to attempt to cross Broadway , or any other crowded thoroughfare , without a Police escort . The stagedrivers seem to vie with the haelanen in whipping ap their jaded beasts to close a momentary opening in a long line of vehicles , just as some feeble old man essays to gain the opposite side of the street . A great many so-called accidents have occurred every year from indulgence in this particular kind of playfulness . Occasionally . the owners of stage lines have been required to pay for injuries ? inflicted in this manner . It is to be regretted that they have not been called upon more frequently to put their hands in their pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such dastardly outrages would be less common . The truck and wagon drivers think it good fun to imitate the acts or the hackmen and stage-drivers . The severe punishment of the latter might , therefore , be depended upon to have a salutary influence on the former . Our advice is , that no opportunity which offers for making the owners of all sorts of vehicles pay dearly for employing drivers who are indifferent to the rights and safety of pedestrians , shall be lost . The man who suffers a slight injury through the recklessness of a driver , and fails to hand over said driver to the Police , Will richly deserve his fate should he at some future time be ran over and crippled for life .
