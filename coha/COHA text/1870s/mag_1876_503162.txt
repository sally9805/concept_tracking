I. WHEREVER Nature has commissioned one creature to prey upon another , she has preserved the balance by forewarning that other creature of what she has done . Nature says to the cat , " Catch the mouse , " and she equips her for that purpose ; but on the self-same day she says to the mouse , " Be wary  --  the cat is watching for you . " Nature takes care that none of her creatures have smooth sailing , the whole voyage at least . Why has she not made the musquito noiseless and its bite itchless I Simply because in that case the odds would be too greatly in its favor . She has taken especial pains to enable the owl to fly softly and silently , because the creatures it preys upon are small and wary , and never venture far from their holes . She has not shown the same caution in the case of the crow , because the crow feeds on dead flesh or on grubs and beetles , or fruit and grain , that do not need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat up the little fish , and the little fish know it , and on the very day they are hatched seek shallow water , and to put little sand bars between themselves and their too loving parents . How easily a bird 's tail , or that of any fowl , or in fact any part of the plumage , comes out when the hold of its would-be capturer is upon this alone ; and how hard it yields in the dead bird . No douht there is relaxation in the former case . Nature says to the pursuer , " Hold on , " and to the pursued , " Let your tall go . " What is the tortuous zig-zag course of those slow-flying moths for but to make it difficult for the birds to snap them up ? The skunk is a slow , witless creature , and the fox and lynx love its meat ; yet it carries a bloodless weapon that neither likes to face . I recently heard of an ingenious method a certain other simple and slow-going creature has of baffling its enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he saw a commotion in the grass a few yards off . Approaching the spot , he found a snakethe common garter snake-trying to swallow a lizard . And how do you suppose the lizard was defeating the benevolent designs of the snake ? By simply taking hold of its own tail and making itself into a hoop . The snake went round and round and could find neither beginning nor end . Who was the old giant that found himself wrestling with time ? This little snake had a tougher customer the other day in the bit of eternity it was trying to swallow . The snake itself has not the same wit , because I lately saw a black snake in the woods trying to swallow the garter snake , and he had made some headway , though the little snake was fighting every inch of the ground , hooking his tail about sticks and bushes , and pulling back with all his might , apparently not liking the looks of things down there at all . I thought it well to let him have a good taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down against further proceedings . This arming of one creature against another is often cited as an evidence of the wisdom of Nature , but it is rather an evidence of her impartiality . She does not care a fig more for one creature than for another , and is equally on the side of both , or perhaps it wo&amp;dd be better to say she does not care a fig for either . Every creature must take its chances , and man is no exception . We can ride if we know how and are going her way , or we can be run over if we fall or make a mistake . Nature does not care whether the hunter slay the beast or the beast the hunter ; she will make good compost of them both , and her ends are prospered whichever succeed . // If the red slayer think he slays , Or if the slain think he is slain , They know not well the subtle ways I keep , and pass , and turn again . What is the end of Nature ? Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any and every point . So everything in Nature is at the top , and yet no one thing is at the top . She works with reference to no measure of time , no limit of space , and with an abundance of material not expressed by exhaustless . Did you think Niagara a great exhibition of power ? What is that , then , that withdraws noiseless and invisible in the ground about , and of which magara is but the lifting of the linger ? Nature is thoroughly selfish , and looks only to her own ends . One thing she is bent upon , and that is keeping up the supply , multiplying endlessly and scattering as she multiplies . Did Nature have in view our delectation when she made the apple , the peach , the plum , the cherry , etc . I Undoubtedly ; but only as a means to her own private ends . What a bribe or a wage is the pulp of these delicacies to all creatures to come and sow their seed . And Nature has taken care to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten , the germ is not , but only planted . God made the crab-apple , but man made the pippin ; but the pippin can not propagate itself , and exists only by violence and usurpation . Bacon says , " It is easier to deceive Nature than to force her , " but it seems to me the nurserymen really force her . They cut off the head of a savage and clap on the head of a line gentleman , and the crab becomes a Swaar or a Baldwin . Or is it a kind of deception practised upon Nature , which succeeds only by being carefully concealed ? If we could play the same tricks upon her in the human species , how the great geniuses could be preserved and propagated , and the world stocked with them . But what a frightful condition of things that would be I No new men , but a tiresome and endless repetition of the old ones  --  a world perpetually stocked with Newtons and Shakespeares . We say Nature knows best and has adapted this or that to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and color to the eye , etc. ; but she has not done any such thing , but has adapted man to these things . The physical cosmos is the mould , and man is the molten metal that is poured into it . The light fashioned the eye , the laws of sound made the ear ; in fact man is the outcome of Nature and not the reverse . Creatures that live for ever in the dark have no eyes , and would not any one of our senses perish and be shed as it were in a world where it could not be used IL IT is well to let down our metropolitan pride a little . Man thinks himself at the top , and that the immense display and prodigality of Nature are for him . But they are no more for him than they are for the birds and beasts , and he is no more at the top than they are . He appeared upon the stage when the play had advanced to a certain point , and he will disappear from the stage when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama go on without him . The geological ages , the convulsions and parturition throes of the globe , were to bring him forth no more than the beetles . Is not all this wealth of the seasons , these solar and sidereal influences , this depth *snd vitality and internal fire , these seas , and rivers , and ocean , and atmospheric currents , as necessary to the life of the ants and worms we tread under foot as to our own ? And does the sun shine for me any more than for yon butterfly ? What I mean to say is , we can not put our finger upon this or that and say here is the end of Nature . The Infinite can not be measured . The plan of Nature is so immense-but she has no plan , no scheme , but to go on and on for ever . What is size , what is time , distance , etc. , to // the Infinite ? Nothing . The Infinite knows no time , no space , no great , no small , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the worlds are a kind of nervous ganglia in an organization of which we can form no conception , or less even than that . If one of the globules of blood that circulate in our veins was magnified enough million times , we might see a globe teeming with life and power . Such is this earth of ours , coursing in the veins of the Infinite . Size is only relative , and the imagination finds no end to the series either way . Ill . LOOKING out of the car window one day , I saw the pretty and unusual sight of an eagle sitting upon the ice in the river , surrounded by half a dozen or more crows . The crows appeared as if looking up to the noble bird and attending his movements . " Are those its young ? " asked a gentleman by my side . How much did that man know-not about eagles , but about Nature ? If he had been familiar with geese or hens , or with donkeys , he would not have asked that question . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew all truths ; so much else becomes knowable when one vital fact is thoroughly known . You have a key , a standard , and can not be deceived . Chemistry , geology , astronomy , natural history , all admit one to the same measureless interiors . I heard a great man say that he could see how much of the theology of the day would fall before the standard of him who had got even the insects . And let any one set about studying these creatures carefully , and he will see the force of the remark . We learn the tremendous doctrine of metamorphosis from the insect world , and have not the bee and the ant taught man wisdom from the first ? I was highly edified the past summer by ob8erving the ways and doings of a cobny of black hornets that established themselves under one of the projecting gables of my house . This hornet has the reputation of being a very ugly customer , but I found it no trouble to live on the most friendly terms with them . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed the eagle among hornets , and very noble and dignified in its bearing . They used to come freely into the house and prey upon the flies . You would hear that deep , mellow hum , and see the black falcon poising on wing , or striking here and there at the flies , that scattered on his approach like chick. ens before a hawk . When he had caught one he would alight upon some object and proceed to dress and draw his game . The wings were sheared off , the legs cut away , the bristles trimmed , then the body thoroughly bruised and broken . When the work was completed , the fly was rolled up into a small pellet , and with it under his arm the hornet flew to his nest , where no doubt in due time it was properly served up on the royal board . Every , dinner inside these paper walls is a state dinner , for the queen bee is always present . I used to mount the ladder towithin two or three feet of the nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshop must be inside  --  a place where the pulp was mixed and perhaps treated with chemicals ; for each bee when he came with his burden of materials passed into the nest , and then , after a few moments , emerged again and crawled to the place of building . But I one day stopped up the entrance with some cotton , when no one happened to be on guard , and then observed that when the loaded bee could not get inside , he , after some deliberation , proceeded to the unfinished part and went forward with his work . Hence I inferred that may be the bee went inside to report and to receive orders , or possibly to surrender its material into fresh hands . Its career when away from the nest is beset with dan- // SEPTEMBER , gers ; the colony , is never large , and the safe return of every bee is no doubt a matter of solicitude to the royal mother . The hornet was the first paper maker , and holds the original patent . The paper it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , and made of essentially the same material - woody fibres scraped from old rails and boards . And there is news on it too , if one could make out the characters . When I stopped the entrance with cotton there was no commotion or excitement , as there would have been in the case of yellow-jackets . Those outside went to pulling , and those inside went to pushing and chewing . Only once did one of the outsiders come down and look me suspiciously in the face , and inquire very plainly what my business might be up there . I bowed my head , being at the top of a twenty feet ladder , and had nothing to say . The cotton was chewed and moistened about the edges till every fibre was loosened , when the mass dropped . But instantly the entrance was made smaller , and changed so as to make the feat of stopping it iaore difficult . Iv . THERE are those who look at Nature from the standpoint of conventional and artificial life-from parlor windows and through guilt-edged poems  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look at Nature at all , but are a grown part of her , and look away from her toward the other class  --  the backwoodsmen and pioneers , and all rude and simple persons . Then there are those in whom the two are united or merged  --  the great pots and artists . In them the sentimentalist is corrected and cured , and the hairy and taciturn frontiersman has had experience to some purpose . The true poet knows more about Nature than the naturalist because he carries her open secrets in his heart . Eckerman could instruct Goethe in ornithology , but could not Goethe instruct Eckerman in the meaning and mystery of the bird ? It is my privilege to number among my friends a man who has passed his life in cities amid the throngs of men , who never goes to the woods or to the country , or hunts or fishes , and yet he is the true naturalist . I think he studies the orbs . I think day and night and the stars and the faces of men and women have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nature because we are afraid of man . Our artists paint the landscape because they c&amp;nnot paint the human face . If we could look into the eyes of a man as coolly as we can into the eyes of an animal , the products of our pens and brushes would be quite different from what they are . V. Buy I suspect after all it makes but little difference to which school you go , whether to the woods or to the city . A sincere man learns pretty much the same things in both places . The differences are superficial , the resemblances deep and many . The hermit is a hermit and the poet a poet , whether he grow up in London or on the moon . I was forcibly reminded of this fact recently on opening the works of Charles Lamb after I had been reading those of our Henry Thoreau . Lamb cared nothing for nature , Thoreau for little else . One was * attached to the city and the lire of the street and tavern as the other to the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close akin . They give out the same tone and are pitched in about the same key . Their methods are the same ; so are their quaintness and scorn of rhetoric . Thoreau has the dryer humor , as might be expected , and is less stomachic . There is more juice and uno // tion in Lamb , but this he owes to his nationality . Both are essayists who in a less reflective age would have been poets pure and simple . Both were spLire , high-nosed men , and I fancy a resemblance even in their portraits . Thoreau is the Lamb of New England fields and woods , and Lamb is the Thoreau of London streets and dubs . There was a wilfulness and perversity about Thoreau behind which he concealed his shyness and his thin skin , and there was a similar foil in Lamb , though less marked , on account of his good nature : that was a part of his armor too . VL SPEAIrII*G of Thoreau 's dry humor reminds me how surely the old English unctuous and sympathetic humor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our first notable crop of authors had it-Paulding , Cooper , Irving , and in a measure Hawthornebut our later humorists have it not at all , but in its stead an intellectual quickness and perception of the ludicrous that is not unmixed with scorn . One of the marks of the great humorist , like Cervantes or Sterne or Scott , is that he approaches his subject not through his head merely , but through his heart , his love , his humanity . His humor is full of compassion , full of the milk of human kindness , and does not separate him from his subject , but unites him to it by vital ties . How Sterne loved Uncle Toby and sympathized with him , and Cervantes his luckless knight . I fear our humorists would have made fun of them , would have shown them up and stood aloof superior , and " laughed a laugh of merry scorn . " Whatever else the great humorist or poet or any artist may be or do , there is no contempt in his laughter . And this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that nearly all our humorous writers seem impressed with the conviction that their own dignity and self-respect require them to looA* down upon what they portray . But it is only little men who look down upon anything or speak down to anybody . One sees every day how clear it is that specially fine , delicate , intellectual persons can not portray satisfactorily coarse , common , uncultured characters . Their attitude is at once scornful and supercilious . And by fine , intellectual persons , I mean those expur* gated natures , like Matthew Arnold , who , to use a favorite image of mine , fall at the fine violet and indigo end of the spectrum of life , in opposition to the red and orange end . The great man , like Socrates , or Dr. Johnson , or Abraham Lincoln , is just as surely coarse as he is fine , but the complaint I make with our humorists is that they are fine and not coarse in any healthful and manly sense . A great part of the best literature *nd the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chest , the appetites , and is to be read and judged only through love and compassion . Let us pray for unction , which is the marrowfat of humor , and for humility , which is the badge of manhood . What I complain of is just as true of the essayists and the critics as of the novelists . The prevailing tone here also is born of a feeling of immense superiority . How our lofty young men , for instance , look down upon Carlyle , and administer their masterly rebukes to him . But see how Cai'lyle treats Burns , or Scott , or Johnson , or Novalis , or any of his heroes . Ay , there 's the rub ; he makes heroes of them , which is not a trick of small natures . He can say of Johnson that he was " moonstruck , " but it is from no lofty height of fancied superiority , but he uses the word as a naturalist uses a term to describe an object he loves . Is Mr. Lowell capable of this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uppermost ? What we want , and perhaps have got more of than I am ready to admit , is a race of writers who affiliate with their subjects and enter into them // through their blood , their sexuality , and manliness , instead of standing apart and criticising them and writing about them through mere intellectual cleverness and " smartness . " VIL THERE is a feeling in heroic poetry or in a burst of eloquence that I sometimes catch in quite different fields . I caught it this morning , for instance , when I saw the belated trains go by , and knew how they had been battling with storm , darkness , and distance , and had triumphed . They were due at my place in the night , but did not pass till after eight o'clock in the morning . Two trains coupled together-the east mail and the expressmaking an immense line of coaches hauled by two engines . They had come from the West , were all covered with snow and ice , like soldiers with the dust of battle upon them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ augmented speed , and with a resolution that was epic and grand . Talk about the cars dispelling the romance from the landscape ; if they do , they bring the heroic element in . The moving train is a proud spectacle , especially in stormy and tempestuous nights . When I look out and see its light , steady and unflickering as the planets , and hear the roar of its advancing tread , or its sound diminishing in the distance , am I comforted and made stout of heart . 0 night , where is thy stay I 0 space , where is thy victory I Or to see the fast mail pass in the morning is as good as a page of Homer . It quickens one 's pulse for all day . It is the Ajax of trains . I hear its defiant , warning whistle , hear it thunder over the bridges , and its sharp , rushing ring among the rocks , and in the winter mornings see its glancing , meteoric lights , or in summer its white form bursting through the silence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its roofs and stretching far behind-a , sight better than a battle . It is something of the same feeling one has in witnessing any wild , free careering in storms and in floods in nature , or in beholding the charge of an army , or in listening to an eloquent man , or to a hundred instruments of music in full blast-it is triumph , victory . What is eloquence but mass in motion  --  a flood , a cataract , an express train , a cavalry charge ? We are literally carried away , swept from our feet , and recover our ser.ses again as best we can . VITh I AM glad to observe that all the poetry of the midsummer harvesting has not gone ont with the scythe and the whetstone . The line of mowers was a pretty sight , if one did not sympathize too deeply with the human backs turned up there to the sun , and the sound of the whetstone , coming up from the meadows in the dewy morning , was pleasant music . But I find the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tune with the voices of nature at this season . The characteristic sounds of midsummer are the sharp , whirring crescendo of the cicada or harvest fly , and the rasping , stridulons notes of the nocturnal insects . The mowing machine repeats and imitates these sounds . T is like the hum of a locust or the shuffling of a mighty grasshopper . More than that , the grass and the grain at this season have become hard . The timothy stalk is like a file ; the rye straw is glazed with flint ; the grasshoppers snap sharply as they fly up in front of you , the bird-songs have ceased , the ground crackles under foot , the eye of day is brassy and merciless , and in harmony with all these things is the rattle of the mower and hay tedder . Ix . Tin an evidence of how directly we are related to Nature , that we more or // less sympathize with the weather , * * --  X. take on the color of the day . Goethe said he worked easiest in a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some days and wo n't draw at all on others , and the secret is mainly in the condition of the atmosphere . Anything positive and decided with the weather is a good omen . A pouring rain may be more auspicious than a sleeping sunshine . When the stove draws well the fogs and fumes will leave your mind . I find there is great virtue in the bare ground , and have been much put out at times by those white angelic days we have in winter , such as Whittier has so well described in these lines : Around the glistening wonder bent The blue walls of the firmament ; No cloud above , no earth below , A universe of sky and snow . On such days my spirit gets snow blind ; all things take on the same color , or no color ; my thought loses its perspective ; the inner world is a blank like the outer , and all my great ideals are wrapped in the same monotonous and expressionless commonplace . The blackest of black days are better . Why does snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Not merely because it is cold , and the sym. bol of death , for I imagine as many inches of apple blossoms would have about the same effect ; but because it expresses nothing . White is a negative ; a perfect blank . The eye was made for color , and for the earthy tints , and when these are denied it , the mind is very apt to sympathize and to suffer also . Then when the sap begins to mount in the trees , and the spring languor comes , does not one grow restless indoors ? The sun puts out the fire , the people say , and the spring sun certainly makes one 's intellectual light grow dim . Why should not a man sympathize with the seasons and the moods and phases of Nature ? He is an apple upon this tree , or rather he is a babe at this breast , and what his great mother feels affects him also . I HAVE frequently been surprised in late fall and early winter to see how unequal or irregular was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suddenly a great fall in the mercury , the frost lays siege to the soil and effects a lodgment here and there , and extends its conquests gradually . At one place in the field you can easily run your staff through into the soft ground , when a few rods further on it will be as hard as a rock . A little covering of dry grass or leaves is a great protection . The moist places hold out long and the spring runs never freeze . You find the frost has gone several inches into the ploughed ground , but on going to the woods and poking away the leaves and d6-bris under the hemlocks and cedars , you find there is no frost at all . The earth freezes her ears , and toes , and naked places first , and her body last . If heat was visible , or if we represent it say by smoke , then the December landscape would present a curious spectacle . We would see the smoke lying low over the meadows , thickest in the hollows and moist places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cling to the fences and ravines . Under every evergreen tree we would see the vapor rising and filling the branches , while the woods of pine and hemlock would be blue with it long after it had disappeared from the open country . It would rise from the tops of the frees and be carried this way and that with the wind . The valleys of the great rivers , like the Hudson , would overflow with it . Large bodies of water become regular magazines in which heat is stored during the summer , and they give it out again during the fall and early winter . The early frosts keep well back from the Hudson , skulking behind the * ridges , and hardly come over in sight at any point . But they grow bold as the season advances , till the river 's fires too are put out and winter covers it with his snows. // XL Oxis pf the strong and original strokes of Nature was when she made the loon . It is always refreshing to contemplate a creature so positive and characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The loon is the genus lckci of the wild northern lakes , as solitary as they are . Some birds represent the majesty of Nature , like the eagles ; others its ferocity , like the hawks ; others its cunning , like the crow ; others its sweetness and melody , like the song birds . The loon represents its wildness and solitariness . It is cousin to the beaver . It has the feathers of a bird and the fur of an animal , and the heart of both . It is in the strictest sense an aquatic fowl . It can barely walk upon the land , and one species at least can not take flight from the shore . But in the water its feet are more than feet and its wings more than wings . It plunges into this denser air and flies with incredible speed . Its head and beak form a sharp point to its tapering neck . Its wings are far in front and its legs equally far in the rear , and its course through the crystal depths is like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till last fall , when one appeared on the river in front of my house . I knew instantly it was the loon . Who could not tell a loon a half mile or more away , though he had never *een one before ? The river was like glass , and every movement of the bird as it sported about broke the surface into ripples , that revealed it far and wide . Presently a boat shot out from shore and went ripping up the surface toward the loon . The creature at once seemed to divine the intenMc*n* of the boatman , and sidled off obliquely , keeping a sharp lookout as if to make sure it was pursued . A steamer came down and passed between them , and when the way was again clear the loon was still swimmi*ng on the surface . Presently it disappeared under the water , and the boatman pulled sharp and hard . In a few moments the bird reappeared some rods further on , as if to make an observation . Seeing it was being pursued , and no mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had gone many times as far as the boat had in the same space of time . Then it dove again , and distanced its pursuer so easily that he gave over the chase and rested upon his oars . But the bird made a final plunge , and when it came up was over one mile away . Its course must have been , and doubtless was , an actual flight under water , and half as fast as the crow flies in the air . The loon would have delighted the old poets . Its wild , demoniac laughter awakens the echoes on the solitary lakes , and its ferity and hardiness was kindred to those robust spirits . XIL Oxjs notable difference between man and the four-footed animals which has often occurred to me is in the eye , and the greater perfection or rather supremacy of the sense of sight in the human species . All the animals-the dog , the fox , wolf , deer , cow , horse , etc. - depend mainly upon the senses of hearing and smell . Almost their entire powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog picks his master out of the crowd by smell , and the cow her calf out of the herd . Sight is only partial recognition . The question can only be settled beyond all doubt by the aid of the nose . The fox , alert and cunning as he is , will pass within a few yards of the hunter and not know him from a stump . A squirrel will run across your lap and a marmot between your feet if you are motionless . When a herd of cattle see a strange object they are not satisfied till each one has sniffed it , and the horse is cured of his fright at the robe , or the meal bag , or other object , as soon as he can be induced to smell it . There is a great deal of speculation in the eye of an animal , but very little science . Then you can not catch an animal 's eye ; he looks at you , but not into your eye . The // 1876. dog directs his gaze toward your face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth or nose . The same with your horse or cow . Their eye is vague and indefinite . Not so with the birds . The bird has the human eye in its clearness , its power , and its supremacy over the other senses . How acute their sense of smell may be is uncertain ; their hearing is sharp enough , but their vision is the most remarkable . A crow or a hawk , or any of the larger birds , will not mistake you for a stump , or rock , stand you never so still amid the bushes . But they can not separate you from your horse or team . A hawk reads a man on horseback as one animal , and reads it as a horse . None of the sharp-scented animals could be thus deceived . The bird has man 's brain also in its size . The brain of a song bird is even much larger in proportion than that of the greatest human monarch , and its life is correspondingly intense and high-strung . Bu* the bird 's eye is superficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is round , that it may take in a full circle at a glance . All the quadrupeds emphasize their direct forward gaze by a corresponding movement of the ears as if to supplement and aid one sense with another . But man 's eye seldom needs the confirmation of his ear , while it is so set and his head so poised that his look is forcible and pointed without being thus seconded . XIII . I ONCE saw a cow that had lost her cud . How forlorn and desolate and sick at heart that cow looked I No more rumination , no more of that second and finer mastication , no more of that sweet and juicy revery under the spreading trees , or in the stall . Then the farmer took an elder and scraped the bark and put something with it and made the cow a cud , and after due waiting the experiment took , a response came back , and the mysterious 837 machinery was once more in motion , and the cow was herself again . Have you , 0 poet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cud and wandered about days and weeks without being able to start a single thought or an image that tasted good-your literary appetite dull or all gone , and the conviction daily growing that it is all over with you in that direction ? A little elder bark , something fresh and bitter from the woods , is about the best thing you can take . XIV I AM surprised to see how little the earth is hidden by the deepest fall of snow . It is little more than a whitewash . Every path through the fields is just as plain as before . On every hand the ground sends toke*is , and the curves and slopes are not of the snow , but of the earth beneath . In like manner the rankest vegetation hides the ground less than we think . Looking across a wide valley in the month of July , I have noted that the fields , except the meadows , had a ruddy tinge , and that corn which near at hand seemed to completely envelop the soil , at that distance gave only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere predominated , and I doubt not if we could see the earth from a point sufficiently removed , as from the moon , its ruddy hue , like that of Mars , would alone be visible . What is a man but a miniature earth , with many disguises in the way of manners , possessions , dissemblances , etc ? Yet through all-through all the work of his hands and all the thoughts of his mind-how surely the ground quality of him , the fundamental hue , whether it be this or that , makes itself felt and is alone important . XV . I HAVE thought that the boy is the only true lover of Nature , and that we // who make such a dead set at studying and admiring her come very wide of the mark . " The nonchalance of a boy who is sure of his dinner , " says our Emerson , " is the healthy attitude of humanity . " The boy is a part of Nature ; he is as indifferent , as careless , as vagrant as she . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he halloes , he feeds on roots , and greens , and mast . He uses things roughly and without sentiment . The coolness with which boys will drown dogs or cats , or hang them to trees , or murder young birds , or torture frogs or squirrels , is like Nature 's own mercilessness . Certain it is that we often get some of the best touches of nature from children . Childhood is a world by itself , and we listen to children when they frankly speak out of it with a strange interest . There is such a freedom from responsibility and from worldly wisdom-it is heavenly wisdom . There is no sentiment in children , because there is no ruin ; nothing has gone to decay about them yet-not a leaf or twig . Until he is well into his teens and sometimes later , a boy is like a bean pod before the fruit has developed-indefinite , succulent , rich in possibilities which are only vaguely outlined . He is a pericarp merely . How rudimental are all his ideas . I knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were two kinds of swallows-chimney swallows and swallows . Girls come to themselves sooner ; are indeed from the first more definite and " translatable . " XVL WHO will write the natural history of the boy ? One of the first points to be taken account of is his clannishness . The boys of one neighborhood are always pitted against those of an adjoining neighborhood , or of one end of town against those of the other end . A bridge , a river , a railroad TOUCHES OF NATURE . SEPTEMBER , track are always boundaries of hostile or semi-hostile tribes . The boys that go up the road from the country school hoot derisively at those that go down the road , and not infrequently add the insult of stones ; and the down-roaders return the hooting and the missiles with interest . Often there is open war , and the boys meet and have regular battles . A few years since the boys of two rival towns on opposite sides of the Ohio river became so belligerent that the authorities had to interfere . Whenever an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river he was unmercifully beaten , and when a Virginia boy was discovered on the Ohio side , he was pounced upon in the same manner . One day a vast number , of boys , about one hundred and fifty on a side , met by appointment upon the ice and engaged in a pitched battle . Every conceivable missile was used , including pistols . The battle , says the local paper , raged with fury for about two hours . One boy received a wound behind the ear , from the effects of which he died the next morning . More recently the boys of a large manufacturing town of New Jersey were divided into two hostile clans that came into frequent collision . One Saturday both sides mustered its forces , and a regular fight ensued , one boy here also losing his life from the encounter . Every village and settlement is at times the scene of these youthful collisions . When a new boy appears in the village , or at the country schoel , how the other boys crowd around him and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try his mettle . I knew a boy , twelve or thirteen years old , who was sent to help a drover with some cattle as far as a certain village ten miles from his home . After the place was reached , and while the boy was eating his cracker and candies , he strolled about the village , and fell in with some other boys playing upon a bridge . In a short time a large number of children // of all sizes had collected upon the bridge . The new corner was presently challenged by the boys of his own age to jump with them . This he readily did , and cleared their furthest mark . Then he gave them a sample of his stone-throwing , and at this pastime he also far surpassed his competitors . Before long the feeling of the crowd beg*in to set against him , showing itself first in the smaller fry , who began half playfully to throw pebbles and lumps of dry earth at him . Then they would run up slyly and strike him with sticks . Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till the contagion of hostility spread , and the whole pack was arrayed against the strange boy . He kept them at bay for a few moments with his stick , till , the feeling mounting higher and higher , he broke through their ranks , and fled precipitately toward home , with the throng of little and big at his heels . Gradually the girls and smaller boys dropped behind , till at the end of the first fifty rods only two boys of about his own size , with wrath and determination in their faces , kept up the pursuit . But to these he added the final insult of beating them at running also , and reached , much blown , a point beyond which they refused to follow . The world the boy lives in is separate and distinct from the world the man lives in . It is a world inhabited only by boys . No events are important or of any moment save those affecting boys . How they ignore the presence of their elders on the street , shouting out their calls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the veriest solitude . They have peculiar calls , whistles , pass-words , by which they communicate with each other at long distances like birds or wild creatures . And there is as genuine a Wildness about these notes and calls as about those of a fox or coon . The boy . is a savage , a barbarian , in his taste-devouring roots , leaves , . bark , unripe fruit , etc. ; and in the kind of music or discord he delights in . They have their fashions that spread from city to city . In one of our large cities the rage at one time was an old tin can with a string attached , out of which they tortured the most savage and ear-splitting discords . The police was obliged to interfere and suppress the nuisance . On another occasion , at Christmas , they all came forth with tin horns , and nearly drove the town distracted with the hideous uproar . Another savage trait of the boy is his untruthfulness . Corner him up , and the chances are ten to one he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slow growth in the boy . If caught in one lie , he invents another . I knew a boy who was in the habit of eating apples in school . His teacher finally caught him in the act , and without removing his eye from him , called him to the middle of the floor . " I saw you this time , " said the teacher . " Saw me what ? " said the boy innocently . " Bite that apple , " replied the teacher . " No , sir , " said the rascal . " Open your mouth " ; and from its depths the teacher , with his thumb and finger , took out the piece of apple . " Did n't know it was there , * said the boy unabashed . Nearly all the moral sentiment and graces are late in maturing in the boy . He has no proper self-respect till past his majority . Of course there are exceptions , but they are mostly windfalls . The good boys die young . We lament the wickedness and thoughtlessness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is.mainly the acridity and bitterness of the unripe fruit that we are lamentbig .
