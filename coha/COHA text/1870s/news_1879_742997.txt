txt Senator Harris , of Tennessee , will report to-morrow , from the committee charged with the yellow fever legislation , a bill appropriating $200,000 for the construction of a steel ship , fitted with refrigerating machinery , in accordance with the plans submitted by Prof. John Ganged , which shin is to be used at New-Orleans and other Southern ports for the purpose of disinfecting ships by means of artificial freezing . Experts all agree that cold destroys the germs of the terrible disease , which it is now feared will again afflict the South during the coming season . It is believed that artificial cold can be so rapidly produced that a 3,000-ton ship may be thoroughly disinfected within six hours . The Senators and Representatives most deeply interested in the yellow fever matter have agreed , it is understood , to the measure which will be reported . The State rights fanaticism which prevented legislation in the last Congress has been subdued by reason of the severe criticism received from the South . The new bill for a National Board of Health , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was defeated in the House by the opposition of Messrs . Goode , Hooker , and other State rights Hotspurs . It differs from that bill in that the Supervising Surgeon-General of the Marine Hospital Service is not made Chairman , but only a member of the board . This is more satisfactory to Casey , Young , and others from the fever district . Dr. ' Tamil ? ton , of the New-England District of the hospital service will , it is understood , take the place of the late Dr. Woodworth . He is considered a very competdnt surgeon , and will be a valuable member of the Health Board . A great deal of uneasiness is felt for the coming Summer by the medical experts , who believe that the germs of the epidemic are still active . The delay in securing legislation is considered to have been very damaging .
