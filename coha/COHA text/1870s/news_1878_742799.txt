txt We all remember the story of the little girl who , while sitting at her mother 's feet , had torn off a leg of her doll , and expressed her discontent in the words , " The world is round , they say , and my doll 's filled with sawdust ; and , if you please , dear Ma , I 'd like to be a nun . " The child in her childish way expressed the dissatisfaction and disappointment we all feel at certain times and after certain experiences in life . She had just learned that the world is round ; she had never dreamed that the plumpness of her doll was due to sawdust until her own eyes had informed her of the unpleasant fact . It was entirely natural that , under such pressure of the unwished-for and unexpected , she should signify her weariness and distaste of everything by wanting to be a nun ; nunhood being as ideal and unknown as all else that lay without the microscopically small circle of her consciousness . How very often we who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the little girl : The world that we had fondly imagined to be square , or flat , or three-cornered , or five-sided , or what not , suddenly turns out to be round . The doll that has been the centre of our desires , the darling of our heart , whose beauty we have rejoiced in , whose symmetry we have wondered at , proves to be stuffed with sawdust . Then nunneries , in a figurative sense  --  meaning surrender , renunciation , retirement  --  look inviting . The wisest and severest of us have dolls , called by a variety of names , and we are doomed to discover ceaselessly that they contain only sawdust , We purchase our knowledge of the world at the price of saw-dust ; we get at the underlying principles of life through the dismembered limbs of cherished dolls . The chief difference , , perhaps , between the man of fifty and the man of twenty-five is that tho former has , and the latter has not . found the sawdust . The quantity of sawdust detected is the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sho ! king to find the sawdust ; but it lies directly in the path of progress and development , and he ' who walks that way must stumble upon it . To disbelieve in it is an iliusion ? a sweet and precious one , perchance ; but the time is always menacing when the illusion will bo dispelled , and the sawdust disclosed . The young man entering upon life has any number of dolls , and he takes it extremely ill if his elders intimate as possible that a grain of sawdust could ever have mingled with their perfection . As he dallies with them they gradually rip , and the particles of wood sift down from their wasting loveliness to his amazement and chagrin . Yes ; he at last admits this , that , and the other were filled with sawdust . " But some of my finest dolls are not ; they are all that they show . " In turn , their seams give way , and their divinity exudes-Then there must be new and larger dolls , and those alone are sought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly and throughout . They are procured : there are plenty of them . Whatever is wanted is supplied . And they are warranted ; for it is easier to warrant than to be honest . Great sagacity and insight are needed to understand that no dolls are made entirely of kid . To the handicraftsman and nature it is more convenient to use sawdust . Middle age has thrown ' away most of its dolls ; it is wont to declare that it has thrown them all away . But it keeps some , thinking they are not dolls because they have been christened anew . It is wholly conscious of the existence of sawdust , which , indeed , it has found repeatedly where its presence had never been suspected . Vividly remembering the past , it imagines that it can detect sawdust at a glance ; that hidden sawdust has no longer power to deceive . Yet it crops out again and again , and though its character be stubbornly denied by him who proclaims himself beyond duping , it is the old sawdust still . Nobody so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen too much of it to be freshly entrapped . Even old age has its soothing sawdust , from which comfort and consolation are in many forms and at many periods continuously derived . We find it to-day , and disbelieve in it to-morrow . We fly from sawdust to sawdust as our years go on , and when we are surest that we are beyond the region of its prevalence , an arm or leg of our doll comes off , and reveals the ancient enemy that we thought we had banished . The fact is that there is a vast deal of sawdust in ourselves ; but we rarely discover it there , because it is the last place we look for it . Our minds are occupied in finding the sawdust in our follows , just as they are occupied in finding it in us , and we constantly wonder why they can contain so much when we contain so little . This is a world of sawdust , and we should adjust ourselves to it as best we may . It is a world of kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sawdust . Each is good in its place . The part of wisdom is to accept both , and endeavor to distinguish accurately between the two . Sawdust is valuable , for it is , or should be , instructive . We should try to learn , as nature has learned , how to use it , where , and when .
