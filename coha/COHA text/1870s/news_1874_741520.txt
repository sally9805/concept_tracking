txt While there is ' by no means " the great ' cod of immigration into the States of the outh which the people of that section deire , there is yet a considerable movement which , in time , will result in modifying , aid , in some respects , changing the characor of the populations there . T.ge presence rf one hundred and fifty thousand Germans n Texas can not fail , in due time , to work Feat influence in the South-west . This mall army of hardy and frugal Teutons has mtered the Lone Star State so silently , in ; uch unceasing currents , and has scattered . a ) widely up and down over the broad acres , that the Texans themselves were , amazed , when , a few months since , the number of 3ermans in the State was announced . A tense stream of immigration has also been poured into Texas from the North-west , from the States of Iowa , Illinois , and Indiana . These various elements are , one and all , aiding in the upbuilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abominations of bad cooking and worse whisky fade away before the examples of the thrifty Germans , who show the native Texans what a variety of good things nature really intended them to have . Texas bids fair to overtake and , perhaps , distance Missouri in the number of immigrants received . Virginia is constantly receiving immigrants from the Northern States . Many of them are prompted more by the cheapness of the , lands in the " Old Dominion " than by any necessity of migrating . The Pennsylvanian finds that by moving into Maryland . he can cheaply buy quantities of good land , slightly improved ; and ' the Marylander is willing to sell , because , over the border , in Virginia , he finds land cheaper , as - well as better , than that which he has just sold . So Maryland and Virginia are gradually changing the character of their populations . The Virginian is wont to say that the Northern immigrant would succeed better if he would make more allowances for the climate , and would . not begin on a scale on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very heartily ; but is also glad to receive the hundreds of English families which have settled in some sections of the State . The arrivals from England are not so numerous as might be desired ; the English generally bring goodly sums of money , and settle in fine farming or stock-raising counties , where they often accumulate large fortunes . As soon as Virginia has a sufficient tide of immigration to crowd the negro a little , and to force him ' to be more provident , the State 's material prosperity will be fully assured , and all Classes will work harmouionsly together . It is not a little singular that two of the remotest of the States south of MASON and Dixolv 's line should be among the very first to secure large numbers of immigrants . Florida and Texas are each shining examples of - what good advertising and proper representation of resources can do for a State . The character of Florida as a cane and orange and tropical fruit-bearing country having been carefully explained to the people of Italy , three hundred Italian families recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be followed by many more . A judicious crusade in Italy and Sicily in favor of the Floridian peninsula would probably result in the beginning of a flood of immigration which might attain the same proportions as that from Germany into Texas . The South is beginning to give very earnest attention to this subject of an influx of population from the outer world . In some of the States the presence , or rather the omnipresence , of the negro is a bar to any very numerous entries of immigrants . But there is no Southern State where the native people feel anything save the most earnest desire to secure as many new citizens as possible by importation . Strong tides of immigration setting to South Carolina and Alabama would do much to solve the problem of the political situation there . The carpet-bag Governments never did . much to encourage the coming of white Europeans into those States , because they felt that if they did so , they would be destroying the principal source of their own perverted and shameless power .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
