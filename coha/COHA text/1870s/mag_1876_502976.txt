FEW features of American progress are more striking and significant than the rapid increase during the present century of our knowledge of our own vast territory . On the map of Reid , published only eighty years ago , the region west of the one hundred and tenth meridian is represented by a broad white space , bearing to the north the outlines of an imaginary inland sea , and to the south the rough indications of mountains . Recent maps of the United States present the same area filled with details of ranges , peaks , lakes , streams , towns , and mining camps , and belted with a railway that runs from sea to sea . The exploration and examination of this great terra incognita of the West was begun by the army , and owes more to that agency than to any other ; although the swift advance of our restless population of pioneers and miners , bringing one district after another into popular notice and commercial relations , may have led many to forget the services of those who first traversed the solitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the marching columns of civilization . It is not our present purpose to give a full account *f the explorations , early or recent , of our Western territory . The character and extent of the information obtained by military expeditions should , however , be pointed out , to rescue the subject from some misconceptions which have grown or have been thrown around it . These expeditions have been very numerous , organized for widely various purposes , carried out under diverse circumstances , and conducted by officers of different degrees of education and ability . A large part of the army has always been kept upon the frontier . Troops have been constantly moving through the wilderness , and the pressure of an increasing population has continually demanded the establishment of new posts further and further in the interior . Officers of the line commanding troops , in accordance with the army regulations , have made itineraries of the routes over which they have marched , and have thus furnished a great deal of information of undoubted value , yet without pretensions to higher accuracy than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this knowledge has been , so to speak , incidentally obtained , without special expense to the Government , during the execution of the regular duty of the public defense . It would be manifestly unfair to criticise for its want of accuracy , or to compare with the results of elaborate and expensive surveys , this rough but useful work . Of the expeditions sent out from time to time for the special purpose of exploration , those of Captains Lewis and Clarke , of Major Pike , of Major Long , and of Lieutenant Fr*mont , and that of Captain Bonneville ( made while on leave of absence at his own expense ) are the best known . The results obtained in this way , although of higher accuracy than those obtained from the itineraries of officers in the field , make no pretensions to the exactitude and fulness of a detailed survey . In fact they never were intended as surveys , but merely as rapid reconnaissances involving a minimum of time and expense . Next came the celebrated Pacific railroad surveys , conducted by officers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance ; but their definite object was the examination of the country with special reference to a railway route from the Mississippi to the Pacific ocean ; and while they furnished most valuable and extensive information concerning the // THE NATIONAL SURVEYS . JA*tTAJIY , qwq this respect they contrast strongly with the work of preliminary exploration , or of reconnaissance , as this sort of surveying is commonly called . By the work of a preliminary reconnalssance the character of the dominant physical features of a previously unknown region is ascertained , a laudable curiosity satisfied , and the nature of certain great commercial problems indicated . The topographical survey , on the other hand , presupposes a country already settled , and having made considerable progress in civilization , art , and commerce , so that land has acquired a high value , thus rendering accuracy in the determination of its subdivisions amatter of pecuniary importance . Again , in speaking of the maps of the geological survey of California , of which he was in charge , Professor Whitney ( after alluding to the survey as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks of them as being " as accurate as could be made with the means at his command , " thus distinctly recognizing the principle that means as well as skill are necessary . The errors which have found place in the maps of the California survey should have prevented its director from charging with incompetency those officers who , under circumstances far less favorable , have performed work , to say the least , equally trustworthy . But we may profitably notice the nature of the principal errors for which this critic takes to task the early Engineer explorers . They are defective longitudes ; and the whole argument based upon them , as to the competency of the observers , must involve the questions , what methods they were obliged to employ , and whether error in the result was due to the inherent defects of the methods available , or to lack of skill in their use . The following paragraph gives Professor Whitney 's views concerning astronomical determinations in the field : One element of geographical position , the latitude , is easily determined with portable instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required ; but the fixing of the longitude , even If only to within a few miles of the truth , is a matter of considerable difficulty . To determine the longitude so that the result may be depended on as being not more than twomiles in error requires a long series of observations made with skill , and with Instruments which can hardly be called portable . But within the last few years the construction of numerous lines of the magnetic telegraph , some of which run through quite uninhabited re gions , as , for instance , the one traversing Australia from north to south , has made the accurate determination of longitude comparatively easy in many places where before it was almost impossible , and has thus rendered great services to geography . The chronometer , which does such excellent service at sea , is of very little use to the traveller by land , except for rough work , since the inevitable jolting consequent on moving about in wagons or on horseback is fatal to the accuracy of its going . The errors in this paragraph show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not familiar with field astronomical work . It is not true that the use of portable instruments for the determination of latitude , or for any other astronomical determination , requires comparatively little skill . On the contrary , it may be laid down as a rule , that the skill required in the use of any astronomical instrument is directly proportional to its portability . The sextant is at once the most difficult and the most portable of all instruments . The Wurdemann portable transit requires more careful manipulation than the heavier reversing instruments used by the Transit of Venus expeditions , and these again are not so convenient as the fixed instruments of the observatories . Again , it is not true that the determination of longitude requires more skill than the determination of latitude . The error in longitude , when a single chronometer is used , is due to the imperfection of the chronometer . That it is not due to want of skill in the observer appears from the fact that it is easy to determine the clock-error with a single set of sextant double altitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error would , in the latitudes of our explorations , affect the determination of longitude about one or two tenths of a mile . When this method is employed , no amount of skill , no number of observations in the field , and no instruments , portable or other , will eliminate the egror ; and in cases where the chronometer has to be transported over considerable distances , and can not be returned immediately to the astronomical base , the possible error is almost without limit . // But what other longitude methods were open to the use of our explorers ? They might , and did occasionally , employ the method of lunar distances , but this is of little use except as a check . In cases where a portable transit formed a part of the outfit , and time permitted , moon culminations were observed ; but the imperfection of the tables , the difficulty of obtaining corresponding observations , and the length of time required to procure a series of sufficient extent to insure accuracy , rendered this method of very limited utility . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latitude determinations of a person using the sextant are a better test of his skill as an observer than his longitude determinations . To those skilled in field astronomical work , the longitude errors of the early explorers will not seem remarkable . Indeed , some of the very best sextant observations ever made in this country have been made by officers of the Engineers . Professor Whitney 's reference to the erroneous location of Salt Lake City is very unfair . It is true that the determination of this point in Fr6mont 's first expedition was erroneous , but the subsequent determination by Fr*mont , and that of Simpson , who was a regularly educated officer of the Corps , come close to the telegraphic determination of the Coast Survey . The error in Fr6mont 's first determination can probably be explained by the reasons which have been indicated . To sum up these considerations , Professor Whitney fails to comprehend the real tests of skill in astronomical field work , and ignores the principle which he does comprehend ; prououncing in one breath the untrustworthiness of certain methods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to these very methods , could not rival the work of fixed observatories and the telegraph . But what is this Corps of Engineers , the members of which are supposed to be unprepared by " their education and duties as army officers to compete with or furnish any valuable aid to those civilians in charge of these surveys , who have devoted years of patient study to geology and the cognate sciences " I * As the law provides , this corps is composed of such graduates of the United States Military Academy at West Point as are recommended for it by the academic board of that institution . The cadets at West Point are , as is well known , appointed from all parts of the country , and pursue a course of four years ' study . The instruction at the Academy is more rigorous than at any other institution in the country , and a failure satisfactorily to pass any one of the eight examinations required before graduation ( each examination involving several branches ) is followed by the dismissal of the student . At graduation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the studies which they have pursued during the course , the greatest weight being given to studies of an analytical character . In time of peace from one to four are generally assigned to the Corps of Engineers , and these are invariably taken from the head of the class . So high is the standard , that in some years none are recommended . The classes , as they report at West Point , average from one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five members . This method , therefore , selects from that number the three or four who , after careful and thorough instruction and examination , extending through four years , are , in the opinion of a board of experienced instructors , best fitted for the duties of officers of Engineers . The remark concerning officers of the Corps , that they are " Academy-made , not God-made , " is thus seen to be a very foolish one . It is one great function of the Academy to select from its students those who have the greatest natural ability , * We quota from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the committee on Military Affairs , with reference to a bill permitting the detail of officers as principal aids or assistants on surveys undertaken by the several States . // and there is no institution in the country where mental power is detected so quickly , so promptly advanced , and so highly rewarded . The course in mathematics at the Academy includes algebra , geometry , plain and spherical trigonometry , descriptive geometry , surveying , shades , shadows and perspective , and the construction of maps , analytical geometry , and the differential and integral calculus . Considerable instruction is given in topographical drawing , and mineralogy and geology are also studied . There is a very rigorous course in analytical mechanics and astronomy . Of course other and very important studies are pursued , but they need not be mentioned in this connection . The practical instruction , so far as it relates to the duties with which we are now concerned , consists in surveying , practical astronomy , and reconnaissance . The instruction in surveying is sufficient to give the student a good idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field astronomy , which has been very much extended of late years , consists not only in occasional explanation and practice in the permanent observatory , but also in very frequent practice with the sextant , and actual work in a perfectly appointed field observatory , with the very best and most modern instruments , following the methods of the Coast and Lake Surveys . The instruction in reconnaissance , which likewise has been recently much extended , includes considerable practical instruction in rapid map-making , both mounted and on foot . Whoever thinks that this course of instruction , carried out with a rigor and thoroughness which would be impracticable elsewhere , is insufficient to qualify the three or four best men in a large class to make surveys under the supervision of experienced directors , must believe with Professor Whitney that this work requires the highest amount of scientific knowledge , skill , and talent , and must also believe that chere is a better way of gaining these qualities than the thorough training of selected men . In point of fact , we may remark in passing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of either . The knowledge of mathematics demanded in the most elaborate methods of surveying is very limited ; and the same is true of astronomy , so far as its connection with the determination of geographical position is concerned . The problems arising in this kind of work are not of the most difficult character . Compared with the course in analytical mechanics , the course in astronomy at West Point , although containing ten times as much as is required for astronomical field work , is regarded as very easy , and presents no difficulty whatever to the highest section of cadets . We can assure Professor Whitney that what he calls " the highest geodetic problem of the Coast Survey , that of working up the observations with a view to contributing to our knowledge of the form and size of the earth , " receives the attention of the young gentlemen at West Point , and as an examination subject is not regarded with disfavor . As for the field work , there is no field instrument used in surveying or astronomy ( the sextant excepted ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not learn to use creditably , if not perfectly , in a week . Thus far we have considered simply what the young Engineer officer brings with him in the way of education and ability when he enters his corps . It remains to be seen what lie obtains there to fit him further for his work . On leaving the Academy he is almost invariably ordered to duty with the Engineer battalion at Willett 's Point . Here there is established a field astronomical observatory , in which he is obliged to work at regular and frequent intervals under the supervision of older and more experienced officers . He makes his own observations , and computes his own results . The instruction includes almost every problem which occurs in astronomical field // work . In addition to this , a great deal of practice in rapid and detailed map-making is obtained , and in this way many square miles have been mapped by the officers and sergeants of the battalion for the land defences of New York . After at least one year , and probably two or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to the Lake Survey , where he remains on duty for several years . The kind of work done on this survey is too well known to require detailed mention here . It is sufficient to say that it is of the same character as that of the Coast Survey . This service we may regard as completing an officer 's regular education for this kind of work . Perhaps it is not strange that a committee of Congress should say that such preparation is inadequate to qualify an officer " to compete with or furnish any valuable aid to those civilians who have devoted years of patient study to geology and the cognate sciences " ; but when a professor in a great university gravely advances the same idea , we have a right to be astlnished . The facts we have adduced show conclusively that the Engineer officer of the present day , educated and trained under the present system , is quite competent to prosecute successfully surveys of the accurate kind - which require more time , more money , more practice , and less natural ability than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intended to convey the idea that all officers of the Corps have passed through exactly the course of instruction and selection which we have indicated . It is true that all are graduates of the Military Academy , but West Point has grown and developed just as other institutions throughout the country have done . The experience of all , however , has been largely what we have described ; and the young men of the Corps , upon whom this kind of work will devolve hereafter , will all have to undergo this or probably a still more extended course of instruction . So much for the a priori argument ; but have the Engineers ever shown by actual execution their competency for the most accurate kind of geodetic work ? Undoubtedly . The amount and character of their labors on the Coast and Lake Surveys , and on our international boundary surveys , furnish ample evidence of this . We have no objection to make to the praises which Professor Whitney bestows upon the Coast Survey ; they are well deserved , and we cordially endorse them alL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Coast Survey should lose the credit of what the army has done for it , although he is very careful to insist that the Engineer Bureau shall not claim the credit of the labors of its civilian employees . He eulogizes Bache as the great organizer and director of the survey , but omits to say that Bache was a West Point honorman , and some time previous to his taking charge of it , an officer of the Corps of Engineers . Hassler , who inaugurated the survey , resigned his professorship at West Point to undertake that work . About forty officers , graduates of West Point , have been employed upon the survey ; and of these a very large proportion have been officers of Engineers . These officers were often employed upon the most scientific duties of the survey . They labored in the field astronomy , the primary triangulation , the secondary triangulation , the topography , the hydrography - in fact in every department of the survey . An officer of Engineers always had charge of the office until the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have produced satisfactory results and received praise . It would be impossible to note in detail what the Survey owes to the army , without careful examination of its reports . But a few instances will suffice . In addition to the services of Hassler and Bache , which West Point can fairly claim , we have the invention of the zenith telescope and the American method of determining latitude , by Captain Talcott // of the Corps of Engineers . The polyconic method of projecting maps , now used in the Coast Survey , was introduced by an officer of the Corps of Engineers . The general office organization of the survey was made by an officer of the Corps of Engineers. * The oldest , most experienced , and most distinguished observers still connected with the survey were directly educated by officers of the Corps of Engineers . The field manual used on the survey for years , and still used to some extent , was prepared by an officer of the Corps of Engineers . The survey of the northern lakes , which is under the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed by officers of the Corps , presents the strongest evidence of the competency of these officers to do firstclass work . The methods followed and the results obtained in this survey are in most respects identical , and in every respect equal in accuracy , with those of the Coast Survey . On this survey over thirty officers of the Corps have from time to time been employed . The international boundary surveys , which have been executed under the direction of officers of Engineers , have been models of accurate work . More than thirty officers have been employed on these surveys . There are many other instances of accurate surveys made by the Engineers , which we might mention ; for instance , Graham 's celebrated survey * Concerning the officerwho superintended this organization , Professor Bache makes the following remarks in the Coast Survey report for the year 1853 : " This officer was placed in charge when the augmentation of the scale of the Coast Survey was begun , and devoted himself , with untiring assiduity and most remarkable success , to the difficult task imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated labors which he undertook , that he was finally obliged to leave the work . His services were so fully shown by the condition to which he had brought the office during his charge of it , that I simply discharged a duty in recommending him for a brevet on retiring . The varied and complicated duties of the several departments of office work require not only professional knowledge of a high order , but intense application , and very considerable administrative power . " of Cape Cod , and the thousand and one surveys of sites for fortifications which have been made with foot , and sometimes even six-inch , contours . But it is not necessary to go beyond those already mentioned , the character of which is beyond suspicion or dispute . At least one-third of the Corps , as it now exists , have served on these very duties . And now we shall be able to form some idea of Professor Whitney 's critical method in dealing with this subject . It consists in comparing the reconnaissance work of army officers with work of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and always with as little reference as possible , to the different circumstances under which it was accomplished ; in touching as briefly as possible on the accurate work of the Engineers , and sometimes ignoring it entirely , as in the case of the Coast Survey ; and in assuming that the civilians who have from time to time executed this kind of work under the Engineer Bureau have been employed because they were more competent than officers of the Corps . As the next step in our examination of the main question , we must call attention to one or two points in connection with the organization of the Engineer Bureau . It is true that the size of the Corps of Engineers is incommensurate with the duties which it has to perform ; and this has been used as an argument why the work of the surveys ought not to be put upon it . But the Engineer Bureau is quite a different matter . From its first organization until the present day , the employees of the Bureau have been officers and civilians . The civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers . From the time of Nicollet 's employment to that of Mr. Clarence King , it has been the custom of the Bureau to employ civilians , often in charge of surveys and other works , and often in much more important positions and at much higher salaries than those of most officers of the Corps . This cus // torn has become so thoroughly established that there has never been any ill feeling on the part of officers concerning it . The nature of the position occupied by a thoroughly accomplished scientific gentleman under the Bureau might be easily ascertained from Mr. Clarence King ; and we are quite willing to ask him what are his relations with officers of the Corps of Engineers , and whether he has been made to suffer for want of a commission . The Engineer Bureau has a perfect right to all credit arising from the labors of its civilian employees ; and we see no reason why civilians should not be employed under this bureau as well as under any other department of the Government . The attempt of Professor Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military and civilian , and set one against the other , speaks for itself ; and his comparison of the survey of an Engineer officer , made with instructions to cover a large extent of ground at small expense , with the limited and expensive survey of King , much to the disparagement of the former , but without any intimation of the essential difference of the two works , needs no characterization . We admire and appreciate Mr. King 's beautiful work as much as any one can ; but the Bureau could not cover the whole country with such a survey if it would , and would not if it could . The expenditure necessary for such a purpose would not bring commensurate returns , and would be a wrong on the people . Finally , we must call attention to the fact that the Chief of Engineers is by law chosen from among the officers of the Corps of Engineers , and is always an officer of great experience and high reputation in the Corps . Having thus briefly considered the character and fitness of the Engineer Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us now turn our attention to the organization which it has been proposed to substitute in the prosecution of this work . If the sur veys are not to be conducted under the supervision of the Engineer Bureau , they must be placed in the hands of some other organization under some other department of the Government . There are now three such organizations in existence ; viz. : the Coast Survey , under the Treasury Department ; the survey of Dr. Hayden , under the Department of the Interior ; and the survey of Major Powell , under the same department . As for the Coast Survey , it has never been proposed to place the general surveys of the country under its control ; but we shall , nevertheless , have a few words to say about that organization further on . The two others are very similar in character and purpose ; we shall , however , comment only on the survey of Dr. F. V. Hayden , because we regard it as a characteristic example of what our surveys will become , and how they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Engineer Bureau and placed under the direction of some other department of the Government . This survey seems to present all the excellences and all the defects of the system which many are anxious to introduce ; and moreover , it is this particular organization , coming into the field backed by several scientific schools of high repute , which has proclaimed its intention of taking the surveys from the hands of the Engineers . The fight which has been made has been determined and unscrupulous ; and we may rest assured that if a substitute is to be found for the Engineer Bureau in the surveys of the country , this is to be the substitute . Dr. F. V. Hayden , the gentleman in charge of this survey , seems to have had considerable experience as a scientific collector for various institutions . He was at one time surgeon and naturalist to one of the expeditions of Warren , of the Engineers . Then he was a surgeon of volunteers during the war ; and then , to use his own frank words , the close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // again the business of collecting , and finally , " after a painful struggle , " and from small beginnings , he succeeded in organizing and perfecting the survey of which he is the head , as it now exists . Concerning Dr. Hayden 's personal fitness for the position which he occupies it is unnecessary to speak . It is only fair to say , however , that he is , like Professor Whitney , a member of the National Academy , and as his survey seems to be endorsed by several of the leading scientific institutions of the country , we presume he fitly represents the gentlemen who are engaged in natural science throughout the land . The money for Dr. Hayden 's survey is appropriated yearly on the estimates made by him . The plan of the work is arranged by Dr. Hayden ; the assistants are engaged , their salaries determined , their promotions made-all by Dr. Hayden . This is of course subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior  --  the only check , so far as we can learn , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this system over that so long in use ? First , in the words of Dr. Hayden , " much greater efficiency has always been gained where the leader of the party is himself an ardent worker in geology and science generally , as he is better able to judge of the work to be performed , and as he urges forward all his scientific assistants by the force of his example and enthusiasm . " This may be all very true as far as geology is concerned , and if geological research be the most important part of a survey , as naturally enough it may appear from Dr. Hayden 's standpoint , this argument might be worth consideration ; but it seems scarcely necessary to prove that the geographical and geodetic work is the most important , and must be the basis of all surveys . When it is considered that this work requires the expenditure of an amount of money and labor vastly in excess of that needed for all the other operations of a survey , our statement can not be questioned . We might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a building , on the ground that the architect is not a practical colorist , as to place a geologist in charge of a great survey because the topographer does not happen to be an expert in this secondary work . The argument , therefore , which requires the director of a survey to be a capable geologist demands in a much greater degree that he should be a trained topographer and surveyor . This Dr. Hayden can not pretend to be ; and he does not hesitate to employ a topographer to take the entire charge of his geographical work . But granting , for the sake of argument , that the director of a great survey should be a geologist , surely the Engineer Bureau is quite as competent as any other department of the Government to engage civilians to take charge of surveys , when it is judged necessary and proper to do so . This has , in fact , been done repeatedly-the chief difference between the Engineer Bureau and other departments being that its requirements include , for the head of a survey , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This may exclude* from commanding positions in sucbA work a large class of enthusiastic sci*. entists ; but it has not excluded them , and will not exclude them , from em ? employment under the Bureau exactly in accordance with their special capacity . But let us compare the systems themselves , and inquire which of the two is likely to furnish the best method of selecting the immediate director of a great survey . In the case of the Engineer Bureau the selection is made by the Chief of Engineers , an experienced and distinguished officer , who has devoted his life to this and other scientific work ) and who can have no motive in the selectionbutthe interests of the Government . He is restrained from favoritism by the most solemn traditions of his corps . He is selected from a body of gentlemen who have been thoroughly trained for the duty , and who have themselves been chosen , after long and careful // examination , by a board of experts at the Military Academy , against whom no one has been so foolish as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the power to employ civilians on Government duty , and from the organization of the Corps to this day the exercise of this power has been pure . In the second case the selection is made by the Secretary of the Interior , who , it is quite possible , might not have the experience or ability for this purpose possessed by the Chief of Engineers ; who would be more liable to be deceived by charlatans ; and who might , in some future epoch more venal than our own , be moved by political pressure to appoint some person not well fitted for such a position . Gentlemen less suitable than Dr. Hayden , finding themselves without occupation , might be too strongly pressed to painful struggles after positions under the Government ; and we are justified in believingthat their chances would be somewhat better under the Department of the Interior than under the Engineer Bureau . We have supposed the selection to be made by the Secretary of the Intenor ; but in point of fact it is not so made at present . Every appropriation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proviso that the money so appropriated is to be expended by Dr. F. V. Hayden ; so that the appointment of this gentleman is made , not by the Secretary of the Interior , but by Congress . Exactly in what manner that body manages to assure itself of Dr. Hayden 's fitness for the position in which it has placed him , does not appear ; but Congress seems to be practically the only authority to which he holds himself responsible . The traces of this responsibility are not far to seek . If the various surveys of the Government are to be kept separate , Dr. Hayden says , " the continuance of each is made to depend upon the value of the work performed , and Congress is left the sole and immediate judge as to the value . " Again , an ap propriation is asked for , and " the interest in the work was so great that not a word of objection wa* made to it in Congress . " And again , " I think we might infer . . . that the survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the express sanctwn of Congress , and I might almost say by the order of Congress . " This system of selecting and controlling the chief of a great Government work is recommended by its republican simplicity  --  but not otherwise . We next have to inquire which method of selection best insures integrity and economy in the disbursement of Government funds . The officers of the Engineers hold life commissions , which can not be taken away from them except in case of bad behavior , and would surely be taken from them for dishonest conduct . Their esprit du corps is greater than that of any other organization in the country . The ideas of the Corps with respect to the use of government money are much stricter , and the system of checks is much more rigorous , than in any other department of which we have information . Every expenditure , no matter how small the amount , is scrutinized by an officer of the Bureau , and must be approved by the chief of the Corps , before it goes for final examination to the auditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Dr. Hayden and the Secretary of the Interior ? No one , so far as we can learn . The practical working of the Engineer system may be gathered from the fact that from the , organization of the Corps to the present day , a period of about seventy years , no officer has ever been guilty of dishonesty . We doubt whether a similar statement can be made of any other department of the Government . The strict notions of the Engineers with reference to Government money may be illustrated by one or two facts . The reader probably understands the general nature of a " deficiency bill . " It is a bill appropriating money to carry on , during the current fiscal year , some work for which the appropriation // made at the beginning of the year has proved insufficient . This insufficiency may be due to unexpected emergencies , such as the outbreak of war or the fear of it , or to incorrect estimates of probable expense submitted to Congress by the executive departments , or finally to the action of Congress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , circumstances being favorable , a deficiency bill may be invoked to remedy the economy of the preceding session . Now it is quite true that Congress often cuts down appropriations for special purposes so far as to injure the public service ; and it is true that there are emergencies when the heads of departments are justified in exceeding the limits thus prescribed . But as a rule this is not true of public buildings or surveys . If Congress reduces the appropriations for these , so that they can not go on , they ought to stop . In no other way can responsibility be defined and enforced . And this is the immemorial practice of the Engineer Bureau . Its estimates for fortifications , surveys , etc. , are submitted to Congress ; whatever sums are appropriated it expends ; and there it stops short , without complaining , or lobbying for a deficiency bill . Let the committees of both Houses say whether this is the case with private-public surveys . Another illustration of this point of strict construction is furnished by the testimony of Dr. Hayden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared incidentally in the course of the examination that a certain distinguished professor had been present with Dr. Hayden 's expedition in the field , the following conversation took place : Aft . DunneU. - Was Professor - attached to your expedition ? Aft . Hayden. - He was a guest of the expedition . Xi ' . Dunnell. - Was he under pay ? Mr. Ilayden. - No , sir . He is professor of - at - College , and was a guest of the expedition for the benefit of his health . Xi ' . Dunneit. - What were the privileges and advantages of such guests ? Were their expenses and transportation paid ? Mr. ffayden. - They receive hospitality . Professor - rendered us very important service in geodetic work . Xi ' . Dunnell. - Was he made a guest with a view of his doing work ? Xi ' . Jlayden. - No , sir . It iv a common thing to receive divtinguished men as guests on such e*epeditionv . It does not seem to enter the mind of this gentleman that if he wishes to entertain guests he . ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as dishonest to put his hands into the Government purse for this purpose as to put it into his neighbor 's pocket . Doubtless Dr. Hayden 's averment of the commonness of such transactions is true for his own expeditions , and perhaps for some others ; but as the Engineer Bureau has conducted some one hundred explorations and surveys in connection with which such a practice would have been regarded as dishonorable , and would not have been tolerated for an instant , the remark should be taken with proper restrictions . Since Dr. Hayden has remarked elsewhere in his testimony that no one is ever connected with his expeditions except in the capacity of a worker , the question naturally arises , what are the industrial functions of distinguished guests ? Turning over the pages of the committee 's report , we find the answer . The " distinguished guest " is the maker of certificates and the creator of public opinion ; and his labors are not unimportant , since they are necessary to the very existence of the organization . The engagement of ornamental young gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , is another form of this evil . We will not dwell on this point , though there is a good story afloat on the plains of the vigorous language employed by a certain distinguished director of a survey , when his mules // were " stampeded " out of camp by Indian thieves , under the very nose of an amateur sentinel , who was laboriously employed in coloring a meerschaum . We next ask , Which of these systems is best adapted to secure a trustworthy execution of the Government work ? Of all branches of this work it must , on consideration , be admitted that the surveys of the national territory offer the greatest opportunities and the strongest temptations for misrepresentation and deceit . By filling in the details of a map when they have not been obtained in actual field work , by magnifying the labor of the field parties , and by claiming a degree of accuracy which the character of the survey does not warrant , it is too easy to deceive those who are not thoroughly acquainted with the means and methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maps on paper , to get up a great popular reputation , and to receive the approval of learned societies and the public press , and the ease with which all these things can be accomplished , are greater than in almost any other field of labor . In which of the two systems we are discussing are these evils best guarded against and least liable to occur ? An officer of the Corps of Engineers is assigned to this duty by the will of his chief . His position and salary do not depend upon his continuance in this particular duty . On the contrary , there are other duties , of more importance and dignity , to which he may be assigned . It is not his business to ask or work for appropriations , or to see that they are obtained . Selected for the duty solely on account of real or supposed fitness , his results are constantly scrutinized by experts thoroughly acquainted with the practical management of surveys , and his continuance in office depends on his ability , not to convince Congress of his fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief . Add to this that he has a reputation in his corps to win or lose , the foundations of which he has laid at the Academy , which it is the great object of his life to preserve and increase ( since he can not expect popular recognition or applause ) , to which a suspicion of misrepresentation would be absolutely fatal-and the system of checks on these evils seems about as complete as can well be devised . How is it with the other system of conducting surveys , in this respect ? The appropriations are made yearly , and depend largely , if not altogether , on the personal exertions of the chief of the survey . His position and income hang directly upon his success in persuading Congress of the importance of his labors , the value of his results , and the skill and ability with which he has conducted his work . He is supervised by no expert . His influence is to be exerted wholly on people who , for the most part , are incompetent to judge of the value of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclination to give his work thorough critical examination . He has no corps traditions , no previous hard-won reputation to hazard . He looks to find the reward of his labors in the continuance of his office , and in a great popular reputation . For his purposes , indeed , such a reputation is almost a necessity . Hence he is always seeking to make a display . He struggles painfully into national academies ; his name and his deeds are continually appearing in the newspapers ; his documents crowd the book-shelves of learned societies ; he propitiates distinguished professors ; he entertains influential scientists ; he ingratiates himself with Congressional leaders . He has , in a word , every temptation in the world to be a humbug ; and we can not blame him much if he is one , for it is the system that has made him so . A man may have much ability , much energy and zeal , even a very considerable sense of personal dignity and honor , and not be able to resist such temptations as these . We leave our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be most effective-that of the officer // of Engineers to the professional in it from long practice . En the less men placed over him , or this indefinite accountability to Congress and to " the scientific men of the country , " as one of our scientists gravely puts it . Finally , after what has been said , it is scarcely necessary to ask which of these systems insures the greatest skill and accuracy in the execution of the work and in the results obtained . It is amusing to note that Dr. Hayden has been obliged to go for most of his astronomical work to the Coast Survey , and to contemplate the exquisite simplicity with which he claims that his methods are much more nearly allied to those of the Coast Survey than to those of the Engineers ; ignorant of the fact that exactly the same methods are being employed on the lake and boundary surveys , and that these methods were almost all either devised or introduced by officers of the Corps . The considerations which have been adduced seem amply sufficient to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Engineer Bureau is greatly preferable to any system under the Department of the Interior at all resembling that which at present exists . But as Professor Whitney intimates that the national surveys would be much more advantageously conducted by the Coast Survey than by the Engineer Bureau , it seems proper to give this point attention before leaving this part of our subject . We have before sufficiently indicated our warm appreciation of the services of the Coast Survey . Its work is as skilfully , scientifically , and honestly conducted as that of any survey in the world . But the character of the work done by this survey is only suited to a very limited portion of our territory ; and it would be impossible and ridiculous to attempt to carry such a work , at the present time , over the whole or the larger part of the country . The excellence of the Coast Survey work is principally due to the fact that the observers are engaged exclusively in a certain definite kind of labor , and acquire great skill accurate and more rapid system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , this refinement of skill would be utterly wasted , and we see no reason to believe that they would be more suocessful in rapid work than officers of the Corps of Engineers . We believe the Coast Survey , while it fulfils as admirably as it has done hitherto the object of its organization , ought to be maintained and warmly supported ; and we can assure Professor Whitney that he need not fear any abatement of the high standard maintained under Bache 's superintendence while the survey continues to be directed by the accomplished officer and gentleman now at its head . But there is a very simple reason why the work of such an organization should not be extended beyond its present limits . We can not present our objection better than in Professor Whitney 's own language . " Indeed , " says the Professor , " it is rather a matter of luck than anything else that the Coast Survey became what it is , and , being what it is , has continued to exist . Such a work needed as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at the same time of extraordinary executive capacity . Such a man might perhaps be found without great difficulty ; but he must , in addition to the necessary scientific and executive ability , possess the art of managing politicians and the personal magnetic influence needed to carry every year a bill through Congress sanctioning the expenditure of a large sum of money . " Here we have the whole case in a nutshelL Any organization which depends absolutely upon the man at its head , and requires for its success that he shall have " extensive scientific acquirements , " " extraordinary executive capacity , " " the art of managing political cians , " and " personal magnetic influence , " is in a position of unstable equilibrium , and sooner or later is bound to falL It may be successful // for a time , but it can not be , and ought not to be , regarded as a permanence . This seems to have been Professor Bache 's view of the survey . In one of the annual reports he says : " The principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to completion as fast as means can be obtained , and not the work of a permanent corps , is a cardinal one " ; and this idea he repeated on several occasions . Fortunately the Coast Survey had such a chief as we have described , and fortunately his efforts were seconded by men almost as able as himself . During his life the survey attained its high degree of excellence ; the efforts of such men as Hilgard and Schott , the pupils and assistants of Bache himself , have kept it up to its standard since his death ; and under its present chief , who is also a pupil of the great Superintendent , there is no fear of a falling off . But when these gentlemen have passed away , as being mortal they must , what guaranty is there that another man is to be found who can fulfil all the requirements of such a position I There is absolutely no check upon his appointment ; and he occupies his position simply during the will of the Secretary of the Treasury . That a suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is indeed a matter of luck , and it is too much to expect that the luck will always be the country 's . When the next vacancy occurs  --  or the next to that - what is to prevent some enthusiastic cracker of rocks or pursuer of bugs , possessing more personal magnetic influence ' * than " scientific acquirements , " and more impudence and perseverance than either , from working his way into the position ? And then the high character of the survey must be destroyed . In what has been said we must not be understood as casting any slight upon the gentlemen who are engaged in the pursuit of natural science . We are decidedly of the opinion that these explorations and examinations in geology and the other sciences are of great importance to the country . Neither do we wish unduly to depreciate the value of Dr. Hayden 's labors . Doubtless that gentleman possesses energy and ability , and doubtless his results have been of value to science . But it must be admitted that the natural sciences offer much greater opportunities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the former have been complacently referred to as the " exact sciences** by one of our distinguished witnesses . It is not always easy to draw the line between the mere collector of " specimens " and the geologist , between the preserver of insects and the entomologist , between the plant-presser and the botanist ; and there is some reason to fear , if the surveys of the country are to be superintended by " scientists " indiscriminately chosen throughout the land , that the applicants for position will be far more frequently mere sciolists than real savants , who usually have no need to seek for place . Notwithstanding the direct charges of Professors Hayden and Whitney , the Engineer Bureau has never placed itself in antagonism to the science of the country ; on the contrary , it has always cultivated the most friendly relations with scientific men . Professor Whitney says that at the recent Congressional investigation of this subject , to which we have referred , the influence of the most eminent scientific men throughout the country was exerted in favor of the continuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that this was done because certain maps issued by the Engineer Bureau were so defective " that it seemed inconceivable that , when the public attention was called to the fact , the poorer work should not be stopped and the better allowed to proceed . " Whatever may be the fact as to the last statement , Professor Whitney 's assertion does not appear in the report of the committee . As for the first statement , it certainly does am // pear , from the documents appended to the report , that a number of gentlemen of high character and distinguished attainments have been drawn into a position which they ought to know better than to occupy . We submit , however , that this exhibit should be taken with some grains of allowance . The friends of free surveying have managed to force the professors of one great university into a false position , from which they have hastened to withdraw . How it happens that the first and much misinterpreted letter of the scientific professors of Yale college should appear in this report , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , we leave to others to explain. * But who knows * It is a matter of simple justice that this paper should be published , and we therefore give it in full : " The undersigned , signers of a memorial relative to the Governmental surveys , addressed , under date of May 12 , to the chairman of the committee on Public Lands in the House of Representatives , have heard with surprise and regret that this memorial has been interpreted as reflecting unfavorably upon the scientific character and services of the United States corps of Engineers and also upon the course of instruction given at the United States Military Academy . We desire most explicitly to disclaim the intention of bringing any reflection upon the corps of Engineers or the instructors of the Academy , both of which we hold in the highest esteem . " While we believe that arrangements for independent explorations and surveys would allow greater freedom to the scientific associations and schools of the country , and afford an opportunity in competition and mutual assistance between parties in the field which would more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret to see the War Department restrained in Its authority or limited in its means for the prosecution of any of its contemplated enterprises in the interests of science . The work of the Engineer corps of the Army in its various duties has long been an occasion for just pride to Americans . The hydrographic surveys which have been conducted by the officers of that corps , including its present accomplished chief , have not , as we believe , been surpassed in merit by similar surveys in any country in the worid . We as freely recognize the eminent services of engineers In the departments of geodesy and topographical reconnaissances , for which the instruction and training given at West Point are not equalled In any civil school in the United States . In particular we should feel most reluctant to appear insensible to the singular generosity with which the Engineer Bureau committed the control of the survey of the fortieth parallel to a graduate of one of the schools of Yale college , whether some other disclaimers would not be forthcoming if called for ? From what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the system of conducting surveys under the Engineer Bureau , that it is without defects , or that there are no individual cases of surveys made by officers of the Engineers which are open to criticism . Probably there are such cases ; but they do not invalidate in the slightest degree the argument which we have advanced . If there are abuses or evils in any system , there are two ways of getting rid of them : by substituting a better system , and by improving the existing one . Now we are at a loss to see in what respect any proposed substitute excels the system of conducting surand the unfailing liberality of acknowledgment which the work of that party , composed entirely of civilians , received from the War Department . Our memorial was designed to express the conviction that it is important that gentlemen educated In the civil schools of science should have the opportunity to contribute their activity , knowledge , and enterprise in the exploration of the territory which yet remains to be examined . While we retain these convictions , we desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we cherish for the officers of the Army and the noble Military Academy at which so many of them have been trained , and take every occasion which maybe offered to acknowledge and reciprocate the distinguished courtesy which these officers have uniformly extended to Yale college .

But the Corps of Engineers is capable of indefinite improvement , by the improvement of West Point and the school of practice . Let us briefly recapitulate the arguments which we have advanced . We claim that the system of conducting the national surveys under the direction of the Engineer Bureau of the War Department is better adapted to subserve the interests of the country than any other yet devised , for the following reasons : First , because the Chief of Engineers is better fitted to make the selection of persons to conduct these surveys than the secretary of any department of the Government , and the academic board of the Military Academy at West Point has more advantages , and is a more suitable body than Congress to pronounce upon the fitness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army is , we believe , the only branch of the public service in which personal or political favoritism is absolutely of no effect . There is no power in the country which can get a man into the Corps or out of it , except the power that resides in the man himself . Second , because this system is better adapted to secure economy and integrity in the disbursement of Government funds than any other . Third , because this system best insures honest and trustworthy work . Fourth , because the system contains within itself no fatal defect , depends for its excellence upon the character of no single man , and is capable of indefinite improvement . If all this be true , how does it happen that we find so many able and distinguished men , connected with the learned institutions of the country , lending their names and their influence to an attempt to substitute an inferior system , instead of laboring for the improvement of the existing one ? The answer is not far to seek . In the " disclaimer " of Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great university . " Our memorial , ' * say these distinguished gentlemen , " was designed to express the conviction that it is important that gentlemen educated in the civil schools of science should have the opportunity to contribute their activity , knowledge , and enterprise in the exploration of the territory which yet remains to be examined . " We have no fault to find with the very natural desire which they here express for the advancemant of their own pupils ; but , in view of the importance of this question to the country , we have a right to ask that it shall be considered on higher grounds by gentlemen of integrity , intelligence , and patriot . ism . If , in accordance with the prevailing view , the work of the nation is a great cake which is being rapidly distributed , there is no reason why the civil schools of science should not come in for their slice . Even from this low standpoint they have no need to fear ; for the Engineer Bureau , in the great surveys which are yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find them ; and where can they be found more readily than at Yale ? But we do not believe that the most distinguished specialists in the land , the professors of a university which stands in the front rank of true , honest , conservative progress , intend to lend countenance to a principle which is the root of our worst political evils . We call upon them , and upon all other honest and patriotic men , to exert their influence on the side of purity and efficiency in the service of the Government . But if we speak in vain , let us have no more attacks on corrupt men , while the systems which make them corrupt are defended ; and above all , let us have no more outcry for the reform of the civil service from those for whose benefit and at whose request a pure service is to be limited in its usefulness .
