txt So it is not probable that an excited canvass can be got up for the October election , which will bring out the full strength of the Republican Party , while it is equally sure that the Democrats have always , except in tho memorable case of Mr. Greeley , come to the polls in full force . It is , of course , a matter of great interest to the whole country to know where Pennsylvania will go iu the National Convention , after she leaves Hartranft ; but lam afraid tho nation must be content to remain in comparative ignorance for some time to come . This I do know , and this I can say , that the friends of Gov . Hartrauft do not expect that ho will secure the nomination , and I am in a position to at least guess thane will not be voted for after the first ballot . I know positively that unless itshould be discovered before that first ballot that after it ho will have considerable strength outside of his own State , and a reasonable prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; In that contingency Pennsylvania will be required to caucus , as a consequence of the unit  --  vote rule . Blaine has considerable strength in the State ; Hayes a great deal in the western comities , but not in the cast . Morton and Conkling appear to have none at all . Judging of the situatiwo as it is to-day , if required to hazard an opinion I should say that Blaine would have , on the second ballot , the solid vote of Pennsylvania , provided always that he exhibits the strength on the first ballot which is now generally accorded to him . Whoever Pennsylvania votes for will get the entire vote of the State , even it iu the caucus of the delegation Blaine or Hayes or anybody else should only have a majority of one . On this point I have talked with so many different gentlemen from so many different parts of the State who are thoroughly informed as to the sentiment of the party , that I can state it without fear of having to retract it in the future . Therefore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their eyes fixed on the great prize of the Presidency , that Pennsylvania , after New-York , is a great element in the problem of the nomination , and not only iu the nomination bat in the election , for , without exception , every gentleman with whom I have conversed has said that there is nothing in the future so certain as that the Republican nominee , no matter who ho may be , will have the electoral vote of the State . This being the case , here are fifty-eight votes for the nomination and twenty-nine for the election , se that it behooves all the gentlemen who want the office to pay some little attention to Pennsylvania . Having now traversed several States , and having conversed with many Republicans who will have influence in the Cincinnati Convention , I feel that it may not be rash to venture on a guess as to what the convention will do in its preliminary stages , but it would bo extremely foolish to declare what will be its ultimate result . The thirty-seven States and eight Territories will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be required to nominate . Sofar as I am informed now , Blaine will probably have on the first ballot 84 , from five different States ; Morton , 126 , from seven different States ; Conkling , 70 , from one State ; Hartranft , 58 , from one State ; Hayes , 44 , from one State ; Bristow , 22 , from one State , and Logan , 42 , from one State . On the second ballor the vote of Blaine may rise to 184 by the addition of Pennsylvania and Illinois , but what will happen after that it would be folly to say . It will be soon that this calculation in-eludes only seventeen States , and that , therefore , there are twenty others and the eight Territories which have not been taken into the account . Concerning these I know nothing positively , but , judging from the general situation , it may be safe to say that the vote of allwill he so divided that the relative strength of the leading candidates will remain about the same .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
