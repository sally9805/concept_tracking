txt The statement which was made on Thursday at Washington by Mr. Wm . E. DODGE , of the well-known firm of PHELPS , DODGE &; Co. , must necessarily produce a great impression on all who read it . It presents at first sight a case of hardship and oppression which scarcely anybody would believe could possibly happen in a free country . We say at first sight , because there are some features in the case - which we have never been able to understand , and . which we can not make out even now , although Mr. DODGE 'S explanation is apparently very full and candid . He says that the total amount on which duties were not paid was $6,658 , and that the sum due to the Government was only $1,658 . Yet the firm paid the enormous sum of $271,000 to effect a compromise of the case . The firm being properly liable only to pay duties to the amount of $1,600 , it actually consents to pay $271,000 , knowing all the time that it is " perfectly innocent of wrong-doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say again that we are quite unable to understand how such a thing as this could have happened . But of this we are quite clear  --  that if the ease be as Mr. DODGE describes it , the Treasury ought to refund the money which it exacted from his firm . At present , the $271,000 seems to have been obtained much as Christian kings used formerly to wrest money from JewaL-by sheer robbery .. Mr. RICE , of the Boston Board of Trade , asked yesterday why the system under which Palmas , DODGE &; Co. suffered has remained so long in force , and he answered his question by saying , because the class affected have not been willing to come forward and resist the oppressions to which it is subject . This describes at least one-half of the difficulty . The merchants ought never to have submitted to such outrages as those which Mr. JAYNE is said to have constantly practiced . They might have made known their wrongs at a public meeting , or sent a deputation to the Secretary of the Treasury , or obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have done anythivg rather than submit to the black-mailing of special agents and . District Attorneys . There is a point at which submission becomes mere cowardice ; and the merchants seem too often to have tou ched it , and even gone beyond it . Books are seized , characters injured , business ruined , a system of harrying and licensed brigandage is alleged to be carried on  --  and yet scarcely anybody resists . Merchants may be naturally men of peace , but this sort a peace is not at all to our taste . We should have shown fight in the Phelps-Dodge case , if it had cost us our last dollar . Yet Mr. DODGE speaks of the terror under which the firm labored  --  of a pistol being held to their ears  --  of the question being one of money or ruin . Why  --  why I If the firm were innocent , why the " terror " ? why the talk of ruin ? One member of a firm may be ihnid  --  but surely the whole establishment can not be . If PHELPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay fe271,000 ? They did not prevent scandal or exposure . They did . not save themselves from annoyance , for the great annoyance of having their books and papers seized was already committed . Their case has been ten times more talked of than if they had allowed it to go to trial . Then why did they pay over a quarter of a million of dollars , when they were not liable to pay $2,000 ? We say again that we can not make it out . Then we hear of merchants who have their books and . papers seized , and heavy demands made upon them for duties . Presently these demands are reduced , and somebody goes from the Custom-house and offers to settle the case for a comparatively small sum . The merchant , after some bargaining , pays the sum . Now , why does he pay anything if he knows that there is no fraud in his books ? " Because be is afraid , " we are told . Why should . he be afraid ? A lawsuit would not injure his business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Custom-house for some time , and it has not damaged them in anybody 's estimation . We know scarcely anything about the case of that firm , but we venture to say they have done right in resisting the demands of the Custom-house if they are confident they are free front blame . But , after all , it comes to this  --  the present system of moieties is all wrong , and should be abolished . Special agents and spies should also be done away with . Whether Mr. JAYNE has acted corruptly or not we can not say , but it is quite clear that he has acted brutally , violently  --  has attacked the merchants in a spirit like that ? which animated the leaders of old in a border foray . All this should be stopped , and Congress could stop it within a month from this time . The present scandals ought not to be continued a day longer than is absolutely necessary to Pass a law abolishing them . It is not a free-trade question . The Post and other papers very unwisely mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress all aflame , and playing into the hands of JAYNE &; Co . Settle the pressing grievances of the merchants first , and talk about free trade afterward . Unfortunately , some people will ride their hobbies , in season and out of season , even though they ride them over their friends . One thing more : we beg to suggest to the Customs authorities everywhere that they ought to make a vast distinction between highly-respectable firms and the common smuggler . Do n't treat an old . established house as you would a knave who comes in with a false bottom to his trunk , and a lot of lace wrapped round his wife 's body . When a firm has been in business for many years , and has a good . character , the presumption should be held to be in its favor ? especially when the person informing against it is a miserable wretch like the discharged clerk described by Mr. DODGE . The merchants should be protected , rather than handed over to be pillaged by a special agent and a District Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ? Which Collector was it that took most money on account of moieties It was Mr. GRINNELL , himself a merchant .
