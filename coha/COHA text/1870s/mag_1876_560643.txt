Chattanooga . CHATTANOOGA . A FRIEND remarks that he is sorry I undertake to write on the battle of Chattanooga , because in his judgment the subject has already been thoroughly exhausted . I know that there are many accounts . I have read several of them , and , so far as my knowledge goes , they are well SEE . After pursuing Lee to the crossing of the Potomac at Williamsport , General Meade 's army , not a little chagrined at the enemy 's escape , turned southward , and crossing the river at Berlin pursued direct routes as far as the Happahannock . It took up a new position , with the advance at this time in the vicinity of Culpepper Court House and the rear at or near Catlett 's Station . The lastnamed place was my position , looking defensively to the left and rear . There , on September 24 , 1863 , without previous warning , the following mandatory summons reached my head-quarters : - written and reasonably accurate ; but as I was present myself , and took part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , and my manner of telling what I saw and heard may throw some additional light upon those important events that have already become the subject of controversy . " The commanding general directs that you have your command eleventh corps in readiness to proceed to Washington to-morrow morning by railroad . " You will at once notify Mr. J. II . Devereux , superintendent of the road , Alexandria , at what points you desire to have the trains take up your troops , and the number at each place . " Your command must have five days ' cooked rations . You will not wait to be relieved by other troops , but proceed to Washington the moment the trains are ready to take your command . Please acknowledge . " By command of Major - General Meade . S. WILLIAMS , " Assistant Adjutant-General . ' // The twelfth corps , under General H. XV . Slocum , received a similar order . Of course , the general quiet was now broken . Cars were drawn from a distance and conveyed rapidly to our vicinity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different depots nearest at hand , and then left behind . The artillery and horses were to be taken . Car after car and train after train was loaded with men , animals , and material , and moved forward , one train following another as closely as a regard for safety would allow . The movement was apparently for Washington , but this was not really our destination . General Halleck telegraphed me , the 25th of September , an order to report to General Hooker at Willard 's Hotel in Washington . I did this at once . Hooker had been placed in command of the eleventh and twelfth corps . He informed me that these two corps were to be transferred to ' the neighborhood of the army of Rosecrans , then at Chattanooga . The battle of Chickamauga had just been fought , closing on the 21st , only four days before this conversation , by Rosecrans withdrawing his army from the battlefield into that curious place , Chattanoo0a , - afterwards so familiar to our people , - a sheltered nook lying against the concave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain below and by Missionary Ridge above . Here the Confederate General Bragg , with his forces shattered and weakened by , the terrific fightin , , near that river of death , the Chickamauga , undertook to besiege the army of the Cumberland . With fewer words than my story , General Hooker apprised me of these facts , and that his command , as I have described it , was to proceed westward by rail as far as it could , and join Rosecrans with all possible dispatch . As one may suppose , the trains did not halt at Washington , but immediately took the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . Just as soon as everything that pertained to my command was well loaded upon the cars and the last train was in motion , I stepped into a car set apart for my staff and the belongings of the eleventh army corps head-quarters , and followed the movin0 body . iNo matter how many precautions may be taken , there will always be the accompanying accidents to mark the progress of an army moving by rail , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thirst for whisky ( which is perhaps greater with them than with other men ) seemed to be increased by the unusual excitement of this move , and it was arranged that all liquor shops should be closed during the passage of the troops . Two or three men , while drunk , had met with fearful fails from our box cars . This arrangement checked the evil . The operation of crossing the Ohio was rather slow at Benwood , a town situated not far from Wheeling , West Virginia . The cars had to be lowered , ferried over , and raised by machinery on the other bank , but we proceeded with this work with very little delay . The journey through Ohio with our slow-moving trains was quite a memorable ovation ; in all the towns and villages the people turned out to cheer us on . At Xenia , Ohio , little girls came with presents of flowers , flags , needle-books , thread-books , papers , etc . They brought everything easily portable and useful to the soldiers that kindness could suggest . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what war was by experience ; fresh from such fields as Chancellorsville and Gettysburg , and going on to much more and closer work , with few chances in favor of a safe return . It is not strange that many a father 's eye filled with tears , and many a rough face softened into a pleasant smile , as these little ones bade them welcome , and kissed them good-by . I must not forget the people of Dayton for their gentle , thoughtful , sympathetic expressions of loyalty and patriotism , as the soldiers of my corps were passing through . In some places , of course , there wa* bitterness , but generally in Ohio and Indiana loyalty prevailed . Occasionally we had to take up a vender of whisky ( who was secretly slipping bottles of it into the pockets of the drinkers ) , carry him a hundred miles or so , and permit // him to walk back from some inconvenient point between stations . The next crossing of the Ohio , at Louisville , Kentucky , was slower . The men were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was carelessness , confusion , and delay . All sorts of material were mixed together : tents , mess-chests , army clothing , and what not . Brigade and regimental baggage was thrown together savagely , so that for many subsequent days and weeks the lesson was impressed upon all the officers , more particularly upon the indefatigable quartermasters of the command , that unless under compulsion they would never again allow railway men to handle the baggage of their troops . In five days the two divisions of my corps , the second under Steinwehr and the third under Schurz , had made the journey from the Rappahannock by way of Louisville , Kentucky ; Nashville , Tennessee ; and Stevenson , Alabama , to Bridgeport , the place where the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad crosses the Tennessee River . We were some time longer in obtaining our wagons and mules , and bringing them up . These had to be escorted by marching troops from Nashville . ON THE TENNESSEE . I shall never forget General Hooker 's first visit to my camp at Bridgeport . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The air was damp , but sharp and penetrating ; you could see every breath you exhaled . The Confederates had left behind plenty of camp rubbish , and filth of all kinds in every direction . There were no buildings except the old mill and the rough quartermaster-shanties for temporary messing and cover . General Hooker looked around , and was not a little disgusted at the general appearance of the region , as I also had been ; b1t when we came to the river his whole face lighted , and he exclaimed , " Grand , grand ! Is it not ? * ' So broad , so rapid , so full was its flow at that point , that the sight filled you with those indefinable emotions which strong and active life-power is calculated to inspire . Portions of the Nashville railroad were given us to guard at the time , to keep off the enemy 's enterprising raiders , appearing at different points between the mountains and the river . We could not always do it . You might see , at intervals , trains that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been burned . Bridges were often destroyed ; but with construction trains always on hand , they were very soon replaced . Across the river , beyond Bridgeport , the Confederates had all the country in possession , for their scouting parties to roam over , for eighteen miles along the railroad to Chattanooga . They had their sentinels and pickets so arranged as to interrupt the most direct wagon road on our side of the river , by firing across at favorable points . All our supplies were being hauled by way of a road farther back , it being more than forty miles from our station at Bridgeport to the army at the front . Even this road had been raided upon by the Confederate cavalry , and a large supply train destroyed . Brave and determined as the army of the Cumberland was , yet when Colonel Hodges , the chief quartermaster of that army , came to my tent at Brid0eport and described to me the situation , the starving and dying condition of the overworked and underfed animals , the . saucy conduct and positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rosecrans 's gallant army , I confess that my sanguine expectancy cooled considerably , and I feared that disaster and defeat would soon come upon Chattanooga . General Rosecrans , having been relieved from his command a little later , came down to Bridgeport and stayed with me overnight on his way to Nashville . He was more hopeful , but General Thomas , who succeeded him , was both hopeful and determined . When General Grant , who had just been assigned to our military division , telegraphed him ( October 19 , 1863 ) from Louisville , " Hold Chatta nooga at all hazards . I will be there as soon as possible , * ' he answered promptly , " I will hold the town till we starve ! " 1816. 205 // August , And it is to the very highest credit of his army that there was no murmuring , even at this hard condition ; a condition that must have seemed desperate to the hungry soldiers , during the thousands of futile expedients which had hitherto been tried in vain to give the besieged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND HOOKER . The 21st of October I visited General Hooker at Stevenson , about ten miles distant from my head-quarters at Bridgeport , and during the interview he told me that General Grant was on the train coming south from Nashville . General Hooker made preparations to receive him , and , doubtless understanding that the general was still lame from the injury he had received through the falling of his horse at New Orleans , sent his springwagon to meet him at the depot , and take him , perhaps half a mile , to the house which he occupied . Hooker did not go himself ; I do not now remember the reason . I had gone to the depot to catch the train , and supposed , of course , General Grant would stop at least one night with General Hooker , but I was mistaken . As I entered the car I saw , for the first time , that hero of battles who had been for some time occupying the public attention , enjoying the attacks and defenses of our newspaper press , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided preconception . I confess he was quite the opposite of my ideal , - in size small , in color pale at that time , in manner remarkably quiet and retiring . When I was introduced he gave me his hand , and a pleasant smile spread over his face ; then , after perhaps a single complete sentence , he let me do the talking . General Hooker 's message arrived . Without the least disturbance of manner Grant said , " If General Hooker wishes to see me , he will find me on this train . " General Hooker soon appeared and paid his respects to his commanding general . I wondered then at the manner of this meeting , and presumed it was General Grant 's method of asserting himself where he thought a general who had had large commands and considerable self-assertion might be seeking an ascendency over him . The train , leaving General Hooker at Stevenson , went on to Bridgeport . Here , at my head-quarters , General Grant and staff were made as comfortable as the circumstances would permit , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have remembered it . General Grant stayed with me . An empty liquor flask , borrowed at Chattanooga , was left at my tent hanging against the wall , by an officer who had come down from the army . I feared the general would think I drank liquor , so that I said to him at once , as his eye fell on it , " That flask is not mine ; it was left here by an officer to be returned to Chattanooga ; I never drink . " General Grant said pleasantly , " Neither do I. " His whole appearance at that time indorsed this declaration , and was to me the contradiction of a thousand falsehoods which ambition and envy had industriously circulated against him . The next morning , General Rawlins , Grant 's chief-of-staff , then in full health and vigor , made all the necessary preparations for the ride to Chattanooga . He helped the general upon his horse , and the party started to go along the west bank of the Tennessee , by the way of Jasper . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassable at any time , and rendered worse by wagon wrecks and dead animals , that the passing supply train had left behind , has been well described by others . Badeau 5ays , " Grant , who was still lame and suffering , was carried in* the arms of soldiers over spots unsafe or impossible to cross on horseback . " He was in Chattanooga the evening of the 23d of October . The noble General Thomas had already issued his orders to General Hooker to collect parts of his command , the eleventh and a portion of the twelfth corps , at Bridgeport . We knew from this his intention in some way to commence the operations intended by our coIning West , i. e. , to open up // 1876. better communication with Chattanoo*a . But-may I say it ? - for some reason , plans take more practical and active shape wherever Grant appears , and he almost never assumes the credit of their conception or of their execution . This was just the case at this time . CHATTANOOGA . The descriptions of Chattanooga have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already familiar with the place and its vicinage . The town and its rolling valley lay along a bend of the Tennessee , between Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain . Thomas 's army held this valley on the south side . The enemy occupied the front and flanks of the position . A bridge of boats connected it with the north side of the river . Over this bridge all the supplies for the army of the Cumberland had to come . A NEW LINE OF SUPPLIES ; LOOKOUT VALLEY . On the 24th of October , Generals Grant and Thomas , and Thomas 's chief en*ineer , General W. H. Smith ( army sobriquet " Baldy " ) , crossed the bridge and reconnoitred on the north side . Going over the intervening neck of land southward , they could see the Tennessee River below Lookout Mountain , and the entrance of Lookout Creek on the opposite shore . This stream runs betweeri the Racoon Mountain and the lofty Lookout range , and forms the Look- out Valley . General Smith , in The Galaxy , lately , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperative with ours from below , and doubtless gives in substance the plans that were discussed by these three distinguished men during the reconnoissance I mention . He says , - " From the base of Lookout Mountain a low vancre of hills skirted the river between Lookout and Racoon mountains , connecting them . The Lookout Creek broke through these hills , near the mountain of that name , and lower down , two miles or more , another creek 207 entered the river . Through the gorge thus formed ran a road to the river , over which had been established in former times what was called Brown 's Ferry . On the north or right bank of the river , the mountains and hills set back , leaving a wide valley . . On the night of October 26th ( two days after General Grant 's visit ) a brigade under General llazeii embarked , and , drifting silently to Brown 's Ferry , landed , carried the gorge and hills adjacent , and began intrenching themselves . " As soon as Hazen 's troops were disembarked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had marched to the north side of the ferry , and before ten o'clock in the morning of the 27th , the twobrigades were strongly posted on the hills and a new bridge spanned the river behind them , thus connecting them with the army at Chattanooga and allowing any number of reenforcements to reach them within an hour . " Now we will return to Hooker 's command . For some time we had been pushing out into the enemy 's country , across the Tennessee from Bridgeport , and already occupied Shell Mound , a station on the railroad about six miles above Bridgeport . General Hooker gave the advance to my command , strengthened by one company of the first Tennessee and another of the first Alabama cavalry . rhe evening of the 2 7th , the day that Hazen was strengthening his position at the mouth of Lookout Valley , we encamped at Whitesides , distant ten or twelve miles . The next day Hooker 's column moved in the same general order as before . General Geary 's division of the twelfth corps followed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march was continued with scarcely an interruption , until we reached the neighborhood of Wauhatchie . About a mile south of that point scouts and cavalry were met by a fire from the enemy , who were concealed in the thick underbrush at the base of a spur which juts out from the ridge that extends along the Tennessee . This point is at the fork // of the Brown 's Ferry and Chattanooga wagon road . A brisk skirmish ensued , when the enemy gave way . Five or six of our men , of Colonel Busbick 's brigade , were wounded . The scene was now peculiar and impressive . The troops were moving in the valley , apparently very close to Lookout Mountain . It appeared not more than three or four hundred yards to the top . The distance to the summit was doubtless greater than it seemed to be . We were in plain sight of Longstreet 's men , both those on the high table-land at the foot of the palisade and those above alon* the frowning crest ; their signal flags were clearly visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Wauhatchie , toward Brown 's Ferry , when the batteries on the highest point of Lookout opened on us . First the smoke could be seen rolling out in curious volumes , and then would be heard the screaming of the shells , then the sound of their bursting low down in the valley . The echoes , mingling with the roaring of the guns , sounded and resounded in a way that reminded us of a similar entertainment at Gettysburg , but here for the most part the enemy 's artillerymen overshot us , so that but one man was killed and one wounded . The meeting with Hazen 's men , who were strongly posted near the ferry , as I have indicated , and whom we did not at first recognize as on our side , though covering the low hills to our front with their waving flags and bright bayonets , was an unexpected and joyous event to us ; and not less so to those so lately besieged . They called out a welcome with the usual loud cheers and shouts , as we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! you have opened up our bread line ! " We encamped facing Lookout , the left near Hazen and the right extending toward Racoon Mountain . Geary with his one division was stopped by General Hooker at Wauhatchie , in order to cover a road that led thence southward to the Tennessee at Kelly 's Ferry . Longstreet , as we have seen , had kept an outpost on the river to watch and play upon the wagon road on the north side , and we were in hopes of catching his men there , in their attempt to regain their main lines . In fact , Wanhatchie was deemed an important point for securing the valley . General Hooker left Geary there , probably three miles from our position . BATTLE OF LOOKOUT VALLEY . Perhaps an hour after midnight , in that country as yet all new to us , we were aroused by heavy artillery firing ; soon the noise of musketry , with its unmistakable rattle , was mingling with the roaring cannon . Those ominous sounds seemed to come from the direction of Geary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , " Hurry , or you can not save Geary . He has been attacked . " Steinwehr was urged to hasten , but Schurz 's division being nearest and first under arms was pushed forward toward the sound , followed by the other division . As soon as the troops were in motion I went forward to General Hooker 's position , at a turn of the road a half-mile nearer Geary . Hooker and General Butterfield , who was then his chief-of-staff , were sitting on the slope of a hill with a camp-fire just starting . The night was chilly . Hooker seemed quite anxious , as might be expected . The issues of a night engagement under the best of circumstances are more than ordinarily uncertain , and our ignorance of the situation of the country and of the enemy 's position , taken up since nightfall , added to the uncertainty . The general was of opinion that we should secure the ridge of hills that ran along on our side of Lookout Creek as we moved toward Geary 's position . To this end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " With your approval , I will take the two companies of cavalry and push through to Wauhatchie . " He replied , " All right , hownrd ; I shall be here to attend to this part of the field . " Soon after I had left , Orland Smith 's brigade of Steinwehr 's division swept up the wooded ridge near what was called Ellis 's house , and found the enemy intrenched or barricading as well as it // could be done in the night and among the roots and rocks . My report says , " The troops charted up the heights under heavy fire without returning it , until the enemy was completely routed . They took quite a number of arms and prisoners. ** General Schurz 's command was much delayed from one cause or another , the night , the low ground , the thick underbrush ( for the command at first avoided the road , as being too much exposed to the ridge alone whose foot it ran ) . Finally Schurz sent Tyndail 's brigade to clear the heibhts , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This work was well done . Afterward the brigade of Colonel Hecker , whose name I never mention without a feeling of respect for his uniform loyalty and courage , made its way to Geary 's position . But long before Hecker 's arrival the work of Geary had been done . An extr* ct from the observation of a spectator among the Confederates will throw some light upon Longstreet 's intentions , matured into plans , as Longstreet saw " during the afternoon the long , dark , thread-like line of troops become visible , slowly wending their way in the direction of Chattanooga . " He says , " General Longstreet , . . . who from the peak had carefully watched the march of the eleventh corps , determined to make an attack for another purpose ( not expecting now to hinder the main object of the movement ) , merely to capture , if possible , a large park of wagons and its escort , numberin * , as was supposed , from fifteen hundred to two thousand men , who still remained in the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division with his trains . After leaving General Hooker , with the two companies of horsemen , skirting the Racoon side of the rough valley , I reached General Geary at Wauhatchie by three or three and a half A. M. There was then li , ht enough ( it may have been only starlight ) to see squads of men moving about in the comparatively open space just north of Wauhatchie . This we observed as we emerged from the VOL XXXVIII. - NO. 226. 14 bushes . The firing was all over and quiet reigned . I called out to the strangers so dimly seen , " Who goes there ? " " We are Stevens 's men , " as the answer . Perceiving that they belonged to the enemy I said , " All right , have you whipped the Yankees ? " The same voice replied , " We were on their flank , but our men in front have gone , and we can not find our way . " My men then gradually approached , revealed themselves , and took them prisoners , there being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed into the thicket and came first upon the tent of General George S. Green , then a brigade commander . He was sadly wounded in the face . After a moment 's delay for inquiry and sympathy , his officers conducted me to Geary , who was glad enough to see me . He had repulsed the enemy 's attack handsomely , using infantry and artillery . This was the place where the mules broke loose and in terror ran in squads through the enemy 's lines , and cave rise to the story told in verse , entitled The Char , , e of the Mule Brigade . Geary 's hand trembled , and his tall , strong frame shook with emotion , as he held me by the hand and spoke of the death of his son , during that fearful night . This son was Lieutenant Edward IL Geary , Battery F , Pennsylvania Light Artillery , killed at his battery during the action . In this way the soldier remembers that the exhilaration of victory was very often softened , or entirely quenched , by real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be esti-mated ! Seeing Geary now secure in possession of the field , I hastened back to receive from General Butterfield an account of the complete success of Steinwehr and Schurz in routing the enemy 's checking forces , and driving all across the Lookout Creek . Many officers and men were killed and wounded during this blind strunole . Colonel Underwood , of the 33d Massachusetts volunteers , was desperately wounded , his wound supposed at the time to be mortal . He partially recovered , to be lame for life . It surely conveys a wrong impression 1876. 209 // when General W. H. Smith says , in the article from which I have quoted , " The valley between Lookout and Racoon mountains was thus securely held and the pass through the latter covered , from which , in the afternoon of the same day , Hooker , with the tenth and twelfth corps d'arm*es , debouched and went into camp in the valley without firing a shot . " He means the eleventh and twelfth corps . There was wounding and death in the afternoon , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As this was our opening work in the West , we were much pleased the next day , October 30 , 1863 , to receive the following complimentary notice from General George H. Thomas , directed to General Hooker : - GENERAL , - I most heartily con*ratulate you , and the troops under your command , at the brilliant success you gained over your old adversary Longstreet on the night of the 28th ultimo . The bayonet charge of Howard 's troops , made up the side of a steep and difficult hill , over two hundred feet high , completely routing the enemy from his barricades on its top , and the repulse by Geary 's division of greatly superior numbers , who attempted to surprise him , will rank among the most distinguished feats of arms of this war . GEORGE H. THOMAS , Major-General Commanding . PLANS AND PREPARATIONS . The foregoing preparatory movements were introductory to the grand battle of Chattanooga , which itself embraces the action of the troops engaged in the neighborhood of Lookout Mcmntain and those more nearly connected with Missionary Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to operate , and four characters to control them : Ilrst , the Cumberland army ; second , the troops from the East , that we have just traced to Lookout Valley ; and third , the troops from the West ( the fifteenth army corps ) . The first character ( and a sound one indeed ) was General George Cit attanooga . A ugust , H. Thomas . He was feeding his troops , replenishing his supplies , refitting his artillery , bringing up his absentees , and getting ready for real work . The se&amp; ond character was General Hooker , nominally subordinate to Thomas , but from circumstances , perhaps , rather than plan , to play a part as prominent as would seem befitting him , judging from his well-known history as a " fighting man . " The third was General W. T. Sherman . The people were learning to watch Sherman 's course with ever-increasing interest ; there was a pathway of light wherever he moved , like the streaming , forceful burner at the head of a locomotive under full headway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ever making real progress toward the grand destination . Of course the fourth was the new commander of the military division , General U. S. Grant . He had hardly set foot in Chattanooga before he telegraphed Halleck , " Please approve order placing Sherman in command department of Tennessee , with head - quarters in the field . " This request was granted . Then he turned toward Sherman , and sent a dispatch down the Tennessee , " Drop everything at Bear Creek , and move towards Stevenson with your entire force , until you receive further orders . " The order did not reach Sherman till the 27th of October , the day Hazen was securing the stronghold at Brown 's Ferry , and we of the East were approaching the valley of Lookout . Sherman , as usual , instantly set to work to fulfill his instructions . With four divisions he reached Bridgeport with his head of column on the evening of the 13th of November . At General Grant 's request , Sherman left his troops and hastened to Chattanooga for a personal interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the evening of the 14th of November , and saw him and General Grant together . I was in the room when General Sherman entered . After a cordial greeting , Grant offered Sherman a cio'ar , which the latter took and lighted , talking continually in his peculiar , // lively , and hearty style . Grant says , " Take the chair of honor , Sherman , " pointing to an old-fashioned , high-hacked rocking-chair . " Oh no ! that belongs to you , general . " Grant , showing that unfailing covert humor that always appears when them are no politicians present to annoy him , continues , " I do n't forget , Sherman , to give proper respect to age . " " Well , then , if you put it on that ground , I must accept . " So Sherman takes the high - hacked chair and leads off in a most entertaining talk , bearing upon passing events . At this interview , casually referred to in his Memoirs , bee , an my personal acquaintance with General Sherman . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner and conversation . He is above the medium height , stands erect , and carries a head capable of continuous study and thought , with a mind as acute as it is capacious . He has a voice that is sonorous , manly , and attractive , and a manner that secures your attention and wins your confidence . Introduce any topic , and Sherman is at home . His memory for detail strikes you at once as extraordinary , and his ability to carry with him the knowledge of places and localities long since seen shows a remarkable source of power at his command as an officer . His marked peculiarity in contrast with General Grant was a wonderful suggestive talent . He would draw up five plans of campaign to another man 's one , while General Grant would weigh the matter and select the best . After the general plan of battle had been settled on , Sherman returned to his troops at Bridgeport , and marched them to us by the route of Hooker 's movement , already described . Owing to rains , bad roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferry , it took till the 23d for Sherman to get three of his divisions into place , some three miles above Chattanooga , on the north bank of the Tennessee , near the mouth of the North Chickamauga . General Thomas reI*nforced him directly by the division of General Jeff . C. Davis , and indirectly by instructions to me to open communi cation with him and cooperate as soon as he had effected a crossing of the Tennessee . For , with a view of strengthening Thomas at Chattanooga and keeping the attention of the enemy during Sherman 's movements into position , I had been detached from General Hooker , marched early across the Brown 's Ferry bridge , and finally made to cross the other bridge into Chattanooga , and go into camp there near Fort Wood . This was in plain sight of Bra*g 's position on Missionary Ridge . BATTLE OF CHATTANOOGA ; RECONNOISSANCE . On the 7th of November General Grant had given orders to General Thomas to attack Bragg , using the private horses of officers and taking such team horses as could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But General Thomas advised against the movement in his crippled condition , so that it was postponed . On the 23d of November , the preparation for this battle not being yet completed , owing to rains , breakages in the bridges , and other incidents belonging of necessity to large combined movements , General Grant determined to make a reconnoissance instead of battle . In plain sight of the enemy , and displayed before Generals Grant and Thomas , and other officers gathered at Fort Wood , General Gordon Granger deployed one division of the fourth corps and supported it by his other two . This force , extended into line , presented a picture not often seen ; the bayonets gleamed in the sunlight , the skirmishers sprang forward at proper intervals and covered the entire front , as alert and active as children at play . The fourteenth corps supported the right , and the eleventh , massed in close order , was ready in view to follow up on the left . " Only a reconnoissance . " Nothing of that solid , slow , thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antietam , or French 's division on the second day at Chaacellorsville , but a brisk , hearty , almost gay parade . The Confederates stood on their brcastworks 1876. 211 // to look at our parade and drill , when our lines went forward with rapidity toward the Orchard Knob . No straggling , no fallin* out from suspicious exhaustion , no hiding behind stumps and trees at this time . Soon the enemy 's pickets were driven or taken , soon all those outward defenses for a mile ahead near the knob were in our hands ; but not without bloodshed . Wood 's division alone lost over a hundred , killed and wounded . The fourth corps had done gallantly what was required , and the other troops were ready and anxious to execute any movement . General Grant , at Fort Wood , kept looking steadily toward the troops just engaged , and beyond . He was slowly smoking a cigar . General Thomas , using his glass attentively , made no remark . Rawlins ( who was afterward Secretary of War ) seemed to be unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inattentive ear . He was heard to say , " It will have a bad effect to let them come back and try it over again . " When General Grant spoke at last , without turning to look at anybody , he said , " Intrencli them and send up support . " In a moment aids and orderlies were in motion . General Thomas sent messengers to Granger of the fourth , to Palmer of the fourteenth , and to me commauding the eleventh . Within a few minutes a new line of intrenchments was in process of construction , facing and parallel with Missionary Ridge , with Orchard Knob as a point of support . The batteries were soon covered against sharp-shooters and stray shots of the enemy . I know I felt freer to breathe when I placed my feet on this little advanced hill , than I had done since entering the beleaguered Chattanooga . General Granger , always gay after an action began , was quite exhilarated by the prompt success of his movement , and was directing the fire of the battery when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard ? This looks like work . " Then , as he liked to bring his neighbors to duty , he adds : " Your troops on the left have n't squared up . " I entered a thicket to the left , and , finding my troops too much retired , went from brigade to brigade and dressed up the lines to Gran0er 's satisfaction . General Schurz , commanding the nearest division , disliking to be meddled with , declared that this movement would reopen the engagement , but the enemy had by this time vacated the whole line of Citico Creek , so that we of the eleventh - Germans , Irish , Hungarians , and Saxonsfor once pleased our neighbors without loss or detriment . In fact , the better to clear our front of Confederate sharpshooters and skirmishers , General Steinwehr had just before , by my direction , sent the seventy-third Ohio across Citico Creek near its mouth , and marched it up in line nearly at right angles to our main front . At the end of this skirmish , that was a cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Gordon Granger , Philip H. Sheridan , Absalom Baird , Thomas John Wood , Carl Schurz , and A. von Steinwehr . These had not yet attained the full stature of their reputation , but were such men , whether commanders or simple men , as one likes to be associated with in times of trial . Historians of this field have made detailed exhibits of their leadership and success . I can not do so without too much extension , but I enjoy the mention of their names , and the recollection of the picture of a half-hour 's unpremeditated grouping on that 23d of November in this foreground of Chattanooga . The beginnings of real success are inspiriting . THE BATTLE : LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN . While we were amusing Bragg , keeping him from sending more men against Burnside at Knoxville , or from running away , as Grant feared he intended to do , from his threat to assault and his preliminary humane warning to noncombatants , the Brown 's Ferry bridge that linked us to Hooker broke , leaving one of Sherman 's divisions ( Osterhaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the morning of the // flag signal , as early as four A. M. , that he was ready to begin his movement . The burden of his instructions was a " strong demonstration , " or to carry the point of the mountain , the latter to be done contingent upon the condition and strength of the enemy . This was just the latitude and contingency to suit the temper of Hooker , a general always ambitious and enterprising . He had now of his own troops Geary 's division , of Sherman 's , Osterhaus 's division ( these belonged to the celebrated fifteenth corps , tb*t were good anywhere to fight a batrcach and ascend the western , awfully rugged , precipitous side of old Lookout . By eight o'clock he had surprised and seized the enemy 's picket line . As quickly as it could be done , Geary 's head of column , toiling up the foot-hills and the main steep , reached the foot of those perpendicular rocks which like palisades crown this lofty mountain . He faced his line toward the north and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over elevations and depressions , past trees and through underbrush - rough pathways indeed for the men . Sweeping along with his right flank secure against an impassable barrier hg rolled un the tle , clean out a village , or forage liberally on a march ) , and Whitaker ' s and Grose 's brigades of the fourth corps , making a division under General Cruft . Add Wildrick 's battery I , first New York artillery , and Heckman 's battery K , first Ohio , detailed from my corps . Geary with Whitaker joined to him , now five thousand strong , went back under cover of a thick fog ( just the veil needed before the scenes open ) to his old fighting place of Wauhatchie . He now turned abruptly to the left , crossed Lookout Creek , and pushed due east , as if to enemy 's line , which was doubtless quite unprepared for this flank assault . Cruft , with his remaining brigade , cooperated with this movement at the bridge , not far from the mouth of Lookout Creek , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an intermediate crossing , a half or three quarters of a mile higher up the creek . As Geary came on , these troops , which had kept the attention of the Confederates ( particularly those near by and those on the nose of the mountain in their front ) , caught sight of the moving lines and rivaled them in charging and pursuing the now flying enemy . Batter1876. 213 // ies had been well located so as at first to distract attention . These now became most effective in increasing the adversary 's disorder and demoralization . We , who were upon the opposite side of the nose of Lookout Mountain , and who had heard the cannonading for hours , and occasionally the rattling of musketry , were deeply anxious , watching every sign . The Confederates were driven from every advanced position , and what I have called the nose of the mountain was taken quite early in the afternoon . As the fog and clouds slowly lifted , we could see the flashes and smoke of the guns and shells that exploded , and catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward us ; so that , as there were masses of dark clouds still hanging against the nose of Lookout Mountain lower down , General Meigs , who was present , did not exaggerate when he wrote that day of " the battle above the clouds . " At dark the troops seemed still contending , but we knew it was Bra* ' s desperate effort at retreat to save men and material , and keep open the only road of escape ( the Summertown ) for his troops still on the summit . The next morning our flags appeared from the highest point , and our signals gayly waved their talk to their companion signals in Chattanooga . Bragg had lost his left , and of course concentrated his command on the next mountain ridge , where his main line had been so lone facing the imperturbable Thomas alou* , the crest of Missionary Ridge . This is a continuous ridge with transverse spurs which stretched out in a long line as a barrier to our advance east or south , not so frowning and formidable in *ppearance as Lookout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A glorious victory , this of the 24th of November ! No envy yet , no exaggerations ; a cheerful hurrah courses along our lines . All honor to " fighting Joe Hooker , " ill honor to Grant , the quiet leader who plans and executes , and dares say " Forward , march ! " in the nick of time , when ether men are apt to flag , halt , and fail . THE BATTLE : ON THE LEFT . Now for Sherman . Full of nerve and energy , with a spirit that knows no discourw*ement and true to the core , he bends only to circumstances , necessities , events which I like to believe are under the rule of Providence . He can not have his fourth division , but he cheerily goes on with the rest of the fifteenth corps , reinforced by General Jeff . C. Davis 's excellent division , taken from the army of Thomas . When Hooker commenced his grand movement early in the morning of the 24th , the bridge boats , which were launched at midnight seven or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the dawn of day appeared , opposite the mouth of the South Chickamauga . Sherman 's men were some of them already across the river ( here the river is more than twelve hundred feet wide ) , some were being ferried over , and the larger portion in waiting for the completion of the pontoon bridge , which was slowly and steadily putting itself out , like two fioatin* , docks , from either bank . The little home-made steamer from Chattanooga came up to lend its aid to Sherman , as soon as it was safe to do so . When Sherman had captured the enemy 's pickets and drawn one division across , he ordered that semicircular line of trenches , convex toward the end of Missionary Ridge , which covered the bridge builders against annoyance from sharp-shooters and against assault . My first part was to open communication with Sherman . It is not a nice feeling , to know or suspect that an enterprising enemy lies between your detachment and the main body . Grant provided against this discouragement for Sherman . He directed Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send Bushbick with his brigade ( supported by Krizanouski 's brigade ) , and covered by one of the eleventh corps batteries ( Wheeler 's ) , over the river , adding a company of cavalry . These troops were to proceed by the river 's bank , on the enemy 's side of the river , from our position already named on Citico Creek to Sherman s // Chattanooga. brid , , e , several miles above . In order to see this ground , and to be ready to cooperate with Sherman with my remaining troops , if necessary , I concluded to accompany Buslibick 's command . We met very little resistance and no organized troops of the enemy ; there was some lively skirmishing on our right . About half past ten , while Hooker was storming Bragg 's left , I stood on the south and Sherman on the north projection of his bridge , which was steadily growing toward a junction . As the last boat was put in , we were conversing , and before the gap was quite closed , General Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the first time Sherman and I had more than a passing acquaintance . He asked if I would leave my brigade with him , so as to extend his right flank and make more speedy connection with Thomas than at Orchard Knob , as all advanced . I assented at once . lie explained the position , and his intended forward movements just as soon as the troops should be over the bridge , with that frank , hearty confidence of manner that attached me to him . I now turned back with my cavalry escort to join my corps and report progress . General Sherman moved as he had told me , sweeping up the gentle slopes for a mile or more , till he struck the rougher portions of the ridge . He was not heavily resisted till , havin , , skirmished over two rugged knobs , he came to the first prominence north of the railroad tunnel . There are more transverse ravines and spurs on this rocky wooded ridge than appeared before the trial to our observation and study with glasses . Bragg 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) division , was strongly posted . Trees , big stones , and logs arranged as barricades , and unapproachable crags in front , made it almost inaccessible . Add to this Cleburn 's brave men in plenty , with large guns and small ones at command , and it is easily conceived that it would be no holiday operation for Sherman to make a successful advance and assault , after he had actually struck the end of Bragg 's line . Night , which brought out the bright 215 flashes of Hooker 's skirmishers on the east side of Lookout , brought to view also to Grant and Thomas , at Chattanooga , Sherman 's camp-fires on the crest of Mission Ridge , in close proximity to the stubborn enemy . THE BATTLE : AT THE CENTRE . The reconnoissance of Thomas on the 23d , resulting in the brisk skirmish and taking of the outer line of Bragg 's position at Orchard Knob , was a successful move against his centre . The " demonstration " and contingent attack of Hooker on the 24th resulted in a grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-planned and nicely-executed flank movement of Sherman had really taken " the bull by the horns , " developed extraordinary resistance , and showed to all of us that there was tough work yet to be done . Sherman renewed his attack early in the morning of the 25th . He sent Corse 's division forward on his right , Mor , , an L. Smith 's on the left of the ridge . He used the brigade of Bushbick 's that I had brought him . John E. Smith and Loomis were brought up to the attack . These brave men gained some ground , and barricaded , but with heavy loss , there being many wounded and many killed . They held what they could , but the struggle against a resolute enemy so well posted was too unequal a contest for any considerable success here . Grant had moved his own position from Fort Wood to Orchard Knob , and had a fair view of these movements . He directed me at 9.45 A. M. to go at once and reinforce General Sherman . When I reached Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place my corps on his left flank , extending his line down the rough eastern slope of Missionary Ridge to the crooked Chickamauga Creek . General Hardee , who commanded Bragg 's right win , , extended his line constantly to confront ours . He renewed the desperate contest , but with little direct , though doubtless with a very positive indirect effect . As Grant kept reinforcing // Cli attanooga . Sherman , Bragg 's attention was absorbed by that flank , and he doubtless put every man he dared spare from elsewhere , to help resist this persevering onslaught . At any rate , all the morning , from sunrise , we had seen gray soldiers moving thitherward . General Breckenridge , who commanded Bragg 's left wing , confronted Hooker 's advance upon his left flank by a small checking force , that gave way after General I-looker had rebuilt the brido*e across the Chickamauga , and crossed over , not far from iRossville , to the attack . When hooker , chafed and hindered by streams impassable except by bridging , had at last advanced well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bragg 's actual left flank , and the enemy 's attention was divided between the dog0 ed attacks of Sherman 's men on the north and the sure approach of Hooker from the south , General Grant took this time in the afternoon ( it might be four o'clock ) to order the firing of six cannon shot , near his own position , as a signal for the long waiting but never impatient Thomas to push forward his divisions and seize the rifle-pits at the base of the ridge . As in all the other great battles , the artillery , from its various available points , almost simultaneously opened upon the enemy 's troops , as if to clear the way and make paths for a safer advance ( a doubtful measure with old troops , as it merely says , " Enemy , get ready ; we are coming " ) . The divisions of Baird , T. J. Wood , Sheridan , and Johnson ( probably thirty thousand effectives in all ) sprin0 forward in line over the rough ground , thi*ough the underbrush , now appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags flying , bayonets glistening , musketry rattling , cannon roaring , like Pickett 's gallant advance at Gettysburg against the terrible Cemetery Ridge . Such was the handsome and rapid movement straight up to the enemy 's lower line of rifle - pits . On this event the aroused Thomas reports , - Our troops advancing steadily in a continuous line , the enemy , seized with panic , abandoned the works at the foot Auoiist , of the hill , and retreated precipitately to the crest , whither they were closely followed by our troops , who , apparently inspired by the impulse of victory , carried the hill simultaneously at six different points , and so closely upon the heels of the enemy that many of them were taken prisoners in the trenches . " General Grant speaks like a diligent and friendly observer under some excitement : " These froops moved forward , drove the enemy from the rifle-pits at the base of the ridge like bees from a hive , stopped but a moment until the whole were in line , and commenced the ascent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following closely the retreating enemy without further orders . They encountered a fearful volley of grape and canister from near thirty pieces of artillery , and musketry from still well-filled rifle-pits on the summit of the ridge . Not a waver , however , was seen in all that long line of brave men . " This Grant and Thomas beheld from their commanding post of observation . The enemy fly up the ridge without stop ping to re - form . With no particular namable formation , in squads , with flags now droopin0 , now fallen , again uplifted , the men , with no more orders , followed by their officers , move on up , up the ridge . Batteries upon the crest bear upon them , and burst the shells over their heads , and cross musketry-fire from the rifle trenches on the heights kills some and wounds others , but our men do not stop until they have fully crowned the summit of this angry mountain and turned the enemy 's 0uns to fire in another direction , upon his own fragments . The enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hooker joined Sheridan 's right flank* the last to let go and the hardest to beat being Cleburn 's division ( which seemed to partake of that Irishman 's stubborn nature ) . This same division , lying in ambush , subsequently met our troops at Taylor 's Ridge and gave a bloody revenge for its discomfiture at Missionary Ridge , and put a damper on Hooker 's glory , so lately won . It was the 25th of November , late in the season , so that // night came on soon after Thomas 's men had reached the crest and had gotten into respectable order . Sherman 's troops saw nothing of this grand work until it was nearly over , and then they pushed in as far as the Chickamauga . From this it will be seen why a quick , close , and continuous pursuit was not made . Sheridan , always on hand and ardent , did *o on into the dark as far as Mission Mills . Guns were captured , prisoners and small arms and flags were gathered up from all quarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and victorious troops . After the cheerings , after the exciting recitals around the camp-fires , while the soldiers are quiet and sleeping beneath the silent stars , the slow-moving ambulances with their escorts of drummers and fifers and musicians ( no music now ) go sorrowfully over the field ( it is a rou* , h one and extensive ) , to gather up the wounded and bring them to the field hospital . Then the indefati , , able surgeons and assistant - stewards keep up their benevolent though sad and bloody work for the entire night . Friend and foe are here treated alike . To delicate nerves all this , - the pain , the blood , the bandages , the poorly-suppressed groan , and the ever - recurring struggles of the dying , - all this is simply terrible , horrible , yet the weary soldiers who are unhurt are oblivious to it all ; the ground is covered with them , sleeping and dreaming of triumphs won and home scenes now nearer . But the officer of rank , whose brain must be busy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who go and come with instructions and messages , and those who are connected with the medical corps , are obliged to hear these cries of pain , and witness these torchlight scenes that take hold on eternity , and make impressions too deep for human language against the arbitrament of war . After the last charge , four stout men carried a seruenut to the rear . They stopped to rest . LE . P. Smtth , then of the Christian Commission , drew near the stretcher , and speakin , , kindly , asked , " Where are you hurt , sergeant ? " He answers , " Almost up , sir . " " I mean in what part are you injured ? " He fixes his eye on the speaker , and answers again , " Almost up to the top . " Just then Mr. Smith uncovers his arm , and sees the frightful shattering wound of the shell that struck him . " Yes , " he says , turning his eye thither , " that s what did it . I was almost up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . " The sergeant was bearing the flag when he was hit . He died with the fainter and fainter utterance of " Almost up , " while his companions on the heights he almost reached were echoing the cheers of the triumph that he would so much have enjoyed . It is comforting to hope that his faithful spirit reached the crest of higher battlements than those which the living victors that day attained . PURSUIT . By five A. M. on the morrow ( November 26th ) my corps was on the march , following General J. C. Davis 's division across the Chickamauga pontoon in pursuit . Davis led , comm , , upon the skirmishers of Bragg 's rear guard just beyond Chickamauga station . Sherman and I were together much of that day , admiring the complete and soldierly manner in which Jeff . C. Davis handled his troops ; he kept up a good line , well supported in rear , and well covered by skirmishers in front , preventing attempts at mischief by the enemy , which are always frequent during retreat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Graysville , engaging both Davis 's troops and mine . It was of brief duration . I stayed at a house where there was a large family of poor people , much terrified . They had torn up the floor ( there being no cellar ) , to get down as low as possible , made barricades of mattresses and other bedding , and were not a little relieved when the heavy guns had ceased to roar , the sharp musketry had stopped , and our friendly faces gave them hope that their last day had not yet come . The next day , the 2 7th , while hooker // was fighting Cleburn at the *in**old Gap of Taylor 's Ridge , I passed through Parker 's Gap , farther north , sent forward and broke three miles of the Cleveland and Dalton Railroad , and drew my men back into camp near Taylor 's Ridge , having taken quite a number of prisoners , one of whom was an officer bearing dispatches from Longstreet to Bragg . THE RELIEF OF BUENSIDE . At the end of this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman , attaching my corps to his command , to the relief of Burnsid* at Knoxville . It will be remembered bow closely Longstreet invested him there , and how anxious our people were for his safety . With few wagons , hardly any tents , - just enough for the scribes , - no bridge trains , scarcely any rations , wearied with the three days ' fighting and two days ' vigorous pursuit , my corps never grumbled . We marched to Louisville , within one day 's journey of Knoxville , the troops resting a day , while several of our officers , myself included , accompanied Sherman to congratulate Buruside that Longstre*et had failed in his assault and been quickened in his steps Virginia - ward by our near approach . Sherman left Granger with the fourth corps in Buruside 's neighborhood , and thea we turned back . Did n't our engineers work ! We gave them plenty of help , however , bridging the Hiawassee and the Little Tennessee . A bridge of half-destroyed , abandoned Confederate wagons , which were roughly repaired and dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was one thousand feet long and was put into the stream between sunset and sunrise . The men were crossing , dry , and smoking their pipes and joking , as the sun was appearing in the east . We turned back , retracing the same route , and the 17th of December went into winter quarters at our old camp in Lookout Valley , having made a march up and back of two hundred and forty miles . What results from this sturdy work of twenty-five days since the first advance on Orchard Knob , the 23d of November ! The poor , sufferiu* , besieged , reinforced from east and west , had beaten the besiegers , gained Lookout Mountain and Mission Ridge , and driven Bragg 's army beyond Taylor 's Ridge , with a loss to him of at least 10,000 men , gaining in morale far more than in numbers . The victorious army , capturing between 6000 and 7000 prisoners , 40 pieces of artillery , 69 artillery carriages , and 7000 stand of small arms , breaking up connection between Bragg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northward , compelling the latter to cease harassing Burnside , and had really made a large breach in the enemy 's grand strategic line of armies , and splendidly prepared the way for Sherman 's even more brilliant ensuing spring campaign . It is difficult to get at accurate numbers , or even fair estimates . Probably after we were ready for battle , Hooker 's wing had 10,000 effectives , Sherman 's , including my corps and Davis 's division , at least 30,000 , and Thomas , at the centre , about the same number of men . Colonel Long , with a small body of cavalry , had operated between us and Cleveland during the battle , destroying Tyner 's Station , and taking 200 prisoners and 100 wagons at o* near Cleveland . It is not likely that Bragg , after Longstreet had been detached , had more than 40,000 effective troops , but he had vastly the advantage of natural positions , and they were well fortified . It was Grant 's purpose to concentrate superior numbers . It was always the true way against an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warlike appliances , such as the splitting of a common country would certainly provide . Our loss , 757 killed , 4529 wounded , and 330 missing , aggregating 5616 , was relatively large , but it was caused by our being obliged to attack positions of great natural strength and the best kind of artificial protection , in the way of intrenchmeats and breastworks . Gradually the work done by our great soldiers , Grant , Sherman , and Thomas , // and other helpers , is passing into history . Just now it seems almost a shame to have lived to mingle in these times . Those who sought the nation 's life are becoming its rulers , but our Union heroes have a proud satisfaction in knowing that they were the direct means of killing secession , state supremacy , and slavery , in America , and that it is only the enlarged generosity of the victors that has lifted up the vanquished into the higher position of power . 0 . 0 .
