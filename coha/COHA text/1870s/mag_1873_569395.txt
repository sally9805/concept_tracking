ARTICLE 11. - MORAL INTUITION VS* UTILITARIANISM . WHAT are right and wrong ? The intuitionist says : the right is the right , and the wrong is the wrong . These are simple ideas , admitting of no decomposition , and hence of no explanation . The utilitarian says : the right is that which tends to increase the sum of happiness , and the wrong is that which tends to diminish that sum or to produce misery . How do we know what is right or wrong ? The intuitionist sa*ys : by an innate moral power which calculates no results but decides upon inspection . The utilitarian holds , that only an examination of consequences can decide what is right or wrong . Why should I do what is right ? Because it is right , says the intuitionist . We hold no parley with those who seek a reason for rectitude . The majesty of duty is not to be insulted by stipulations as to what you shall have for your service . Right is its own reason , and demands of every one an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right because thereby I shall secure my own or others ' good . I make very little of this myth , called virtue , but whenever I can lend a hand to anyone , I feel obliged to do it . Helpfulness is my idea of holiness . These remarks serve to give some inexact hints of the leading points of difference between the two great schools of morals . In general , one relies upon moral insight , the other upon mental foresight . The one depends upon an intuition of nature , the other upon an apprehension of results . Yet though each party has held the other in detestation , still neither , when pressed by argument , has been able to avoid assuming the positions of the other . Dr. Whewell , in his Elements of Morality , a work meant to be an antidote to Paley , after insisting upon the degrading tendencies of the happiness system , reasons thus : " The object of the supreme rule of human action is spoken of as the true end of human action , the ultimate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is that supreme good ? He says , " Happiness is conceived as necessarily an ultimate object of action . ' ' The desire of happiness is the supreme desire. ** // 218 April , " Happiness is our being 's end and aim " ( 544 ) . " The supreme object of human action is happiness " ( 573 ) . Now as the supreme rule derives its value and validity from the supreme end , it follows that in Dr. Whewell 's mind happiness legitimates action ; which is unmixed Benthamism . On the other hand , Mr. Mill , who is the great apostle of utilitarianism , after a multitude of sharp hits at his predecessors for paying so little attention to the subjective effects of action , finally complains of Bentham , that " Man is never recognized by him as a being capable of pursuing spiritual perfection as an end , of desiring for its own sake the conformity of his character to his standard of excellence without hope of good or fear of evil from other sources than his own inward consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 384 ) . This is everything but utilitarianism . This mutual assumption of each other 's position leads us to suspect that both parties are right and both are wrong . There is a moral instinct , but its province has been extended much too far . Considerations of advantage , on the other hand , do play an important part in our moral judgments , but do not create our moral nature . The intuitionist has said a great deal about the " eternal distinction between right and wrong , " of " virtue , not happiness , as the end of man ; " in all of which there is far more of rhetoric than of reason . The utilitarian , on the other hand , while unquestionably right in testing his code by the canon of consequences , has always been prone to regard the moral instinct as without ethical authority , but as being the result of prejudice or the product of contagion . We do not believe that our moral convictions are caught like the measles , no more do we believe that conscience can utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control of life intuition is blind without the guidance of utility ; and utility is the purest selfishness apart from moral intuition . To determine if possible the value and limitations of each method , is the purpose of this essay . Each party has a strong word to utter in its own behalf . Men are judged in their motives without any estimate of results . We contemplate some example of lofty devotion to duty ; and at once we clap our hands and cry , well done . John in ilerod 's // court rebuking the licentious king , wins our admiration before we have considered the consequences of the rebuke ; and when a little later we see him in Herod 's prison , bowing his neck to the sharp stroke which falls flashing down , we do not retract our praise . When Arnold Winkelried gathers in his side the sheaf of Austrian spears , we instinctively yield our admiration without thought of the victory which his sacrifice secured for Switzerland . Who thinks less of the three hundred who held the pass at Thermopyl* because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we accord to Luther depend in no wise upon the good that flowed from his protest . Had the church crushed him , as it did Russ a hundred years before , it would not have affected our decision . Suppose , on the other hand , that the course of Nero were proved to have caused great good to modern Europe , still we should think no better of him . We judge persons , if we are sure of their motives , without thinking of results ; and results are powerless to reverse our decision . The only use we make of consequences is to arrive at motives ; we reason upon what a man did to find his motive in doing it ; but the motive known , the judgment is instinctive and irreversible . This is not , a question of argument , but a plain matter of fact . Despots in their mad ambition have struck blows that freed nations ; and wicked men often prove blessings , as thunder storms clear the air . But we think no more kindly of the tyrants for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked men because God makes their wrath to praise him . Demosthenes failed to secure Grecian unity and liberty ; but his failure does not diminish our admiration . Indeed , never does he seem so grand a figure as after that fatal day at Cheronsea , while he stood amid the wreck of baffled plans with his country falling in ruins around him . Washington secured American independence ; but it is not his success which we reverence . Success never won the reverence of a single human conscience , and never will . We judge no man by what he did , but by what he meant to do , and by the principle of action that ruled him . The only way in which a judgment of a person is ever modified , is by showing that he was moved by other motives than those we had attributed to him . Richard III . was a monster and is a monster forevermore. // Facts such as these are offered by the intuitionist to prove that consequences are not the standard of moral judgments . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the conscientious practices of one age are often the detestation of the next . As consequences manifest themselves moral judgments are reversed . Many things once thought righteous are now viewed with abhorrence . The asceticism of the early ages , and the deeds of the Inquisition , have had the sanction of conscience . Individual experience is a collection of mistakes ; and the history of the race is mainly a record of measures once thought righteous , but which , when weighed in the balance of consequences , were found wanting . Indiscriminate alms-giving had the sanction of conscience until political economy by its irresistible reasoning and its still more irresistible facts showed its pernicious tendency . Now from these undoubted facts two things clearly appear ; first , if conscience is a guide to action , it is an altogether unreliable one , and second , conscience can never maintain its authority against known inutility . From data like these the utilitarian argues , that consequences furnish the only trustworthy test of moral judgments . A glance at these conflicting arguments will serve to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments of the intuitionist all relate to moral judgments upon persons , those of the utilitarian only to moral judgments upcn actions . But abstract action has no moral quality at all . Our moral judgments are really upon persons , and never upon things . We never praise the sunshine or the rain , though they are of the greatest advantage . We never condemn the fire or the torrent , which sweeps life and property away . Impersonal agents may produce the highest good or the greatest mischief ; but they never win oar approval or receive our condemnation . These are reserved for personal agents only . Not even the acts of a person are really praised or blamed : it is the person doing those acts . He it is that is base or noble ; he it is that is righteous or wicked . Often indeed we do speak of an action as good or bad , but in every such case the condemnation is really bestowed upon the actor , and is allowed to flow from him over the , act . This is plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and suppose the motive to have been good , we might wonder at the blindness or folly of the doer , but we should remove our condemnation . It would be called a mistake , an error , not a crime . We read Machiavelli 's Prince only to detest the author ; but if it could be shown that the book was written as a satire on the morals and diplomacy of the time , the very book which is now Machiavelli 's shame would become his honor . Abstractly considered , action may be wise or unwise , helpful or hurtful ; but it is never morally good or bad . An examination of consequences cali decide upon the wisdom or folly of an action , and hence its fitness or unfitness to be done , but it can never determine its moral quality for the sufficient reason that it has no such quality to determine . Actions are instruments of expression , and their moral worth lies entirely in the motive or principle they aim to express . Now of many actions possible to the same motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to determine which is best fitted to express that motive . Conscience may command us to love one another ; but the specific actions which this rule involves are to be discovered by intelligence . Conscience may enjoin reverence toward God ; but whether this sentiment shall manifest itself in the myriad abominations of idolatry , or in the pure worship of the Bible , depends not upon conscience , but upon civilization and mental culture . Yet in many things , and especially in religious matters , the particular actions whereby particular motives find expression become habitual , and at last seem to be the only natural way of expressing this or that sentiment of the soul . In this way the abstract action itself acquires with the unthinking and conventional a sacredness or vileness of its own . In this way , too , the claims of conscience are enormously exaggerated , and its authority is brought into just contempt . Custom and prejudice unite trivial and foolish observances to worthy and sacred feelings , and thus the authority of conscience is claimed for many actions base and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , and he replies , My conscience tells me that it is right Conscience of this kind is the product of contagion , or a consolidation of prejudice , and needs nothing so much as a little good sense . Now as actions have no moral quality in themselves , we resign without hesitation the making of a code , or the determination // of specific action , to the judging intellect ; and we admit consequences to be the only standard of judoment The only rational aim of action is to secure good of some kind for ourselves or others ; and actions are to be selected with reference to their fitness to secure this end . Things hurtful are not to be done , things indifferent may be left undone , things helpful must be done . Let us look steadily at this . Will any intuitionist affirm that we are under obligation to do anything which leads to permanent mischief ? Can there be any obligation to things without result ? We think that no one can feel obligation under such circumstances . We must conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belieMed to be helpful , are we under obligation to perform it . Justice and truth have no absolute obligation ; it is only as they are the bond and cement of society that they are binding upon us . The Sabbath is obligatory because it was made for man . Profanity is forbidden because it destroys reverence for God and his law . Even chastity derives its obligation from its necessity to the family relation , and the proper physical and moral education of the race . The whole moral law was made for man , holds an organic relation to his well-being ; and in this fact lies all its binding force . The reason why justice should be done though the heavens fall , is , that the heavens would be sure to fall , if justice were not done . Kant carried his demand for unconditional veracity to such a length as to declare , that if an innocent man were hiding from a cutthroat , and a third party should be questioned as to his hiding-place , he must tell the truth under any certainty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be told because society and human happiness are based upon it , and any tampering with it is sure to result in mischief . Whenever it does not hold this relation , it may innocently be dispensed with . Novels are lies ; the best of them are downright falsehoods ; yet whatever the evil of fiction may be , it is not that it is fictitious . If society were so constituted that a knowledge of reality should be of no advantage , then truth would have no obligation . In short , can we suppose God to have laid commands upon us , obedience to which must result in mischief ? We surely can not . Can we suppose him to have placed us under obligation to do that which results in nothing ? // Such action would be puerile and insane . It only remains , then , that he has placed us under laws for our good , and that those laws are obligatory only because of the good at which they aim , and to which they lead . And we hold to the Divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatens to ruin , only because we trust his wisdom and love aga'inst our own . And the result always justifies our trust . Strong in this belief , the martyr dies and his blood proves the seed of the church . The patriot resists unto blood ; and the tree of liberty flourishes the more vigorously above his grave . And everywhere men endure a great fight of afflictions , holding fast the commandments of God ; and always the light and momentary affliction works out a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory . Except as we have this faith , we should not take one step beyoiid our own foresight , and we ought not to . Pain , except as related to some coming good , is not to be endured on any plea , or at any one 's command . In. every case where duty demands what seems an absolute sacrafice , God is the postulate and support of conscience . It is in. deed well that his law should take the form of an absolute imperative because the results of action often outrun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were it not for the absolute form of the law , we should constantly sacrifice the future to some momentary advantage . It is well at times that a father 's commands should be absolute law to the child ; but the binding force of his laws consists in the fact , that they all aim to secure the well-being of the household . So too , implicit faith in our Heavenly Father 's commands is the only becoming attitude for us to assume ; still the obligation to obedience lies entirely in the fact that our highest development and truest blessedness are only found 4herein . Throughout the universe nothing is obligatory which is not helpful ; and nothing is wrong which is not hurtful . Love is the law and love is its fulfillment . Love is the only absolute obligation . It is the foundation of all true codes , and germ of all the specific virtues . Mighty principle ! capable of endless adaptations , and of eternal self-revealings . Fit law for weakness . Fit law for power . Law of earth . Law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific virtues are love manifesting itself under condi // tions . They may pass away with their conditions , but " charity never faileth . " But love looks With indifference on things indifferent , with condemnation only on things mischievous , and with approval only on such actions as are fraught with good . As the result of these considerations we hold this to be the infallible test of codes as well as of men , By their fruit ye shall know them . Then the end justifies the means ! Of course it does . Strictly speaking , means have no moral quality at all apart from the end at which they aim . This principle , so far from being a self-evident falsehood , is one of universal application . The security of society is an end to secure which we use such means as the imprisonment and destruction of men . Yet if the end can be secured in no other way , who doubts thatthe means are justified ? This principle is fundamental in the moral government of God . The whole creation groaneth and travaileth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force man into mental and spiritual development , hunger and want and disease hang forever upon his heels . On every side he is scourged and stung . Pain whirls an incessant lash , and lights an ever-burning fire . There is very much in the Divine dealings with . man which , unless some transcendent good is to come from it , can only be viewed as a monstrous abuse of power . Clouds and darkness are indeed round about him it is the trial of faith to believe that righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne . The reverent soul , anxious for the honor of its God , finds comfort only in believing that there is a good and a glory in store , in which these awful methods shall find their reason and their justification . Persecution , too , if it accomplished its purpose , would be justified in using the rack and the fagot . The real objQction to it is , not that it is inherently wrong , but that it must both fail to secure its object , and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first , that the doctrine in question is a pernicious heresy , and second , that the fire which burns the sophist will also burn the sophistry , then the same reasons which warrant the hanging of spies , traitors and murderers , would also , but with thousand-fold force , justify the burning of incorrigible heretics . What then of the Jesuit doctrine ? Why this , that to secure their paltry end , // they sought to undermine the foundations of society . As human nature is constituted , fraud , cunning , intrigue , untruth , all tend to loosen the central attraction on which social relations depend , and send the flying members into collision and chaos . For this reason we demand an implicit obedience to truth , but for this only . Believing the moral law to be an expression of the Divine goodness , and a pledge of the highest blessedness of the universe , we forbid all Jesuitical tampering therewith , but only on the ground of its mischievous tendency . Now before the intuitionist grows indignant at this concession to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His claim that moral good or evil is a quality resident in actions , as hardness in stones or whiteness in snow , we have seen to be utterly groundless . Abstract action is neither moral nor immoral , but unmoral , and it is only as conscience is blinded and misled by custom , prejudice , and association , that abstract action is looked upon as good or evil . The georneter studies his diagram , and finally enounces the properties of the square , the triangle , the circle . But the claim that there is a moral in tuition which in the same way discerns moral properties in action , is sufficiently disproved by the fact just mentioned , that there are no such properties there to discern , and by the further fact , that moral judgments are always upon the actor and not upon the act . We admit that men think that conscience tells them what is right or wrong ; but we have explained the genesis of the belief Conscience tells some people that to carry a few gravel stones in the shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday is a mortal evil . When stoves were first introduced , there were good people whose conscience told them that it was little better than sacrilege to bring a stove into church , and we once had a friend who positively thought that we had forfeited our title to salvation by wearing our hat on the back of our head . We have known ministers who had conscientious scruples about wearing a beard , and good people whose conscience would mA allow them to listen to a minister who could be guilty of so grave a crime . In short , there is no conceivable absurdity on which some one has not had conscientious scruples . But when examined , this folly turns out to be not conscience , but superstition , which from // association , aided by ignorance , has contrived to win for itself the approval of our moral instinct . Now if the intuitionist will argue from these unreasoning prejudices that there is a moral faculty which discerns between right and wrong action , he may do so ; but we utterly fail to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with culture , with time , with the longitude . Our claim is that all action , when viewed abstractly , may be classed as helpful , hurtful , or indifferent ; and that only the first is obligatory . The principles of action may be given by conscience ; but their application should be determined by experience and common-sense . The intuitionist says , Do right ; and we claim that the helpful is the right . But this doctrine is commonly stigmatized as " groveling expediency , " " bread-andbutter morality , " " dirt philosophy , " &amp;c . Yet what aim can be higher than this , of lending a helping hand to everyone without regard to low , selfish interests ? Will the worshipers of that venerable female abstraction , called virtue , suggest a nobler aim ? Will those rhetorical moralists who deal in the " unconditional veracities , " the " absolute sanctities , " and the " eternal rightuesses , " enact for us a higher law than that on which the law and the prophets hang ? We do not , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not aim at the production of good ; but we do deny that it would have any obligation . Such action might furnish a striking example of what we could do , but not of what we should do , and would be full as unlovely as it would be unhappy . Our idea of the " thousand years of peace " is not that men shall then serve some inanity called virtue , but shall love the Lord their God with all their hearts , and their neighbors as themselves . Who can show us a higher view ? But in yielding so much to the utilitarian , we by no means agree with him in denying moral intuition ; and nothing that we have said , supposing it all to be true , removes the need of innate moral perception . We look upon our moral instincts as a part of the primary furniture of the soul , and , like all the intuitions , as antho*tative in their sphere . The attempt of the utilitarian to reduce them to some operation of the intellect , or some affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete failure . Most of all does he fail to show that they are // but shadows of custom and prejudice . We have now to consider whether he is justified in turning conscience out of doors , as something neither native to the soul , nor necessary to a science of morals . A susceptibility to happiness , or the possession of a sensitive nature , is a necessary condition of a moral nature . Except among beings capable of enjoyment or suffering , goodness and sin are alike impossible . It is our own pleasures and pains which interpret to us the pleasures and pains of others , and render us capable of love and malignity . If a stone were endowed with every power of mind but sensibility , it could neither perform a loving action , nor perpetrate an outrage . It could form no conception of good or evil , and could do neither . Such a being might do mischief but it could never sin . All the qualities which constitute character would become impossible under such a supposition . In onr own susceptibilities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But because sensitive indifference involves ethical indifference , it does not follow that a sensitive nature implies a moral one . For all about us are animals which , though possessing sensitive natures , are not the subjects of moral law . What then is the relation of the sensitive to the ethical nature ? It does not create that nature , but constitutes the possibility of its action . From it we get the timber for building character . In it we find the field in which the moral powers are to win their victories or suffer their defeats . Only through self-love can we learn to love others . Only as we love the brother whom we have seen , can we rise to love God and the brother whom we have not seen . The natural desires , passions , and sentiments furnish chaos for moral creation . If they were away , conscience would be without an occupation . The facts of perception do not make the laws of thought , yet without the facts the laws would never come into knowledge . So also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet without those facts the principles would lie dormant and unknown . But if there be intellect to foresee the results of action , and a sensitive nature to urge us to effort , what need of any specific moral faculty ? We have various desires , each aiming at its peculiar gratification , and since these desires are natural , we // must suppose their gratification to be both innocent and becoming . We can not allow that there can be anything in human nature as God made it , which , while it must be admitted because an unmanageable necessity , must also be slurred over as disgraceful . In addition to these desires we have the j udging intellect to guide them to their object . For the control of life what need is there of anything more ? This question calls up a most fundamental peculiarity of moral judgments . These are never upon a single thing , but are always based upon a comparison of two or more . The universal form of a moral judgment is : this is better than that . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We applaud the good only as we remember the bad that might have been . We condemn the bad only as we recall the good that should have been . Remove the idea of an alternative possibility , and there would be neither approval nor condemnation . Deny freedom in the agent , and moral judgments cease . Admit his freedom , but restrict his desire to a single line , and still a moral judgment would be impossible . If our nature were such that only a single set of desires , or desires which never conflict should present themselves , we should not be moral beings , and there would be no need of a conscience to control our lives . No nature can be moral until it is made the theater of conflicting possibilities ; and in the manner in which the conflict is decided lies its glory or its shame . Alike to natures which rise above , or fall below , this possibility and this conflict , moral judgments are inapplicable . The lower orders determined by instinct to a single line of action can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of the saintly soul a time shall ever come when all its powers and principles shall converge to a single point , and all conflict of desire and aim shall absolutely cease , then that spirit will have risen above the plane of moral judgments . Such a nature might win our reverence , but not our applause , or commendation . It has risen above conflict , and enjoys the serenity of God . Out of many beings endowed with sensitive natures , ma n is made fit to be the subject of moral law by the conflicting possibilities which abide within him ; and the need of moral insight to such a nature is found in the fact , that only as these warring powers // recognize one certain order is a true development possible . Desires conflict , which shall yield ? The springs of action are many , what is the order of their rank , and what their relative authority ? If they are of equal rank , every action is equally worthy , and there is no good or evil . If their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be constant , or good and evil will have no fixed meaning . If the order may be inverted , then the sinner of to-day may become the saint of tomorrow ; and angel and devil may exchange places in our regard . Variables may enter into a function , but a function comJ ) osed entirely of variables is useless for purposes of calculation . Except the true order of the soul be authoritatively given , and the principles of action be fixed , no science of morals is possible . The function of conscience , then , we conceive to be this , not to form codes , but to disclose the true order of the soul , to criticise the springs of action , and determine their relative authority . Our claim is , that when two motives appear in the soul , we instinctively know which is higher . When gratitude and selfishness appear together , we know one to be worthy and the other base . When pity and pleasure claim the soul , pity makes us acknowledge its superior authority without entering into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other passion whatever , then love claims our allegiance with an authority which we can not dispute , and rules us by Divine Right . And this claim is not a calculation , but an instinct ; not a foresight , but an insight ; not a judgment , but an absolute knowledge . We never doubt which of two motives is the higher . It was never known that any one had difficulty in settling the rival claims of love and avarice , or that opposing judgments were delivered upon them . Men do serve the lower against the higher , but never without remorse and shame . In a fit of anger men resist the pleadings of the better nature , but can not escape compunction . The man who lives for himself alone , and shuts his eyes and ears to misery and distress , is visited with universal condemnation . Now this faculty , power , instinct , or whatever it may be , which when two motives disclose themselves , intuitively pronounces upon their relative work and authority , we call conscience . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower we are wicked . // The lower motive may be natural and innocent in its place , and even obligatory as compared with one still lower , but whenever any motive , however high , is placed above one yet higher , then we sin . Not obedience to good motives satisfies conscience , but obedience to best motives . That one should seek his own gratification is both innocent and becoming as long as nothing higher is left undone . But the moment the higher claims him , he can not persist in the lower without sin . Hence sinful action consists chiefly in doing right things at the wrong time ; and evil is good out of place . Now the utilitarian denies that we have any such moral insight . We believe that a common and consistent conscience is as patent a fact in human experience as a common and consistent reason . But leaving this question for the present , let us see how the utilitarian succeeds in dispensing with moral insight . The earlier forms of the doctrine were purely and grossly selfish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandeville , we open Paley 's treatise . He says : " The difference and only difference between an act of prudence and an act of duty is this , that in one case we consider what we shall gain or lose in the present world ; in the other we consider also what we shall gain or lose in the world to come . " In every case of duty " private pleasure is the motive , and the will of God the rule . " We need not read further before , with Mr. Mill , we begin to " think meanly of him . " But in the chapter on Happiness he says : " I will omit much usual declamation on the dignity and capacity of our nature , of the superiority of the soul to the body , of the rational to the animal part of our constitution , upon the worthiness , refinement , and delicacy of some satisfactions , or the meanness , grossness , and sensuality of some others ; because I hold that pleasures differ in nothing but in continuance and intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . According to this doctrine , it only needs a more delicate nerve to make the table more sacred than the temple . In the hands of Bentham the doctrine became rather more decorous in appearance and more worthy of consideration . An attempt is made to get out of the selfish slough by proposing , // instead of the greatest happiness of the agent , the greatest happiness of all concerned , as the end of human action . Yet Bentham s views of happiness were extremely narrow , and his deduction of the greatest - happiness principle was illogical . For he tells us to " think not that a man will so much as lift up his little finger for you , unless he sees his advantage in it . " Bentham did indeed get out of the selfish system ; but every Benthamite has been forced to confess that it was by a logical inconsequence . The best that can be said for utilitarianism as a complete system , has been said by Mr. Mill . He has criticised unsparingly the errors of his predecessors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its utmost limits . One great error of previous utilitarians had been in confining their attention to objective and material consequences ; without taking note of the spiritual bearing of actions . This with Mr. Mill is a constant subject of complaint . Of Paley he says : " He looks too much to the objective consequences of action , and too little to the subjective ; attends too much to the effects uponour outward condition and that of others , to those on our internal sources of happiness or unhappiness too little . " Of Bentham he complains in the quotation already given , that " man is never recognized by him as a being capable of pursuing spiritual perfection as an end . " Of his theory he says : " It will do nothing for the conduct of the individual , beyond prescribing some of the more obvious dictates of worldly prudence and outward probity and beneficence. * * * It recognizes no such wish as that of self-culture ; we may even say no such power . * * * A moralist , on Bentham 's principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought not to slay , burn , or steal " ( Discussions , voL i , p. 388 ) . No one has repudiated the selfish system more heartily than he . " As between the agent 's own happiness and that of others , utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator . In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth , we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utiiity . To do as you would be done by , and to love your neighbor as yourself , constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarianism " ( Vol. iii , p. 347 ) . // The aim is the noblest possible , and we believe that no ethical writer was ever more in sympathy with the aim . We have always felt that were it not for the exigencies of his mental philosophy , Mr. Mill would be an intuitive moralist . But , as he says in his review of Whewell : " it has always been indistinctly felt that the doctrine of a priori principles is one and the same doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of duty . " A disciple of the experience philosophy must be a utilitarian . Mr. Mill 's rule , too , is the best possible , but when addressed to a graded nature like our own , it is without meaning , except as there is a moral instinct to interpret it . We say the greatest happiness is the aim , but in what does this help us ? There are many kinds of happiness , and these too are often incompatible . There are pleasures of the senses and pleasures of the soul . Which are to be placed first ? The happiness of one man is the detestation of another . Which is right ? Each propensity of our nature demands gratification , but not infrequently one must yield to another . Which shall it be ? Which of the several springs of action shall hold rule in the soul ? What is the true order of the emotions , and what their relative authority ? Can the scales answer any of these questions ? Is the relation of higher and lower only a question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical pleasures above spiritual ones ?

He must not appeal to any instinct of the soul ; he can only say : " They will bring you more pleasure than those groveling pursuits of yours .

I choose to stay where I am . " Suppose he chooses to answer in this way , what more can the utilitarian offer ? He may say that such a course will be prejudicial to others , and appeal once more to the sensualist , on the ground that his course involves others in wretchedness . " But , " says the other , " why should I care for others ? Why should I sacrifice my own advantage to secure another 's happiness ? " But , says Mr. Mill : " Few but those whose mind is a moral blank could bear to lay out their course of life on the plan of paying no regard to the interests of others , except so far as their own private interest compels . " ( Diss. , vol. iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , I do n't know , " rejoins the other ; " but I would like to know the precise reasou why I should not lay out my life on this plan ? " Here the utilitarian might point out how the happiness of the agent is involved in that of others , and , availing himself of the principle of association and inter.dependence of interests , he might enjoin many apparently disinterested actions . This has been very carefully done by Mr. Austin and the elder Mill . If we fail to do good to others , they will fail to do good to us . Unless we preserve a correct moral deportment , others will be infected by our bad example , and thus , sooner or later , the evil effects of our wickedness will come back upon our own beads . But this carries us not one step beyond the selfish system ; it still leaves the " private interest " as the compelling , nay , as the only motive . Now men have a very strong bias to low , selfish action ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should not be selfish ? Men have too an almost invincible tendency to seek their happiness in low and sensual gratifi. cations , to the neglect and destruction of their better natures ; will the utilitarian give us the exact reason why they should not pursue such gratifications , to the exclusion of higher ones ? He can offer nothing , so far as we can see , except that the higher is the happier . But is sin nothing but a bad bargain ? Is this sense of guilt , this remorse and shame , only the result of miscalculation or imprudence ? Is this feeling of conscious von . xxxii. 16 // rectitude , this joy of righteousness , only a sense of having made a good investment ? Motives too are of different rank , else there is no good or evil . Will the utilitarian tell us how he determines their relative authority ? Our claim is that as two motives appear in the mind , we intuitively know which is higher ; the utilitarian can only test them by their subjective consequences . To act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act from others is followed by joy and self-respect . Now the utilitarian argues that these results are the unfailing indices of the quality of the motives . This may be true ; but these results are not the causes of the quality , nor the ground of our moral judgment . The moral estimate of motives always precedes approval or condemnation . We did not act rightly because we are happy , but we are happy because we acted rightly . We believe with the utilitarian , that consequences are the only test of abstract action ; but when he applies this canon to motives , he argues in a circle . Why is this motive higher than that ? Because to act from it produces joy . But why does obedience to this motive produce joy ? Because it is higher . The argument is circular , and no ingenuity can save it from returning into itself We are not seeking to make out a case , but to reach the fundamental facts of our moral nature , and we think it indisputable that in every truly moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motives , the judgment proceeds upon an instinct and not upon a calculation . Indeed it seems to us that the utilitarian makes far too much of happiness as the cause of action . Happiness is rather the end of action than its cause . The bulk of human action is instinctive , and though it would cease if it were found to be resultless , yet the primary cause is the promptings of the instinct . Indeed there are many questions into which comparisons of happiness do not enter at all . It is better to be a miserable freeman than the sleekest slave . It is better to be the most wretched of men than the happiest of brutes . It is doubtful whether our busy civilization is any happier than the stagnation of the Chinese ; but who doubts which is nobler ? He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow , but for all that , let knowledge grow from more to more . So also between sensual and spiritual pleasures , we never decide // by any comparison of happiness . The balance has no office here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kind . No increase of the former can raise them to the rank of the latter ; they are absolutely incommensurate . Why then should I follow the higher motive ? Because it is higher . How do I know it to be higher ? By insight , not by foresight . We have here a true moral intuition , as undeniable and authoritative in its sphere as any of the intuitions of the pure reason . At this point we agree most heartily with the intuitionist , in saying that right is its own reason , and dem*nds from everyone an unconditional surrender . As between subjective aims , intuition only can decide , and from its decision there can be no appeal . We are indeed warranted in seeking happiness , but it must be a happiness which accords with our moral instincts . We have said that the aim of all action should be to do good , and we say so still ; but the direction which our effort will take will be determined as much by our moral affections as by our sensitive nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among beings of low aims and desires it would only lead to low and groveling action . That each should do as he would be done by , is a rule fit for angels ; but only as it is interpreted by a moral instinct will it result in angelic action . In a world of sots , it would be obeyed by hauling one another up to drink . In a world of gluttons , obedience to this rule would result in unlimited gorging . In order that these laws should result in high action , it is necessary that there should be high instincts to determine their application . So then , while the objective aim of action should be to do good , the ultimate and supreme good that we are to crave for every one is , that his life should be made to accord with the ideal law of action . We are not allowed to seek for ourselves or others any good which conflicts with this . The psychology , then , of right action we think is this : it begins in an authoritative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not end in happiness , could the instinct maintain its authority ? This is the last question the utilitarian can ask ; let us look at it closely . Conscience and reason alike agree that the only end of action is happiness of some sort ; conscience decides which kind of happiness we shall make supreme . Now if the utilitarian means this , could // the moral instinct maintain its authority , if the pursuit of moral happiness involved the destruction of sensitive good , the answ5 is obvious . Our moral instincts have maintained themselves against , not only the threat , but the reality , of every conceivable torture . " And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment : They were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins ; being destitute , afflicted , tormented . Of whom the world was not worthy . " ( Hebrews xi , 36 ) . But if there were no happiness , sensitive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain its authority ? In that case the moral instinct would have no authority to maintain , for it would affirm no obligation . For as we have seen , the office of conscience is to determine the relative rank of motives . But if actions were alike in result , motives could never be differenced into lower and higher , and thus the essential condition of a moral judgment would be wanting . In this case , our moral judgment would not be false , but impossible . We believe , then , with the intuitionist in the absolute authority of conscience . We believe with the utilitarian that the end of all action should be to secure our own or others ' good , but what particular good we shall seek , or how we shall seek it , can not be determined without reference to our moral affections as well as to our sensitive nature . We do not object to the utilitarian 's testing everything by its relation to our happiness , but we insist that he shall take ttccount of our moral as well as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest can be made by appeals to merely sensitive good . It would be hard to entice a sot from the pothouse by promising him some greater gratification . It would be impossible to engage a sensualist 's attention by telling him that he will get more pleasure out of life by becoming pure and clean . It was the sharp rousing cry of , " Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand , " which sent publicans and scribes , Pharisees and Sadducees , out to the banks of the Jordan to confess their sins . Considerations of prudence have a certain value , but are totally inadequate to the work of moral reform . The changes might // be rung forever on heaven and hell with but little effect . The one thought of having fallen , of having quenched a light more glorious than the sun , is worse than torture-halls . The hope of rising again , of recovering the bartered birthright , is better than elysian fields . It is under the influence of this thought that men bow in an agony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say , I will arise and go to my Father , and say I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son . Where considerations of prudence are powerless , conscience can make the guilty soul quake and tremble . Conscience as a fact and an actual force in human nature is not denied by Mr. Mill ; he admits its existence , but traces its origin to experience . Conscience , according to him , expresses no universally valid principle of action , no constancy of moral obligation , but only the opinions and prejudices of ourselves and neighbors . To be sure it now seems independent of such sources , but such is its actual origin . A denial of conscience would be less disastrous , for this would be false on its face . Far worse is it to load it with opprobrium , and discredit it as an impostor . Mr. Mill himself seems conscious of this at times , for he says , " The sanction so far as it is disinterested is always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the transcendental moralists must be , that that sanction will not exist in the mind unless it is believed to have its root out of the mind , and that if a person is able to say to himself ; This which is restraining me , or which is called my conscience , is only a feeling in my own mind , ' he may possibly draw the conclusion that when the feeling ceases the obligation ceases , and that , if he find the feeling inconvenient , he may disregard it and endeavor to get rid of it " ( vol. iii , p. 340 ) . A very natural conclusion and a just one . Why indeed foster a feeling very b which is only a feeling , disclosing no principle of universal obligation ? Because it will hLirt me if I do n't ? I can very easily quiet it by letting it severely alone . " But , " he continues , " is this danger confined to utilitarian morals alone ? Does the belief that moral obligation has its seat outside of the mind make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The question is not whether it can be got rid og but whether it ought to be obeyed . If I understand that this voice within // my breast is an echo of the voice of God , a sign of his august will , then I may indeed neglect it , but not without feeling that it is not only my peril , but my deep disgrace and sin . But ig on the other hand , " its binding force consists only in the existence of a mass of feeling which must be broken through in order to do what violates our standard of right " ( vol. iii , p. 339 ) , and if this mass of feeling " is derived from sympathy , from love , and still more from fear , from all the forms of religious feeling , from the recollections of childhood , and of our past life , from self-esteem , desire of the esteem of others , and occasionally even self-abasement " ( p. 339* , then , I say plainly , I will obey no such thing as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  one knows not what of mental confusion . It is only a well-dressed superstition . Examination proves it to be an impostor and human nature is made not one whit more respectable by obedience . If it be a usurper it shall and ought to be dethroned . It is not to be thought of that one sentiment should assume to lord it over all the rest unless it can show a Divine right to the throne . Mr. Mill , with other utilitarians , constantly confuses the * priori determination of principles with the d priori determination of specific action . He declares that " the contest between the morality which appeals to an external standard , and that which grounds itself on internal conviction , is the contest of progressive morality against stationary ; of reason and argument against the deification of mere opinion and habit " ( vol. iii , p. 154 ) . This , as we have sought to show , is true of the * priori determination of specific codes , and if by conscience Mr. Mill means the mass of inherited practices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly dignified by the name of conscience , his complaint is most just . But this is not conscience . This is superstition , which from some original relation to a worthy or sacred impulse has come by the force of association to have all the sacredness of the impulse itself . The fact is , that few intuitionists know what the true office of conscience is , and utilitarians do not take the pains to find out . It does not determine action , but the principles and direction of action . Now while we are ready to resign the conventional conscience to be hooted at and insulted until it learns more wisdom , how can it be said that an * priori determination of principles is // inimical to advance ? The principles of mathematics are stationary , but they do not hinder the progress of the science , nay it is their fixedness alone which makes advance possible . What would science be if among the myriad applications of its principles the principles themselves were floating . What damage does intellect receive from fixed laws of reasoning ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason ? Why then should an appeal to the common conscience be stigmatized as inimical to progress , a deification of opinion and habit ? Plainly , without some fixed rule of action , no real advance is possible . Progress and regress are alike unthink* able where there is no fixed point . To make moral science possible such a principle must be given ; and if the voice of universal humanity is to be trusted , such a principle has been given . Not a common and consistent code , but a common and consistent conscience , is one of the most patent facts of human history . Remember that by a moral judgment we mean a decision upon the relative worth and dignity of motives ; and we claim that in such judgments all men agree . We do not claim that conscience is always equally active , nor even that it is always active . We should be very loth to entrust ourselves to the protection of a Feejee 's conscience , and if we had no other defence than his sense of right the possibilities would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savagism there is little complexity of motive , and moral judgments are correspondingly simple and few . It is not until there is some degree of political and social knowledge that moral questions become at all complex . It is not until intelligence has opened up the various departments of endeavor and showed their relation to well-being , that they can become amenable to the moral instinct . In a state of ignorance conscience may be intense but never broad . Even in Christian countries there are whole continents of life which , because of ignorance , are wholly without the realm of conscience . But in all truly moral judgments savage and sage agree as far as they go . There may be savage islands where only the lowest motives can be understood , and where moral judgments must be very rudimentary , but as far as they go they agree with those of poet and philosopher . Opposition in moral judgments has never been shown , nor do* we think it can be . No one ever put ingratitude above grati // tude or hate above benevolence . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make many motives possible ; but the motive given , the judgment is identical from pole to pole . It is said that forgiveness , which ranks so high as a Christian virtue , has been held in contempt by savages . That may be ; but the reason was that it was looked upon as the mark of a mean and cowardly spirit . They had not reached the point of moral culture where they could readily conceive how any one should forego the infliction of just punishment when it lay in his power . But convince the king of Ashantee , or a Comanche chief ; that it springs not from cowardice , but from a strong , godlike love , and he too will admit its unearthly beauty . Was there ever a nation under heaven which did not hear with reverence and adoration the story of him who " came , not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many ? " Nay , verily , but as the " old , old story is told around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men unto him . Give the motive , and conscience gives the judgment , which is valid for every climate and every age . As the child or the savage rise to the more complex motives of manhood or civilization they accord with the whole great harmony of mankind . Nor time , nor place , nor the circumstances of society , nor any result whatever , will serve to change or modify a moral judgment Now whence this agreement under every difference of outward condition ? What can we conclude but that there is a universal moral instinct in the human soul ? Now this instinct , universal in its manifestations , and unanimous in its decisions , whence comes it ? Is this moral law within a type of a greater law without ? Is it the sign of a Being above us , and a Will higher than our own ? Is it the echo on earth of the law of heaven ? iDo we through it gain glimpses of a purity purer than our purest , and of a holiness far transcending ours ? if so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impunity defy . But if I made this law , I can and will unmake it . The statute book is mine to revise or abolish , as I choose . If it is only a product of human customs and prejudices , a compend of opinions and self-interests wrought by some kind of associational chemistry into respectable form , then it has no ethical authority , obedience has no merit and deserves no approbation . It is all the result of eda // 1873. ilforal Intuition vs . Utilitarianism. cation . We have been prejudiced against bate , malice , envy , and ingratitude ; that is alL The traitor in himself is as good a man as the loyal citizen . Apart from all prejudice , Arnold is as noble as Washington , and Judas as good as Christ . The worst that can be said of the vilest sinner is , that he has been imprudent The best that can be said of the saint is , that he is long-headed and shrewd . These are the conclusions to which the utilitarian , denying that conscience reveals immutable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can accept them ? Who does not see them to be false to urnversal experience ? Mr. Mill himself does not accept them . In a passage criticizing Mr. Mansel 's doctrine of Religious Nescience , he says , " If instead of the glad tidings ' that there exists a Being in whom all the excellencies which the highest human mind can conceive , exists in a degree inconceivable to us , I am informed that the world is ruled by a Being whose attributes are infinite , but what they are we can not learn , nor what are the principles of his government , except that the highest human morality which we are capable of conceiving does not sanction them ; convince me of it , and I will bear my fate as best I may . But when I am told that I must believe this , and at the same time call this Being by the names which express the highest human morality , I say in plain terms I will not . Whatever power such a Being may have over me , there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compel me to worship him . I will call no Being good who is not what I mean when I apply that term to my fellow creatures ; and if such a Being can send me to hell for not so calling him , to hell I will go " ( Exam . Sir Win . Hamilton , vol. i , p. 104 ) . Goodness in God must be the same as goodness in man ! So strong is Mr. Mill 's belief in this doctrine , that he is prepared to go to hell rather than deny it . We do not see how Mr. Mill could have given a more supreme proof of intense belief Yet what is this but an admission that the principles of morality are objective to the human mind , and are identical throughout the universe ? But if any one choose in spite of consequences to look upon the moral instinct as a contagion of others ' views , there is the sufficient answer that self-judgment must precede any judgment upon another . Self knowledge is an indispensable condition to knowing others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen or heard . Pain is nothing to one who has never suffered . So also the language of moral judgments is absolutely unintelligible to one who has not learned their meaning from the motions of his own soul . We must conclude then that this law is not earth-made but heaven-born . Man 's chiefest dignity is in being placed under this law , and his greatest glory lies in obeying it . All below man are ruled without their knowledge or consent , but man is taken into his Maker 's counsels and aske4 to obey . " Henceforth I call you not servants l ) ut friends , for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth . " The sum of our argument is this : Conscience judges actors ; reason judges actions . Conscience selects the motive ; reason selects the act which will best express that motive . Conscience gives the principle of action ; reason applies it . To misapply the law is error ; to disobey it is guilt . Reason detects the first ; conscience judges the second . The sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former arises from an examination of consequences ; the latter from comparing purpose and motive with the ideal law of action . Both schools are thus seen to be necessary to a complete science of morals . When the intuitionist attempts to construct an d priori code , he falls into the most ludicrous extravagances . When the utilitarian denies that we have the power of moral insight , he reduces morality to the lowest selfishness , and does violence to universal experience . Conscience is absolute in its sphere ; but its sphere is only the determination of the true order of the soul , or the relative rank of motives . The end of all action is not to do right , but to do good , either to ourselves or others ; but what kind of good we shall do will depend more upon our moral affections than upon our sensitive nature . In physics the mind must constitute its metaphysical data and the laws of formal logic ; perception must add the facts . Without these two elements , the internal and external , no science is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the law is chaos . So , too , in moral science , there must be the moral postulates of conscience , the fixed principles of action , and there must be reason , foresight , experience , to determine their application . Skill and prudence come with the years , but the fixed order of the soul is given as the original datum of action .
