ARTICLE 111. - REVIVALS OF RELIGION . HOW TO MAKE THEM PRODUCTIVE OF PERMANENT GOOD . THE phrase " A Revival of Religion , " or as more briefly used , " A revival , " has in this country a somewhat narrow and technical meaning . It has lost its wide , historic sense , in which reference is had to a period of some length , to facts of varied nature , and to the experience of an entire country or of all Christendom : such as the national religious reformations under Luther , Calvin , and Knox . It means in our American newspapers , magazines , and books , a more local and transient excitement , which may be limited to a single congregation , or may pervade a district of con ntry , and which implies an increase of conversions from a worldly to a spiritual life , and a large accession of communicants to the church . The circumstances may vary in nearly all the incidental particulars . The revival may come with or without a resort to special means , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the labors of some minister ot icr than the pastor ; with or without a previous state of doctrinal or of practical declension ; with or without careful and intended preparation ; with or without peculiar measures in the way of manifesting feeling , testing earnestness , and directing inquirers . Revivals may differ in the degree of prominence of the ordinary exercises ,  --  singing , prayer , the exhortations of laymen , and the sermons of clergymen . They may be unlike in the frequency of their return to the same community , in the rapidity or simultaneousness of their effects , in the duration of the special influence , and in their freedom from mixtures of superstition , animal excitement , and fanaticism. ft is simply claimed , by the name in question , that , with whatever peculiarities or imperfections , there has been a truly religious influence , manifested with more than usual power , and so operating through social sympathies and channels as to affect large numbers , in a short space of time , with regenerative results . The name represents a reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience , in the individual or in the church ; but it represents a Christian force , which deserves study , which has rewarded use , and which such a mind as that of Jonathan Edwards thought worthy of defense and explication . The word revival is peculiarly precions to our American churches , from its relations to their past history , and to their present attitude before the hosts of unbelief . At critical times , the spiritual interests of the nation have been saved by them , while not a few churches have owed their existence to the local revivals in border settlements , and in older communities ; the sudden conversion of great numbers to a religious life having furnished the needed material for new organizations . A large proportion of the churches in the evangelical denominations will testify that , by this instrumentality , they bave been greatly if not chiefly enlarged and strengthened . And now that faith in the Bihie is losing its hold on many minds , and a supernatural religion is pronounced in high quarters to be an absurdity , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who value revivals because in them the presence an ( l agency of the Holy Spirit are manifest , and the modern as well as the ancient gospel is seen to be " in demonstration of the Spirit and of power . " If still there are Pentecostal effusions , primitive Christianity survives in one of its chief characteristics , and will yet vindicate its reality and potency by a repetition of early victories . In learning how to make these seasons of spiritual exaltation and conquest productive of permanent good , we must guard against conceptions and acts which , from a misunderstanding of their nature , limit the use of revivals , or introduce into them vitiating influences . We need to understand their philosophy to such an extent as to enable us to seek them rationally , and to employ them in a wise harmony with other instrumentalities . That a revival should not be productive of permanent good seems indeed to be a contradiction in terms , and the supposition is warranted only as the word is used to cover a mixed experience , in which human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to divine action . We proceed , then , to answer the question proposed , by indicating tbe leading truths which require to be kept in mind , and by which our specific judgments and decisions should be shaped . // 1 . lYe must keep steadily in view all that is implied in the divine authorship of revivals of religion . If every truly converted soul is " born of God , " and , through conversion , is introduced into a divine kingdom , whose victories are precisely of this spiritual nature , then a revival is the product of divine forces , and the result of a previous divine plan . It is such an event as a battle in a military campaign ; and , whether it occur in a large city upon the scale of the day of Pentecost , or as a limited movemeut in some obscure village church , it marks the development of the scheme of the great leader . God can not be indifferent to such phenomena , or separate from them . As conquests of his foes , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into them , as a general puts his will into the plan and conduct of a compaign , with its resultant battles and victories . For the Holy Spirit is a person and not a mere influence . He therefore enters into revivals , not as a material force , such as water , or steam , enters into machinery , being let on or shut oW by infillible and inflexible methods , and producing uniform results under uniform appliances ; but He enters into them as sensitive , intelligent , voluntary divine mind acting upon similarily characterized finite minds . There is then scope and demand in revivals for everything which recognizes on our part this divine activity ; for desire and love , for prayer and faith , for encouragement and submission , for joy and humility . The good is to be secured in the spiritual and not in the material kingdom of God . The effect is to be wrought by a conscious and purposed divine influence , in a way which introduces us to that which , as above the realm of mere natural causation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the super-natural , though not ranked in the category of miracles . It will save us from many mistakes in connection with revivals to look this fact always in the face , and to study its many relations . Under its light we shall see that there is ample space for a divine choice and sovereignty in the part which revivals shall have in the religious forces of a given country , community , or church , and in the use to which God shall put given individuals . No absolute outward uniformity can be predicted , even when men imagine that they are arranging a similarity of circumstances . The richest blessing of a revival is never to be found in the unwarranted assumption that it has been the product of a fixed spiritual force in the moral world , // parallel to the law of gravity in the natural world , which can always be counted upon , and used at will , by a happy adjustment of the appropriate machinery . Not so must it be interpreted , would we give due honor to God , and cultivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility , and the deepest reverence . That we may be privileged with other such scenes of power , and may have the richest resultant piety , we must cherish the thought that God , as the Head of the Church , has strictly personal relations to these revival occasions , and in wisdom and love exercises his own judgment as to time , place , men , measures , and results . With humble prayer and faith should we seek his appearing ; with grateful joy and reverence should we hail his presence and accept his gifts : then may we reasonably hope to see the churches used , through revivals , as instruments of divine power . 2. 1F* must as carefully recognize the fact , that revivals , coming in a line of spiritual causation , involve human agency , and therefore varied methods and attendant imperfections . It is not true that divinely induced results imply an exclusively divine operation , uniform methods , or freedom from imperfections . In his moral kingdom God deals with associated minds , and und erthe limitations of their ignorance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not only directly but indirectly . He reveals truth gradually and in many ways ; he introduces human agency ; he institutes organized religion , the Church , the ministry , the sacraments ; he uses the providential incidents of national and individual history ; he works through all appropriate second causes as they exist at the time . This plan involves a variety of methods in producing revivals of religion . These must be adapted to the peculiarities of particular periods , nations , classes in society , and individuals , according to varying degrees of knowledge and culture , changing moods , shifting tendencies to faith or unbelieg and differing temperaments . Facts confirm the conclusions of theory . No little astonishment has been caused by the variety of instrumentalities and methods connected with revivals , and the outward diversity of results . Some have been stumbled at the marked contrast of the phenomena , till they have doubted the reality of a divine power therein , and the wisdom of seeking to renew such scenes . // But variety is characteristic of all God 's works ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consider the variety of authorship , style , and contents in the books of Scripture ; resorted to , plainly , as a means to reach minds in every age and of every degree of development . Similar is the variety of revival agencies and methods , which are to work upon the German , French , Scotch , Irish , English , or the conglomerate American character ; upon the higher , the middle , and the lower classes of society ; upon sanguine and sluggish temperaments ; upon the children of the Church and the neglected masses of the highways and hedges . It is to be expected that , in this work , men will be used according to their personal availability in relation to those to be influenced . A tasteful , scholarly minister , with methods ordered by culture , will usually have his chief power with the educated and refined ; and , in a revival , God will give him a work to do among them . But a coarser-grained man , with less knowledge and ruder speech and action , will ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will find favor with the common people . Very few possess a humanity as broad as that of Jesus , who could reach the extremes of society . Religion does not overlook natural affinities . To gain its full revival power , as a permanent force in the Church , we must so far lay aside our personal likes and dislikes as not to make them a rule for others , or to seek to confine the grace of God to the channels which might be prescribed by our ideas of taste , dignity , and propriety . All fish are not caught with the same hook , or with the same bait , and God must be allowed to select his " fishers of men " according to their skill in winning souls from particular classes , or in special circumstances . Permanent good will result from revivals only as ministers and churches learn to be as wisely comprehensive in their measures as God is or as they grow into the spirit of Paul , in their passion for souls , and are ready to be " made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by all means save some . " Otherwise , suspicion will supplant confidence , alienation will take the place of co-operation , favorable opportunities will be lost , valuable instrum entalities will be thrown away , and important results will be disesteemed. // And of course these varied methods in revivals will involve a multitude of human imperfections-of knowledge , character , and effect-intermingled , painfully and humiliatingly , with the divine influences . Chemical laws hold good in muddy as well as in clear waters , and the sun shines as brightly on heaps of refuse as on fields of grass . The church and ministry are confessedly imperfect as organizations , and in their individual elements . ft is for no one to say with how much of imperfection the Holy Spirit , in his condescension and meekness , may consent to be associated , in reaching all orders of mind and classes of society . IRevivals may have many elements of error , of superstition , of fanaticism , of disorder , of hypocrisy even , and yet be of God , who advances his cause in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitements and revolutions which incidentally call into action the worst as well as the best characters , and which bring forth mixed results of good and evil . To allow wisely for such facts , and to train Christians to a considerate estimate of revival phenomena , is absolutely necessary to permanently happy results . Otherwise there will be an interminable debate and division over men and measures , over doctrines and converts , till religion is scandalized , churches are rent asunder , and revivals become a fear to the saints and a scoffing to the wicked . A chief difficulty arises from the disposition to claim that a revival is a divine endorsement of certain men , doctrines , and measures ; as though God could associate his saving power only with that which is true and good , and as though anything human possessed only those qualities ! A pastor is blamed for an inconsistent life , or for erroneous teaching : his labors are attended with a spiritual blessing , and his friends at once claim that his character and doctrine have received the divine endorsement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secedes and establishes a new organization : in a few months a revival occurs , and God is supposed to have testified in favor of that faction . An institution of learning is established amid much dispute as to its necessity , the wisdom of its management , the reputation of its leading officer , or the soundness of the peculiar principles which it represents and propagates : but the Spirit of God converts some of the students , and immediately it is announced // that God has put his seal of approbation upon the enterprise . A u evangelist goes through the churches , preaching much truth , but subjecting himself to deserved criticism ; and his blinded friends claim each successive revival in connection with his ministrations as God 's answer to the objections brought against him . This attempt to press revivals into improper service , to put upon them an unwarranted interpretation , tends to weaken confidence in their genuineness , and to make the disgusted listeners to such reasoning reject both the conclusion and the work of grace . For , plainly , such an argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , unless we are prepared to prove that God never uses any but perfect characters and instrumentalities , no one is competent to declare the degree of error , or of depravity , which will inevitably prevent an outpouring of the divine Spirit When God converts souls in a revival , it is the direct gospel truth which be uses with saving power , and this he may employ in despite of many undesirable accompaniments , even as in secular history he secures important , beneficent results under every form of civil government , and by the instrumentality of men of the most varied characters . It would make God endorse the most contradictory doctrines and measures , moreover , to apply the test in question ; for sure it is , that he has sent powerful revivals in connection with the efforts of Calvinists and of Arminians , of Baptists and of Pa3do-Baptists , of Prelatists and of Non-Prelatists , of Protestants and of IRomanists , of New Measure and of Old Measure men , of Radicals and of Conservatives , of eminent saints and even of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for our partial vision and limited judgment to decide , whether the true spiritual occasion for the revival , in the Lord 's view , did not rather lie in its relation to his " hidden ones , in the bearing of some quite obscure or unknown fact ; such as the persevering and importunate prayer of even a single devoted saint , some wrestling Jacob of whom neither the church nor the world has much knowledge , or some humble widow whose closet opens directly into heaven . To render revivals a permanent blessing , then , we must study into their phenomena sufficiently to avoid all narrow and party interpretations // of their meaning , and must accept them with their incidental human imperfections . " We have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. " 3. lYe must remember that revivals , however precious in their results , cover but part of the ground of divine action and of the religious lffe and work of the charch . Forgetfulness of this truth has operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unduly , and to cast into the shade important Christian duties and instrumentalities ; thus exciting a measure of suspicion in regard to such experiences in the minds of other good men , and limiting , in a degree , the comprehensiveness of their own labors . The word revival may be taken , indeed , out of its technical meaning , and made as broad as the idea of pro . gress in religion , in all departments and by all instrumentalities ; in which case , no such objection can apply . But , as generally used in this country  --  to denote a powerful religious movement on the minds of the unconverted , attended by an awakened zeal of the church-in their behalf , with the employment , commonly , of special efforts to reach and save them-the idea covers only a part of the work assigned to the Christian by the Master . It relates to external conquest simply ; the advancement of the kingdom . by the subjugation of its pronounced foes . But this , as in the case of a nation , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means exhausts the conception of progress ; which ought to be largely internal , by growth rather than by conquest , by development ratWer than by accretion . If we consider the nature of piety , and the circumstances in which it must live and act , we shall see that its ordinary work must be to maintain holy character in life 's daily routine . There will be its conflict and its victory , its beauty and its power . Indeed , until its reality and vigor have been tested in that sphere , it will have little influence beyond . For there it comes in contact with the mass of men , in practical work , in concrete form , in a manner open to inspection and sure to be judged . Its first work , therefore , is , to build up right character and a pure and impressive life ; to exhibit industry in labor , fidelity in trusts , truthfulness in speech , interest in all departments of // needful action , fortitude in suffering , courage in danger , sympathy with sorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisting temptation , forgiveness of injuries , complacence in moral goodness , high principle in conduct , and an unworldly state of mind in the midst of great worldly activity . Then it starts from vantage ground to urge a Christian life upon the unconverted . Indeed , it will find its desired results already half accomplished , according to the implication of our Saviours words : " Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father , who is in heaven . " This , probably , is the explanation of the fact , that the New Testament so constantly insists upon holy living , and dwells so little upon the methods to be used in laboring for the impenitent . Obviously , then , the church must be largely occupied in , what Paul calls , " maintaining good works . " ( See Titus iii , 8 . ) This includes life in the family , in the varici forms of secular business , in the discharge of duties as a citizen and as a friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to which may be added the maintenance of social and public religious worship in connection with the church , on the Lord 's iDay and at other times . To live industriously , peaceably , benevolently , conscientiously , devoutly , usefully , and joyfully , in the position providentially assigned , must comprehend a large part of Christian duty . If now one looks tu the growth of the church or Christian community , that will be seen to depend greatly on a properly religions nurture of her children in the family , as well as upon individual adult conversions and the aggressive power of what we term revivals ; and we must so employ the latter as not to overshadow the former . When Christianity first started forth , to fulfill the command to " teach all nations " it necessarily operated mostly upon adult minds , and relied upon the outpouring of the Spirit on Jew and Gentile in a manner often resembling that of modern revivals . And this would continac to be a leading instrumentality for outside effort , as the gospel was pi-essed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be true now , in connection with foreign missionary labors , and with efforts to reach the mass of unconverted adults in nominally Christian lands . That Pentecostal // scenes will be renewed , with the most striking results , in the simultaneous conversion of great multitudes , may be gathered not only from the moral necessity of the ease , as we look out upon the mass of ungodliness in the world , and from past scenes in the history of the church , but also from the promise of Scripture that " a natiou shall be born at once , " as it were in a day , in those times when a " little one shall become a thousand , and a small one a strong nation . " But this is outside work , and meanwhile there will be going on the natural growth of the church from within , as its own children are " trained np in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . " At this the church has ever aimed , and with as much success as its measure of wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this meaus of increase have looked the great body of Christians ; some through the ideas associated with infant baptism and a subsequent confirmation , and others apart from those usages . And American Christians , who are accustomed to rely so extensively upon revivals , and to count upon them each winter , as at the season most favorable for special services to this end , must not forget that , in other lands , this instrmnentality has been less used , and that there the growth has been almost wholly through the regular means of grace , the cultivation of family religion , and a church education of the children by catechism and liturgy . There must be , as there ought to be , great power of development in the church on this side . It is the natural method of increase ; it accords , also , with the inspired explanation , through Malachi , of God 's intent in the institution of marriage and of the family ,  --  " that He might seek a godly seed ; " and it produces the most perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adult conversions , and beautifully rounded out into the symmetry of a complete and gradually formed mind and heart . Indeed , there is reason to think , that , in ordinary communities , where the ingatherings from revivals are mostly of youth from twelve to twenty years of age , a large proportion of the so-called " converts " are really persons regenerated in childhood , and awakened by the revival to a new and more intelligent consciousness of the divine life in the soul . The influence of the family and of the Sunday school at least prepared the soil and sowed the seed for the seemingly sudden harvest of the revival . // What is needed , then , in this direction , to make revivals productive of permanent good , is , to recognize their true relation to other Christian experiences , and to other modes of Christian progress toward the final triumph of the Redeemer 's kingdom . Made exclusive in their demand , they falsely turn every other condition of the church into a declension , draw off attention from equally important duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heights of excitement to the inevitable reactionary depths of insensibility or of depression . But no such distorted view of revivals need be cherished . They do not constitute the whole of religious work , hut they belong in the Christian system , and have a place of special honor and power under the dispensation of the Holy Spirit . Doubtless , also , they have their law , in the mind of God , though no one has yet succeeded in definitely stating it , or in bringing them under fixed conditions of time and circumstance . While , as a general rule , spiritual results will be according to the prayerful use of appropriate means , God wishing to encourage prayer and to reward faithful labor , yet Christians are often disappointed in the results of prayer and effort in specific cases ; so that no man can surely predict the range and power of revivals in particular localities . What pastor has not been surprised by a powerful revival in spiritual circumstances seemingly unfavorable ; and again disappointed at its non-arrival when its conditions appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore the old divines have associated them with the sovereignty of God ; but to God , we may well suppose that a sameness of principle appears throughout . They are to be regarded as glorious additions or supplements to the ordinary working of spiritual forces ; in which God seizes upon a conjuncture of facts and favoring occasions to work saving results on a large scale and with great rapidity , exalting the faith of his people and striking terror into the heart of his foes . In the United States , revivals have thus been conspicuously used , at eventful periods , to save the land from prevalent infidelity and worldliness . In the days of Jonathan Edwards , after there had been a wide-spread deadness in religion , accompanied by an invasion of error , the " Great Awakening " was spiritually the salvation of the country . // Again , after the Revolutionary War had left religion in a low condition , and French infidelity had infected large numbers , God used the powerful revivals at the beginning of this century , to give new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second war with Great Britain , the mercantile prosperity and subsequent reverses , twenty years later , and also the financial crash of 1857 , were followed by extensive and powerful revivals . And now , in accordance with the inspired declaration , that " when the enemy shall come in like a flood , the Spirit of the Lord will left up a standard against him , " the praying and believing ones are expecting that the present spread of skepticism will furnish the occasion for mighty outpourings of the Holy Spirit , which shall demonstrate the divine character of the Gospel , and shall convert the very leaders of unbelief into apostles of the faith . They may therefore properly be objects of desire , of prayer , and of effort , on the part of ministers and of churches , while not allowed to interfere with the steady prosecution of ordinary Christian work , and the expectation of a continual success in the conversion of sinners and in the upbuilding of personal character . Indeed , as the special activities of a merchant in his spring and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of the year , so when the excitement and labor of a revival pass , it should be to allow steady play to the regular duties of family , social , and church life ; it being tinderstood , that piety equally inspires both modes of action , and that the converts of a revival need subsequently to be trained to obey the unexciting demands of the details of a daily life that shall be inspired by faith in Christ , and love to God and their neighbor . In this light , that pastor is most wisely a friend of revivals , who follows them most faithfully with the use of the ordinary means of grace , and with a recommendation of piety in its everyday aspects . That church also gives the best evidence of having received permanent good from a revival , which accompanies its zeal for conversions with an equal care for the growth and education of " the babes in Christ , " and for the exhibition by the older members of a proportionate character and a readiness for all forms of usefulness , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus be vorJ . XXXIIL 4 // made to understand , that the revival is religion in only one of its phases , and in one of its forms of power ; and that a church does not necessarily decline in piety when those special scenes pass , but often goes on to greater trials and triumphs of Christian principle , which require daily communion with God and an abiding faith in the perpetual aid of the indwelling Spirit , in order to " overcome the world .
