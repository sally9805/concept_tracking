RURAL ENGLAND . qwq hell to be there , and it stood hard by the wayside , and ever and anon the flame and smoke would come out in such abundance with sparks and hideous noises , and still the flames would be reaching toward me ; also I heard doleful voices and rushings to and fro ; and this frightful sight was seen and these dreadful noises were heard by me for several miles together . Poor Christian went through it on foot ; I had the advantage of him in being in a railway car , which would have helped him much ; but then there would have been no story , and the world would have lost one of the most vivi ( l and stirring descriptions of the terrible and of terror that exists in all literature.1 Of the grievous blasphemies that the pilgrim , so hard bestead , had whispered into his ears , I heard nothing ; but 1 fear that I supplied that deficiency myself , in my heart at least , at the sight of such dark desolation deliberately wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright with beauty and glad with meadows and trees and fields of corn . It is impossible not to see that railways and mills and forges and towns are gradually , and not very slowly , destroying rural England . Railways , however , are not so barely hideous there as they are in the United States . All that can be done is done to soften and mitigate their harsh unloveliness . They are carried over the roads or under them ; and this precaution against dan* , er does much to preserve beauty and diminish unsightliness . The glimpses of country roads and village streets , undisturbed by the passing train , that are caught from the windows of railway carriages are charmin in themselves , and are witnesses of the care that is taken there that those who wish " rapid transit " shall not have it at the cost of the property , the business , the safety , the comfort , or even the pleasure of the neighborhoods through which it suits their convenience or their interest to hasten . The maxim " Sic utere tuo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you injure not that which 1 I need not tell the reader of Pilgrim 's Progress that in the passage above I have borrowed Bunyan 's phraseology . Rural England . August , is another 's ) seems to he a guiding one in the administration of British affairs - at home . Indeed , as compared with the United States , and with many other countries , England may be defined as the country in which every man has rights which every other man is bound to respect . The rights are not always the same rights , but they may always be enforced even by the humblest and poorest , and they are usually asserted and maintained . In England there is both private independence and public spirit , and both have at their back the two great powers of the land , - the law and public opinion . There are great lords and great corporations in England ; but neither can do a wrong to the poorest laborer , much less to a great body of people , with impunity , or lawfully take a penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts , which are incorruptible , and it is always availed of . If any one should by chance suppose that I have in mind the elevated railways , existing and proposed in New York , he is quite right in his supposition . English railways are banked and sodded , and , if need be , walled , so that as you travel over them it does not seem as if the country had been rudely torn in twain and left at ragged ends for your passage . Even the stations are made sightly , and some of them are very pleasant to the eye . Many of them have little gardens on either side which are cultivated by the station-master 's family ; and in not a few places I observed that these gardens , containing vegetables and flowers and shrubs and even small trees , were extended many rods either way from the station-house . Telegraph poles , such as those which traverse our roads and even the streets of our cities , looking like posts and lines on which Brobdingnag washerwomen might dry the petticoats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kept out of sight as much as possible ; all unpleasant sounds are suppressed as much as possible . In the cities manufacturers are not allowed to fill the air four times a day with the shrieks of steam-whistles , simply because it is convenient for them to mark their // hours of work by turning a steam-cock . They are not permitted to save trouble and a little money by annoying all others who are within hearing . Indeed , as I have mentioned before , even the railway whistle is rarely heard , and when heard it is a very mild and inoffensive creature compared with that which shrieks and howls over the plains and in the cities of our favored country . For generations England has been a manufacturing country , and the manufacturing interest is now the most powerful influence in its affairs ; but there even manufacturers are obliged to respect the minor rights and little comforts of other people . It might be so with us if in our so-called " land of liberty " we had personal independence and public spirit . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be that it is the liberty of every man , and especially the liberty of any combination of rich men , to get gain at the cost of other people . But no care or contrivance can make railways and steam - mills and forges other than an offense to all the senses , or cause them to harmonize with a human environment . If we will have what they give us , we must yet accept them as necessary evils . Therefore it is that , there being so many of them in so small a country , they are destroying rural England . By means of the first , and chiefly because of the others , the great towns encroach upon the country . This is true of all the great towns , but it is especially true of London . London not only grows monstrously itself , but like some germs of corruption , it throws out prehensile feelers which draw other objects to it , to be changed into its own likeness , and made in fact part of itself . London town already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , changing every place to London as it goes , that it seems as if in a not very remote future it will meet the off-shoots thrown out by other great towns , that it will absorb and assimilate them , and that England will become one great London , an island city of trade and manufacture and art , the political and commercial metropolis of a peerless empire , yet dependent for its food and its rural recreation upon other countries , which its imperial people will use as their grain fields and as their grazing and hunting grounds . " Moabismy wash-pot ; over Edom will I cast out my shoe . " Enough of rural England , however , still remains to make it the most beautiful country in the *world to those who love to see nature humanized , and her spontaneous beauties molded by the hand of man and blended with his work . They who like rugged roads better than green meadows and cultivated slopes , or palms better than oaks and elms and beeches , or who like to live by rivers upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauties of nature in other climes . They to whom the blending of castle and cottage and spire with forest and field brings no enhancement of the beauties of unmitigated nature may find the latter elsewhere , or have it " dry shod at home . " But the lover of humanized nature may find it in England in a perfection which imagination can hardly surpass . If the climate of England tempts a man into the open air more than that of any other country , the beauty which rural England spreads before his eyes more than doubles the temptation . I expected much ; but although I am a man and did not come from Sheba , I was obliged to borrow the words of the woman who did , and say that the half had not been told me . When Wordsworth wrote - " One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man , Of moral evil , and of good , Than all the sages can , " it was an English landscape that he had in his mind 's eye . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any pursuit or taste tempts into communion with nature , even in our raw , rude country , can fail to apprehend and feel , although he may not quite comprehend , what Wordsworth means by his somewhat extravagant utterance ; but in England its truth comes home to him with tenfold strength . Nature there is informed with humanity ; there the landscape , without being artificial , has been 1879. 243 // redeemed from savagery . And this has been done not with purpose , but simply by man 's taking nature to himself , to love her and to cherish . It is remarkable that a people so inferior in the arts of design should have been able so to treat nature that art may look to the result as a model , almost as a realized ideal . The beauty of English scenery is a setoff against many acres of painted canvas of which other peoples boast . In my country walks I was intereste ( I not only in the beauty of rural England , which in greater or less degree never failed to delight my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in my endeavors to observe them , and in my way to see places and buildings of note , that I found the former . I wished to know something by personal contact of the English country folk , the farmers and the peasants ; and I was able to do so . I found them accessible , good-natured , and truly hospitable . A fine afternoon tempted me to a long walk in the country around Canterbury , and as the twilight came on I saw a little cottage in the midst of a great sprout-field . The approach to it from the road was by a narrow path . In this I found a poor man , an agricultural laborer , standing by a plow which he was untacklin* , , and by him stood his little child , ragged and barefooted . The man face was sad , and his child was sad , too , and silent . He answered my greeting civilly , but so heavily and with such manifest reserve that I did not stop and speak with him , as was my custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that it seemed to show how little change had been made in men of his condition by the lapses of centuries . For it brought up at once to me that passage in Piers Plowman 's Creed , which even in my boyhood , and before I had pondered the sorrowful problem of life , had moved me to tears , in which the writer tells of his meeting with the poor man who hung upon the plow , whose hood was full of holes so that his hair came out , and whose toes looked out of his clouted shoes as he wallowed in the fen almost to his ankle ; whose wife was with him using the goad , barefooted on the bare ice that the blood followed ; and their children were there - " And al they songen o song That sorwe was to heren They crieden alle o cry , A careful * And this wretched man , when he sees Piers Plowman weeping , stills his children , lets the plow stand , asks him why he grieves , and says that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God hath sent . " Go we , leeve brother . " Passing the poor man and his child , I went to the cottage door , which proved not to be his . It was half open , and at the sound of my step a woman appeared . She was homely of feature , but pleasant of look , healthy seeming , and comfortably clad . She bade me " Good even , " which I returned , and asked if she could give me a glass of water , saying that I had had a long walk , and that there was no ale-house near . This I did because I had been told that the peasants were very shy of the curious , and resented sullenly the mere intrusion of their superiors . She answered , cheerily , " Deed I can , sir , and I will . But will ye walk in , sir , an ' sit down . We re just havin ' supper . " This was just what I wanted , and more than I had hoped for , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturb them . " Deed an ' ye wo n't , sir ; an ' . if ye d sit with us an ' take a cup o ' tea , ye d be kindly welcome . " Then , turning to her husband , who sat munching his supper in stolid but not ill-natured silence , - the usual mood of the inferior man animal here when not under excitement , - she said , " Mate , the gentleman wants a glass of water ; step out and draw him some fresh . " He obeyed in silence ; and while he was out she said , " We ye good water here , sir ; sweet an ' soft , an ' it comes cool from the well . " The water when it came was worthy of her praise , and was one of but two draughts of sweet , soft water that I had in England . For there all over the country ( as I found it ) the water is hard ; it does not adapt itself to your thirsty throat ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but forms a patchy scum with eyes , that floats about and looks at you . // I accepted the invitation to sit with them at table , and was pleased , and , after what I had heard and read of the hard lot of the famished English farmlaborer , surprised at the comfort of their meal . The bread was * , ood , better than that which is sold by most bakers in New York ; and they had butter ( good also ) , cheese , and tea , which although not very good was still tea , and quite *lrinkable when concocted with milk and white sugar , both which they had of good quality . They had also a dish of cabbage and potatoes , of which I did not eat . As I took my cup of tea and ate my slice of bread and butter , I talked with them , and asked questions about their life . I say with them , but it was the woman who did all the talking , the man sitting silent , only uttering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealed to him : " Mate , how is that ? " or , " Mate , is n't that so ? " I liked her use of " mate " instead of that unpleasant word " husband . " The sum of my observation and information at this visit was as follows . The cottage was of three rooms , entered , after the first , in which we sat , one from the other . These rooms were about ten feet square , and the walls , which were of rough stone plastered , were about seven feet high . The rooms were ceiled , and the roof was thatched . For this cottage they paid half a crown ( sixty-three cents ) a week . The man earned twenty shillings a week , and the woman got washing and odd jobs to do . They were cheerful , and seemed to think themselves very comfortable . They complained of the odd sixpence in the rent ( half a crown is two and sixpence ) , and thought that they ought to have the cottage for two shillings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ground for a vegetable garden , the woman said they " would be made ; " but of the latter there was no hope . To my surprise , I found wherever I went among the peasants this absolute lack of a square foot of ground on which to grow a radish . What is the cause of the universal , or at least the general , unwillingness to let these poor people have the use of a few square yards of land beside their cottages I did not learn , and can not conjecture . It can not be the value of the land , for at least as much as they could use is thrown out of cultivation by the very presence of the cottage . I afterwards found that this cottage and the fare and fortune of its inmates were ? tirly representative of the housing and living of the peasants in such parts of England as I visited ; but I was not in the western counties , where , I believe , the peasants fare most hardly . This couple had no children , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a droop in her voice that showed that she had ceased to hope for one . Poor *reatare ! if her natural longing had been satisfied perhaps there would have been less comfort in her cottage and less cheerfulness in her face . The landlord of the cottager is not , or is rarely , the squire or the lord of the manor . his landlord is the farmer ; and my observation and inquiry led me to the opinion that the farmers as a class are disposed to be very hard upon the farm laborers . It is they who refuse them little garden allotments ; it is they who exact rents for miserable hovels which are entirely out of proportion to their value , and to the rent of the groun ( l on which they stan ( l . It is the English farmer who is most strongly opposed to household suffrage in the rurM districts . I do not mean to say that upon the latter point he is in error , or to express any opinion in regard to the subject ; I merely remark upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English farmer is an aristocrat . He is willing to take his place in a system of caste , and to look up , if he may also look down . He will touch his hat to the squire , and think it quite right that people should be respectful to their superiors ; and he is confirmed in this opinion , or rather this feeling , when lodge touches his hat to him . To give Hodge a vote would be to take away one of the marks of his inferior condition , and so to level him up , in every respect except money , to the position of his employer . With my limited opportunities for observation , it would not become me to pronounce 1879. 245 // upon the social and political feelings of whole classes in England ; but I believe the farmers to be the most conservative body in the kingdom , the least disposed to change , and to be the main-stay of the tory party . The English farmer must be a man of some money capital . It is common for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that is from five thousand to twenty-five thousand dollars ) , and some farmers are worth much more than that . As none of his money is invested in the land which he tills , he has it as working capital , as an improvement fund , and as a reserve . This gives him the position and the importance of a capitalist , and brings him a certain consideration even from the great landholders ; but it does not make him independent , or , I should say , even aspirin* , , with extremely rare exceptions . If crops are good , if his wife and his sons and daughters are healthy and do his will , and if the squire is " haffable " when they meet , he is content ; and who shall say that he does not wisely ? So long as his rent is paid with fair punctuality and his family live decent lives , he may be sure of not being disturbed ; and indeed he is not uncommonly living in the same house in which his father and his grandfather lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old furrows . And if he can not pay his rent , his landlord , the son or the grandson of theirs , would be an exceptional En*lish squire if he were not ready to do anything in reason to make it easy for him in the present , and to help him in the future . But however prosperous , he never dreams of such a thing as setting up for a gentleman ; nor does he seek to acquire the tastes or the habits of one , although he may be better able to afford them than many of those who have them by birth and breeding . The truth is , they would not suit him ; to be obliged to live like a gentleman would be to him a daily affliction . He sometimes hunts a little ; hut hunting is a rough , out-o ' - doors amusement , which may be enjoyed to the full by the dullest and coarsest of human creatures , as well as by their Rural England . August , superiors in intellect and refinement . But here the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gentry . He reads little , and thinks less . He has his place in the social scale , and with that he is content . English cottages and farm-houses are generally picturesque objects in a landscape , their forms and colors being almost always pleasing in themselves and harmonious with their surroundings . And the cottages within doors , although they may be very rude and comfortless , have a character which is not to be found in houses of a corresponding or of a much higher class in the United States . Our square , sharp-edged houses , built yesterday , directly on the road-side , of clapboards and shin*les , and painted white or lead color , are very unsightly objects in themselves , and compared with English cottages of stone or brick , or beams and plaster , with their pitched roofs , tiled or thatched , their softened outlines and rich color , are very much inferior . But in real comfort and in healthiness I am inclined to think that our flimsy wooden houses are superior . For they are dry and warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes through thatch , or soaks and rots it , and their clapboard sides do not become reservoirs of cold dampness . Rheumatism is not so common among those who live in them as it is among the English rustic folk . In an English village , or along an English country road , you see more old men leaning upon sticks , or sunning themselves as they sit crooked over by their doors , than you do in the farming districts of New England and the Middle States . Picturesque , too , as the English farmhouse is at a distance , and picturesque as it often is within , - made so by 01 ( 1 brown beams and red brick and mellowtinted stone left in sight , and old brown tables and settles that are softened and enriched by the smoke and the use of generations , - when seen close by , it generally bears without , as it does within , the mark of the inferior condition and habits of its occupants . Sight and // smell are offended by objects that are in unnecessary nearness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants are anything more than tillers of the ground , and that when work is done they put it and its belongings out of sight and out of mind , an ( l change their occupation with their clothes . The family live generally in the kitchen , although there is a parlor , or keeping room , which is used on high days and holidays , and sometimes on other days in the evening . I have in mind one in which I was , and which might be taken as a t.ype of its class . The occupant paid two hundred and thirty pounds a year for his farm , quite equal to fifteen hundred dollars here . The kitchen , where I found the family , was paved with large red brick , which is the common flooring of farm-house kitchens . Damp as it must be , it is preferred . Landlords told me that they had offered to put down plank floors , but that the offer had been declined . It might be reasonably supposed that the women would gladly change the bricks for wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they cling to them . Certainly the advantage in appearance is largely on the side of the old flooring . I remember another farmhouse kitchen in which I drank buttermilk , which with its unceiled beams , its old oak window casings and settles , its gigantic chimney-piece of the same , its soft , sombre plaster , its red brick floor , and rows of red flower-pots standing behind the lattice in the deep window , presented one of the richest and most charming combinations of color that I ever saw . And it was a notably homelike-looking place , with individual traits and a physiognomy of its own , to which one might become attached ; being in this respect far superior to the possibly more comfortable , but utterly blank and characterless rooms corresponding to it in our country . In the other farm-house I was hospitably offered cider , for which the neighborhood had reputation , and was invited into the keeping room to drink it . Compared with Newark cider , or any of our cider of like grade , it was a dull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity to chat and look about me . In the former way , however , I effected little . It was difficult to extract anything more than monosyllables from my entertainer . Indeed , I found the farmers the most taciturn class in England ; and Imay say that they were the only people that I met there who as a whole were silent and reserved . The peasantry I found very ready to talk , as I did also the higher classes ; but the farmer sat mumchance . The cause of this of course I do not know , but it occurred to inc that it might be his position . He knows little more than the peasant , and can talk but little better ; and yet he has a consciousness of superiority which makes him , in the presence of his betters , ashamed of his great mental inequality with them , and therefore he is silent . Certainly , the furnishing of this parlor showed the barest possible condition of mind in those for whom it was prepared . There was a heavy old sideboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood some old decanters and glasses , heavily cut and very ugly ; upon the walls were three or four colored wood-cuts of the cheapest kind , ugly also ; on the table was a large Bible and an almanac , or some book of the sort ; and these , with the chairs , one of which was a rocker , completed the furnishing of the room , compared with which the kitchen was cheerful and attractive . The holder of such a farm as this in New England or the Middle States would have taken me into another sort of room , would have received me more on a footing of equality , and would have had more to say in reply to my inquiries . Whether he would have been a better farmer I doubt ; whether be would have been a more respectable man , or even a happier , I shall not pretend to decide . An English village is not at all like one in New England ; at least I saw none such , and I walked through scores of them , north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide street , with its great elms and maples , on which are the churches and meeting-houses , the houses Rural England . // of the principal farmers , of the clergyman , the lawyer , and the physician , as well as of the minor people , an English village shows a knot of little brick , or stone , or antique beam and plaster houses , very close together , and mostly without grass or trees of any kind . There is an ale-house , which has for its sign and name the head or body of some wild beast of impossible color , or the arms of the nearest nobleman or gentleman , a shop or two , and in the middle , the town pump . These villages generally belong bodily to the bearer of the arms aforesaid , and in some cases they are not more than half a mile apart . It impressed me strangely when a gentleman who was driving me through one of these said , as we passed a group of houses , from one of which a coat of arms hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * " Then , ' ' Ireplied , " that one we drove through last it was about fifteen minutes before was yours . " Yes , " he said , with a little smile at my question . He had said nothing of it as we passed through . One of the remarkable conditions of rural England is this nearness to each other of places regarded as distinct . I asked a little fellow in Essex if he was born in the village in which we were . " On noa ! " he answered with surprise , almost with resentment . " I were born in - ( I forget the name ) . " And where is- ? " " Yon , " he said , pointing to a nest of half a dozen little houses , about as far off as the width of Boston Common . Every place , every clump of wood , every little knoll , every hollow , has a name by which it is known to the whole neighborhood . Even the shaws , which are hollows filled with a growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated village through which I walked was Speke , in Lancashire . Its utter insignificance may be gathered from the fact that it contained no shop , and not even an ale-house . The absence of this customary place of refreshment ( where you may be pretty sure of good beer and good bread and cheese , if not of a good chop ) caused me , after I had walked out a few miles into the country around , to look about me for luncheon . Two pretty little cottages at the end of a short lane attracted my attention , and I resolved to try them . As I walked up the lane I passed three boys playing , whose names , oddly enough , were Tom , Dick , and Harry . After a few words , I proposed that each of them should accept a penny . The proposition was received in silence , but with a delight manifested by flushed cheeks and brightened eyes , and , when the pennies had been bestowed , by a mutual exhibition of them , accompanied by that twist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which is of no race or people ; or if it be peculiar to Anglo-Saxons , then all boys of English blood may pity the French and German and other boys who have it not . The like sum , however , would have elicited no such signs of pleasure from " American " boys . But in England a penny is a possession to a child , of whatever rank . One day a little lady , some six or seven years old , who was sitting on my knee , while her younger sister sat with mamma , hard by , said to me with an amusing air of importance , " I had a penny yesterday , "  --  the room in which she made this announcement was hung with antique tapestry that was given to one of her ancestors by a king , - " and I had it , " she went on , " for reading . " Whereupon her little ladyship opposite spoke up , saying , " And I had a penny , too ; and I had it for not reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry peal of laughter from mamma and me that greatly disconcerted the little ( lamsel . I thought at the time how much better this restriction as to money was than that lavish use of it to which American children are accustomed . A young lady whom I knew well was at a famous school on the continent of Europe , where she had not a few titled school-mates . Certain exercises being required which were mere manual drudgery , and a certain orderly arrangement of the toilette table , et cetera , my fair friend , being somewhat lazily disposed , was able by her excess of pocket money over that of her noble companions to have her exercise copied by a princess , and her toilette table kept in order by a // countess . As to which I think that as to the end , the discipline of the noble young ladies was of better omen than that of the merchant 's daughter . But I am long on my way to the cottages , where indeed I found little of peculiar interest , not even the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one which I entered seemed to have but two rooms , hut it may have had three . That one at the door of which I found myself was , as usual , the kitchen and living room . The walls were plastered ; the beams and the thatch showed ; the floor was paved with flat stones , which were much broken in places , so as to show the ground beneath . This floor must have " heaved , " to use the word by which the peasants express the striking up of the wet ground and the dampness in these floors . Nearly opposite the door was a large dresser , on which was a not copious array of crockery . A fire-place as large as that in the kitchen of an old - fashioned New England farm-house stood out into the room . Notwithstanding the condition which I have described , the aspect of the place was cheerful , much more cheerful than that of many " best parlors " in which I have been . Perhaps this cheerfulness was somewhat owing to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a mellow light and a soft air entered the door with me : perhaps , also , to the fact that one of three women whom I found seated before the chimney ( from habit , for there was no fire ) was a handsome mother , who was suckling her child , which sweet sight , with charming freedom from ' shame , perhaps from consciousness of beauty , she did not hesitate to allow me to enjoy . But no small part of the attraction of the room was a flowering vine which climbed up the cottage wall and strayed in through the open lattice . And there , too , in this humble habitation , stood a row of pots with flowers , common flowers , the grandest of them a geranium ; but all were well cared for and nearly all were blooming . Nothing struck me more forcibly as peculiar to the lower classes in England , or won me more in their favor , than this love of flowers . It is universal . Go where I would , in the abode of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country towns , where the houses were hovels grimier and gloomier than any cottage I entered , I saw flowers . Sometimes it was a single flower that could have cost nothing , set in an old broken tea-pot or other shard of earthenware ; but it was there , and it was put in the window , and plainly was prized and tended . The beautiful feeling of which this is a manifestation seems to be almost lost to us . For it has absolutely nothing in common with that fashion of cutting flowers off by the bead an ( l making them up into huge , artificial masses for decorative purposes at feasts and at funerals , which has prevailed among us for in any years . That fashion , on the contrary , is actually at war with this feeling ; for it destroys the very beauty which the flower lover so much prizes ; it does away with the character of the flower , which is only to be seen as it stands upon its stem and amid its leaves ; and it ( leprives the flower nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although of course it has no moral significance , seems to me a very charming trait in the character of English women . After giving the woman with the child good-day , I asked her ( for she plainly was at home ) if she could give me some bread and milk , mentioning as my excuse that even if I walked back to the village it had no public house . She replied pleasantly , " No offense , sir , but I m sorry I ca n't give you any milk ; we ye no cow. ** Whereupon there was a consultation between her and the two old crones , who sat with their chins between their hands and their elbows on their knees . One cottage and another in the neighborhood was sug* ested , but in vain ; not one had a cow . And this , by the way , I found very general . If the cottager has a pig he does well ; the possession of a cow is a mark of somewhat high grade in agricultural society . At last the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to reach him or her . I had merely to go back through the lane , cross 1879. 249 // the road , and take the next by-road , and follow it about a mile . On my way thither I passed a man doing work that we hear of sometimes , but never see , - breaking stones on the highway . He was an old man , and he sat flat upon the road , with a heap of small square stones between his legs , at which he pegged away with a hammer having a small head and a long handle . I stopped and talked with him . He had on . a pair of wire goggles to protect his eyes from the splinters of the stone . They stood well out from his face , and as he lifted his head to answer my greeting he had the look of a large , benevolent lobster set upon end in the road-way . He was not stolid , but talked intelligently , speaking very good English , and seemed cheerful and contented . His wage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one dependent upon him he was quite at his ease . That at his age , he being certainly sixty-five years old , he should sit all day upon a damp road-way and smite small stones into smaller pieces he seemed to take as the ordinary and inevitable course of things . I learned from him that the wages paid in that neighborhood were , for plowing twenty shillings a week , for harvesting twenty shillings , for digging and piece work eighteen shillings . On my telling him that he would get nineteen shillings that week , and proving it to him , he was very grateful . 1 turned away and resumed my walk and he his hammering . I soon found the house to which I had been sent , and the mistress was at home ; and a very comfortable body she was to have about a house , ample , healthy , and , without being at all pretty , not uncomely , and very cheerful . I made a hungry man 's request . Her reply was prompt and cheery . Indeed I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I would walk in and sit . This I did at once , taking a seat by a small table by the kitchen fire ( for it was the kitchen ) ; and while she went off on her Eve 's business , just as if I had been an archangel , I looked about me . All that I saw was very homely ; but comfort and plenty were manifest on every side , with neatness and order . I got a glimpse of the living room through a half-open door , and it was much more attractive than what I saw in the south of England . Indeed , the farm-houses and even the cottages in Lancashire seemed to me better in every respect than those in the southern and eastern shires . My hostess soon returned , and set a pitcher of milk ( she would have called it a jug , and so would her betters , but it was a pitcher ) , a loaf of bread , and a big wedge of cheese before me , and bade me welcome . I fell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sprinkle clothes that lay in a large buck-basket . As I ate and she worked we chatted ; and I learned that her husband was a small farmer , paying for twenty acres of land , this nice stone house , with a stable and barn , twenty pounds a year , if I remember aright . Her goodman was kind to her ( I saw plainly that she loved him ) ; they were forehanded folk ; and she was as happy as the queen , God bless her majesty , " - with a little courtesy . I slackened the working of my jaws , and stopped , when she pressed me to my food , begging me to eat the whole , for there was plenty more . But although I had not eaten for six hours , and had walked many miles , I was quite inadequate to what she proposed , which gave me an astonishing notion of her goodman 's performances at table . Hearty thanks and a shilling at parting were pleasantly received as full payment , and I went on my now aimless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the richness of which and the fine farming I was strongly impressed . In the newly plowed fields the ground turned up a dark , rich loam , and the furrows across a twelve-acre field were drawn as straight as if they had been ruled . I had observed this highly finished plowing elsewhere in England . In some fields , for a reason that I know not , there was an alternation of four or five furrows with an unplowed green space of about the same width all across the field . The lines were drawn so accurately and the sides of the unplowed spaces were so exactly parallel that the effect was as if a gigantic piece of green music-paper had // been spread upon the earth . The farmhouses and their out-buildings were substantial , comfortable , and in good repair , and I passed some well-trimmed hedges that were quite ten feet high . But as I walked I was conscious of a difference between this country and that in the middle and southern shires from which I had just come . At first I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l ) ut all at once it came upon me , - the land was level and there were no trees . As far as I could see , all around me , the land lay fiat , or in very gentle undulation , and there was scarcely a tree in sight . The only green was that of the fields and the hed es ; and the latter were confined to the grounds just around the houses . This absence of trees and scarcity of hedges deprived the landscape of what we regard as its peculiarly English traits . But the notion that the hedge is the universal fence in England is erroneous . Even in the south , where hedges are most common , post and rail fences are even more common ; for the hedge is used chiefly on the road-line , and to mark the more important divisions of property . Elsewhere , post and rail fences and palin s are frequently found . The hedges that line the roads are generally not more than three feet and a half high , and are not thick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through them . Near houses , especially in suburban places , brick walls are common ; and I observed in these a fact which seenied significant . In most cases I saw that the walls in such places had been raised by an addition of some three feet . The upper courses of bricks were plainly discernible to be of a make different from that of the original wall , and the joint and the newer mortar could easily be detected . This seemed to show unmistakably an incre*tse in the reeling of reserve , and perhaps in the necessity for it . The walls that would sufficiently exclude the public a hundred years and more ago were found insufficient , and some fifty years ago ( for even the top courses were old and well set and mossy ) the barriers were made higher , - high enough to be screens against all passing eyes . Another change seemed to me to be witnessed by the fields all over the country . I observed not uncommonly trees standing in lines in fields or meadows , but chiefly in the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement was hardly apparent , but with a little trouble they might be sighted in line . Now such an arrangement of trees in an open field is almost certain evidence that the line in which they stand was once that of a fence of some kind ; and these trees therefore bore witness to the increase of the size of fields in England in late years , - a natural accompaniment of an increase in the size of farms and buildings generally . The Lancashire fields past which I now was walking were free from these trees and from hedges . I can not but believe that they had been removed for purposes of agricultural thrift ; for trees in fields and hedges between them are greedy devourers of the nourishment that is needed for the crops . I found a plowman sitting on a rail fence , but he could tell me nothing about this , although he seemed to be a sensible fellow . " The land was as he had allus knowed it . " He gave me the same information as to wages that I received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land without stint . I found all the Lancashire country folk proud of their land , and with good reason . My road soon became very lonely . I had not met one human creature walking since I ate my luncheon ; but now no human habitation was in sight . The road narrowed and wound about , following the course of a slu*gish little stream , which , with alders and ragged bushes stooping over it , was always at my right hand , and began to be offensive to me . What business had it there , stealing along in noiseless shadow ? It was neither beautiful nor useful , but a mere ditch of running water . I began to hate it . The sun was going down , darkened by heavy dun clouds , casting a gloom upon the landscape . As I walked on I thought , Why should not some of these people that I have seen this afternoon , that plowman on the fence , for instance , murder me and throw me into that hateful 1879. 251 // stream ? The few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be ample temptation , and if any one or two of them should do it , they would quite surely escape detection . For I should not be missed . The friend that I left in Liverpool , even if I did not return within a day or two , would merely suppose that I was off on some traveler 's expedition , and would await letters for a week or a fortnight , may be , before making any inquiry . And if inquiry were made , I might possibly be traced to the farmhouse where I took my luncheon , but no farther ; for in all this distance of some miles I have not seen man , woman , or child . Such things are often done in England , and this is just the time and place and occasion . The ideas of time and place suddenly suggested to me that to be back in Liverpool that evening I must be at the railway station at a cer tam hour , and I was miles away from it . I looked at my watch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to make the distance . I turned , and set off at a swinging gait that I knew I could keep up for half a ( lay . As I went , the gloom vanished from my soul ; my quickened pace and my settled purpose almost changed the face of nature to me , and made even the sluggish stream not quite hateful . As I passed the great field where I had left my murdering plowman on the fence , I saw him whistling behind his plow , half a furrow 's length off . At the farm-house , my comely hostess looked out the door and gave inc a smiling , cheery " Good-even , sir . " Just as I reached the station I heard the little chirp of the steam-whistle on the coming train , and before nine o'clock I was in Liverpool . Richard Grant White .
