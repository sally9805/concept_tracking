// Art . February , ART . THE readers of Mr. Eastlake 's handsome and pleasantly written book on " Household Taste " must - some of them at least - have shared with us the feeling that the pleasure it gives would have been more complete if , after having been stirred up to enthusiasm over chairs and tables , side-boards and bookcases , and made zealously in earnest to learn the whole duty of man in the house-furnishing way , and to do it , we could have found a place where the things we ought to have could be bought for money . But the people with ideals do , by dint of everlasting harping on their favorite topics , get other people interested , worked up to a white heat of desire , and of consequent effort to get their desire satisfied ; out of which ferment comes , in every case , some tangible improvement , some approach , if it be no more , to the sought-for perfection . Thus , since Pugin in England began to laugh and scold at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here at home , tried to light a little fire of enthusiasm for more poetical and individual home surroundings , to the present times , when Mr. Eastlake , with more knowledge than Downing and more practical sense than Pugin , comes to us with his helpful hints as to what to do and what to avoid , if we would make our houses beautiful , there have been constant efforts making to supply the demand , all the time growing , for prettier and more sensible furniture , and for household utensils that should please and not vex the eye . It would be long if we were to catalogue in detail all the improvements the cheap wall-papers with designs as good as those of the dear ones , - a work Pugin started , since taken up by several hands , notably by Owen Jones , who has lately made some first-rate designs and had them carried out ; the glass and crystal of to-day , much of it , especially the French crystal , being better than has been made for a hundred years back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not yet quite out of the imitative stage , but fast learning to think for itself , and even now pleasanter to look at than the best to be had twenty years ago ; stuffs of all sorts for furniture-coverings and curtains , oftener with good designs than bad ; and so forth and so on , improvement being evident everywhere but in furniture , properly so called . Here the world has never been quite so badly off , so at its wit 's end , as it is to-day . Yet there is good furniture to be had to-day , and of to-day 's make , too , if we only knew where to go for it . And this is the case with many things beside furniture . One principal reason why we see so much bad , or , at best , indifferent , uninteresting furnishing is , that the art of getting good things together is so long , and time so short and so taken up with more serious things . If only somebody would bring the good things together into one place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how these fine theories of Pugin , Eastlake , Downing , Walter Smith , look , put into practice That is what the young couples who have houses to furnish , and middle-age couples who have houses to refurnish , are anxiously asking for this long while . And , at last , we have a scheme fairly set on foot for giving us what we want . " The Household-Art Company " - a modest association of a few men of taste and energy , whose business it will be to bag all household gears of a picturesque nature that may be found flying - has settled itself comfortably down into pleasant quarters in Boston , and offers the public the fruit of its second year 's gleaning of England and the Continent . The collection of objects is not an ambitious one , and whoever has travelled much , and seen the great brica-brac shops of London and Paris , with the workshops of the Salviatis and Decks , the Collinets and Castellanis , may easily sniff at the contents of these unpretending , pretty parlors . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the beginning ; the undertaking is an experiment , and if it succeeds , the measures have been taken to extend operations in many directions . If people like , or can be taught to like , the pretty things , the quaint things , the artistic things , that are already here , there are plenty of the same sort where these came from , and better and better , and the supply can be made equal to the demand . And how can people , - young folks with fresh eyes and taste as yet unspoiled by fashion , or older people , well rid of fashion , and with expe // Ar ! . rience of what there as in the world of truly beautiful , - how can either of these sets not like instinctively , or be easily taught to like , the greater number of the things the Household-Art Company has to show them ? Last year , when the company 's ship came home , it brought great store of the beautiful English furniture of the last century , and the eagerness with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to more coming this year ; but Holland was the field chosen to be scoured by the last foraging party , Holland and Friesland ; and we , for our part , find Holland as much to our taste as the England of 76 . These Holland cabinets , covered with surface carving , and ample closet above and below , or a single closet supported on pillars which rest on a platform raised a few inches above the floor , are , practically , very convenient things in a house , beside furnishing a room well , standing out boldly from the wall , and filling the eye with their solidly picturesque proportions . We never saw two of them exactly alike , and the usual variety obtains in the specimens in the company 's rooms . Another strong point in the collection this year is the pottery , Majolica , Delif , Chinese , and Japanese , all being represented , not , indeed , by many splendid , or even by any very remarkable specimens , but by a large number of good pieces , some old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily compassed by moderate purses . Among these specimens are many pieces of the material called Flanders gray ware , clever copies of the real old gr ? s de F/andre , and certainly very attractive substitutes for the common pitcher of the crockery-shops , which cost more and are not so strong . There is also a small but well-chosen collection of old p-Ar de F/andre , and two or three complete tea - sets of old Worcester ware which ought to have magic enough in them to bring back the very ghosts of our grandmothers , if once the fragrant Hyson should be poured from these tiny teapots and circulate through these bits of cups . But old Worcester is getting as rare as real grandmothers , and a man is lucky who owns either of these precious products of art and nature working in harmony . We would like to call attention also to the good stock of tiles imported by this company . They are not all from one manufactory , but represent several works , and offer us some choice , where , hitherto , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ex 245 cellent one , it is true , and well deserving its name , but - we are glad to see what other people can do ! Tiles are not half as much used as they might be ; they are always decorative , and can take a variety of expressions , cheerful as a rose-and-rosebud paper , grave and respectable as Spanish leather , picturesque as tapestry , neat as a check apron ; and then they last forever , and can be kept as clean as a dinner-plate . Among these tiles are two sets of the old Wedgewood pla* , ues , to our thinking as satisfyingly lovely as anything in modern . earthen-ware , designed to serve as panels in mantel-pieces . Let these be set into a well-designed mantel-piece made of oak , or maple , or mahogany , that out-of-fashion but most beautiful of all woods , and what marble mantel of to-day 's make could compare with it ? These brass sconces , too , - here is another old fashion come back again , and a pretty , cheap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so picturesque with a bit of Christmasgreen about it as one of these same sconces of beaten work ( to English the technical phrase repousse9 , with the soft shimmer of the candles reflected in broken light from its surface ? These sconces are of modern make , the old ones are becoming scarce , and are much sought for , much affected in Paris by artists , and thought pretty in an antechamber , with a bit of tapestry , if one can get it , on the wall . And , speaking of tapestry , here are a half-dozen remarkably fine pieces of old Gobelin in excellent condition , worth , for decorative effect , as every artist knows , acres of wall-paper ; and if we think the brass sconces not fine enough , or too picturesque for inodern surroundings , here are magnificent specimens of electrotypy , copies of the Shakespeare Dish , of the Milton and the Dante Shields , and the Amazon Dish , and the Siege-of-Troy Dish , brilliant ornaments for dining-room or entrance-hall . One want which this company offers to meet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , wlo are fitting up our houses , for ornamental brass and iron work , sometimes elegant or even rich , but oftener serviceable , comely , and yet low in price . It is at present almost impossible to get welldesigned hinges , door-plates , key-plates , knobs , and closing-rings made in this country without going to great expense ; and though the manufacture of these things is now carried to great perfection in England , very few of the articles are imported . // Art . Yet how welcome they would be is shown by the fact that somebody here having hit upon the device of covering flat hingeplates and plain door-knobs with thin pieces of electrotype copper , ornamented with designs in low relief , there has been such a demand for them that they are being used everywhere , though the effect of even the best of them is mean and mechanical . The English iron and brass work for these " hardware " purposes is well and solidly made by cutting the plates out of boiler-iron or even out of thick sheet-iron , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very much in use . It is not at all uncommon to see handsome new houses in England fitted , all through , with hinges , door-latches ( not mortice-locks ) , key-plates , and the rest of the hardware , of wrought iron and brass , - handsome to look at , well made , and serviceable , not possible to get out of order with ordinary usage , and always looking better the more it is rubbed and handled . All this English hardware the Household-Art Company is prepared to import , and they have on hand a small supply of it , together with some very attractive specimens of the French brass-work , firedogs , fire-irons , etc. , etc. , copiedliterally from old renaissance and Gothic examples , and made to do service , not merely to look at . We wish this enterprise may thrive , for though there is a real desire to furnish our homes more picturesquely and cosily , and , at the same time , usefully , for every-day living , and not for stage effect , there has thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving a great deal more time to it than most people can afford . And , oftentimes , the result was not satisfactory . Now there is a place promised us where one can go for advice and assistance , can see what others are doing , and learn the best way of infusing a little of the artistic , the poetic element into our too mechanic and monotonous ways of living . But we shall not think the Household-Art Company has done the best it can for us , until it gives a fillip to the arts here at home ; does its possible , however little that may be , to set our own mechanics at work , and to develop the capacity , which is here abundantly , if one will look for it , of making beautiful things , glass , pottery , iron-work , carpets , and stuffs , as well as steam-engines and reapers . However , the taste must be formed first , we admit , and this new association can do a good deal to that end . February , - Our quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare has at last reached Touchstone 's " seventh cause , " and the Nation accuses us bluntly and insolently of not telling the truth when we asserted that we had measured Mr. Ward 's statue . " The Atlantic , however , supports an untenable theory with a humorous juggle of measurement . Its own words show that it has not had the head of the Shakespeare measured at all . " We certainly should not he at the trouble to contradict this were it not that we are under an unquestioned responsibility to the public , and have not the right to choose whether we will allow ourselves to be misrepresented or not . The Nation , pretending to a sincere desire not to misunderstand our words , represents us as saying tha4 havingfound the distance from the point of the chin to the bridge of the nose of the statue to be six and a half inches , we did not proceed to examine if this be half the head , but simply took it for granted that it is , and , without further measuring , settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will now say that , having found the dimensions of half the head by the ordinary rule , we proved the correctness of the rule by measuringfrom the bridge of the nose to the summit of the skull for the other half and found that this also was six and a half inches . This is what our words always ' meant , and not what the Nation , desperate for an argument , and catching at any straw , affects to believe they meant . We shall not resume the discussion , of this matter until the Nation shall bring forward the name of some sculptor as well known and as worthily known as Mr. Henry K. Brown , who will say that the Nation 's method of measuring is correct , or who will say that , by his own habitual way of measuring statues , Mr. Ward 's Shakespeare , measured from the statue itself or from the cast , is less than seven andfive thirteenths of its heads in hezght . We considered ourselves no authority on such a point , and we called in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle the fact . The Nation is no authority ; let it therefore call in a professional opinion . Let it take that of Mr. Marshall Wood , a distinguished English sculptor now in New York , or that of Mr. Launt Thompson ; we wish it would call upon either of these gentlemen , or any other sculptor . We feel sure , however , that it will do nothing of the kind , but will prefer to abide by the injustice it has done Mr. Ward . // Music . MU SIC . MR . THEODORE THOMAS 'S concerts have been , as usual , most interesting . At every hearing of this wonderfully drilled orchestra , each performance seems more perfect than the last ; certainly Mr. Thomas has this year cured what few technical defects there might have been in the performances of past seasons , and his orchestra seems as nearly perfect as well may be . The somewhat too pronounced and strident quality of his brass instruments , that used to make it an unthankful task for the strings and reeds to try to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ; and he has at last succeeded in obtaining a perfectly even pianissimo from all his wind instruments , such we have never heard equalled in any but the finest French orchestras . Even the unmanageable bassoon has been brought to play as softly as the celli , and the usually irrepressible flutes and oboes vie with the violins in delicately subdued tones . In addition to this , Mr. Thomas 's flutes and reeds have an advantage over those in French orchestras , in that they can play loud when necessary . In France , the players of wooden wind instruments rarely succeed in going beyond the quiet , pastoral character of their instruments , and in passages of passionate intensity , as , for instance , the famous monologue of the clarinets that immediately follows the grand outburst of the horns in the overture to the Freisc/ziitz , they commonly show great want of power . German players , on the other hand , cultivate almost exclusively the heroic character of these instruments , and seem to find themselves at home only in strong passages , rarely succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Thomas 's artists show themselves equally acquainted with both the heroic and pastoral characters of their instruments . The bowing , phrasing , and purity of intonation of the strings is as fine as ever , and the dynamic balance of the whole orchestra is as perfect as is possible in one of its very moderate size . Of new music , Mr. Thomas has presented to us this season much that is interesting . His programmes have been , perhaps unavoidably , of a somewhat mixed character ; and he seems to have an eye to strongly marked 247 contrasts , rather than to any logical system of development in the succession of pieces performed . The character of much of the music on his programmes , especially the preponderance of music of the socalled " future " schools , has given rise to some quite lively discussion in the daily papers , ( would that such public expression of individual opinion on musical matters were more common with us ! ) one writer contending that the production of music of a bad , or at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste , whatever chances such music may afford of displaying a highly developed executive power and brilliant virtuosity ; his opponent , on the other hand , holding that Mr. Thomas was doing the public a good service in impartially performing music of all schools . If we mistake not , Mr. Thomas is as far as possible from wishing to make his orchestra the means of indiscriminately brimiging all schools of music under the notice of the public . He is , if anybody ever was , a confessed admirer of Wagner , Liszt , and Berlioz , and has , as far as we can find out , a deftnite object in view in the formation of his programmes , namely , a wish to advance the cause of " the future , ' even though the cause of classic music by the acknowledged great masters suffer by it . The different spirit in which both he and his orchestra take hold of the new music , from that in which they play Haydn , Mozart , and the earlier works of Beethoven , can be seen at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critically to his performances . To be sure the same care and attention to even the minutest details is noticeable in the drilling of his orchestra , whether they be playing a Beethoven Symphony or a Liszt Symphonic Poem , a Mendelssohn Overture or an orchestral bit from one of Wagner 's musical dramas ; but the degree of interest in his task that he displays is vastly different , and however perfect his performances of classic music may be in all technical details , we must admit that they show neither the fire nor the sentiment that is so marked in his renderings of more recent music . But be his musical convictions what they may , so long as they are honestly come at , which we see no earthly reason to doubt , he has a // Musw. perfect right to them and to do all in his power to propagate his ideas , - happy he who has such means of doing so - and we can not think him open to the charge either of aiming at the mere display of brilliant virtuosity on the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . Whether his object , namely , the introduction of the new music , be one which will benefit the cause of art or not , is another question , and one , if the truth must be told , about which we ourselves are by no means sure . It may even be doubted whether Mr. Thomas has taken the right measures to secure his own end . It seems to us that many of his selections from the later composers are more calculated to frighten away than to fascinate and interest all listeners who are not already attracted towards such music . When a man wishes to interest the public in a school of music with which they are unacquainted , he will find it an object first to conciliate his public , and , if possible , to impress them favorably with the music he is trying to introduce ; not by means of eulogistic handbills and much talking , but by first playing to them such things of the new school as they are pretty sure to like . After an audience has once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mi. *ch more inclined to appreciate those of his works which would at first have frightened them away by their unaccustomed style and strangeness of form , than if they knew the composer only by hearsay . When the Music Hall organ was first put up , some most admirable musicians tried to interest the public in Bach . In those days , Bach was a composer whom the most of us had , at best , only heard of ; of his music and style we knew nothing or next to nothing ; his greatness we were willing to take for granted . The first pieces of Bach that were played at the Music Hall were the Tocata in F , and one of the great Fugues ( we think the great one in G Minor ) , - compositions which can be ranked with all that is greatest and most glorious in music , but whose first effect upon nearly the whole audience was as if some Juggernaut-car had mercilessly rolled over them . The music simply crushed them , and if they had no very unkind feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on that queer principle of gratitude which prevents us from doing some violent personal injury to a dentist after undergoing a painful operation , because we are so grateful to him , when he stops , for kindly bringing our tor February , ture to an end . After the first few weeks of organ concerts , the general impression that Bach 's music had made upon the pub . lic was that of unparalleled noise and con fusion worse confounded . " Sehr gelehrt , aber sehr hdsslich , " as an impromptu critic once said . It was not for some years that this first impression was wiped away . People now feel about the new music much as they then did about Bach . To most of our public , Wagner , Liszt , and Berlioz are only known as men whose sole delight is in the braying of brass , the clashing of cymbals , and the tinkling of triangles ; as men who make so much noise that ordinary mortals can not hear what they say . Something over a century ago , the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think of such compositions as the overture to the " Flying Dutchman , " the Hunnenscldacht , or the overture to the Carnaval Romain , we do not wonder that many people have a prejudice against the " future . " We do not mean to say anything against the actual merit of the compositions , but merely that they are in no wise calculated to enlist the sympathies of an unprejudiced audience . There is enough music by Wagner , Liszt , and Berlioz that is interesting without being painfully abstruse , passionate and intense without being almost absolutely annihilating , and which , while it sufficiently shows the habitual train of thought and modes of expression of the respective composers , does not so widely depart from the musical forms to which we are accustomed as  --  to seem at first either strained or ugly . The first four movements of the Symphonie Fanfast4rue by Berlioz would , we think , be deeply interesting , with their beautiful , finely marked theme and masterly orchestration . The fourth movement ( La Marche au Sug5plice ) does , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its well-defined and very characteristic march-theme , both dignified and brilliant as it is , can hardly fail to interest all listeners . Liszt 's Ler Pr6ludes has already become a tolerable favorite with most of us , and we think that hearing it oftener would do more toward endearing the composer to us than such things as the Hunnenscidacizi ' or the Racoczy March . In making selections from the works of Richard Wagner , the task become a more difficult one , as there is little of his music that will well bear performance separated from the dramas of which it is a part . But if concert arrangements from Wagner are to // Music . be played at all , we think transcriptions of separate scenes , such as the Finale from Tristan ( played here last year ) , or " Odin 's Farewell , " from the Walkiire , with its ever-recurring lullaby-melody , more repaying than " selections " in tottourri from such as were played here this season . Mr. Thomas brings with him this year a more than usually attractive array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may be pardoned for striking off the final e from her title ) , shows more genial sentiment than before , even something very like passion in her playing , which used to strike us as too purely intellectual , though she sometimes evinces a tendency to oversentimentalize , and to pay too much attention to the elaboration of separate passages , thus injuring the impression of the piece as a whole . In the two movements she played from Chopin 's F-minor Concerto , these traits , both of them new in her , were strongly marked . She played the beautiful Larghetto with a passionate earnestness of sentiment that we have never before felt in her , and , although she took the temp remarkably slow , the interest was grandly sustained to the very end . In the final Rondo , on the other hand , her performance lacked totality of conception as well as lion , and , in spite of the exquisite finish she gave to all the various details , there was hardly a thought in the whole movement more than two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenor , satisfies all the expectations which we have been led to entertain of him , which is say . ing much . He has a pure tenor voice of fine sympathetic quality , rather than of great power , and he uses it like a consummate artist . His singing is characterized by true musical sentiment and great artistic finish of style , uniting a thoroughly developed technique of the best Italian school with a manly , German spontaneity of expression equally removed from lackadaisical sentimentality and ungenial coldness . It was indeed a comfort to hear his rendering of Mozart 's delicious air , 0 , wie dngstiich ! 0 , wie feur:g ! from the Entfiihrnng , after the lovelorn efforts of other tenorini digrazia , who usually give the little gem of passionate melody either with that calm self-satisfaction of manner which the 249 possession of a tenor voice can alone impart , or else in such tones of sombre despair as to make us for the moment fancy we are listening to Bellini or Donizetti , instead of Mozart . We would , however , caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Music Hall , where it evidently costs him much exertion to make himself heard . These finely cultivated light tenor voices are too precious to be strained in large halls , and Mr. Osgood 's large repertory of German Lieder by the best masters increases our wish to hear him in a smaller room . ! *Te can not close our inkstand without saying a few words about Mrs. Charles Moulton 's first appearance in oratorio , in the Christmas performance of Handel 's Messiah by the Handel and Haydn Society . Mrs. Moulton 's singing of the grand old music was , in many respects , different , in some respects , perhaps finer , than any rendering we have yet heard here . She has an unaffected , almost childlike simplicity of style which lets the music tell its own story easily and naturally . If she does not give evidence of very deep sentiment , she is yet wholly free from all spurious sentimentality ; and the beauty of her voice together with her easy and masterly use of it , her finished style and cultivated enunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music most genuinely enjoyable . In her recitatives she makes the music wholly subservient to the meaning of the words , as it properly should be . Her rendering of Rejoice greatly " was perhaps the most perfect of her efforts . The masterly ease and joyous brilliancy with which she carried through Handel 's long , florid roulades was in strong contrast to the manner in which we usually hear them sung , which is , if anything , more indicative of the bursting of a bloodvessel than of triumphant joy . In " I know that my Redeemer liveth , " her singing showed the song of songs in all its greatness and power . She is to be particularly commended for her rigid adherence to Handel 's music as he wrote it ; we do not remember her introducing a single embellishment of her own . Upon the whole , Mrs. Moulton is one of the most satisfying oratorio singers that we have heard . // SCIENCE . IF the International Scientific Series , which we owe to the disinterested labor of Dr. Youmans , proceeds as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the reading public in its prospectus . The first volume , by Professor Tyndall , was a model of lucid and attractive scientific exposition ; and now we have a second , * by Mr. Walter Bagehot , which is not only very lucid and charming , but also original and suggestive in the highest degree . Nowhere , perhaps , since the publication of Sir Henry Maine 's Ancient Law , have we seen so many fruitful thoughts suggested in the course of a couple of hundred pages . The principal aim of Mr. Bagehot 's book is to point out some of the conditions essential to progress in civilization , and to show how it is that so small a portion of the human race has attained to permanent progressiveness . It has been customary to contrast man with inferior animals as alone capable of improving his condition from age to age ; the implication being that while none of the inferior animals show any capacity for progress , on the other hand all men , without distinction save as to degree , possess such capacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe progressiveness as a tendency inherent in humanity . The gulf between man and other animals , wide enough in any event , has in this way been unduly exaggerated . In reality it need not take a very long survey of human societies , past and present , to assure us that beyond a certain point stagnation has been the rule , and progress the exception . Over a large part of the earth 's surface the slow pro-* gress painfully achieved during thousands of prehistoric ages has stopped short with the savage state , as exemplified by those African , Polynesian , and American tribes which can neither work out a civilization for themselves , nor appropriate the civilization of higher races with whom they are brought into contact . Half the human race , having surmounted savagery , have been arrested * Physics and Politics ; or , Thoughts on the Application of the Principles of " Natural Selection " and " Inheritance " to Political Society . By WALTER BAGEHOT . New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1873. in an immobile type of civilization , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally . It is only in the Aryan race , with the Jews and Magyars , that we can find evidences of a persistent tendency to progress ; and that there is no inherent race-tendency at work in this is shown by the fact that some of the Aryans , as the Hindus and Persians , are among the most unprogressive of men . The progress of the European Aryans , like the evolution of higher forms of life , has been due only to a concurrence of favorable circumstances . It is one of the puzzles of sociology that the very state of things which is pre-eminently useful in bringing men out of savagery is also likely to be pre-eminently in the way of their attaining to a persistently progressive civilization . " No one , " says Mr. Bagehot , " will ever comprehend the arrested civilizations unless he sees the strict dilemma of early society . Either men had no law at all , and lived in confused tribes , hardly hanging together , or they had to obtain a fixed law by processes of incredible difficulty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in their way who did not . And then they themselves were caught in their own yoke . The customary discipline , which could only be imposed on any early men by terrible sanctions , continued with those sanctions , and killed out of the whole society the propensities to variatiop which are the principle of progress. * , A word to the wise will suffice to show that Mr. Bagehot has here struck nearer to the explanation of the arrested civilizations than any previous writer . Among numerous tribal groups of primitive men , those will prevail in the struggle for existence in which the lawless tendencies of individuals are most thoroughly subordinated by the yoke of tyrannical custom , - the only yoke which uncivilized men can be made to wear . These communities will grow at the expense of less law-abiding tribes until the result is a strong nation ruled by immovable custom , as in the case of Egypt or China or India . The problem now is how to get beyond this stage , and to relax the despotism of custom without entailing a retrogression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 February , // Science . solved except where a race , rendered organically law-abiding through some discipline of the foregoing kind , has been thrown into emulative conflict with other races similarly disciplined . And this condition has been completely fulfilled only in the case of the migrating Aryans who settled Europe . This is but one of Mr. Bagehot 's many bright thoughts . We have barely room to hint at another . It was formerly assumed that , instead of mankind having arisen out of primeval savagery , modern savages have fallen from a primeval civilization , having lost the arts , the morals , and the intelligence which they originally possessed ; and in our time some such thesis as this has been overtly maintained by the Duke of Argyll . Mr. Bagehot shows that in every way such a falling off is incompatible with the principle of natural selection . Take , for example , the ability to anticipate future contingencies , - to abstain to-day that we may enjoy to-morrow . This is the most fundamental of the differences between civilization and savagery . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment is , in a mere material , economic , or military aspect , such an important acquisition to any race or group of men , that when once acquired it could never be lost . The race possessing this capacity could by no possibility yield ground to the races lacking it . Or take the ready belief in omens by which the life of the savage is so terribly hampered . Could a single tribe in old Australia have surmounted the necessitv of searching for omens before undertaking any serious business , it would inevitably have subjugated all the other tribes on the continent . So , because the men who possess the attributes of civilization must necessarily prevail over the men who lack these attributes ( and this is always true in the long run , though now and then a great multitude of barbarians may temporarily overthrow a handful of civilized men ) , because this is so , it follows that there can not have been , in prehistoric times , a general loss of the attributes of civilization . To do justice to Mr. Bagehot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of intentions , we are conscious of having given but a sorry account of it in these brief paragraphs . But we hope we have said enough to recommend it to the attention of the thoughtful reader . We 251 are glad to see that the young science of sociology has received such an early and satisfactory treatment in Dr. Youmans 's series of popular books . Among the new books in the older departments of science , M. Figuier 's Insect World * deserves some notice . Whatever M. Figuier 's short-comings may be , - and they are certainly very great , - he must at least have the credit which belongs to an industrious writer . As an authority on scientific matters , he is far beneath contempt . He has no merit whatever which should make him , on his own account , worthy of mention even in such gossip about scientific matters as ours . Nevertheless , among his many crude and uncritical compilations from the works of better men , he has once or twice produced a rea&amp; able book which is fairly serviceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present work is another . The reader who wishes to obtain , without too much trouble , some rudimentary acquaintance with the structure and habits of the various orders of insects , may find this book useful . Thermic Fever , or Sunstroke , by H. C. Wood , Jr. , is a well-arranged account of the clinical history , character , and treatment of this formidable disease . To rank it with such books as Dr. Wyman 's on Autumnal Catarrh is to give it high praise ; yet from a cursory examination of it , we are inclined to regard it as a book of like merit with the latter . Johnson 's Natural Philosophyt is a work which meets a popular desideratum . It contains an excellent account of the phenomena and laws of mechanics , heat , light , sound , and electricity ; with a chapter on physical astronomy .

THE delays of justice which occur in courts nowadays are not those which gave our English ancestors trouble . Delay caused by the unjust spirit of the sovereign , or by his indifference to the wrongs of his subjects , came to an end with end of individual sovereignty . Though the history of Barnard 's and Cardozo 's court shows that , for a time , at least , the popular sovereign may be as unjust and indifferent as any other , these instances are exceptional . There are few cities like New York in the world , and matters of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjudicated without flagrant and open denial , delay , or sale of justice . It is in matters of public right that most of the trouble takes place . It is the thieves and murderers for whom justice is delayed , and this delay in nine cases out of ten occurs without fault of the court which grants it . The legislation of the various States on the subject of criminal jurisprudence has been so hasty and ill digested , that at every stage between the commission of a crime and the termination of judicial proceedings the criminal finds doors of escape ready to his hand . The popular idea that courts of appeal grant new trials and writs of error out of pure love of the thing is not founded on fact . They generally have no discretion in the matter , and the remedy must be found in the revision of the slipshod legislation which is gradually making a thieves ' paradise out of every court of justice . To be sure , there is great weakness in the appellate courts themselves , which comes from the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of construction in doubtful cases which advance the ends of justice , but even strong coi*rts can not repeal the fundamental principles of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence ; for centuries it has been the policy of our law to make hanging and incarceration difficult ; a policy which found its origin in a deep-seated jealousy of arbitrary power , and also in a deep-seated and religious respect for life . By a curious irony of events , our jealous devotion to the interests of the accused subject , and our desire to protect him from the tyranny of courts , has ended in the establishment of a worse tyranny , - the lives and liberties that we protect best are those of thieves and assassins . It must take a long time before we succeed in striking a just balance between the protection of individual rights and the maintenance of social security . Meantime , there being no doubt that our panel-thieves , pickpockets , burglars , and car-hook murderers are carrying things with a high hand , the press has arrogated to itself the function of making life less agreeable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching , criticisms of the judicial proceedings instituted against them . The indictment , the jury , the plea , the verdict , the exceptions , the motions in arrest , and indeed every action of the judge , the jury , the prosecuting and defending attorneys , are appealed to the selfconstituted tribunal of journalism , and there retried . On the whole , it can not be denied that in most cases the press has used its influence on the side of order and security . . Without displaying much legal acumen , it has generally succeeded in discovering and making known to the public the guilt of the criminals whom it has attacked ; and it has shown little or no disposition ( in cases in which politics were not involved ) to persecute the innocent . As a general rule , when it has attacked courts , it has done so with good motives ; and although we firmly believe that the judiciary in its present weak state needs the support of all honest people , we are not at all inclined to think that a crusade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid or valuable power . Every now and then attempts of the kind are made , but they always fail . We find an apt instance in some recent proceedings of the Supreme Court of Illinois . A man named Rafferty had been tried for murder in the county in which Chicago lies , found guilty , and sentenced to death . His counsel had obtained a writ of error which was still pending . There was at the time a great deal of excitement in Chicago with regard to unpunished crime ; public meetings had been held , and committees had been appointed , and the papers had called general attention to the subject , when ( in October last ) the Chicago Even-252 // 1873. ing Journal published the following editorial article . " THE CASE OF RAFFERTY . " At the time a writ of supersedeas was granted in the case of the murderer Chris . Rafferty , the public was , blandly assured that the matter would be examined into by the Supreme Court and decided at once , that possibly the hanging of this notorious human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time speeds away , however , and we hear of nothing definite being done . Rafferty 's counsel seems to be studying the policy of delay , and evidently with success . The riff-raff who contributed fourteen hundred dollars to demonstrate that hanging is played out , ' may now congratulate themselves on the success of their game . Their money is operating splendidly . We have no hesitancy in prophesying clear through to the end just what will be done with Rafferty . He will be granted a new trial . He will be tried somewhere within a year or two . He will be sentenced to imprisonment for life . Eventually he will be pardoned out . And this in spite of all our public meetings , resolutions , committees , virtuous indignation , and what not . And why ? Because the sum of $ 1,400 is enough , nowadays , to enable a man to purchase immunity from the consequences of any crime . " If next winter 's session of the Legislature does not hermetically seal up every chink and loophole through which murder* ers now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest man in Illinois . We must simplify our mode of procedure in murder trials . The criminal should be tried at once , and , when found guilty , should be hanged at once , and the quicker hanged the better . The courts are now completely in the control of corrupt and mercenary shysters , - the jackals of the legal profession , who feast and fatten on human blood spilled by the hands of other men . All this must be remedied . There can be found a remedy and it must be found . " The scurrility of this article naturally attracted the attention and the anger of the Supreme Court . It plainly insinuated , although it did not in so many words charge , corruption ; such at least must have been its meaning for any casual reader not bent on a favorable construction . The judges , whose reputation is perfectly good , determined to make an example of the offending 253 newspaper , and attached the publisher and editor for contempt of court . By a bare majority the judges determined to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . This absurd result filled the Chicago Evening Journal and all the other papers of the Northwest with great delight , and afforded them an opportunity of perpetrating editorial contempts of the most open kind , of advertising themselves as martyrs , and of enlisting the sympathy of the press all over the country . Waiving all question as to the policy of proceeding against the newspaper in the first place , and also as to the power of the court to punish for contempt not committed in its presence , it is obvious that the punishment imposed was ridiculously inadequate . The offence was " the impeding and embarrassment of the administration of justices ' by the publication of an article tending to bring the Supreme Court of the State into public contempt ; such an offence , if punished at all , should have been punished very severely . The fine of three hundred dollars certainly produced the impression on the mind of any one who had followed the proceedings that the article had produced its effect , and that the court was really frightened . Very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , bccause it only adds one more to a list of experimental attacks which have been made upon the press within the last few years , no one of which had been attended with any success . During the rule of Tweed in New York , the Ring introduced into the Legislature at Albany a provision for the restoration of the common-law rule as to contempts , the effect of which would have been to give to Barnard , Cardozo , and the other rascals who happened to have seats on the bench , the power to prevent all discussion of their action . The common law on the subject was that which appears from the decision of the court in the Journal case to be in force in Illinois , but three , hundred dollars and costs would not have been the penalty imposed on newspapers in New York . The proposal , however , was too monstrous for consideration , and even the Albany Legislature was forced to decline having anything to do with it . The next attempt to make use of the power to punish for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has the same rights in this matter that are enjoyed by courts ' of law . Two members of the press were in- // Politics . carcerated for publishing proceedings of the Senate when the publication had not been authorized . Nothing came of it however . These instances serve to show how extremely improbable it is that the power to punish for contempt by " construction " can ever come much into vogue as a means of bolstering up the dignity of courts . The punishment of actual contempts committed in open court is a different matter . Judges must have that power for the purpose of preserving order , and it would be well if they exercised it much more severely than they now do ; but the press has become far too powerful an engine to make it possible for judges to silence or frighten it back into the attitude it once held towards those in authority . As it is evidently supposed , however , by some people , that this is not so , and as it is impossible not to sympathize with the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its choice of means , to strengthen its position in the fight which it is perpetually called upon to engage in against popular clamor and stupidity , it may be worth while to trace in a few words the history of " constructive contempt " the briefest retrospective glance will serve to show how completely it belongs to an age and system of society which has gone by . A " constructive contempt " is " any publication , whether by parties or strangers , which concerns a cause pending in court , and has a tendency to prejudice the public concerning its merits and to corrupt the administration of justice , or reflects on the tribunal or its proceedings , or on the parties , the jurors , or the counsel . " The power to punish is very wide . Short of torture or execution , it may be said to have no limits . It is in the discretion of any court , which either by statute or common law has the power , to prevent absolutely all discussion of any pending case by the press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are summary and final . Outside of England and America the power does not exist among civilized states . In France and in Germany there is an active supervision of the press , but it is by the administration , not by the courts ; and , what is particularly worthy of notice , the power rests primarily , not on the danger that public discussion may lead to resistance of judicial decrees , but on the danger to the dignify of the court . No one will deny that the dignity of courts February , ought to be preserved , and that general respect for them and for their decrees is a great safeguard against disturbance and civil commotion ; but then so also is the dignity of other branches of the government important . Respect for the proceedings of the Treasury Department is a great safeguard against the depreciation of the national credit ; and if a newspaper publishes an article showing that Mr. Boutwell knows nothing about finance or political economy , it may very likely affect the price of government securities , and through these the fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boutwell has no power to punish for constructive contempts of the Treasury . So , too , the publication of articles calling attention to the unfitness of the President for his position , holding up to public scorn his ignorance of law , his indifference to public opinion , his lack of interest in specific measures of reform ; all this has a very bad effect on the reputation of the country and its inhabitants ; we have heard a sensible man express doubts as to the morality of caricature when it handled persons of exalted station ; but General Grant can not have Mr. Matthew Morgan locked up in the Old Capitol prison . We may say the same thing even of such a small branch of the government as the signal service Constructive contempts of the weather reports might lead to all sorts of disasters by sea and land , the loss of much . property and many lives ; but the chief of the service can not prevent the publication of such criticism as the press may see fit to make . It is only the courts whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The explanation of this anomaly is to be found where the explanation of so many other anomalous features of our system of government are to be found , in the peculiar character of the growth of the English Constitution , the so-called principles of which we have inherited . The English Constitution , or rather the constitutional rights of the English people , have been obtained and established , not as a general rule according to any systematic plan , but accidentally , on the impulse of the moment , under the pressure of actual tyranny . Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights were not well-considered reforms , introduced , like the Prussian reforms of Stein and Scharnhorst , from above , because they were seen to be necessary to the social progress of the people ; they were liberties , wrung from unwilling superi q // Politics . ors by aggrieved subjects . Down to the time of the American Constitution no system or scheme of government had been devised for any portion of the English race , and indeed it had hardly occurred to any one that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern essay on the art of government in our language which recognized any principles in politics . At that period even representation ( in the modern use of the term ) , the freedom of the press , and the independence of the judiciary , were things unknown in England . Indeed , we may almost say that down to the time of our Revolution , the sum and substance of political wisdom among Englishmen was , that the contest for forms of government was a fool 's contest , that the best government was the best administered government , that politics was a game by which power was won and lost , that every man had his price , but that Britons never had been and never would be slaves . In this century the subject has received a very different kind of discussion . The great principle , that government is the agent of the people , having been fairly adopted , the road is at length opened to systematic and scientific consideration of questions which have heretofore been mere questions of power or force . But though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached . The continual struggle for liberty and rights in which our ancestors were forced to engage , left them , as we have just said , little time or inclination for making the charters they obtained consistent and complete . They were content with securing themselves from acts of oppression when opl ) ression was attempted . The result is that the inheritance they have bequeathed to us is a strange compound of modern liberty , ancient and perhaps obsolete custom , and forgotten prerogative , some of it belonging to one century , some to another , some going beyond the memory of man , some rational , some irrational , some unintelligible . Every now and then , in the midst of these entangled constitutional strata , some fossil remains of a by-gone period are turned up in the course of judicial investigation , and it has been the custom with courts and legislatures which understood their duty clearly to remit them to the care and study of historical and antiquarian inquirers , and not attempt to adopt and declare them part of the organic life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pun-255 ish for constructive contempt of court . It is a fossil which belongs to what might be called the arbitrary period , if politics were studied as geology is . To understand its being found as a deposit in the strata of English and American jurisprudence , we must go back to those very early times in which the king was the source of all power , the real sovereign . All states , England among the rest , which have steadily developed themselves from within , have at some period come under the domination of a single ruler , in whom all power was centred . Of course , at such a period , society is very simple . It mainly occupies itself with fighting . There is no legislation , no representation , small commerce , or domestic trade ; there are no accumulations of wealth , no complicated questions of property rights , no great cities , no public meetings , in fact no public to hold meetings . In this rude state of society , the king performs a dozen duties which in modern times are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administers justice . He sits in his hall , " throned and delivering doom ' * the suitors come in to his presence , and obtain redress for what wrongs have been done them . We have in the Arthurian legend one of the first pictures of this sort of society in England . In Mr. Tennyson 's last " Idyl of the King 's may be found an imaginary record of a day 's proceedings in one of these early courts , in which a simple viva voce order issued from the throne takes the place of all the cumbrous modern machinery of injunctions , writs of entry , mandamus , n* exeat , and arrest on mesne process ; assumpsit , detinue , replevin , trover , and waste ( to say nothing of " pleas of the crown " ) are all merged in the primeval action on the case in the Au/a Regis . It was the king sitting in the Hall of Doom who first discovered that he had the right to punish for contempt of court . It required no elaborate investigation into precedents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he Vleased . Nor did he make any distinction between actual and constructive contempts . If any one , whether in court or at some remote place , committed acts which seemed likely to bring the administration of justice , or , in other words , the king , into contempt , the most summary measures were immediately taken with the offender . The object of such measures was , not the preservation of the dignity of law or justice , but the preservation of the royal authority itself .
