txt Judge Park said he understood Dr. Treadwell 's photographs were introduced to illustrate the subject . If the witness proposed to show that they cud not properly illustrate it , his testimony was admissible . The witness pronounced the photographs absolutely worthless as indicating the size of the corpuscles . They were really optical delusions resulting from the unskillful handling of the instrument . The witness was free to say that he had formed a very poor opinion of Dr. Treadwell , which possibly , however , ? did that gentleman an injustice . The witness then referred to a number of authorities supporting him in his assertion that the blood of a man could not ho distinguished from that of a dog or other domestic animal . The authorities which did not agree with him he considered as having relied upon probabilities rather than upon actual observation . Dr. Richardson , of Philadelphia , who had disagreed w.th the witness , had recently written him that he had been converted to his views . Dr. Richardson said , in his letter , that although he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ape or the blood of the dog could not be distinguished from the blood of man , he had refrained from making the fact public because he was afraid an improper use might bo made of it in the defense of criminals . " Do you know Dr. Treadwell ? " asked Mr. Watrous . " I have not the pleasure , " replied the witness , adding , that he had never read of Dr. rfreadwell except in the newspapers , in connection with the present case . " Is he considered an expert in your science ' ? " " Wo consider a man an expert only when ho publishes the result of his investigations . " " Have you read his testimony in the present case ? " " I have read what purported to be a stenographic report of it . " " Is this testimony in accordance with tho the latest scientific . knowledge on the subject ? " This question was objected to , and admitted in another form , the witness being asked whether there was anything in Dr. Treadwell'a testimony which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct . Dr. Woodward said he was glad the form of the question had been changed . It was extremely distasteful to him to criticize another man . He thought that in his testimony he had niacin all the statements concerning the matter at issue necessary . Personal matters he did n't wish to speak about . Dr. Woodward 's cross-examination was conducted by Mr. Waller , assisted by Dr. Treadwell , who sat at his elbow . Mr. Waller asked the witness if he had ever produced any better photographs than the four shown by Dr. Treadwell to the jury . The - witness answered in the negative . " Do n't these photographs show him entitled to be called an expert ? " asked Mr. Waller . " Possibly so , " replied the witness , " if they are not the result of chance , or a few successes in a multitude of failures . " " If you had soon those four photographs alone , and knew he had never made any others , would you not say ho was entitled to be called an expert ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his other photographs which he sent inc . I will do him the justice of saying ho may have improved greatly since the former pictures were taken . " Mr. Waller , naming the dimensions of the 15 corpuscles taken by Dr. Treadwell from Mr. Hayden 's knife , asked the witness whether they were within the range of human blood . The witness said they were within the range of man 's blood or dog 's blood , with the greater probability of their being dog 's blood . " In your examination of does blood did you try to find the average size of dog corpuscles V ' " No , Sir . It would take all my life to find the average of the blood of any animal . " " Could n't you find the average in one or two years ! " " It would take me 42 years . " " Have you ever discovered in your work that you have been radically and curiously wrong in your measurements of corpuscles ? " " I have made many errors in averages , but none in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . for the disagreement between corpusclooneasuring experts ? " " The only reason I know of is that different experts examined different specimens of blood . " " Do you mean to say a man can not be an authority as an expert who has not written a single lino about his pretession ? " " Not unless he agrees with the majority of the authorities . " " Does it not often happen that the men that write the most and talk the most know the least . ? " " Yes , Sir . " " Even in your profession ? " " In my profession , and in your profession , also , " " Is n't it so iu your profession that a man of versatile talents , and of a great many occupations , is n't as good authority as a man who has a less variety of occupations ? " " It very often happens so . " " Is the fact that a man belongs to many societies any strength to him as an expert ' ? " " It depends on circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no societies anything against him as an expert " No , Sir . " " Then , " said Mr. Waller , " I want to say to you that you and this gentleman by my side do not differ in any essential particulars . " " Save your speeches until later in the case , " said Mr. Watrous . " Court stands adjourned until 10:30 Monday morning , " said Judge Park , interrupting the attorneys.
