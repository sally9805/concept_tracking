txt What originally caused Mr. , of Clinton , Ill. , to doubt the sincerity of Mrs. 's love for him is not known . The pair had lived together in comparative peace and happiness for nine years . To be sure , Mr. had sometimes expressed annoyance at the cold dinners which were set before him on washing day , and had occasionally remarked that all women are crazy on the subject of house-cleaning ; and there had been occasions when Mrs. had appealed to the mop-handle to enforce her views , or had indulged in the wild justice of the stove-lid when her feelings had been violently lacerated , Nevertheless , the wedded life of the was on the whole successful , and their neighbors would have been greatly surprised had any one hinted that Mrs. was not warmly attached to her husband . When Mr. began to ask himself if he was quite sure that his wife loved him , his peace of mind vanished . He is a middle-aged respectable man , engaged in the manufacture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved wife . No sooner had the unlucky thought entered his head that perhaps she did not really care for him than he began to notice any quantity of trifles , nearly as light as atmospheric air , which to his morbid imagination seemed evidence of his wife 's coldness . The cold dinner on Mondays and the semiannual house-cleaning gradually presented themselves to him in the light of heartless persecutions . If Mrs. went to bed early , he assumed that she did it to rid herself of his society , and if she sat up late , he decided that she was influenced by a desire to watch him and prevent him from exercising his marital right of snoring in his chair . He imagined that she manifested in countless ways , both her want of love for him and the hypocrisy with which she tried to conceal it ; and thus looking upon her who was the wife of his bosom  --  and also , presumably , of his shoulders and the back of his neck  --  with suspicion , he became a miserably unhappy man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would bo well to test his wife 's affection . In pursuance of this idea , he devised various little plans of more or less ingenuity . On one occasion he waked Mrs. up in the middle of the night and in a whisper informed her that he was dying . The good woman promptly arose , and preparing a mustard plaster , placed it where it would do the most good , and exhibited a solicitude that was quite satisfactory . The unfortunate man , however , was not contented , and tried the experiment a second time , whereupon Mrs. remarked , " Fiddlesticks ! " ? which was heartless as well as irrelevant  --  and told him to go to sleep and he would be all right in the morning . Being thus again filled with suspicion as to the state of his wife 's affections , Mr. tried further tests . He entered the house hurriedly one evening and informed her that he had been shot at by three ruffians , who swore that they would kill him sooner or later . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his precious life , Mrs. calmly remarked : " John , I want you to sign the pledge this minute , and do n't you ever dare to come home in such a shameful state again , " and thereupon compelled her husband , who was far more sober than the average member of an elective Judiciary , to then and there sign a total abstinence pledge . Still the miserable man hankered for further tests , and he even took the ill-judged liberty of informing , his wife that his health was becoming undermined by cold meat , that if she really cared whether he lived or died she must give him a hot dinner on Mondays . She told him that if he wanted to die he might , but she did not propose to take the boiler off from the fire and thus interfere with the washing , in order to pamper any silly fool that eyer lived , " and the sooner you make up your mind to that , John , the better , and do n't let me see you coming into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . " In the opinion of Mr. , these tests all pointed to a lack of affection which was to the last degree painful to him . He ceased for a time to make any further experiments , and assumed a sad , despairing look , which he rather thought would move the heart of a brass monkey , had there been a metallic animal of that species in the neighborhood . It finally occurred to him that suicide would be the thing to excite any slight particle of pity that might still linger in his wife 's bosom . It so happened that he lived in a three-story house , and the joint bedroom of himself and Mrs. was the two-pair-back room . One afternoon ho mounted to the third story , carrying the clothes-line with him . He fastened one end of the line around his body , just under the arms , . and the other end to the leg of a bedstead . Then opening the window , he carefully lowered himself until he dangled opposite his bedroom window , in which situation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last convinced that her husband was in earnest , and that ho had actually hanged himself . Filled with horror , she sprang to the window , and remembering that a person who has hanged himself should be cut down as soon as possible , she cut the cord with a large pair of scissors . Mr. fell heavily to the ground , and when he was subsequently picked up he had just strength enough left to remark that at last he was satisfied , and then hastily expired . This incident affords a valuable precedent to men who desire to know if their wives really love them . It would , however , be well for any husband who proposes to hang himself to so manage the affair that his feet shall be but a few inches from the ground . When , in such circumstances , he is cut down by a horrified wife , he will be none the worse physically for his experiment , and his wife will be saved the trouble and expense of a funeral .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
