ARTICLE 1. - NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC WORSHIP . THERE is reason to believe that the public worship of non* liturgical churches is not entirely satisfactory to a large pro . portion of the clergymen and people connected with those churches . Indications of dissatisfaction are to be found in numerous attempts which have been made to change the forms of worship , and which have resulted in considerable diversity of order , in various innovations , and in not a little superfluous ornamentation . Any one who has worshiped with different congregations knows , for example , that the same order of service does not prevail in all the churches . One is never quite sure what will come first , or what is coming next* Even at the end , when the benediction is to be pronounced , he is not certain whether he is to stand or to sit , to step instantly into the aisle or to wait a moment with bowed head . Preachers who find themselves in many pulpits are sometimes heard to complain of the annoyances to which this lack of uniformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , that the respon. sive reading of the Psalms , or the congregational use of the // Lord 's Prayer , or the recitation of the Apostles ' Creed , or all of these new features , have been added to the forms of worship more commonly observed expense , to render complicated music , until the service sometimes becomes more ornate and pretentious than in any of the churches which are ritualistic . These departures from the one undeviating order which was once followed in all the churches are mentioned only to confirm the statement that there is dissatisfaction with the forms of worship we received from our fathers , and to show that the desire is very general at the present time to escape from the extreme simplicity and even bareness of outward forms with which they were so long contented . Now it would be entirely useless , even if it were desirable , to think of pushing all the churches back into modes of worship with which they are no longer satisfied . It is as truly our liberty to seek for better ways of approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements of truth in our creeds . It is not my purpose , therefore , to complain of the changes which are going forward , but rather to point out the directions in which improvement may most hopefully be looked for . I do not , then , contend for the reduction of services in all our churches to absolute uniformity . Strict uniformity would give a service too short for some churches and too long for others . The congregation which is counted by hundreds or thousands is capable of sustaining an order of worship not simple enough for the congregation which is counted only by dozens or scores . And there certainly are no weighty reasons for consulting the convenience of occasional preachers in the arrangement of public worship , for we are in the habit of advocating permanent pastorates . The order of service becomes familiar to the people and pastor in each church , and the stranger within the gates will not be disturbed by slight deviations in the succession of prayer and praise if he finds the devout spirit . We can not permit ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often raised against choirs of professional singers . A well trained choir has important functions in public worship , and it would be senseless to do away with it // altogether merely because in some instances it has exceeded its proper functions . And as for the additions . which have been mentioned , it is freely admitted that there is no objection to them in themselves considered . No one can reasonably object to the use of the Lord 's Prayer by the congregation . The Psalms have been the devotional poetry of the church in all ages . The Apostles ' Creed is a confession of faith in which all Christians have long agreed . It is my opinion , however , that these additions have usually proved to be disappointing . They seem like an unsuccessful imitation of another kind of worship . They do not flow in harmoniously with the forms to which they are attached . They seem like parentheses , which are not without meaning , but which are only incidental to the real progress and genius of our more simple modes of worship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . If public worship in non.liturgical churches is unsatisfactory , it is not , in my judgment , because there are serious omissions , but because its characteristic elements have not been properly developed ; and if this is true , our worship can not become rich , complete , and devout , by slight additions from other sources . Without further preface I proceed to indicate the directions in which improvement may reasonably be looked for . If the changes which are proposed can be brought about , our worship will be developed in accordance with the elements which have always distinguished it rather than by importations from without ; some of the appendages already described will give way to what is vastly better and choirs will be restricted to their proper but important functions . The characteristics of devotional services in non-ritualistic churches are that the prayers are extemporaneous and that the worship of the congregation finds audible expression in sacred song . In these respects we have long been distinguished from rflualistic churches , where the prayers are by the book , and the people join in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prayers in our churches depend on the devotional culture of the minister . When public prayer is devout , appropriate , and scriptural , much is already done to bring worshipers near to God . But , while too much can not // be said about the preparation of the pastor to lead the devotions of the people , and while this part of the service , though often satisfactory , might be much enriched , yet it is not in this respect that our worship is felt to be most seriously deficient ; and , at all events , the depth of his devotional culture must rest with the minister himself-congregations have to do with it only indirectly . It is in the other element , the service of sacred song , that the most serious imperfections are to be found . It is often the case that the musical part of the service consists of elaborate selections rendered by a choir with one or two worn-out tunes listlessly sung by the congregation . It is in the development of this part of the service that improvement is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought to its proper place and power in the worship of God . A genuine revival of this element of worship is all that is needed to make our public services satisfactory both to the devoutness and the taste of true worshipers . My meaning can be best unfolded by a comparison of American and English church music . It is with a good degree of confidence that I have reached my conclusions , because the reform , if it may be so called , which is needed in this country has been practically secured in Great Britain . If we can accomplish what has already been accomplished in the Congregational , and to some extent even in the Presbyterian , churches of the mother country , nothing more will be heard about the poverty of our public worship . I. First to be noticed is the change which has been effected in music composed for the singing of hymns . A word may be said in passing of the hymns themselves . Twenty years ago the hymn book in use in the Congregational churches of England was not unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good old hymns of devotion contributed by every age and which are the precious inheritance of the church , but it contained also hundreds of hymns , expressing religious sentiments of various kinds and in which the ends of the lines are found to be in rhyme , but which are useless for purposes of worship . Since that time , however , many fine hymns have been added , some of them recent compositions , some of them translations of ancient hymns , but nearly all of // them breathing forth the spirit of praise and aspiration . These hymns have gained a rapid and deserved popularity in the English churches . A few of these , very few , have become somewhat familiar here . We ought to be using the hymns of Christian life and sentiment and some of the sacramentarian hymns which have so greatly enriched the treasury of sacred song in the churches of Great Britain . It is , however , in the development of a higher order of church music that progress has been most remarkable . During the time to which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly new and so wide-spread , that from 1860 , or perhaps later , until now , may properly be styled a distinct period in the development of public worship . Indeed , there has been a revival of interest in secular music also , as the popularity of the best concerts and the organization of local societies all over England for the practice of vocal and instrumental music sufficiently proves . But I must confine myself to the subject in hand . The best hymn-tunes in existence are the work of living composers . There can not be found anywhere tunes comparable for sweetness of harmony and sustained effect with the tunes of Barnby , Dykes , Monk , Sullivan , Gauntlett , Smart , and other English composers of the present day . Two of these tunes , which have made a place for themselves in some American books , may serve to illustrate the superiority of the new style of music . The tune composed by Monk , which is wedded to the hymn , " Abide with me , fast falls the eventide , " is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is refreshing by contrast with the cramped , mechanical tunes so commonly sung in our churches . The tune composed by Dykes , which is inseparably joined to the hymn , " Holy , holy , holy , Lord God Almighty , " is full of dignity , of reverence , and of the noblest harmony . When Ortonville or Greenville is given out how wearily the singing drags along . But when one of these tunes is chosen , not only is it better sung , but also a spirit of subdued fervor fills the place . Yet tunes of this character have almost wholly superseded the monotonous tunes of the past . In the churches of England you may still hear St. Ann 's , York , Portugese Hymn , Dundee , Lyons , and other fine old tunes which are simple , stately , and harmonious ; but you will // also find as familiarly sung and as truly loved these tunes of more modern origin . When you hear the praises of God 's people swell out in so sweet and mighty strains you begin to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive that worship can assume no form so beautiful or so reverential as the expression of devout hymns by the best tunes . Even the metrical versions of the psalms , used in the Presbyterian churches , which are inverted and complicated as artificially as possible , are impressive because they are sung to fine tunes . Much more , then , may it be supposed that worship is satisfying when the best ancient and modern hymns , hymns written not to order , but as it were by inspiration , are sung to tunes which perfectly express their spirit . Now , I make no sweeping condemnation of the church music in use among us . I do not deny that there has been some considerable development , so that singing is better than it was a half century ago . In the time of Lowell Mason , for example , many good tunes were composed . But we have shut ourselves up too closely to the Lowell Mason period . There has been scarcely any progress since his best tunes appeared . But few congregations can be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is true , and here and there are sung in church , hut they are tunes of the wrong sort . Take the more recent collections . What has been added to the Andover book of which Lowell Mason was the musical editor ? A large number of tunes of a light character and with frequent changes of movement , tunes suited only to a Sunday evening in the parlor , but entirely lacking in dignity , solidity , or the impression of progress , and therefore wholly unsuitable for public worship . They are feeble , trickling tunes . And , still worse , a quantity of tunes , some with a tripping movement coming around into a jolly refrain , others plaintive and sentimental , and others boisterous , which , having caught the popu. lar fancy , have been incorporated into the books because they are popular . That is , additions to church music have been adapted to an existing taste , but apparently no attempt has been made to elevate and educate popular taste . I do not know that any one is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in Great Britain the best musical composers have been // enriching the service of church song and the English people have been learning to use and enjoy the new music which combines loftiness and sweetness , at the same time in America tunes wiLhout any substance , tunes decidedly objectionable by their triviality and sentimentality ) have made the staple of additions to every new book , and as a consequence either that congregational singing has been debased , or has been confined to a very few tunes of which the people have become weary because they are so often repeated . " Old Portugese llymn is inspiring , after all , " some one says ; " there can be nothing better . " Yes , but we can not sing it every Sunday . " It is simple pedantry , " says the editor of the English Psalmist , " to restrict the music of the church either to any particular age or any particular school . The old that remains has filtered out of much that has perished , and the new is doubtless destined to undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song is as impossible as it is fataL " When unprecedented events in personal or national history occurred , the royal psalmist composed verses suited to the occasion . And , perhaps because some would clamor for an old hymn such as the song of Moses or of Deborah , he would begin with the summons , " 0 sing unto the Lord a new song , for he hath done marvellous things . " The new song called for a new tune , for the chronicler relates that when the ark was brought back and David had composed a hymn of thanksgiving , " then on that day David delivered first this psalm into the hand of Asaph and his brethren , " the very psalm of which the ninety-sixth and ninety-eighth psalms are part and both of which begin " 0 sing unto the Lord a new song . " But every one knows that Asaph and his brethren were composers of music . New music will always appear along with new phases of religious development . Yet there are those in our churches who think there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way could be found to make the hymns and tunes which have been given to public worship in England available in our own churches , and to make the people familiar with them . II . I now come to another needed improvement which has already been secured in the Congregational churches of Great Britain , and is , if possible , of still greater consequence . Along // with this new movement in choral tunes there has been a remarkable development of another type of church music , which adds vastly to the richness of the service . It is the congregational use of chants . I was not a little surprised , on my first attendance at Dr. Allon 's church in London , to hear him announce , after prayer and Scripture reading , the fifty-first chant . How was my surprise increased when the congregation rose and under the lead of a good choir joined heartily and accurately in the singing of the chant . My first thought was that chanting was peculiar to that congregation , but I afterwards found that in nearly all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that everywhere the people take to it with delight . The book of chants is as necessary in every pew as the book of hymn tunes . It is a book containing about seventy selections from the psalms and from other devotional portions of Scripture , arranged for chanting . Fifteen years ago there was no such book . Dr. Allon then published a small collection for use in his own church , and the result was so gratifying that other congregations introduced the book . Soon a larger collection appeared , which has obtained a constantly increasing circulation , and has finally received the sanction of the Congregational Union of Great Britain . Any objections one may have to this form of worship are sure to vanish as he listens to the people around him singing familiar words from sacred Scripture to the music of an appropriate chant . And when he joins his own voice to the volume of swelling melody which only the chant can contain , and is now borne along rapidly by the sense of the words to the natural cadence , now rests steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse with its own appropriate movement , using all the while the very words of David or Isaiah as they have been familiar to him from childhood , he will say , here is a form of worship natural , melodious , devout , scriptural . Now , indeed , the people are praising God after no artificial fashion and with no uninspired words , but out of a liturgy created under the direct suggestions of God 's spirit , and with a musical harmony not unlike that which the chief musician may have composed when the glowing psalms of David were first sent to him for arrangement . What the feelings of the chief musician // were when the verses of the sweet singer of Israel , the characters still soft in the parchment , were put into his hand with the request that he would set them to music , we can but dimly fancy . We do not know that he also was inspired . Very likely the music fell far below what he would have it . But , at all events , when we listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same psalms , which have gathered about them in the intervening centuries the fragrance of the Church 's worship , we know that we have found the loftiest and purest expression of praise to God which as yet it is possible for the congregations of his people to offer . It may be that in small churches the psalms are not sung as well as they are sung in the large churches ; but , for that matter , neither are the hymns . In the churches I attended the chants seemed to be sung with more heartiness even than the hymns , and I am told this is generally true in all the churches . Our English brethren feel that in the restoration of the chant there has been an immense gain to public worship , and speak of it as though they had made a great discovery . Now , I contend that we need just this innovation in our American churches . Collections of chants should be introduced and the singing of them made familiar . It is true that a few chants have been prefixed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably were inserted for the convenience of choirs , as there are no simple marks to direct the singing . I am not aware that they are anywhere used by the people . If the use of the chant were only a theory much might be said in its favor , yet we would hesitate about actually incorporating it into our worship . But the experiment has been so successfully tried in English churches of our own order , and the addition of the chant has proved so palpable a gain to public worship , that there need be no hesitation about trying the same experiment here . If our ministers and churches could once realize what a wealth of sacred song is ready for appropriation , some provision would soon be made for putting the music into the hands of the people . I said that the responsive reading of psalms as an addition to worship is usually disappointing , although there seems to be much in its favor as a scriptural form of devotion participated // in by the people . The reason it is disappointing is because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation goes only half far enough , and as might be expected is a failure . The right material , if I may so speak , is introduced , but the wrong expression of it is attempted . The chanting of the psalms by the people is as nearly perfect a form of worship as can be imagined , but the reading of the psalms , either continuously or by alternation with the minister , is destitute of strength , of unison , and even of distinctness . It is a confused murmur , intolerable if listened to , tolerable at all only if one enters himself into the competition to reach the final syllable as soon as the others do . The contrast between reading and chanting a psalm is no less than the contrast between reading and singing a hymn . Suppose a congregation should undertake to read a hymn in concert . " Sun of my soul , thou Saviour dear , " read by the people would have neither beauty nor power . There would be a meaningless j umble . No one could worship God through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notes of Mozart 's equally wonderful tune be taken up and the feeling of worship is at once evoked . The hymn is the same , but the musical expression of it makes the difference between discordant , incoherent sound , and melodious , intelligent , inspiring worship . If one has heard a congregation read a psalm responsively with the minister , he may say , This is an improvement of worship . But if he has once heard a congregation chant , he will say , Even if the reading is unobjectionable and is a gain , the chanting is so infinitely superior to it that it should at once give way to this devoutly musical expression of the psalms , in which the people can join with a real unison . Let the chanting of a psalm take the place of one of the hymns or have a place of its own , and then , without changing the order or the distinctive characteristics of non-liturgical worship , we shall have secured all that is needed to make our devotional services satisfactory . To the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first is that it savors , after all , of ritualism-that it sounds like the service of liturgical churches-that it is open thus to the very objection urged against other additions in the early pages of this paper , for it is not consonant with the dis // tinQtive characteristics of our worship . But the objection is not well grounded . Chanting is no more a part of ritualism than Scripture reading , or singing of hymns , or the apostolic benediction . The English churches have more reason than we to dislike ritualism . It may be supposed that they would avoid anything that is in the least degree associated with the forms of the Established Church . Yet they have felt no hesitation whatever in developing their worship by the use of chants . Not only do they chant the psalms because chanting is the proper expression , but they ( and also the Presbyterians , who will not tolerate an organ in their churches ) chant the Gloria Patri at the end of every psalm . They hold that these and some other forms are the possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public worship centuries before the liturgy of the Church of England was in existence . Our English brethren , who know so well what ritualism is and who deprecate its influence , would smile at the idea that chanting the psalms of David savors of a liturgy , and would wonder that we , for such a scruple , either content ourselves with reading the devotional poetry of the Bible , or justify ourselves in ignoring it altogether , except as the minister occasionally reads an extract to the people . But we really need to ask only the one question , what is intrinsically the best development of worship for our churches ? If our forms are too meager , let us enrich them from the best sources , whether other churches have gone to the same sources or not . Let us improve our worship , neither in a spirit of competition nor of self-defence , but with the simple purpose of making our forms the best possible aids to the worship of God . Public worship should not be made the subject of ceaseless experiment , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be too foreign to the habits of the people , especially if those changes are a return to the ancient usages of the church , let us adopt them for the very good reasons that we need them and have a right to them . Singing and chanting are directly in the line of the characteristics of our worship , and therefore substantial improvement is to be looked for in the introduction of fine tunes and chants . Other changes are to be discouraged , not because they resemble a kind of worship different from ours , // but because they do not fit in well with that to which we are accu*tomed , and at the best are only incidental improvements . We are to make such changes as are best in themselves , suited to the genius of our worship , and which can be adopted by the people without forcing or a sense of strangeness . The other objection to the introduction of chanting is that there is not sufficient musical culture in our congregations to overcome the difficulties of this kind of singing . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chanting than in singing ordinary tunes . In fact , the movement of the chant is simpler than any other . It is really the succession of a few chords , and it is almost impossible to go astray . And , besides , the compass of the notes is kept within the range of average voices . Very high and very low notes are seldom employed . More than all , the fact that English congregations have easily learned to chant , is sufficient encouragement to us , for the Americans generally are more musical than the English . This remark , however , may raise the question , Provided the necessary music were in the hands of the people , how could they be instructed in the use of new tunes and of chants ? Two methods are obvious and sure to succeed . One method , not uncommon here and very general in Great Britain , is the occasional meeting of those who are interested , for the purpose of practicing church music , part of the time being devoted to hymn tunes and part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregation will have learned a tune or chant before it is given out in church , and , joining their voices with the choir 's , will easily carry the congregation along , while at each successive singing the music will be more familiar . But a still more effective method is to use this very music in the Sunday school . Almost everywhere two or even three books are used , one for the church , one for the Sunday school , and still another for the prayer-meeting . And , indeed , no one could have the heart to set the children upon the dreary task of singing the tunes to which their parents heroically address themselves . But the hymns and tunes and chants which are really suited to the needs of the congregation , the children love . It is incalculably better that they should sing // such music to such words than that they should learn the ditties called hymns and the jingles called tunes with which they have been so abundantly supplied . If there is in the congregation , Sunday school , and prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon become familiar . When the two or three hundred children and young people in a congregation both know and love the music that is to be sung , there need be no fear that the singing will be a failure , while there is the additional advantage that the children will take a real interest in public worship . I ought to add that within the last five years an attempt has been made in England , with some success , to accustom congregations to the singing of anthems . A collection of anthems has been bound up with the more recent issues of chants , and has already obtained a circulation of more than twenty thousand . The effect , however , is not as good as in the use of chants , because only those anthems can be sung in which the measure is nearly the same for all the parts and which are of the simplest character . Dr. Allon , who is more influential than any other clergyman in the interests of church music , and is editor of nearly all the tune books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in church but such as can be sung by the congregation . But this theory inevitably excludes some of the finest sacred music . One legitimate function of a choir is to render anthems and responses which are too difficult to be sung by a congregation . The most important use of a choir is to lead the people in singing hymns and psalms . Everyone sings with more confidence under the lead of a trained choir . And when the best music is sung by the congregation there is no danger that the choir will usurp functions which do not belong to it . It will no longer be necessary to relieve the monotony of wretched tunes by numerous selections of an elaborate character . When people enter heartily into the singing assigned to them they will not care for much music by a choir . And yet , when singing by the choir is no ! t a substitute for singing by the congregation , when the choir exists mainly to lead the worship of the people , then devoutness may be still further promoted if , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters is intelligently sung in // the hearing of the congregation . T , for one , am much indebted to my choir in the conduct of worship , and am quite sure that the devout strains to which my congregation listen have often produced a quiet and reverent mood . At all events , churches that have good choirs had better not give them up until the quality and volume of congregational singing are much improved over what they are at present . It may be said , then , of the improvements advocated that they are all in one direction , that they are precisely in the line of our established custom of worshiping God in song , that they therefore develop that which is characteristic of non-liturgical worship without doing violence to the existing order , that they are simple and practicable , and that they have received the hearty approval of all the English churches in which they have been introduced . There can be no doubt that the public worship of God would be wonderfully exalted if we would make the same experiment . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desires of many hearts , and also of rightly dividing and properly reading the Word of God . To the congregation would be assigned the delightful task of elevating the worship of praise . Old hymns that are good would keep their honored place and new hymns equally excellent would stand beside them . Old tunes which have become sacred would continue to do service , and new tunes which are devout and stately would become familiar favorites . Then the psalms , instead of being tortured into versions called hymns , but which are destitute alike of poetry and fervor , would be taken unchanged from the Bible and sung to the impressive music of the chant , while the Gloria Patri would regain its place at the end of the psalm . Let there be prayers which breathe forth the penitence , praise , and desires , not of the past in stereotyped forms , but of the present in words chosen when devotion rises , let the Scripture readings be in keeping with the needs and thoughts of the hour rather than those selected in another century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymns , and the noblest chants for inspired psalms , and then our worship will be adapted to our needs , to our customs , toou r highest aspirations , and to our strongest desires to glorify God . // No heed should be given to any who say , " If we have fine preaching our churches *111 prosper . " Let us have the best preaching possible , but let us also offer the best worship . We need not let down the standard of preaThing in order to bring up the standard of worship . Let us rather , having laid emphatic stress on preaching , go on unto perfection in the other parts of divine service , that we may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing . Many kinds of people with varied wants meet in the house of God . A hymn , a psalm , a prayer , may open the way to peace with God as effectually as a sermon . The most eloquent preaching is reinforced when the hearers have been brought into a receptive frame of mind by true worship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , if it is felt to be needed . As in England one minister began by printing for his own congregation a book which was after . wards adopted by other churches , so it may be here , or there may be the combined action of neighboring churches . A collection of chants costing not more than forty or fifty cents might easily be prepared and introduced without any immedi. ate change of hymn books , or a collection of chants might be bound up with three hundred choice hymns and tunes ( as many hymns as are ever used ) , and supplied at a much smaller expense than the bulky volumes of more than a thousand hymns , which are clumsy in the pew , heavy in the hand , and burdensome to the purse . Such a book can not be prepared under the direction of our national council , for its meetings are too infrequent , and the members of its committee would not be a unit in musical taste . Its sanction might be of value when the proper book has appeared . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due time , for the better hymn tunes , at least , must sooner or later supplant those we are now singing . It may be thought that , after all , the changes here recommended can not bring about a radical improvement , for all that is proposed is better music , without any material change of order or form . It is not the forms but what is put into the forms that is important . Among ten or twelve parts of the service one is a sermon . But there surely is a difference in // sermons . What is said and how it is said determine the strength or weakness of preaching . Eloquent discourses and wretched discourses alike are called sermons . One part of the service is prayer , but if the prayers are unsatisfactory , the remedy is not the substitution of some other exercise , but more earnest praying . So one part of the service , the congregation 's part , is singing . But the superiority of the noblest hymns in the language , the magnificent tunes of recent and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music of the chant , over mechanical hymns , monotonous tunes , and rambling responsive reading , is no less than the superiority of thoughful , earnest preaching over superficial , drowsy preaching , or the superiority of the effectual , fervent prayer of the righte. ous man which availeth much , over the wearisome prayer of him who thinks he will be heard for his much speaking . The improvements advised are as radical as they are desirable . And when they are secured , responsive reading will give way to a better use of the psalms , while the use of the Lord 's Prayer and Apostles ' Creed may be left to the preference of each congregation , but will be recognized as only incidental to the main features of our services . It is to be feared , let me say in conclusion , that the importance of improving public worship is not sufficiently recognized . The hymn books and the music we have are thought to be well enough as they are . The whole subject is considered too trivial to engage the attention of clergymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congregational and Presbyterian churches the quality of public worship is the principal source of weakness . Worship is too often spoken of under the name of " preliminary exercises , " as though it had no place but to clear the way for the sermon . When it is remembered how much Methodism owes to the hymns of Wesley , and to the tunes which , if not of the highest order , are at least vivacious , and how largely modern revivals owe their popularity to the music which is sung , when it is remembered that , in general , theology has a deeper life in hymns than in creeds , because hymns are sung , so that one might say , let me give the church its hymns with their tunes , and I care not who gives it its confessions and artieles of faith , it must be admitted // that it is of the first importance what hymns are sung and what music becomes familiar . From stiff and mechanical tunes , from frivolous and unsanctified tunes , from boisterous and discordant tunes , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one deliverance . It is by supplanting them with psalms , and hymns , and spiritual songs , the music of which is so devotional , reverent , sweet , and strong , that it will at last be possible not only to sing it , but to sing it unto the Lord , and to sing it with grace in the heart .
