txt The story told by the Captain of the Orpheus , the vessel with which the Pacific came in collision , affords further evidence of the mismanagement of the steamers . Neither of the Pacific 's side-lights were lit , and she displayed only her white light at the mast-head . The officer in charge of the deck of the Orpheus could not , therefore , tell , which way the steamer was steering . At the event proved , she was steered straight for the sailing vessel , and although the latter 's sails were thrown aback at the last moment in the effort to avoid a collision , she was struck with a violence whirl crushed in the bows of the Pacific . It is the duty of a steamer to keep out of the way of a sailing vessel . So recklessly , however , are steamers managed , that sailing vessels , as a rule take their own measures for safety , where it is possible to do so . Had the Pacific had her side-lights in order , the Orpheus would have kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Captain . As it was , there was no means of telling what course the steamer was steering , and what course the Orpheus must take in order to . avoid her . if the look-out on board the steamer had been attending to his duty , there need have been no collision , in spite of the inexcusable failure to light the side-lights. in all probability the Pacific was rushing along without any one on the look-out , and with the officer on the bridge in too drowsy a condition to notice the lights or the Orpheus . It is now perfectly well known that the City of ' Waco was destroyed because she was unlawfully permitted to go to sea - with a deck-load of petroleum . That not a soul of the ship 's company was saved was probably due to the incompetence of her officers . There was a heavy sea running , but it ? rould be hard to find a sea in which a life-boat would not live if properly handled . It is quite possible that the boats were capsized or stove by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , however , many persons on board the steamer , and two or three determined officers could have quelled a panic , if they had made the effort . These two steamers , the Pacific and the City of Taco , were lost because of reckless mismanagement . It is but a short time since the Captain of the Atlantic drove his ship on the rocks because he had made a niistako in his reckoning . Still more recently the Ville du nacre was sunk because the officer of the deck gave the helmsman a wrong order ; the Schiller was wrecked because her Captain neglected to take soundings ; and the Illinois and the Montana were nearly lost because they were driven at full speed into a heavy head sea . Bad seamanship , and criminal recklessness , which is the worst form of bad seamanship , were the immediate and only causes of every one of those so-called accidents . Had the officers of these vessels studied seamanship on board a Hunter 's Point ferry-boat , their incompetence could be easily understood . The public however , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given only to experienced seamen . There is sense in shutting our eyes to the fact that the decay of seamanship has kept pace with the growth of tie steam marine . The lad who goes to sea on board an ordinary steam-ship might as well stay at home , and exercise himself in boiling a teakettle on board a cat-boat , so fir as his advantages for becoming a sailor are concerned . On board the steamer he will have to steer , and to handle in fair weather a few fore-and-aft sails . In time ho may become an officer , and learn how to telegraph orders to the engineer . He might spend fifty years in this sort of thing , and at the end of that time he would-be no more fit to take an old-fashioned Liverpool packet across the North Atlantic than he would be to manage the steam-engine that propels his own vessel . There are some of the best seamen in the world in command of steamships , but they are rapidly becoming the exception rather than the rule .
