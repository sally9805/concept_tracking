ARTICLE IIJ. ***COLLEGES AND STATE UNIVERSITIES . EDUCATION , universal education , is one of the permanent themes of American thought and interest . Whatever else may enlist our attention , we can never be long unmindful of this one great interest of American society . No other great nation ever entrusted so much to the virtue and intelligence of the people , and no other nation has ever taken so much pains to render the people worthy of the trust committed them . This watchful care of education has been greatly characteristic of us as a people in all our past history . But at no time in all our national life has there been a more imperative necessity of earnest and candid thoughtfulness on this subject than at present . That whole system of arrangements on which we rely for the education of the nation , needs to be re-examined , with a view to the proper adjustment and proportions of the several parts to the whole , and to one another . Not that any sudden revolution in our system is either desirable or possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy the name of revolution has ever been possible , in any part of our system . There is nothing in respect to which our national life is more misapprehended than in respect to this . Other nations are apt to suppose that every thing American is the extemporaneous creation of a motley multitude of impracticable theorizers . No conception could be further from the truth . It is because the thinkers of the old world have so generally fallen into this error , that they have so often and so utterly failed to understand us . From the beginning , nothing that we have been or done has originated in the brain of the speculatist . Our own national life is a natural and spontaneous growth , from seeds whose existence and presence were coeval with our origin as a people . Nobody ever invented our Township system , our State govern * It is thought that the readers of the New Fmglandet- will be interested in the different aspects of this important subject , as they are presented by well known educators in different parts of the country. - Ens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even the peculiar features of our Federal Republic . They are one and all growths from seeds which Providence planted here , when North America began to be peopled by men of European origin . Thoughtful men in all lands look with reverence upon the history and present condition of England , as the growth of ages , and confidently predict for her a long and glorious future . Her social state was not planned by an architect and built according to his model , like her cathedrals and her cities ; it grew under the superintending care of Providence , like her oaks . But the same thing is no less true of the great American off-shoot from England . It is no human invention , but a product of mighty social forces by which it has been from the beginning developing and maturing . Constitutions and systems , in our country , are not , as in France , the extemporized creation of some coup d*tat ,  --  some dark and bloody night of revolution ; but as in England , vital products matured by time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter is the difference of age . Of no part of our social life is this more entirely true than of our system of education . It is not , either as a whole or in any of its parts , the creation of any one mind , or even of any generation ; originally education was with us entirely religious in its aims . The com mon schools of early New England sprung from a solicitude that all the people , without any exception , should be so far instructed as to be intelligent readers of the Bible . The thought seemed quite shocking to those fathers of our country , that any child should be reared up among them without being familiarly acquainted with those oracles of God . For this reason they established schools for all the children in every community , and required that the school-master should accompany every band of emigrants that pressed into the surrounding wilderness . In like manner their colleges were founded and sustained with religious care , that there might be an unbroken succession of learned and cultivated men , to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church and State . All the schools of the early days of New England were as truly religious in their aims as their churches . // In process of time , this common stock sent off two distinct branches . One of them has grown into our great public school system , which is now rapidly overspreading the continent ; the primary design of which is to bring within the reach of the whole people such rudiments of knowledge as are needful to fit them for citizenship . This branch has fallen , for the most part , and is falling more and more , under the control of the several States . The reason is obvious enough . In order that instruction may be imparted to the whole people , it is needful that it should be free ; and the State only , by its power of taxation , is able to sustain a system of gratuitous instruction adequate to the wants of a whole people . It is the judgment of the nation that the voluntary principle is inadequate to the task , and that therefore it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately . The majority of our people have therefore , from a conviction of necessity , consented to intrust this part of our system of education to the State . They have done so with the distinct understanding , that as in this country the Church is wholly distinct from the State , and has therefore nothing directly to do with the government , so , on the other hand , the State has nothing to do with religion . The tendency , therefore , is to exclude religion more and more from that part of our system of education which is under the control of the State . Our schools are not hostile to religion ; they do not make war on it ; but they do not interfere with it . Secular learning only is provided for , and religion is left to the Church , the family , and the individual . We are not now expressing any opinion for or against this arrangement . We are only stating facts and tendencies . The fact is undeniable , that we are rapidly tending toward a vast continental system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than forty millions of people , in which there is likely to be no direct recognition of God and the Christian religion . The other branch of our system of education embraces those institutions devoted to the higher education , which are sustained by individual munificence , and are free of State control , our Academies , Colleges , higher Female Seminaries , and for the most part our Professional Schools . In nearly all these institutions , except in the Schools of Law and Medicine , religion still // retains much the same place as in the days of our fathers ; neither is there anywhere apparent a disposition to make them less religious than they are and ever have been . If in this condition of affairs the State were disposed to confine itself to the work of providing a rudimentary education for the whole people , and to leave the higher instruction to such institutions as the people might be disposed to found and sustain by their own voluntary liberality , the outlook of the future would not seem to most minds to afford any just ground of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why this might not he accepted as a satisfactory solution of the whole question . We are , perhaps , all convinced of the inadequacy of the voluntary principle to provide free instruction in the rudiments of learning to the children and youth of a great nation . This must be done , or our republic is a failure . It must be done by the State or not done at all . The State has a right to provide the conditions of its own safety and perpetuity . But in a free republic one of these is universal education , to the extent of qualifying the entire people for the duties of citizenship . Such an education it is the imperative duty of the State to provide . But by what right the State taxes all the property and industry of the country , to provide instruction in the higher departments of learning for the comparatively few who can ever avail themselves of it , why the sweating , toiling operative should contribute for the instruction of his neighbor 's son at college , while he is utterly unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been made out to our satisfaction . It seems to us improbable that it ever will be . In addition to this , many men who are by no means deficient either in intelligence or public spirit are beginning to think that taxation for gratuitous education has reached a point of nuscrupulous extravagance in some portions of our country , which is exceedingly burdensome at present , and not a little alarming for the future . When we tax capital till from onefourth to one-third of the interest it will command is absorbed by taxation , we must not be disappointed if capital flees from exactions so oppressive , and seeks for itself a more congenial home . // We do not hesitate to affirm that any extraordinary increase of taxation , without the existence of any great and sudden emergency to justify it , is one of the symptoms of a diseased body politic . Ii ; is a very prevalent symptom at the present time , and in nothing is it more apparent than in the reckless extravagance of our public expenditures for gratuitous education . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burden on the business and capital of the country , too heavy to be borne . This is a subject of great importance , and will soon demand from men who think more attention than they have hitherto given it . But however desirable it may seem to any of us , for these reasons , that the State should confine its efforts in the cause of education to providing primary instruction for the whole people , leaving the higher education to be provided for by the voluntary principle , it can hardly be expected that , as things now are in large portions of our country , this will be accepted as a satisfactory solution of the question . The opportunity of securing such an adjustment has , for the present at least , gone by . The time has been when it was not by any means impossible . When the Christian people of the country first began to found colleges in our great central valley , had they been as harmonious and united in their plans as they were divided and distracted , as strong through union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivalries ; had they combined all their resources over this vast field upon a few institutions , instead of undertaking a number of such enterprises ; so great that the wealth which is available for this cause is entirely inadequate to endow and sustain thefn , and the demand for the higher culture , whether present or prospective , insufficient to supply them students in respectabre numbers , and often in such proximity as to be inconvenient rivals ,  --  those few institutions which were really needed might have been made so strong and so influential over the whole community , so respectable in their endowments and so satisfactory in the advantages offered , that the people would have desired no other provision for liberal culture ; and the proposition to found the higher seminaries under State control , and support them by funds drawn from the public treasury , would have found little favor . But the // great and obvious advantages which might have been derived from such a state of things have been utterly lost , for the present certainly , and perhaps forever , by the blunders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unreasonable and unthinking multiplication of colleges to which we have referred , and have thus rendered them nearly all weak , and , as compared with the high and noble aims for which they avowedly exist , pitiful and contemptible . Some of the men who have devoted their lives to this cause , have seen and deplored the evil from the beginning . The directors of the Western College Society have always been aware of it , and , to the utmost of their power , resisted it , but often resisted in vain . Sectarian ambitions and jealousies have done much to aggravate and extend it , but even they are by no means exclusively responsible for it ; such enterprises have been undertaken and aided and encouraged blindly and unthinkingly-they are still so undertaken and so aidedwithout any due consideration of their relations to other institutions previously existing , and with no conception at all of the vastness of the resources needful to their success . The consequence was inevitable , and now stands revealed before our eyes . The communities that have been watching the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often disgusted , and have sought the interposition of the State to provide for the higher education , not because they desire State institutions ,  --  they do not , but a good deal distrust them , and would greatly prefer such colleges as the voluntary principle has fostered in the older States ; - but because they want institutions adequately endowed and sustained . They have despaired of getting such from these rival enterprises which they see around them . This cause has done more to enlist the States in the founding and endowing of vast and expensive universities perhaps , than any other which can be named . lit is the staple of the argument on which the advocates of all measures for extending and enlarging our system of pub - lie instruction in the direction of the higher education rely for popular impression . The colleges which the voluntary principle has founded are represented as a failure , both present and prospective , and there is only too much in the sad facts of the case to give countenance to this representation . The religious // community may thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault that a public opinion has been extensively created , that the voluntary principle can not be relied on to provide for the higher education , that the efforts of religions people are necessarily so enfeebled by their mutual rivalries and jealousies , that they can not be trusted to take care of any great public interest , if the whole truth must be spoken ( and why should it not be ? ) , not even of religion itself If things are to go on at this rate , the time is coming when people will accept a State religion to escape from religions anarchy ; just as they have often accepted a military despotism to escape civil anarchy . A public opinion has thus been created in some of the great States of the interior , by the deplorable fainre of the religious community to perform with wisdom and snecess the high and solemn function committed to it by Divine Providence , which is making haste to establish the higher seminaries under the control of the State ; and it is probable the experiment must be made on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional burdens on an already overtaxed people . Let us not be understood as for one moment admitting , that the efforts of the religious people of the country to found colleges in the great central valley is a failure . We neither assert nor admit anything of the sort . Several of the colleges so founded might be mentioned by name , that have achieved results so great and benefic cut , that were they from this time to be blotted out and cease to be , the good already done would richly compensate for all the money and labor bestowed upon them . And yet they neither are , nor are to be , blotted out ; they are the sound , well-laid foundations on which the Yales and the Princetons of the great interior of our country are to be built for coming generations . It is still , however , true that , in consecinence of that unwise multiplication of colleges to which we have referred , they have encountered great and peculiar disadvantages , and have not only seemed to outside spectators to accomplish , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wiser economy of resources devoted to the case , they might have accomplished . Their progress has been slow and toilsome and difficult , while everything around them has grown with rapidity . The scanti // ness of their resources has often doomed them to be seen struggling hard for the boon of continued existence , while thousands of intelligent men have been looking on them in sharp and damaging contrast with the colleges of the New England and middle States , or with those universities of recent growth whose roots draw ample nourishment from some State treasury . If we continue to divide our gifts upon a great number of rival colleges , we shall hope in vain that our colleges will be able to endure such comparisons without damage ; and if our colleges are to retain their hold on the confidence and respect of the community , they must be able to abide such comparison , without shame or humiliation . To a great extent we have failed to provide colleges which are prepared to abide such a test It is therefore that an extensive reaction has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few are making haste to found and endow them upon a scale of gigantic magnificence and costliness , assuming that the limitless resources of American taxation will pay for alL It is perhaps not improbable that many will be disposed to think that , under these discouraging circumstances , the effort to sustain colleges on the voluntary principle is hopeless , and should be abandoned , except in those portions of the country where they have long been established , and have grown into strength and maturity without the competition of State universities . If this is our conclusion , our last error will be worse than the first . Great and unnecessary as are the difficulties with which our younger colleges are contending , several of them have won a position , in spite of those difficulties , which will give them a most important influence on the course of liberal learning in all the future : they have fought a very hard battle , but they have not been conquered , and they can not be . It is immensely important that these institutions should be strengthened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in hand . Even if the care of liberal learning is to be largely transferred from colleges to State universities , the presence and commanding influence of the college is of great value to the universities themselves . Few of our State universities have yet attained to any very satisfactory results ; and those that // have succeeded have done so by constructing their system very much after the model of those colleges which were founded long ago on the voluntary principle . Michigan University , for example , would never have been what it is , if it had not derived its spirit and its life largely from Yale and Harvard . If any State universities are to attain to eminent success in the future , it is to be done in the same way . We can not create in this country a new liberal education . Our system can not be revolationized . It may be-will be gradually changed , as it has been in the past , by growth and development . But it must still grow from the old roots . Each new branch must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore of great importance that , if State universities are to be founded , they should grow up under the influences of Colleges which are strong enough to exert a powerful influence on the community around them . The conservative influence of such colleges tends powerfully to protect the State universities against their greatest danger-an attempt to found a great university upon some plan which has originated in the brain of a theorizer , instead of growing from the original germs of our national life . But this is not the only reason for persevering in our work of endowing colleges . The success of the State in providing satisfactorily for liberal learning is as yet much more a matter of experiment than a certainty . It is only too evident , from considerations already suggested , that any system of education controlled by the State can not be pervaded by a religious spirit . The stream can not rise higher than the fountain . The State as such is indifferent to religion ; it takes no account of it . It must be expected that all systems and institutions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State itself . The same causes , then , which are driving religion more and more from our public school system , will equally drive it from our State universities . But can we afford to drive religion from all our seats of learning ? Are the religious influences of Yale and Amherst and Princeton and Oberlin really of no value to our youth in the process of obtaining a liberal education ? The great body of the American people , especially of those who give their sons a liberal education , do not think so . If the day ever comes when // they do think so , it will be an evil day to our republic . There are few American parents , even of those who are not very religious in their own lives , who would not prefer to place a son at a college which derives its very life from such religious influences , rather than at a university pervaded by indifferentism to religion . If then religious people will found such colleges , and make them strong in all those advantages and attractions which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict , that the higher education will permanently remain in their bands . The people will be convinced and remain convinced , that the interests of liberal learning are safer in their hands than in the hands of the State . Nothing can permanently wrest this great interest from the hands of the religious people of the country , but their own negligence and inactivity , or what is still worse , their mutual rivalries and jealousies . There is still another reason why it is perhaps improbable that State universities will ever make satisfactory provision for liberal edneation in this country . No State university can prosper unless it has the confidence and hearty good will of the great body of the people ; and it is far enough from being evident , that any State can permanently so manage the affairs of a university as to fulfil this condition . One of our great religious factions , the Roman Catholic , is in open feud with our whole system of State education , and will be equally hostile to State universities . Some of the Protestant denominations are increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open hostility ; and their objections against State universities will be stronger than against the elementary schools . Besides , a State university can not let religion alone , for religion can not let it alone . The only hope that a university can enjoy general favor lies in conciliating the different denominations by dividing up its chairs of instruction among them , as best it can . But the hope of permanently allaying sectarian rivalries by any such expedient is delusive . The best that can ever be attained in this way is a condition of unstable equilibrium , which a breath of wind may at any time destroy . For a fuller expression of our views of this point , than we have space for in this Article , we refer our readers to previous numbers of this Journal . // For these reasons we are quite as confident that the State can not be trusted to provide for liberal learning , as some of our contemporaries are that it can not be safely trusted to the voluntary principle . We do not believe the people of this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober second thought , to entrust this great interest of our civilization to universities , so called , which yet are not universities , and which , while the State controls them can not be ,  --  universities which exclude , by a necessity of their constitution , from their whole course of instruction , that knowledge which is the beginning of wisdomthe knowledge of God and his government . There is no greater misnomer than a university which can yet find no place in all its teaching for that great living theme of the human mind in all ages and lands-religion . To exclude that subject is to descend from the universal to the partial , and make the name university inapplicable to the work we are rearing . How then are we to avoid the errors which have hitherto so greatly hindered our work , and render it possible to secure more satisfactory results in the future ? To this question we are forced to reply , that , in the existing condition of religious society among us , these errors are , to a considerable extent , unavoidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are evils growing out of the present divided condition of the Church which we can not hope to see remedied . However unreasonably we may have multiplied incipient colleges , and however hopeless the condition of many of them may be , we can not expect that any of them will be voluntarily abandoned . None of them will be willing to consent to die for the public good . The men who founded them believed that they were needed and would do good and are not likely to be convinced to the contrary . Neither can we hope to prevent the multiplication of such enterprises . A college is a thing so really respectable and beneficent in its influence , that the public , or at least a portion of the public , will be easily made to believe that to found such an institution must of course be a laudable enterprise . People are easily convinced that if in a town of ten thousand people one college is a very good thing , two would of course be twice as good ; just as they think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to religion and morality , then one // church to every five hundred souls must be proportionally more helpful . We must therefore still expect that good men who know little of the greatness and difficulty of the undertaking will be filled with zeal at the thought of the good accomplished by founding Yale or Amherst or Oberlin , and will religiously resolve to do the same thing in the missionary field where their lost is cast ; and when they find the resources of that field inadequate even for a beginning , they will go East for help . Perhaps they will have no great difficulty in persuading a few men of established reputation to give to the undertaking the influence of their names , in utter ignorance of its relations to the whole field , and to other institutions of kindred views on which large outlays have been already made , with which it is liable to come into competition ; and thus enable it to obtain from givers whose generosity is worthy of all praise , but whose neglect of thoughtful discrimination can not be too much deplored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to divide between two feeble institutions , those resources which ought to have been concentrated on one strong one . We must expect to see such things done in the future , as they have been done in the past , and be obliged to deplore in vain this great waste of the resources of Christian learning . We must expect to see the of sect keen-sio*hted to discern immediate sectarian in-spirit terests and necessities , but blind to what the general good requires ; and therefore ready to found colleges in the interest of sects , utterly regardless of what Christians of other denominations are doing for what ought to be the common cause . All these sorrowful things we have seen , and must expect to see them again . They are evils for which we can prescribe no immediate remedy . And yet we are not without hope . The dependence of our colleges for sufficient endowment is not upon the small annual or occasional contributions of the masses . These may do impo*'tant service in the infancy of an institution but they can not be a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those permanent edifices which , while they afford convenient rooms for all the uses of the institution , give it also dignity and importance in the eye of the public , and for providing adequate libraries , cabinets , and other useful instruments of instruction , colleges naust depend on the munificent gifts of the wealthy . // The men who dispense this munificence are little exposed to the influences xv which have so unreasonably multiplied colleges . They will prefer either adequately to endow an institution and make it a monument to their own memory , or else to bestow their liberality on institutions which are sure to obtain such benefactions from others as will , in addition to their own , make them respectable and influential . Such donations will not therefore be scattered indiscriminately among all the colleges that have acquired a " local habitation and a name , " but will for the most part be concentrated upon those that are likely to live and be strong and influential . That law of life that , " To every one that hath shall be given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that which he hath , " seems a little hard when we are struggling with difficulties too great to be overcome ; but , in its application to our colleges , it is benefi - cent and necessary . The thing that is desirable is , not an equitable division among all the colleges we have , but a concentration on such as we need and can adequately sustain . In this quarter , however , there lies a great danger which we must not fail to point out . Let us not suppose for a moment that the States in the interior are going permanently to rely on the colleges of the Atlantic States for the higher culture . A few of our young men may seek an education in those colleges . But they are too distant , and united to us by too few and feeble influences , to do much for us in the way of education . The States that border on the lakes , and on the Mississippi and its tributaries , can not be reached and educated by lines of railway and telegraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A State with three millions of present population and a prospect of an indefinite increase will have institutions of its own for the hig*ier education ; and if the voluntary principle does not or can not provide them , the State will and must . The danger to which we allude is that the colleges in these States are so feeble and so much in competition with each other , that none of them will attract the atteution and receive the donations of the wealthy ; and that therefore all will be alike insignificant and powerless , and that thus the5 higher culture will pass away from them and fall into far less trustworthy hands . This danger is real and great . We can not forbear earnestly to // invite the attention of men of wealth , wherever residing , to this aspect of the subject . We entreat them to consider the propriety and necessity of putting an end to this all too equal competition among many colleges , by bestowing , upon a few , such ample endowments as will render them fully adequate to the work providentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retaining the care of liberal learning in the Mississippi valley in the hands of religious men and institutions which they control . Let men who have such gifts at their disposal make their own choice , being careful to select those which in their judgment are most promising of lasting influence and efficiency , and , however our favorite enterprizes may fare , we promise them our lasting gratitude . It should also be said that there are institutions which have been raised up by lives of Christian toil and struggle amid difficulties such as we have alluded to , and have attained to such positions , that they can be made strong andinfluential without any such enormous outlay as would be necessary to found an entirely new institution . The resources which they have accumulated , though inadequate , are highly important . They have been trained , too , in the school of hard experience , amid the very difficulties that have yet to be overcome . They know perfectly what they want , and how to make the best use of the resources placed at their disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do more for the cause than a million drawn by a university from some State treasury . No intelligent man can attentively consider this subject in all its relations , without being solemnly impressed with a sense of its importance . The fitting destiny of the American Republic can not be attained by a merely physical and material civilization . No people have ever had an equal need of a high intellectual , moral , and spiritual culture . If this nation is to be worthy of the principles it has proclaimed , and the position it occupies among the nations of the earth ; if it is even to retain and perpetuate the privileges and blessings we are now enjoying , it must cultivate the highest manhood . For cultivating such manhood no instrumentality has yet been devised which can take the place of our colleges ; and nowhere is their influence more needed than amid the exhaustless material resources* // 1873.1 Colleges and State Universities . and the multitudinous populations of our great central valleya valley which in the year 2000 will contain a population perhaps not inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anywhere on earth there is need of the most potent instrumentalities for promoting the highest moral and spiritual culture of which man is capable under the influence of the gospel , it is here . It is here too that there is greatest danger that these instrumentalities will pass into neglect and disuse . The bare suggestion of such a danger has in it much that is alarming . But there is no occasion for despondency . This rage for a civilization wholly material will not last forever . The God of this world will not have things all his own way after all ,  --  God has never yet deserted this nation in the times of its necessity . In relation to the subject discussed in this Article , this is one of those times ; *nd there are not wanting indications that the day of deliverance may be near at hand .
