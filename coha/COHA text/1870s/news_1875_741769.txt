txt The trial of John Dolan for the murder of James H. Noe was concluded in the Court of Oyer and Terminer yesterday . At 10:30 o'clock , the hour for opening the case , the witnesses and jury had taken their places , and a few minutes later Judge Barrett ascended the bench . Rev. Dr. Dowling , the late Mr. Noe 's Pastor , was present , and conversed with counsel previous to the trial . Mr. Howe produced a copy of the City Record of Friday , the ** inst. , containing a notice of a reward of $1,000 for the apprehension of the murderer of Mr. Noe , which Officer Dorsey more ou Tuesday that he had not seen or heard of . Judge Curtis next commenced slimming tip for the defense . Ho said he had possessed the acquaintance of Mr. Noe during his life , and still enjoyed the acquaintance of his family . He was grateful to his Honor for having adjourned the case Tuesday night . He was laboring under a disadvantage , be said , as he wee pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless be contended that the prisoner at the bar was not guilty of the homicide , upon the testimony of Mr. Housely , the son  --  n ? law of the deceased , whose description of the murderer of Mr. Noe did not cor.espond with the personnel of the prisoner at the bar . He denounced the theory ot the handkerchief having belonged to the prisoner , even admitting that it had ever been white . Nor was it likely that the murderer would have left his handkerchief as a gag to the murdered man , while he carefully concealed the broken cane Inn heap of rubbish in a dietaut spot . Superintendent Walling had sworn that the description of the murderer which he promulgated to his subordinates was given to him by Black , the Receiver . Again . Mr. Noe could not have been killed with that stick , and the testimony of Mr. Housely was to the effect that Mr. Noe had told him that ho was struck with a jimmy . The evidence had shown that the prisoner carried several sticks . The prisoner was undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clothes . Counsel did not consider the testimony of Delia Ward of much consequence , and asked the jury to consider what a woman like Delia Ward would be likely to do . She had been accused of stealing the prisoner 's money , and had been assaulted by him .. Counsel did not believe that she would care what also swore to . He dwelt upon the pnucitv of proof that the prisoner had been guilty of the homicide , and ably made the moat of the testimony for the defense . Judge Curtis had not quite completed his summary when the hour of 1 o'clock arrived and a recess was taken for three-quarters of an hour . At 2 o'clock Judge Curtis resumed his arrument , and finished with an appeal to the jury to carefully - weigh the testimony against the prisoner and to divest it of its personalities . and it innocent to render a verdict of acquittal . At 2:15 o'clock District Attorney Phelps began to stun up for the prosecution . It tuna quite . unnecessary , he saki , for him to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn the jury not to be Influenced toy prejudices . His conscience never accused him of attempting ta inflame the passions of a jury . He stood , alike with them , t he Sworn Milner of the law . They could not , ho said , avoid feeling the sympathy which such scenes aroused , and hearts would be more than hard which did not throb with sympathy far the unfortunate prisoner at the bar . They could not , however , forget that sunny Sabbath morning when surrounded by a loving family Mr. Noe left his home and going about his own duties was met by death at the hands of the felon . He could not forget that home turned to mourning and desolation . The grave could not be reopened until the sound of that dread trumpet awakes the dead . The jury were under no obligations to any but themselves ; they must keep their judgment clear and minds unclouded . Ho would not enter into a definition of crime . The jury must learn that the felon who struck down a man while in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first degree . Mr. Phelps then recounted the history of the circumstances attending the commission of the crime and said " Yon can divine the character of the murderer by his first remark iu redly to Mr. Noe 's question , " What are you doing here 1 " He replied , " I am a thief . " No attempt at concealment , reckless , without scruple , and without shame he fearlessly displayed his character to the man he was about to murder . From the lips , now cold in death , had been learned what occurred in that narrow staircase . Dealing him a blow with what Mr. Noe believed to be a " jimmy , " the assassin had billowed it up with a more convenient and effective instrument , the deadly paintlion . It was not to be supposed that the burglar had expected to meet air . Aoe or any other person in that building on such a day and at such an hour . He went there to steal property . Mr. Phelps vividly depicted the souffle in the dark . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible hour on the following morning , while Mr. Black was taking down his shutters , the prisoner entered his store and offered tor sale a watch . He received for this watch 00 , according to Mr. Black 's statement ; t35 by Ins own admission . The sale had been effected ? where 1 Not at a pawnbroker 's , for it would then have been liable to discovery by the police , who would have had access to a licensed pawnbroker 's . No ; he wisely took it to an Milten:wed pawnbroker , a loan broker , a receiver of stolen property . Counsel then scouted the idea that Dolan had been accompanied oy any one to the " loan " broker 's . No one know that Mr. Noe 's watch was at Aaron Black 's until that person produced it . Superintendent Walling bad obtained from him a description of Dolan and promulgated it to his force . Alter days and nights of watching Dolan was found . He wag not at first charged with the commission of the crime of murder , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he had obtained the watch , and had endeavored to trace Peter Thompson . When found , Debut said " No , this is not the man  --  it is some other man , " and so on , Mali at ' last they besatne satisfied that Dolan was the sole man eugaged in the crime , " That cold scarred face , " which Mr. Noe and described , was the same that had confronted the Jury during the trial and had attempted to gain his liberty by his lying stories . Independent facts all connected and pointed to the prisoner . Counsel said that he had little faith in the power of description . He had frequently endeavored to , remember how his most intimate friends wore their hair or whiskers , but had never been able to do so with any degree of accuracy . The evidence against the prisoner would have been complete , even if the testimony of the two unfortunate arts had not boon taken . Having the meshes of the law around him he sought to escape by falsehood . In conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate man , but to ask the jury to follow the dictates ot their own consciences under their oaths . Such persons us wished to retire were thetsafforded the opportunity , after which his Honor proceeded to charge the jury . He first defined the different degrees of murder , explicitly stating that the commission of murder during the commission of a felcuy constituted murder in the first degree . This was the crime of the person who assassinated Mr. Noe . In his building were goods exposed for sage . It had been proved that the store doors and scuttle had been securely fastened , and that they had boon broken open on the morning of Sunday , Aug. 22 . The interview with his wife and dying declaration of Mr. Noe showed thin  --  his hearing a notes , going to the scuttle , and on inquiring who was there being answered by the person confronted ; that he was a thief , and that whoever he was he took Mr. Noe 's watch . Was that person entering the building for the purpose of theft , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Noe 1 . If the jury thought such was the case , they must render a verdict of murder in the first degree . The prosecution claimed that this person was the prisoner at the bar , and they rested their suspicion on a chain of circumstantial evidence . The law , in the case of direct evidence or where the commission of the crime was witnessed , provided that all the jury had to do was to weigh the testimony . Atter all , the law had sufficient force for this emergency , and allowed twelve men on the bench to say whether the facts in the case pointed necessarily toward the prisoner . After carefully reviewing the testimony adduced on both sides , his Honor . concluded as follows ; If there be a doubt , calmly dissect it with your minds fixed upon the testimony ; It is all important that no guilty person Shall escape by this means . If the prisoner is guilty he ought to be punished as a warning to all persona who feloniously enter our dwellings and stores . Whatever your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence and not on fiction or story . The jury passed out todeliberate at 4:50 . Thirteen minutes later they had - agreed and returned to the court . In response to the usual question &be; foreman responded , " We find , the prisoner at the bar ' guilty of -. murder . in the first degree . " At . this ennouneement ? Dolan turned : impatiently from the foreman , at sivhoin be. , had , been looking , sun gazed aillealy through the window at . the rear of the bench . He showed no emotion , and was a subject of wonder to all concerned . A deathly silence prevailed in the room for the space of a minute , which was broken ty Mr. Howe , who requested that the jury be polled . This was done , each member in his tarn responding " Guilty . " Mr. Howe then asked for a " stay of judgments " on a plea of abatement , based on the allegation that the Grand Jury which found the indictment and the jury which convicted Dolan were illegally constituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was not the legal Commissioner of Jurors . Judo Barrett overruled the plea , and Mr. Howe asked to have his exception noted . Under Sheriff Cummins was then summoned , and Dolan was asked to stand up and say , if he could , why sentence should not be pronounced upon him . He simply shook his head in the negative . and Counselor Howe . having reiterated his previous request , Judge Barrett sentenced the prisoner to be hanged in the City Prison , on Friday , Dec. 10 . The Under Sheriff then removed the prisoner , who was still apparently indifferent ? to his sentence , end the court adjourned . Mary Reed was led from the court-room weeping bitterly , the only one who was affected to tears .
