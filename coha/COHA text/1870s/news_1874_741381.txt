txt The bill entitled an act to declare the publication and dissemination of false news a crime , which was introduced at Albany by Senator JAcous a day or two since , had its origin with the Governing Committee of the New-York Stock Exchange . This action of the Exchange was induced by the serious results as to the standing of that association , caused by the recent introduction of the forged letters relative to the Western Union Telegraph Company and . the Toledo , Wabash and Western Railroad , and for the alleged perpetration of which Mr. E. D. MoKAY is now under bail to appear for examination . It was found that a warrant in this case could lie issued only on a charge of conspiracy to defraud , and in order to enable action to be taken in the future in matters of this kind , based upon a graver charge , the bill referred to was prepared . By the provisions of the bill , any person who shall knowingly circulate false intelligence , with the intent of depreciating or advancing the market price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stocks or bonds of any corporation or association , or of any merchandise or commodity whatever , shall be declared guilty of a misdemeanor , and shall be punished upon conviction thereof by a fine of not exceeding $5,000 , and by imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years . The bill further provides that every person who shall forge the name of any officer of any corporation to any letter , message , or paper whatever , with intent to advance or depreciate the market price of the public funds , or the market price of bonds or stock issued by any corporation , or of gold or silver coin , &c.,; shall upon conviction be adjudged guilty of forgery in the third degree , and shall be punished . by imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years . It would seem that the passage of this bill was needed in order to thoroughly protect those interested ; and the Stock Exchange shows by its effinis in this way , and by the adoption of a system of official brokers ' contracts , and also by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members are earnestly desirous to do all that is possible to keep its standing as a business body up to a high mark . Should the bill pass , a strong safeguard for the future will have been obtained .
