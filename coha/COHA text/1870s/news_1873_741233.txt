txt While Japan is pressing forward with rapid strides in the paths of modern civilization , her neighbor and rival , China , is by no means standing still , At the Foochow Arsenal there has now for some years been in progress work on a large scale , looking to the creation of a steam navy for China , constructed on the most approved plans yet devised by modern science . The chef artificers at the arsenal are mostly Europeans or Americans of approved skill , and the work they have so far turned out has been commended as of the best quality by experienced judges . The contract in force with the Chinese Government provides for the construction of sixteen steamers between October , 1867 , and February , 1874 . Of these , eleven are now afloat , and . since one , a corvette of 250 horse-power , is to count as two by a special arrangement , only four more of the sixteen are to be launched . Of these , two are almost ready to leave the ways , and the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished have been distributed among the different ports of Newchwang , Tientsin , Canton , Amoy , Ningpo , and . Chefoo ; and all the work on them has been done in China , except the building of the engines , which were sent out from Europe . The new corvette , - which is the first real man-of-war the Chinese have ever yet had , is quite a formidable craft . She is 200 feet long , with 37 feet beam , and carries eleven Whitworth guns , namely , one 150-pound. pivot , two 70-pound pivot , and eight 70-pound broadside . Her maximum speed , under steam , is 14.29 knots ; her mean speed , 13 ; her maximum , with half boilers , 11 ; mean , 10.50 , and her full capacity , under sail and steam , 16 knots . The captain and crew are native Chinese ; . the former being old .

" Hence , schools were attached to the arsenal , and at present there are three schools of construction , including a Naval School of Theoretical and Practical Navigation , in which we infer pupils will learn ho'w to handle a ship when not " in sight of land . " The latter school is held on board a training-ship commanded by an officer of the British Navy , and he speaks , it is said , in high terms of the intelligence and docility of the young Chinese under his charge . It thus appears that whatever the degree of insularity or exclusiveness the Chinese may choose to cultivate on laud , their relations to the outer world on the sea may become very different . At present their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smuggling . But it is altogether unlikely that , after they once discover the scope and power of a steam marine for extending and guarding national trade on the ocean , they will refuse to profit by its advantages . Their schools are to ' be kept lip after the contract time of next year falls in , and fresh ships are to be laid down as soon as the keels of the stipulated sixteen steamers are under water . That other work will soon be cut out for all these swift vessels we may be sure , and we may be equally certain that , whatever strength may be attained by the Chinese steam navy , Japan will , of necessity , put a fleet afloat fit to cope with it . Probably , in no remote future , these great Oriental Powers will become naval rivals , just as England and . Holland were two hundred years ago ; and we may even live to hear of engagements between them off Yokohama or in the Hoang-ho , like those that thundered near The Hague or the Thames in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Vox TROMP sailed up channel with a broom at his masthead.
