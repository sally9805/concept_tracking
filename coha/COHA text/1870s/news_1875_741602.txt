txt The " sensation " of yesterday was the appearance of Mr. BEECHER as a witness on his own behalf . Nothing very striking or with much bearing on the case was elicited from him ; but his account of his earlier life and . of his labors heightens the interest ? of the trial and will be read with eagerness . It is a strauge , impressive sight to see this man , who not long since was regarded with a feeling akin to worship by more of his countrymen , probably , ' than ever had that feeling for one man , except - in the cases of WASHINGTON and JACKSON and HENRY CLAY  --  to see him , whose eminence was a moral as well as an intellectual eminence , appear as the defendant in a case the least revolting , if not the least criminal part , of which is the specific offense with which he is charged - by the plaintiff . For there is no need for refraining from allusion to the fact that on the supposition that Mr. BEECHER is guilty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole conduct in that case , the acts which would indicate the most depravity , are those committed since the alleged crime for which he is now virtually on trial . " What , " said a Congressman , on reaching his New-England home , to the venerable Pastor of his Congregational Church , " what do you think of this Beecher business , Dr. ? ? I have n't been able to follow the trial . " " Nor have L I have n't wanted to . Its a dreadful business . It makes me sick to think of it . " " What ! do you think Mr. Beecher is guilty ? " " Oh , no I 'm not at all sure of that . But I wish he were guilty , ' and that were all . It would be a cleaner thing . " It is to the credit of the community that a feeling somewhat akin to this is so very general . The recognition of the possibility of even a great and good man 's erring , without thereby losing all his greatness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his whole nature  --  the feeling of charity which would lead to the forgiveness of a sin candidly confessed and heartily repented of  --  is a manifestation of a healthy and Christian-like sentiment in the public mind . But the other feeling  --  that a sacrifice of honor , of truth , and of the happiness and reputations of half a dozen other men and women , in the endeavor to avoid . such confession and repentance , is worse than the first offense , deepening and blackening it almost beyond the power of words to tell ? this feeling is also healthy and not unchristian . Among the remarkable matters connected in one way or another with this trial , hardly any one has been more striking than the very different impression which the evidence has produced . upon different individuals . We do not refer to those who were prejudiced beyond . the power of evidence or argument before the trial began ; neither to the blind Beecher-worshipers of Plymouth Church , nor to the ? uek. of shallow , unclean , scoffers who rejoiced. at seeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they themselves were wallowing . We have in mind rather the thoughtful , tte well-informed , the honorable-minded men who felt real pain when this scandal took a shape which compelled Mr. BEECHER to meet it , and who would all now gladly see him come out of it with his reputation as stainless as it was ten years ago . Upon this class of men it is remarkable that the evidence thus far , when they have read it - carefully , has produced directly opposite impressions . You will meet two men who you would think could not disagree widely upon a question of evidence , and particularly when it was of a moral nature , who will yet . hold diametrically opposite views of what the testimony has thus far established ; one declaring that he sees no reason whatever to believe that the defendant committed the offense alleged ; the other convinced beyond a doubt of his guilt . But , ' of course , all this was based upon a partly heard case . The evidence is widely and attentively read ; but men keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion as the trial has advanced have kept their feelings and . their judgments cool ; so that a very large proportion of those who have already come to some conclusion upon the evidence will declare that they are ? yet so unprejudiced that they could sit upon the jury to-morrow , and be ready to acquit or convict according to the weight of the testimony yet to be produced . This is also creditable to the condition of the public mind . The difference of conclusion arises largely from the moral quality of so much of the evidence . The facts sworn to are not bare facts as in most criniinal trials or civil issues ; they are looked upon in their moral bearing on the position of the plaintiff or the defendant . Therefore they take their tinge in the eye of judgment less from the merely logical aspect in which they would otherwise appear than from the moral and even the aesthetic nature of those who consider them . But this doubtful or disputed state of feeling is rapialy to be resolved into something more decided in character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax of the case . When he leaves Mr. FamarroN 's hands , his fate , in the mind of the general public , will be decided . And for our parts , we retain the hope that Mr. BEECHER will prove his innocence , for they are a bad lot with whom he has allowed his good name to be injuriously mixed up .
