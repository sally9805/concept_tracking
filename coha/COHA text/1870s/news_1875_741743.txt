txt There is a deal of uncertainty about the action of the Republican Convention at Worcester next Wednesday , and there are very marked feelings of uneasiness among the Republicans , especially those who are classed as politicians . It is admitted that the Democrats have put a strong ticket in the field , and in good shape , and it is felt that the Republicans , to offset it , must do their best in the way of nominations . That this best will not be done is the fear . The campaign has been conducted by many of the party papers in a ' very impolitic manner , and the result has been a widening of the breach between the factions of the party , rather than a healing of old . wounds . It was realized at the opening of the campaign that only through the union of the whole party on a strong candidate for Governor could the State be brought back to its proper place on the Republican side , and this was industriouily talked until it was discovered that Dr. George B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nomination . Then a bitter warfare was begun against him . Threats were made to bolt , and there was a vigorous throwing of mud until a state of affairs was brought about quite resembling that when Butler made his famous raid on the Governorship . Loring and Rice have been the prominent candidates from the moment Mr. Talbot withdrew his name , and now they stand even , with perhaps a slight lead by the Doctor , though it is claimed by their partisans that each is considerably ahead of the other . Both are popular with many , and unpopular with many others . Loring 's record is brought up against him as a bitter Democrat while he was a Democrat , and a seeker for office , while Rice is assailed as the Boston candidate representing the city as against the country , the " aristocrats " as against the masses , and ready , just before the war , to give the S uth the protection they demanded for their slave property . That both are assailed unfairly Is the fact , but this will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stirring up bad blood generally . Just now a strong and shrewdly-managed move is making for a third candidate . A large number of delegates , more than one-third , are sent to the convention without instructions , and though many of them are partial to either one or the other of the leading candidates , it is thought that they can be influenced , and that with them and the luke-warm. supporters of either Loring or Rice , a combination can be formdd for a third candidate , and that candidate Charles Francis Adams . Mr. Adams is not popular , and is not regarded as a Republican in good standing ; and against him piecisely the same objeetious are urged as against Mr. Rice . But he has the support of some of the shrewdest operators and managers in the party lines , and these are the men who are working in his interest . Others will have their friends in the convention . Within a few days the maim ; of Judge Colt , of Pittsfield , has beau mentioned as one who would call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the western part of the State . Judge Devens has been again urged to run , but he positively declines , and ex-Gov . Bullock , and Gen. Bartlett , the candidate for Lieutenant Governor on the Democratic ) ticket , have been spoken of . But the only substantial movement is , at the present time , entirely in the interest of Adams . The Loring men propose to have a much larger number of delegates determined to vote for their candidate , and they declare their determination to stand by him to the end . His friends also believe that many of the uncommitted delegates can be brought to vote for him , when they realize his strength , and that they can overcome both the Ries and the Adams forces . Mr. Rico has been importuned to withdraw by many influential Republicans within the last day or two , and it is not unlikely that he will before the convention assembles , though his friends at present declare their intention to stand as firm as Dr. Loring 's . The friends of both these candidates have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both put out bulletins of the standing of the delegates as fast as they are chosen , which are remarkable , each claiming a decided majority for its favorite candidate . Since the caucuses began there has been some marvelous figuring about the minor offices on the ticket , but little has been thus far heard . It is quite probable that the example of the Democrats will be followed . to some extent , and that several new men will be nominated . Of the platform nothing whatever has been heard , and that question will not be considered until to-morrow night , at Worcester . A hot night before the convention is anticipated . The head-quarters of the rival candidates will be transferred from Boston to the Bay State House to-morrow afternoon , and will be established in the spacious parlors on the second . floor . which have - been the scene of memorable contests in years gone by . Ben . Butler will be there as an unpledged delegate , bent on all the mischief he can find . to do of foment . Henry Wilson will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony . The convention is likely to be one well worth seeing .
