THE RIGHT NOT TO VOTE . EVE nas some cause to look twice at a plausible proffer of advantage . Her children have double cause to watch with jealous anxiety her deliberations in such a case . She can not act for herself , for she incloses the race . All the types of destiny are shaped in the matrix of her decisions . It would not be very fanciftil to describe the present as the crisis of * Second Temptation . The banble of power now bends to the same hand as did the fruit of knowledge , and " Ye shall be as gods , " is again the assurance of the tempter . The iron subjection and sorrow into which the first counsel of ambition beguiled the common mother has been borne for sixty centuries , and at last the emancipator stands before her , ready to strike off the chain and bid her accept at once equality , freedom , and power . We do not overstate the liberal purpose of the age . christ ' s own mission " to proclaim liberty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that are bound , " is not broader ( temporally ) than the theory of equality which has become the Gospel 's grandest offshoot in its second spring . No such thing as arbitrary privilege or privation has a living root left in the future . MAN alone is crowned , and his accidents , birth , wealth , learning , color , sex , are everywhere getting ready to cast their crowns at his feet . In all prerogative , he must increase , they must decrease . For there is recognized in the soul itself that which is above all it has done . It inherits of the dignity of its Author , and can have no other superior . To define the lure divi , zo sovereign of this world , it is only necessary to ascertain who is a Man . We may safely assume this as the funiamental political criterion of the world that is to be . No matter if the weight of opinion be still in favor of the doctrine that political power is a providential trust , never to be conceded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Regardless of authority and expediency , the democratic mass of mankind everywhere feels that the common birthright of equal liberty involves equal prerogatives of l ) Ower , and is a gift of too high origin and quality for man to confer or withhold . It follows that the natural right of any human being to take part ii*political elections can be challenged only on the ground of incompleteness in manhood. * The l ) ractical right can be de-nied only in the case of one alien to the community and interests concerned , or in some way l ) resumably incapable of performing the intelligential act of election . Considering , therefore , that equality has fotight its decisive battle and is the established creed of the future , it is not too much to say that the temptation of power approaches the female sex as closely and as plausibly as did that of forbidden knowledge . It comes in as a necessary incident of the progress of political eqtiity the most perilous career into which mankind have ever launched , insomuch as the towers and possibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented and enormous . It matters not whether the proposition be ultimately put to a direct vote of women , as seems to be anticipated by many , or whether it shall be decided through the votes of men alone . Whether in their own persons , or through the agency of their brothers , as hitherto , women will participate in the decision of this question and all other questions in which their rights and interests are concerned . It is too late in the day to think of carrying measures or sustaining laws in which wonien // are especially concerned , over the heads of women , if indeed such a thing were ever possible under Christian civilization . All who are exercised concerning real or supposed wrongs of women , such as legislation or public opinion can reach , may make themselves easy . No public wrong whatever can now long withstand the forces of discussion and organization , wielded by or in behalf of any iml ) ortant fraction of the body politic . And above all other possible fractions , that , to men at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not , be l ) ermanently wronged or dissatisfied by the arrangements of society . Wielding always , in this country at least , a power in all departments which , if conscious of itself , could but smile at the feeble alliance of the ballot , women will have this additional power very easily as soon as they conclude to take it . The only question remaining , therefore , and the only inquiry here proposed , is this What is the interest , honor , and duty of women , in regard to assuming an identical position with men ? The question is evidently a question for women . It is certainly time for women to take it up seriously , consider it thoroughly , and express themselves upon it authentically . There are persons who assume to deliver the opinion and demand of the female sex . Women , it is true , reject for themselves , and justly , the *coinmon rule that silence gives consent . It i6 their right not to be forced to speak . Still , the determined effort to personate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex is suspected to be rather a disguise , requires the principals coml ) romised by the proceedings to scrutinize and dispose of them in a way of unmistakable authority . They begin to recognize this necessity . A very few have led forward in behalf of their sex , and if in some way the expense of canvassing and organizing the silent sentiment of women were but l ) rovided for , very instructive and indeed convincing ( leveloplilents might be realized . Perhaps this will come of itself soon enough , and in a way of its own . Discussion , meanwhile , is yet needed , to give consciousness , consistency , and decision to the sentiments of right-minded women . It is superfluous to add that we address ourselves to women in what we have to advance on this subject . Everything that is said upon the subject is necessarily addressed to women , mediately or immediately , and from them must get its answer in the end . The right to vote , then , need detain us no longer . The question is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the various masculine functions which women are invited to assume , this title is broad enough to cover the whole debate . Have women such negative right , and is it for their interest , honor , and usefulness to waive it , or to insist upon it ? There is certainly no such right for men . Men must vote , as soldiers must fight . Popular suffrage is an arsenal thrown open to the public enemy . It coml ) els good citizens to arm likewise , in defense . The worst of it is that the modern repeating arms are for the l ) ublic enemy exclusively . So far , women on both sides are non-combatants . Throw open the arsenal to them also , and you at once put another hostile army in the field as strong as the first ( for every 1 ) ad man has somewhere a bad woman for his mate ) , and every virtuous woman then must fight by the side of every loyal man . Have they not a right to decline this necessity while they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) aired off . Their common abstinence does not affect the vote either way . Sha4l the zeal or ambition of a minority be allowed to break this truce , and plunge the whole sex , against their will , into a conflict from which none can be exeml ) t and which never will end ? It must be conceded thaL women have a right to consider this question in the light of their own general interests , and to decide for themselves , as a body , whether they will be made voters , and otherwise masculine , or not . The natural right of the individual must be subordinated here , as everywhere , to the l ) aramount rights of the whole . No individual right can be exercised to the injury of another , and much less to the injury of the many . There is no right in the world which is not subject to this limitation . The question must , therefore , be submitted to the decision of the majority , at least of women themselves . Not a woman can be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lividual assuml ) tion of the right until the whole have decided to submit to the change . Nobody will dispute this position who is not l ) rel ) ared for absolute individualism and anarchy . Is it best for women , as a body , to accept and assume an identical position with men , in each or any of the three great spheres of life , social , civil , and political ? The social sphere we shall understand to include all relations between human beings which are not established by law . Conventional agreement , or public opinion , is the law of this sphere . Here women are nearly omnipotent . Whatever conventional rules or prujudices restrain them // are their own . Men themselves learn all their views of feminine propriety ultimately from women . The sex will therefore approach this part of the question in a peculiarly independent , or say rather sovereign , attitude . Whatever they agree to will be accomplished in the act of agreement . And the power and efficacy of social action immeasurably transcends that of all civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former . The man is not more effectively shaped in the womb and in the home than the parts and processes of the j ) ublic orcranism are shaped in the vital stir of private society or personal intercourse . How far will the position of women be iml ) roved by exchanging it for that of men , or assimilating it to that of men , in society ? The material peculiarities which distinguish the social position of men from that of women resolve themselves into these two ( i ) the burden of supporting themselves and families ; and ( 2 ) the burden of carrying on the public , professional , and material business of the world . For the bulk of this work men alone generally hi*ve by nature the proper faculties , such at least as physical strength , boldness , and enterprise . But for all of it , the law of self-dependence peculiar to them as men is a necessary condition , as enforcing the life-long application which is in most cases indispensable to success . In exceptional cases , women voluntarily embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protection as happen to them . Nearly all women , however , have preferred husbands and children , such as they could get , to all other objects . From this thorough experiment , elucidated by what we have been able to learn of their nature , we ( men ) feel warranted in the comfortable , not to say flattering , expectation that women will generally continue to give us the preference , and to yield their indispensable good-will to the perpetuation of our species , to the end of time . Could we even waive the solaces of home and children and wonian s love , yet the conception of a planet depopulated and left to wiser animals , that the mother of men might dedicate herself to the procluction of laws , books , arts , and works of art , for which , alas , their dumb inheritors would have no use , is a conception too repugnant to all rational ends of creation and providence to be possible . We mention this , and with the utniost seriousness , because it is too often forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a delicate one in civilized ceuntries ; that in many l ) laces it is al ready on the side of death ; and that as a small change in the inclination of the earth'a axis would convert our blooming lands into lifeless wastes of perpetual ice and snow , so a little general shifting of the burdens of active life upon our women would depress procreative action sufficiently to extinguish our own branch of the race , at least , within a moderate period of time . We conclude , therefore , that self-dependence will not become the rule for women until it shall be the l ) leasure of Providence to exterminate us , and that women will be the least willing executioners of such a decree . Until then , the imperative condition of success in all arts , professions , and businesses - that is , self-dependence , forcing an unalterable and undivided application for life-will be exceptional among women , as now . The cause which makes many employments masculine in practice , which are not distinctively such in character , is this necessity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed in competition with those who can and must give their lives to them . Exceptional women are often foun .1 to break the ice of precedent and custom in such matters , and to make for themselves * place among men by a man-like choice and endeavor . But nothing less than a general compulsion to selfsupport , which if inflicted upon women would be equivalent to the extinction of civilized man , can ever naturalize in the sex any of the learned professions or of the more difficult arts , handicrafts and commercial employments , to such extent that a female expert will be less* than a prominent exception . Such a generai compulsion of women to self-support would be a return to heathen barbarism of the most brutal tyl ) e . Possibly the ladies may correct us , but to our own humble perception there is , after this single remark , nothing left of apparent interest or honor to the female sex in the transfer of the arts and professions to their side , or rather in the transfer of the female sex to the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own living independently , of which so much is said by some . There is no peculiar honor in independence . There is something quite the contrary , in fact . The only honor that belongs to independence is that of being useful to others in due proportion to what we receive from them , or in common language , paying one 's way . No one enjoys that honor more perfectly than a good wife , mother , or daughter , who never touched a penny of wages or profit in her life . But a further honor is enjoyed in those positions of a nature which mankind have always // agreed to regard as the highest they can bestow . Royalty , priesthood , and official station are honored with support at public expense . These conditions are imperfectly honored , however , in this way , because services are exacted as an equivalent for support . The relation partakes of that of a hireling , in which the abs*ence of honor is absolute . But when the never-to-be-recompensed services of a great soldier , in the crisis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no consideration of what is to be got from him in return for his pension or salary . His services may be nominal , or nil , but his public support is ( or should be ) princely ; not so much for his own sake as for the sake of public virtue and of humanity . Now this sort of position alone bears an analogy to that of the woman in the family . There is enough of coarseness , grudging , and haggling debate about what is yielded in Congress to the national benefactors , and in the family to the wife and mother : there is enough of all this in the manner , and enough of uttermost stinginess in the matter , of what is done in both cases , to disgust the benefactors and disgrace the beneficiaries , arid in a superficial point of view almost to pervert the whole tribute to an insult . But the bottom fact remains that an obligation is recognized , however shabbily . Homage is paid perforce to a right of unconditional support ; and if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by human society ( save that obedience which is due only to God ) , we know not what can be the form of it . The individual man may contemn and oppress his wife ; but society commands him to support her , irrespective of her usefulness to him , and in effect authorizes her to take her support , according to his ability , wherever she can get it , from his substance or his credit , whether she does anything to deserve it or not . It is enough that she is a wife : that of itself is her plenary title . In so requiring , Christian society recognizes in wifehood a dignity such as it recognizes nowhere else on earth . In that very dependence ( as contempt prefers to put it ) which some inconsiderate women resent so loudly , Christian society exalts the wife and her office above every other human character and station . It expresses in its broad , rough-hewn phrase of fact the sincere homage which takes living form in every manly heart and crowns the wife and mother as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuberant halo so far around her as to invest her daughters with a secondary sanctity . All genuiii*e manhood has a jealous repugnance to the soiling of a wife 's or daughter 's hand with hire . And of all the aristocracies , where is that which the supposed degradation of self-support cuts so keenly , so universally , as the aristocracy of domestic womanhood ? Yet where is the democracy whose voluntary service is so cheerful , so lowly , even extreme , as that of the same proud caste ? Long may this pride flourish ! We can half forgive , though we would not excuse , the folly of daughters who so commonly carry their sense of womanly dignity to the false extreme of feeling ashamed to work for wages when paternal poverty renders it needful , dutiful , and hence honorable . Though a mistaken or even hateful sentiment , it has its root in a genuine instinct of woman 's dignity and " woman 's rights . " The ideals of society are far above the statutes in which they are imperfectly suggested . Statutes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a minimum standard of morality . The theory of Christian law is very high ; and although its statutory development steadily tends to higher forms , the theory must not be sought on the actual low level of the statutes or of the vulgar usage . We have , therefore , no more than justly , resorted to the better sentiment of men , for the true interpretation of their meaning in binding themselves to the support of women , and we have found this interpretation decisively confirmed by the nature of the provisions they have made for their purpose . On the same ground we deny the crude theory that support is exacted for wives , as for children or slaves , because their civil existence is merged alike in that of the husband , father , or master , so that the law looks to him , as the only responsible party whom it knows , to prevent them fi-om becoming a public charge . There may be truth in this aspect of the case , but it is only a small part of the truth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to be covered by this explanation , or to be compared with that of children or slaves . It is also steadily growing broader and freer ( as there is admitted room for it to do ) by the vital efficacy of the principle we have attributed to it . Besides this , there are no counter provisions , as with children and slaves , for enforcing subjection and service upon the wife which shall make good the expense of her support . Duties on her part , to husband and family , are indeed recognized , as Heaven forbid they should not be ; but no other means of enforcing such duties are given by law to the husband than to the wife , save as they may linger , like tenacious roots and stumps // of pre-Christian barbarism , in the more backward political communities . A man may lawfully chastise his son , or bind him out to a master , to enforce his service in recompense for his support . Or he may bring him before a magistrate and have him punished for contumacy , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Or he may expel him from his house , and the son will have no direct remedy at law . All this is disallowed by the law in respect to a wife . He may not , without cause , even go away from her peaceably , leaving her in his own house to enjoy it alone . The superior happiness and dignity of marital rather than independent support for women being established , as well as its absolute necessity to the race from the lowest to the highest considerations  --  a necessity we must leave our readers to consider for themselves - we return to the question , or rather to the form of the question , which still remains and chiefly exercises earnest minds , viz. : How to deal with the exceptional cases , the unmarried , the unmarriageable , and the unwilling to marry . The trials of these classes originate most of the agitation . There are always on hand , too , a large class of active and ardent spirits who take it for granted that for every wrong and infelicity there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanthropist of this kind that a law aimed at an evil will fail to reach it , or will overturn with the evil a greater good , or will establish in exchange for the first evil another still worse . It is necessary to realize that evil and sore evil is incurable in an evil world , and that beyond very narrow limits the utmost that is left us to effect is the exchange of one evil fqr another , and the choice of the least . So it is in the matter of providing for single women . The gravest evil connected with single women is their singleness , for it implies single men , and both together , on a large scale , constitute one of the most unhealthy conditions of society . Could we remedy this !  --  but at least we must not aggravate this . The most of mankind would sooner punish than encourage bachelors ; but we all sympathize with single women , and , so far as they are concerned , would gladly make their lot as independent as it is inconvenient . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that , could we satisfy it , we should instantly multiply both the classes of single persons whose singleness is the greatest of misfortunes at once to themselves and to society ? We do not refer to recruits of celibacy who would otherwise have been constrained by its terrors to submit to ineligible marriages . We have no desire to keep up arrangements foi forcing women to accept husbands . But in. dependence and the processes of independence do even more to render women ineligible for marriage than indifferent to it . It is unnecessary here to inquire whether this ought to be or not to be . It is the fact to be met .. Be it a true instinct or a discreditable weakness , it is certain that all men find a charm in girlish siml*licity and softness , while they shrink from the self-poised and self-sufficing woman of affairs , with something akin to preternatural dread . The slightest tinge of business in a woman 's air demagnetizes her . It is useless to reason or to rail : this weakness , or whatever it be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the changing phases of human nature , men have given no sign of amendment in this respect ; and , bad as it is , we really think the women might do worse than to take them as they are , and give up reforming them . At this point our sex-reformers exhibit to advantage that remarkable unconsciousness of the higher characteristics of men as well as of women , which distinguishes them at all* times . Those ladies are far from masculine , or even remotely acquainted with the n*asculine nature , we should say ( unless in its baser forms ) , who take it for granted and steadily assure us that women will better their prospects of marriage by proving their capacity to take care of themselves and their husbands too . They may be as well qualified as anybody to argue the abstract question whether woman ought to be supported by man , and they are entitled to their individual preference on the same point , so far as they are personally concerned . But they lack the first condition for a practical argument-acquaintance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature has certified her intention in this matter by endowing the adult male portion of mankind not only with ample ability to support all the rest , women and children , but with a spontaneous impulse to do so , and even to insist on doing so , which is one of the most remarkable facts in human nature . We shall probably be told that this , too , is a perversion . If so , it is a perversion nourished by Christianity and enjoined by its apostles . It is a perversion most perfect where ver the sexual attraction in men is purest , gentlest , most ennobled , and is wholly imperceptible only under the brutal phase of savageism  --  to which we should speedily descend , without further motive , under a system of sex independence and equality which gave women no unconditional right to si*pport in* // the conjugal relation . The women who decry sentiments of generosity between the sexes , and cry mightily for justice as something more sacred and more serviceable , would , like another noted lover of justice , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man who married an Irish servant to save hiring one , illustrated the peculiar advantage to be expected in matrimony by the independent woman , and the style of husband her business qualities are likely to win-yes , and to develop , on a general scale , proportioned to the extent of self-dependence among women . On the other hand , wherever a genuine specimen of natural manly affection for woman can be taken , it will be found upon strict analysis that the master impulse is that of protection rather than possession , while considerations of advantage are held in utter contempt . The chief happiness of the lover and of the husband alike is expected and found in the strange l ) ieasure of carrying a certain woman and her children in ease through life by his own life-long toil . It was a home-thrust of some cynical wit who rallied our young men upon their overmastering desire to pay for some young woman 's board . This noble rage is said to have fallen of late years , at least relatively to the rising board and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which women are deluging us does not a little , doubtless , towards extinguishing it . But do we really wish to extinguish it ? Jt is thoroughly woman-like to toss the head at masculine help when l ) ut as a consideration per se-as much so as it is to receive it with delight in the acceptable form of courtesy or love . But , rising above 1 ) ersonal feeling ( for the question is not here put to any woman as a personal one ) , will our women soberly consent , in their regard for the true welfare and nobleness of their brothers , husbands , and sons , to do anything which shall tend to educate them to a less generous sentiment or habit of mind in this matter ? Our sincerest natural sentiments are products of social culture , in their perfection , and are capable , like other growths , of perishing under adverse in4luences or neglect . The ruder sort of men in a Christian community , ignorant it may be of any chivalrous sentiment toward women , are nevertheless unconsciously impressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , as decided as their betters in preferring wives for whom they must earn , to wives who will earn for them . It may be taken for granted , without argument , that the interest of marriage is the fundamental interest of society , to which all individual or exceptional considerations must bow . In considering what shall be done for single women or single men , or any other class of human beings related as a class to the family or marriage state , we must rule out of consideration in advance whatever will discourage or deteriorate matrimony on the general scale , and we must be extremely careful , in choosing modes of amelioration for abnormal conditions , to avoid if possible whatever tends to extend such conditions . We should aim to apply to the celibacy of women a double remedy , ameliorating it by means which will tend at the same time to diminish it , rather than a palliative which will re-invigorate the disorder in its cause . Now that cause is plainly and simply the ihdisposition of a large proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely balanced numbers of the two sexes . The way to aggravate the evil is accordingly plain : anything that will diminish the charms of women in the eyes of men , and increase the dread or distrust of matrimony which now keeps so many bachelors useless in the world and so many spinsters forlorn . Equally simple , again , in general terms , is the remedy : Whatever exalts women in the estimation and affection of men rather than in their own conceit , whatever increases not their earnings but their charms , whatever gives them power not in markets and caucuses but in hearts , will improve the condition of the majority of sin* gle women in just the way they would prefer ; will quite as much improve the condition of an equal number of single men ; will make it easy for the inevitable remainder to provide for themselves ; and will be a twofold benefit to society , by at once multiplying families and increasing their happiness . Since the attraction to marriage is generally depeiident on the same qualities which make amiable companions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially del ) endent on marriage and maternity , the equation may be reduced to simple and correct terms by saying that the grand interest and vocation of women is to persuade men to marry . Society looks to them for this high service , and there is nobody else to perform it , for nature has placed the means entirely in their hands . The means placed in their hands are noble and beneficient also in themselves . Such is their beauty , which in its merely direct action is worth more to man than all the other beauty with which the Creator has adorned the world ; and it is in their own har ds more than they think , not // indeed to deface with pigments and other artificial contrivances , but to irradiate with health , culture , and grace . Such are their modesty , their purity , their gentleness , their tender ministries . Such , too , are their utilitarian virtues , domestic skill , taste , and economy , without the aid of which neither happiness , prosperity , nor virtue are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control men by their feelings , reason , and interest at once . They not only induce marriage , but make it happy when contracted , give it a good report among them that are without , and certain of them ( which is no small matter in these days ) render it not impracticable toi men to marry and sul ) l ) ort families . In all this woman is the artist of society , whose works are as far above art as a child is more and more beautiful than a picture of one . The instinctive study of women to attract the preference of men , and to make and keep for themselves a happy settlement in life , is worthy of all honor , so far as it is controlled by modesty and good sense , whether we consider its motive , its means , or its effect ; and we are bound to say that the women who take so much pains to pour contempt UI ) Ofl this sort of husbandry , " speak evil of things which they understand not . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of statesmen and philanthropists , and why is it not worthy of a simple maiden , younger or older , we should like to know ? But while it is undoubtedly the first object set before every woman by nature and reason to achieve a husband , a home and a family for her own , the questiGn still remains , what to do with those who must fail in this object , or who will not attempt it . Must they suffer as victims on the family altar ? Or is there no way to better their condition apparently , without making it really worse ? XVe purpose to answer this question both favorably and definitely . But first , there are two minor reasons to be added for rejecting the remedy by confiscation of masculine employments . Women and children are the chief stockholders , so to speak , who are to suffer in property by such confiscation . We can not make additional places for the women who l ) *Ol ) O5* to enter the masculine callings they must make room for themselves by displacing men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , broker , or politician ( supposing such a thing ) were to make an old bachelor of the very man who would have sought her hand most acceptably if she had not thrust herself into his place and character . Undoubtedly , every such instance of success must thwart some woman s chance of domestic happiness or curtail its material resources . The general effect of the transfer of work must be to diminish marriages by diminishing the average of men 's resources . Women will do with toil and solitude and sorrow the work that men would have been glad to do for them as wives , and so will have their labor and much worse for their pains . In the second place , the enlargement of women 's employment and remuneration has in very small l ) roportion gone to better the condition of the votaries or victims of celibacy . It is a fact worthy of the most serious attention from such as take an interest in the condition of self-dependent women , that the hulk of all that is earned to-day by female labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls who are not strictly in need of employment . Few , that is , comparatively , are orl ) hans or adult single women , who have no other resource than their labor . A large majority are young girls ! iving with their parents , and required to spend the years which might and should be devoted to education in earning their quota of the family sul ) port or savings . The philanthropy expended in devising employment for lone females goes , like alms given to juvenile beggars in the street , mainly to relieve unnatural parents of their natural obligations , and sometimes to suI ) port them in idle debauchery . The true remedy for the destitution of single women should be one which is not to be wasted on a greedy crowd neither in need of it nor really benefited bj*i it ; one which will increase instead of further subdividing the total of skilled , honored , and respectably paid labor ; one which will not diminish the ability of men to marry and support families in comfort , but will rather diminish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor less attractive to manly affection , but will , on the contrary , qualify them the better to al ) preciate and to fulfill the offices of domestic love ; and finally , one which does not exact of them either arduous training or permanent establishment as a condition of success . it is to be presumed that the system of nature contains provisions or possibilities for each of its members which harmonize thus with the native adaptation , impulse , and peculiar interest of each , and consequently with the paramount interests of the whole . Let us arrange the demands of society in pursuance of this presumed method , leaving on one side whatever employments are unfavorable to the best development , exercise , and // opportunity of woman 's peculiar excellences , as the genius and soul of domestic life , and reserving for special consideration and encouragement whatever pursuits promise satisfactory support to women temporarily or permanently single , while educating them , more or less , toward those vital arts which devolve upon them exclusively , and in which , it is certain , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family , leaves a gap with nobody to fill it . It will he sufficient to pass very lightly over the negative side of this examination . It would he superfluous to point out the life-long and arduous exactions or the unfeminine tendencies of the profession of law , of a public and comprehensive practice of medicine , of public preaching and lecturing , of politics , legislation , and administration , or of a business career in any department . The natural right of a woman to devote herself to any of these pursuits to which she may feel inclined is not to be resisted . It may be well even to promote a free development of such exceptional vocation , in desperate cases . The question for women as a body is not that of individual liberty in these things . That is settled as soon as raised . The question still remaining , and the one of all importance to women , is whether the preponderance of masculine forces over feminine susceptibilities which determines the choice of a 1 ) tlblic over a domestic sphere , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to set before their daughters as the ideal of a useful , hal ) py , and high womanhood . To state this question to women in general is sufficient . They can give it but one answer , so long as they are women . The pursuits of art and literature are not so unfortunate for women , in that they do not involve any positively unfeminine tendency . At worst , they rob a woman of domestic life , and rob domestic life of a woman-two of the worst robberies , to be sure , that can be effected , either by selfish violence or misdirected views of good . There are cases , undoubtedly , in which the subject-matter of the fraud is too small on either part to be seriously regretted , and exceptional cases in which it is smaller than the compensation which art or literature returns . Leaving such cases , which sometimes will assert themselves , to take their own course , and that not without generous sympathy , it will be the care of women , if we mistake not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all other aberrations from the vital sphere of society , as rare as pure womanly training at home an ( I good advice from wdmanly public ol ) imOfl can make them . For it is notorious that the women who return to domestic life after once achieving a subsistence for themselves in any profession , are too few to be worth taking into any statistical account . Descending to the material avocations , it is worthy of passing note that nothing seems in practice to spoil the womanly with surer effect than commerce . Women ought , naturally , to be more successful sellers than men , especially to male purchasers . But the experience of merchants proves , and their practice testifies , the reverse . Saleswomen , although so much cheaper than salesmen , make little or no encroachment upon the employment of the latter in * cities , and , strange to say , so far as they are employed , it is mostly in stores frecjuented only by female customers for small purchases . Now the cause of this is as plaim* as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of courtesy in saleswomen . Complaisance and tact are the grand lubricants of trade ; and it is very remarkable tha&amp; these most feminine of traits , by which women in their own sphere rule the world , are the very traits that seem to be annihilated in them by the influence of any kind of sordid commerce . Many employers have renounced saleswomen , and even female waiters , for the avowed reason that they could not make them sufficiently civil to customers . To men they are especially disagreeable , because col4rtesy is sc peculiarly essential to l ) leasant intercoursc between individuals of opposite sex . Th least taste of their sharpness is intolerable , as it would not be in a man . It is like taking vinegar in milk . But it is no discredit to the feminine type . Quite the contrary . The highest organic products are most delicate , most corrul ) tible , and most offensive in corrul ) tiOn . So infallible is this law in the moral world also , that we may rest assured women will never be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wallstreets and Broadways of the world to create an alluring examl ) le of success . Among mechanical employments there are many which naturally seek the aid of female fingers , and these , of themselves , generally offer little positive harm to the feminine nature , make no intolerable exactions upon it , and detract little from the ability of men to place it in a better sphere . But even here are sore evils to womanhood . The habit of domesticity is sacrificed , and a distaste for domestic life in any shape is a general trait which strikes all who have opportunity to observe the character of shop and factory girls . // Finally , to all resources for single women which must be abstracted from the resources of husbands and fathers , or of those who should be encouraged to become such-in other words , from the resources of their married state-there remains the universal and conclusive objection , that the number of single women they will provide for must always be less than the number of single women they will make ; partly because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not naturally need it , having parents or husbands ; and partly because self-dependence in women so powerfully tends to dissuade both sexes from marriage . It remains to notice those more feminine arts which offer an almost unoccupied field for women , in which they can never be rivalled , in which they will displace no men from their posts of duty as supporters of women and children , which will neither predispose women to celibacy , nor petrify men against matrimofly , but which will set the individual woman in the way of at once preparing for and attracting to herself the great opportunity of her social existence . For the few women whom wise Nature spares from the fundamental interest of society for a separate and public life , there is the most ample and honorable scope which any of mankind can find in this world , in almost unoccupied feminine professions which wait for women , and women alone , to fill them . Not to speak of art , literature , and science , already fashionable pursuits for women , there are two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which further organization is demanded for the purposes of female votaries . We refer to the domestic practice of medicine and hygiene and the domestic ministry of the gospel . For medical instruction there is no provision adapted to women unless it be as yet in embryo . The serious objection to mixed classes will always exclude from existing medical institutions , no matter how liberal , such women as would very much grace the profession . Yet the ideal of the medical profession is too noble and beneficent not to attract a good proportion of those women who are exceptionally biased by nature or circumstances . Their sympathetic and religious nature is wanted here , and will find an ample range of service to which it is specially adapted , even while it disqualifies them to meet the severer exactions of a comprehensive practice . What we need throughout the greater part of our lives , rather than great medical skill in emergencies , is daily advice and supervision , more closely carried out than it can be by male physicians , especially as to children , household management , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration for three modes , in each of which at once an important reform might be set on foot with apparent ease and great promise . Presupposing a competent medical institution which modest women coul4 enter , and from which modest women could graduate  --  the chief difficulty of the question  - -  in the first place , let the lady practitioner be adopted by mothers as a daily domestic visitor and counselor , perhaps a supervising nurse , in health and sickness alike , without necessarily interfering with the office of the trusted family physician in more serious cases . In wealthy city society domestic female physicians might enjoy a satisfactory practice in this way , and would be exceedingly valued , without violating in any case the peculiar delicacy which ought to be inseparable from the very idea of a woman . Secondly , let physicians in large practice adopt such lady practitioners as professional partners through whom their own perhaps superior experience and abilities might act in multitudes of cases quite as effectively and more acceptably than in a direct manner , and who would take off their hands a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by better attention . Thirdly , let the profession of hygiene for children be united with that of teacher , including the charge not only of lessons , but of regimen , dress , exercise , play , and the premonitions and causes of illness . The domestic ministry of the gospel , whenever the support of the gospel shall begin to be a prominent object with those who profess to be devoted to it , will open an ample and most appropriate sphere for all the noblest feminine faculties and aspirations that are and are to be . As to public ministrations of any kind , nothing less than high art , which vindicates all its own exceptions , has ever seemed to justify such individual publicity in women . To call the public together to listen to one 's talk , is the farthest stretch of self-assertion in an individual of either sex . If not justified by the indisputable necessity and authority of the message delivered , it can only be regarded as the most impudent of the forms of egotism . At the present day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for addressing the intelligent world , a gratuitous appearance upon the rostrum , i.e. , one not called for by some kind of customary public appointment , adds the disgrace of a motive of personal vanity to that of presumption . For these reasons , emphasized by the finer modesty of the female sex , we do not believe that // the great conventional power administered by women will ever stamp women 's preaching or lecturing to promiscuous audiences with approbation . Women can exercise the office of oral public instructors only by thrusting themselves into it ; an insolence which is only worse in a woman than in a man . The thing is essentially different from publishing one 's thoughts in print . In the latter there is no personal display , and no demand upon properly public attention , for the very book or newspaper is read , every copy of it , in privacy . If women should ' come to be appointed , not by small combinations of persons with peculiar views and objects , nor by managers in search of paying " sensations , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orally and publicly , the stigma of vanity and presumption would no longer attach to the performance . They would then have only to consider whether they had anything to say , and any necessity for saying it ore rotundo , sufficient to justify them in overstepping the modesty of nature . But the work of a domestic religious missionary can be performed incomparably better by women than by men , and myriads of women ought to be sustained in this office in all parts of the world by Christian churches . A woman has suggested that perhaps the reciprocal influence of the opposites in sex , now entirely one-sided in preaching , might , if brought into play from the female side also , prove a remedy for the present disparity of men in churches and worshiping congregations . It is hard to imagine a female preacher who could fascinate men-as preacher , at least . But the private influence of Christian women over the souls of men is peculiar and wonderful , though little exerted . If ever this magic of sex . shall be consecrated in its finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostles may be rivaled by a woman . Whether the grand fields of purely feminine activity above glanced at will ever be made of much importance to women and by women or not , no body can now safely prognosticate . The immediate interest of our inquiry centers on the proper arts of women in their own exclusive sphere . The domestic arts acquire a more commanding importance , on the whole , than any others , from their ancillary relation to woman 's highest office  --  the highest in the world , both in its exactions and in its fruits . There is much in housekeeping which is as far as possible from sublime ; but there is nothing in it which is not closely related and indispensable to the most sublime results of human existence . Its despised elements are the staple of our choicest fabric , the gram . mar of our highest eloquence , the mechanism of our grandest achievements . They therefore require the attention of the artists ( f society , precisely as the material , mechanical , or grammatical elements of any other art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The handling of the elements of any art conduces , by a mysterious effect of affinity , to a certain mastery of the art itself not otherwise attainable . Yet the elemental arts of society are turned over to our helots , and so utterly neglected that it would seem to most persons a misnomer to dignify them with the name of arts . " Women 's arts for women " would be the motto of a true woman 's labor reform . In them is room for all , whatever their condition or talents , with recompense fit , without prejudice to the prospect of marriage either by unfitting themselves or disabling men , but with precisely the contrary effect in every way . In this direction there is liberty indeed , for we shall not bring up against an impenetrable mass of competition , nor find that we are destroying on one side as much as we are making on the other . The only obstruction is want of education in the domestic arts , and of conventional respect for them . But of this worst injustice to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is intolerable , we are told , for women to have no facilities for professional education , and to be threatened with social ostracism if they contrive to become lawyers or doctors . Yet these are the precise conditions under which women must acquire and practice the rudiments of their own noblest profession , if at all . They should labor for what they and the whole economic world most need and might most easily have : universities of a new type , comprehending , in a scientific and ennobling way , first the domestic arts , which are not above the humblest nor beneath the highest , and afterwards such other arts and professions as best suit the peculiar dignity of the womanly nature . It would be necessary that women of position , leaders of society , should interest themselves , not patronizingly , in such institutions , and give their own daughters the full share in their advantages which they need . There are benevolence , good sense and influence united in women in high places , sufficient , if properly organized , to make housekeeping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , and a cultured profession , engaging talents and learning in its service , while lifting up millions of women out of want , or homeless and fruitless toil , to aug // ment and share the happiness of'millions of homes , besides making many new homes for themselves and others , that never would have existed but for their domestic accomplishments . Even under the present circumstances , we have known a small number of such women , self-made , and not peculiarly gifted , who , so far from having to dread the position of a menial in domestic service , were able to command at all times not only a choice among scores of applicant employers , but positions of unqualified respect and even friendship , in families of high social standing . There is pz*obably no other service from women , for which society would bid so high to-day , in both wages and personal consideration , as for accomplished and lady-like housekeeping , nursing , and sewing . In other words , almost every man in good circumstances would gladly support two ladies for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife ) , as assistant and delegate in household affairs and for assistants of humbler pretensions still ampler room and proportional consideration are waiting , provided they be only qualified to command it by good-breeding and domestic skill . Dropping here the subject of occupation , we must notice briefly three other questions pertaining to the conventional sphere , before passing on to the civil and political . Of these , the first is the proper ideal of education , and of mental honor and power , for women . The second is their proper position morally ( i.e. , voluntarily ) in marriage . The third is their proper position relative to proposals of marriage . We notice these points particularly , not only because of their actual prominence in the present agitation , but also because they offer lessons of fundamental importance in the new branch of science upon which mankind have entered by instigation to which we referred in an opening paragraph . It was said long ago that the proper study of mankind is man . Just now , there is no doubt , the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to appreciate themselves with discrimination ; that is , in a conscious or deliberative way . The intuitive sense answers practical purposes so long as it is pure and unmixed , as in the unthinking animals , or in the unthinking stage of human nature . But the moment we begin to think we begin to blunder , and continue floundering in ragged notions and babblements , ' until mature discussion brings out into mature consciousness the truth we once had unconsciously in nature . While women loved and served in the simplicity of nature , looking only for the other love and service their na* ture craved from men ; while they gave unreasoning admiration to powers they lacked , enjoying an unreasoned but delightful homage in exchange-they never learned to grudge or to envy , to make comparisons or to raise questionings . When querulous sciolism breaks the spell , impeaching the rationale of wifely subjection and marital responsibility , and of reciprocal homage between weakness and strength , it is no wonder if the crude answer be confusion ,  --  perhaps hasty recantation . Vital action is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone , but it often does not read well , superficially . Crude criticism can only make the Creator a fool . Since we will criticise , we must go to the bottom . Having bitten the tree of knowledge , there is nothing for it now but to eat it through . We anticipate from the accurate analysis of this subject , in the end , a new conception of honor and power , immeasurably highei than has heretofore prevailed in the world . Men and women alike bring to this discussion a brutal criterion pre-imposed upon their minds . We admire the muscularity of intellect with precisely the same ignorant reverence which savages yield to corporeal superiority , and for the same reason-because we can see it work . We are able to smile at the contempt of the rude man for woman 's inferior size and strength . She sees that he plumes himself upon a brutal distinction , and she is disposed neither to contest it nor to be mortified by it . But when he boasts vigor to floor her in a wrestle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the force being by one attenuation higher , and only indirectly palpable to the senses , is mistaken for power of a higher origin , and she now feels herself disparaged . Blindly conscious that she can not be an inferior creature , however , it seems to her that there must be some mistake about this . It is not strange if she concludes that she could become a match for him with like training , and that equity for her sex demands it . It xvould be substantially as reasonable and as dignified an aspiration for her to insist on training her delicate form to be a match for the male athlete . She can not see the substantial identity of the two objects-and as little can the conceited Intelligence which looks down upon her-because neither has been taught to recognize the brute community and correlation of all natural forces , from brawn to brain . Neither has learned that the dignity of man resides in a moral nature which is superior both to his logical // and to his physical powers ; that in both these classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them only as to variety and quantity ; and that hence the boast of supenor logical force is but another brutal distinction . XVe need to learn that the moral nature is the only seat of power and worth , and that the mind , like the body , is but its servile instrument , whether for good or evil , having dignity or ability of its own in no other sense than the hulk of an elephant or a case of nitroglycerine . In this way we disparage neither intellectual nor physical instruments . We give them precisely their due appreciation as useful means , useful in proportion to their kind and force , for the ends of the moral nature . Means to be cultivated and employed , but certainly not to the praise of the owner , more than a steam-engine or a good horse . Where and how does real and originating power show itself ? Not in mind or in matter , but in that which moves , sways , impels , and governs both . " Why , gentlemen of the jury , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain case , " J. J. was a man who could have kept a whole village of people like this witness revolving around him all their lives , unconscious of the power that moved them . " Here was a good illustration of true personal power . That subtle intelligence we call tact ( in which the female sex naturally excels ) , perhaps had not a little part in it , and so far it was not power , but a forcible instrument . But above and beyond all the forces employed was the inscrutable Power that employed them not only , but the employers of them , the moral natures of other men , in orbits controlled by its massive solar attraction . And not the least common illustrations of this solar power to be found in human life are women , often of little logical or forensic ability , and even uneducated , making instruments of men with all their powers , to whom in the entire range of merely natural or visible forces they would seem to be hopelessly inferior . Precisely thus , too , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not put together a grammatical sentence or the shortest chain of reasoning , are found dominating their superiors in these resl ) ects by a power which no intellect has ever been ible to define or to trace . In the l ) assive foi in of this 1 ) ower , i.e. , endurance-which is it iTh st test , as silent standing under fire is r er*e5t test of the morale of the soldier ii have always been unapproachable . L ir peculiar forte ; their moral V en withdrawn by iiature mainly from the offensive and concentrated on the defensive line . Is , then , the native admiration of women for masculine qualities fallacious ? Not for its own purpose . It expresses a legitimate satisfaction for them . It proves that relatively to theirs the masculine is a complemental , not in itself a better , nature . It is true for its own purpose and purport , but no farther . The same may perhaps be said of the mutual complacency on both sides . The impartial llml ) ire finds the truth midway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be extremely difficult for women with a little more than feminine intellectual impulse to be persuaded that there is not something better in that direction than can he found in their own peculiar dower . 1'hey will still insist that great efforts ought to be made to educate the logical faculty ir women to a par with that of men . We could name a woman of so logical mind as to be capable of keeping to the point in an argument , and by virtue of that unfeminine aberration , inconsolably conscious of inability to sustain an argument with men who acknowledged her as an equal . Attributing the defect to her education , she rushed to mathematics to obtain power with men ; unconscious that all she really lacked in argument was a disposition to avoid it , and that a simple opinion , enforced only by womanly tact arid weight of character , has an unacknowledged power with most men which the reasoning of a Bacon , if she attained it , would displace but n*ever replace . Men are most commonly persuaded without being convinced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten it is a woman who does the former thing and a man who does the latter . A little use of this masculine weapon in practical life teaches every man that logic is a morally impotent thing . Its use is not to create convictions , but to define and fortify convictions already embraced . For example , it were no modesty or disparagement to admit that this little argument on the Right Not to Vote is uncalculated to change the persuasion of a single reader . Its only possible mission is to aid in developing and fixing sentiments already in harmony with its general principles . As a positive organ of truth , the intuitions of the moral nature are infinitely more trustworthy , and more potent too , than the manliest powers of argumentation . The latter find their place in the conduct of affairs , which thus falls to men . Women were not made for argument , for hardiment , or for government , for the reason that they are // wanted in a more spiritual sphere , closer to the fountain-head of power , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world would only disqualify . Of education proper , or the faculty of acquiring knowledge , there is little danger in these days that even men will get an unfeminine depth and severity . Women need masculine studies , masculine teachers , and masculine society , not to make men of them , but women . There is little danger of perverting the type by sterling culture . Spurious culture at the hands of undisciplined writers and lecturers of either sex is more likely to do it . Frivolous vacuity and street life will be favorable to it . But nothing that a woman s mind can healthfully crave and digest will be dangerous to her womanliness . It is the adaptive quality of the nature that determines the product of nourishment . Doves fed upon flesh will not assimilate alarmingly to birds of prey . Mixed colleges would have almost everything to recommend them , if only the difficulty arising from inferior physical stamina in girls could be overcome . Yet , if we have not misstated the nature of the highest ability , women have it of themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is of but illusory importance . Any well-constituted and wellnurtured girl , graduated by a good mother , exhibits in all personal relations a dignity and strength to which the wisest men bow with genuine deference . It is miraculous how much they make of a little education-so much , that a great deal more makes very little difference , nothing of the difference it makes between men . If we look for the indispensable men , we must look mainly among the pre-eminent intellects and the masters in departments of knowledge . Not so among women : " She that gathered much had nothing over , and she that gathered less had no lack . " The eminently intellectual and edu. cated among them yield in personal influence and weight of character , as a rule , to the unsophisticated . Ah ! how wise they are , these girls , in their simple , unerring instincts : how their perfect presence levels before it the intellectual distinctions which stand so well between men , taking our profoundest homage by the pure majesty of the soul ! The wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to the moral nature , and is identified with their virtue . It is a significant implication in the very growth of language , that broadest and surest of generalizations , that for a woman to be pure is to be , as in English , discreet , or as in French , sage . Discretion , or sound judgment , is an intuitive power , making no use of logic , and therefore acting unconsciously , always undervalued by the young , but discovered in mature life , often with surprise , to be the highest gift of human nature , and the highest power in human affairs . It is common to lament that the best female education seems to sink as it were into the sand , and disappear with the girl from the stage of her last school-examination , leaving little trace in her after-life , or even in her memory . We suspect that this is , after all , nearly as it should be , and that cherished intellectual contents and ascendant intellectual methods in a woman 's mind would displace far higher powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can in most cases successfully assert against even the " best " education .
