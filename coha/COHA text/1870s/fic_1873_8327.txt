Oh ! how unlike its summer dress , A sheet of azure loveliness , In which the swallow dips his wings , And breaks its breast , in rippling rings , When the scared water-fowl upsprings !

Wild fife-notes , tremulous and shrill , Prove that the mead-lark lingers still , And guardian of her brood from foes , The quail a signal-whistle blows . VI .

This nook of loveliness I sought In many sylvan tramp of yore  --  The happy heart that then I brought Beats in this breast no more .

II . Where field flowers sprang and bird-notes rang The rude gale pipes a warning ; By vapors dun that hide the sun , Festooned are the halls of morning .

Passing away ! passing away ! When were words uttered so full of dismay ? How on my heart , like a knell , they are falling , While through the darkness sad voices are calling " Sorrow is ever the neighbor of mirth , Nothing is stable and constant on earth : Oh ! how brief !

Forms on the dazzling , auriferous sands Gather , and wave their pale , beckoning hands : Woven of starlight are robes that they wear , Each stately head ringed with a circlet of gold ; One I know well by her dark , glossy hair , A beautiful being of Phidian mould .

Keen , darting wit that wounded not the heart At which was aimed his brightly polished dart ; Quaint humor that gave colloquy a zest , While laughter followed every harmless jest ; A soul to meanness that could not descend , Were traits that marked my dear departed friend . He was not for the fashion of these times , And praised the ring of Father Chaucer 's rhymes ; Better he loved weird Spencer to peruse Than glittering couplets of the modern muse , And with advancing years prized more and more The crystal well-head of Shaksperean lore .

Thus in an idlesse mood I lay While closed the long , midsummer day ; Each nodding wild flower , wind-swept leaf Sang a low lullaby to grief ; Birds warbled from their pulsing throats Condoling , sympathizing notes , Until I thought , opprest and ill , That Nature 's offspring loved me still , And knew their worshipper  --  though gone The glory of his golden dawn : The power to wake , from day to day , The sounding legend and the lay : The gifted vision to descry Shapes rarely seen by mortal eye .

Down life 's swift rolling stream ; No cloud on high to rob thy sky Of sunlight 's cheerful gleam . II . May age to thee no winter be , But like the summer glow ; And song and fame light up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , when reached time 's goal , Receive within its bowers , To meet once more friends gone before , Crowned with unwithering flowers . Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : AN OLIAN MELODY . from Later Lays and Lyrics ( 1873 ) I. My bosom has olian cords , That warble wildly to the soul , And oft the strain takes form in words That echo like a death-bell 's toll ; Anon it makes my pulses beat With power beyond expression sweet , II . The door of my sad heart it opes , And memories wake long cold and dead ; The ashes of a thousand hopes Stir in their dark and mouldering bed  --  Loved faces , in that heart enshrined , Bring back the mournful Past to mind . III . Unearthly songs that long have slept , To chant defying mortal skill Wake , when those bosom chords are swept That soon will broken be , and still . Alas ! those chords , though finely strung , Can never sing as they have sung . IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal of doom upon my brow ! Off with these laurel wreaths ! the shroud Would best become the mortal now ; For one , long-loved , can not be mine  --  I stained with guilt  --  she half-divine . V. These bosom-chords in happier days , To joyous melodies kept time , But now , attuned to saddest lays , Alone with wailing voices chime ; Or make olian reply To a lost soul 's despairing cry . Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : GREETING TO MARY . from Later Lays and Lyrics ( 1873 ) I. Happy New-Year ! to Mary dear , From one whose heart is aching ; Her image fair is painted there Although its chords are breaking . May saints keep guard , my Mary ward From ills to life belonging ; And on her way , from day to day , May angel guides be thronging , In hours of deep dejection , To give her hope , protection . II . While New-Year chimes revive old times , Though full of solemn warning , Wake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love good morning ! May nought annoy , the birds of joy Sing in her praise forever ; The demon Care , the ghoul , Despair , Molest my Mary never , While Heaven at last receives her  --  A crown of glory weaves her . Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : MY SCOTTISH BEAUTIES . from Later Lays and Lyrics ( 1873 ) I. Ellen , Jean and Flora I prize all things above , With blushes like Aurora , Smiles like the Queen of Love . They are my own three Graces With eyes that flash delight , May Time on their sweet faces One wrinkle never write . II . Thy form , majestic Ellen ! Thy proud and stately mien Should grace no humbler dwelling Than palace of a Queen . Across the dark blue water , In Europe 's ancient land Was never born a daughter With air of more command . III . I know that there are many More dazzling in their charms , But Burns would long , sweet Jenny ! To clasp you in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wert a shrine  --  Eyes , with the blue of ocean In their clear depths , are thine . IV . And Flora , gentle Flora , Unsung thou shalt not be ; Rose , Mary , Blanche and Cora Are names less dear to me . Thy household virtues make thee A wife to be desired ; For life the bard would take thee Although in rags attired . V. I am no pleasure-seeker , A sober life I live , But fill , fill high the beaker , And pledge the toast I give ! " Ellen , Jean and Flora I prize all things above , With blushes like Aurora , Smiles like the Queen of Love . " Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : SNOW FLAKE AND ONNOLEE. from Later Lays and Lyrics ( 1873 ) I. There is a mare whose silken hair Gleams in the sun like gold , Her nostrils spread and beauteous head Show lineage high and bold . Blood , speed and bone will make her known Wherever reins are drawn ; Like other steeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II . And by her side , with even stride , Speeds Onnolee , her mate ; The bits she champs while on she tramps Untiring in her gait . The look of game in her sinewy frame Commands the turfmen 's praise ; On her glossy coat and mane afloat The ladies ' love to gaze . III . An Arab sire has given fire To dark eyes full and clear ; Away with checks for their arching necks While both outpace the deer ! The fastest nag in rear must lag When they are stripped to trot ; Though bad the track they will not slack , Of a breed that falters not . IV . Sure-footed , strong , they move along Fleet as the gliding doe ; Hooves small and round upon the ground Fall light as flakes of snow . Each agile limb of these trotters trim Is laced with swelling veins : Look out ! look out ! when they 're about , And Harry holds the reins ! Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : " INSULA SANCTORUM. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If souls were free from fraud and guile , And ignorance had less effrontery ; If battle blades were sheathless while One traitor lived to curse his country ; If far more prized than golden ore At Freedom 's shrine were deep devotion , The sainted Isle would flash once more , A jewel on the breast of ocean . II . When ages of Oppression rest Upon a land once bright with glory  --  Resentment in each generous breast Enkindled by her mournful story  --  Better the cannon 's angry peal To rouse than tongue that idly preaches  --  The ringing rhetoric of steel Than eloquence of uttered speeches . III . When Valor finds in danger 's hour The mask of Honor worn by Treason , And thrown away on lawless Power Are arguments though based on reason , Resolve to win the field , or die , Should waken as one man the Nation , While bugle call and rallying cry Are heard , not empty declamation . IV If hearts to dare and heads to plan In crushing tyranny united , Then in his majesty would man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would ancient feuds forego , And faction cease to make commotion , Outshining moon again would glow Our Emerald on the breast of Ocean . Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : LONGING FOR SUMMER . from Later Lays and Lyrics ( 1873 ) I. How happy the swift birds of passage must be , Flying southward in flocks over mainland and sea , To rest their tired wings in some fair southern isle , Where the bright eyes of summer eternally smile ; And thither , my love ! had we wings we would fly , Nevermore to live under this bleak northern sky ! Our forms are too frail and our hearts are too warm For this desolate region of darkness and storm . II . Oh ! long have I waited to rove , hand in hand , With the girl of my heart in some tropical land ; We would banquet on fruitage , delicious and sweet , While winds blowing landward would temper the heat , And brilliant flamingoes , in scarlet arrayed , Through the salt pools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cool leafy glooms , The rainbow 's own tints would flash back from their plumes . III . I would build thee a home amidst whispering bowers , While Time glided by , his old scythe wreathed with flowers ; I would hear in thine accents , unaided by art , The music that passage would find to my heart , And toil for thee only , my loved and my own ! In this drear world no longer heart-broken , alone ; No more looking mournfully into the past , But , soul knit to soul , live and love to the last . Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : SONG . from Later Lays and Lyrics ( 1873 ) I. Bloom for us a little longer , Last Rose of the summer hours ! May your drooping stem grow stronger Kissed by silvery dew and showers . The Flower-Queen gave a fragrant sigh , Whispering with her sad good-bye ! " Lonely , oh ! so lonely ! " II . Last leaf of the forest clinging In the chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things too bright to last ; Tongue the leaf in falling found Singing with a rustling sound , " Lonely , oh ! so lonely ! " III . Poet holding once communion With the forms of beauty flown , Rent are golden cords of union , And thou wanderest alone : Answered , pale and evil-starred , With a wailing voice the Bard , " Lonely , oh ! so lonely ! " IV . Let me cross the mystic river , Let me walk the radiant shore ! From the bonds of clay deliver One in love with earth no more : Here , where fairest forms conceal Oft such hollow heart , I feel " Lonely , oh ! so lonely ! " Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : EASTER CAROL . from Later Lays and Lyrics ( 1873 ) I. Rejoice thou that weepest , And hold up thy head ; Awake thou that sleepest  --  Arise from the dead ! Hope bursts from the prison That held her so long ; The shout  --  " Christ is risen ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is banished From Death 's wintry cave , And mourning has vanished Like mist from the wave ; For Christ light bestoweth , Though dark is the way , The fount whence it floweth Is day  --  endless day . III . Despair furls forever Her banner of gloom ; Its black fold will never Again wrap the tomb ; Hope bursts from the prison That held her so long ; The shout  --  " Christ is risen ! " Wakes earth into song . Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : ALONE . from Later Lays and Lyrics ( 1873 ) I. In nevermore there is despair ; In fare-thee-well , a dirge-like tone ; But agony , too hard to bear , Breathes in that mournful word  --  alone ! It tells of broken hearts and ties , Long silent lips , and curtained eyes ; Of vanished birds , abandoned nests , And white hands clasped on silent breasts . II . Alone ! alone ! what echoes wake In memory 's cavern , at the sound ; While phantoms their appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But ah ! how desolate the thought Such figures are of moonlight wrought : Alone ! alone ! no sadder word By mortal ear is ever heard . Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : TO STELLA IN HEAVEN . from Later Lays and Lyrics ( 1873 ) I. I have seen thee in my dreaming , I have though of thee by day , And an eye on me is beaming In the distance far away . The cloud that floats above me Takes the likeness of thy form ; Oh ! say , dost thou still love me In a realm that knows not storm ? II . Where the crystal streams are rolling Through amaranthine bowers  --  Unheard the death-bell tolling , As in this world of ours ; Where the form , divinely moulded , Is never laid to rest , With the pale hands meekly folded On the frozen , pulseless breast . III . Oh ! say , dost thou remember When first I called thee mine , Or quenched is love 's bright ember In the home that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takes the likeness of thy form , Oh ! say , dost thou still love me In a realm that knows not storm ? Hosmer , William H. C. ( William Howe Cuyler ) , 1814-1877 : JANE . from Later Lays and Lyrics ( 1873 ) I. Far you must go , and look round you in vain To find sweeter girl than my Highland lass , Jane ; Many be summers , with bird-notes and bowers , That drop in her pathway their innocent flowers ; Ever , with Truth setting seal on her brow , May she be pure , and as spotless as now ! II . In her blue eyes beams a soul-kindled light , The lone star of eve is less placid and bright ; Tinged in her lip with the red of the dawn , Light is her footstep as tread of the fawn ; Beauty has painted her cheek with the rose , Round her a charm her own loveliness throws . III . In the rich lines of that beautiful face , Painter might find his true model of grace ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptor might study the mould of her form :  --  Far you must go and look around you in vain To find fairer girl than my Highland lass , Jane .
