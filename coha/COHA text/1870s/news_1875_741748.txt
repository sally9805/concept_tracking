txt According to the evidence given by Warden Quirm before the Committee of the Legislative Assembly , the Tombs is one of the best-ordered prisons in the country . This was not the case a few months ago . When Mr. QUINN entered upon the duties of his present office , there were many things which in his judgment needed reform , and he immediately set to work to reform them . It was not an uncommon thing , for example , . to see a prisoner " staggering about the yard " in a helpless state of drunkenness ; but tfiis is all stopped now , and , moreover , the barber who used to be the medium of introducing whisky into the prison has been summarily discharged . Mr. QUINN confesses to showing a little favor to the ladies who may come under his care , but to the male prisoners ho is a rigid disciplinarian . Although supposed to be cognizant of everything that goes on within his jurisdiction , the Warden is quite ignorant of the occurrence of any of those scandals which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there are still any defects in it , ho considers that they are either inevitable or the consequence of trifling mistakes over which he has no control . All this would be extremely satisfactory , and the more so as coming from one who is the chief authority iu the prison , and who , therefore , should be supposed to speak with some weight , if other witnesses of the highest credibility did not tell an opposite story . The whole current of evidence which has thus far been taken by the committee is directly opposed to QuiNN 's testimony ; and it is clear that instead of the Tombs being a model of good management , as.he would have us to believe , it is conducted on a system than which nothing can be imagined as more corrupt and iniquitous , not to say terribly cruel . It does not appear that any of the prisoners are treated properly . If they have money to purchase favors , then favors to au unlimited extent , even to the concession of their liberty and to the pleasures of open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , the grossest injustice is meted out to them . They are not permitted to practice even ordinary cleanliness . They are forbidden access to their lawyers , and are refused the right , which every man is supposed to have , of a trial in the courts . Their health is neglected at the risk of their lives , and , in fact , in every possible way the prison is to them rendered a dungeon for the perpetration of the most heartless injustice and torture . Mr. Warden QUINN admitted that he often has seen , during the hot , Summer weather , as many as four prisoners confined in a cell eight feet three inches long by five feet eight inches wide . He admits , . too , that prisoners are not bathed , however dirty they may become . But these are among the trifles which can not be mended . He counterbalances the evil , if it be any , by letting his prisoners walk in the streets when they require it , in charge of a small boy of sixteen , and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not , however , say whether the privilege is ever extended to people who can not afford to pay for it . His knowledge did not extend much further . But the public , if we mistake not , will have much more faith in the evidence of Mrs. MULETTE , who , as the wife of a clergyman , has made it her busi- ness for many years to minister to the wants of poor prisoners . This lady describes the condition of the prison and of the prisoners as filthy in the extreme . " A man , " she said , " might be in the prison for months and never receive a clean shirt . " There is no classification of prisoners . Lawyers are introduced by the keepers , and , prisoners who desire to consult . some attorney who may not be iu league with the officials are prevented from doing so . " One girl , " says Mrs. MuLErrE , " paid $ ' 25 to Mr. Hown , and be never came near her again , " and complaints of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in return , are " of constant occurrence . " rive dollars is the price demanded by keepers for putting a prisoner into a decent cell . In some respects Mrs. Mumorrn directly contradicted . the Warden . She says it is not true that good food is often sent in to the prisoners from friends , because if they want food they are expected to buy it of the matron ; while liquor is introduced because the female searcher is herself a criminal , and she passes anything on receipt of twenty-five cents . There are no spoons in the prison , and the inmates are allowed to take their soup " like dogs . " Mrs. MuLErrn had only heard of the fact , previously proved , that Coroner CROKER , when he was a prisoner in the jail , was allowed a large amount of liberty , but she did not doubt it . He was suffered to go home , to take meals at the restaurants , aud , indeed , to spend as much of the night as he chose outside the walls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the highest crimes known to the law  --  manslaughter , if not murder . But the witness suggested another person  --  RAvmosn , the forger  --  who , she stated without hesitation , had acted as financial agent for the keepers , collecting their fees from , and arranging their business with , the prisoners under their care . Nor was the evidence of MARCUS SAGA any less condemnatory of the prison discipline . He had been a prisoner , and he told his experience . It was five dollars for a cell , five dollars for exercise , five dollars for cleaning a cell , and , . in fact , dollars for everything . A clean shirt could not be had without money , did . prisoners have often gone in filth till covered with vermin . Letters written by prisoners do not reach their destination ; food sent to them is not received ; counsel are refused access to prisoners , while other counsel are thrust upon them . Many prisoners after long detention are discharged , they know not why , without a trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their behalf in any way . If any person were to set to work to imagine all the various forms of corruption and injustice which can possibly occur under prison management at the present day , it may be doubted whether he could think of anything that is not put into practice in the Tombs . It is , perhaps , needless to say that QUINN and his assistants are all true and steadfast members of the " great Reform Party , " the Democrats .
