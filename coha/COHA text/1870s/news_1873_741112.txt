txt Such weather as we have experienced for the past week is not conducive to rapid ferry travel , and the people of Brooklyn are naturally longing for the day when the East River Bridge shall be completed . This result once accomplished , the chief drawback to the prosperity of Brooklyn will be rem oved , and eligible residences and building sites there will be almost as much in demand as they are in this City . It will be some years , however , before the bridge can be completed , and in the meantime the Ferry Company can do much to improve the facilities of travel between the two cities . The gates which have been erected at the Fulton and Wall-street Ferries were intended to keep persons froinDjumping after the boats . and thus endangering their lives ; but the means provided for rescuing any one who falls into the dock are still insufficient , or not so placed as to he promptly made available . The general management of the Fulton. and . Wall-street Ferries is as good as can be reasonably expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats is run at regular and short intervals . On the other ferries under the control of the Union Company , there is too little regard for the convenience of the traveling public . This is especially the case at the Hamilton Ferry , although it is the most profitable but one of all the ferries . The boats are run with a most uncomfortable irregularity , which entirely upsets any attempt at making a close calculation of the time necessary to effect the crossing . The boats are supposed to start at certain fixed times , . bat are as often a few minutes before as after that time , and all without any apparent cause or necessity . A. similar state of irregularity and uncertainty is found at the South Ferry . One reason for this uncertainty is doubtless that inexperienced pilots are given boats on these ferries , so that they may learn their duties where mistakes are less likely to lead . to accident than in the contracted . space of the East River at the Wall or Fulton-street crossing . To hurry these novices , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accident , but the business public should not be detained each day while tyros are taking their first lessons in pilotage . Another complaint against some of these ferries ie that the number of boats is reduced in the evening at 6 o'clock , just as the demand for accommodation is the greatest . An hour later a boat might be laid oft without inconvenience , but the Company 's practice in this matter seems to be to make the public conform to its uncertain rules , instead of itself conforming to the needs of the community . Every ferry should be run as promptly on time as a railroad , and the Union Ferry Company ought to adhere strictly to this policy on all the ferries ender its control . Such a valuable franchise as that of the Brooklyn ferries should be managed in the interest of the general public . and if the present ' holders find they can not give greater accommodations for the rates now charged , they will find plenty of capitalists ready to relieve them of their leases , and to agree to afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferries .
