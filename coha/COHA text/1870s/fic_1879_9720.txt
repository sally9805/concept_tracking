A bell is heard to ring R. There goes a ring . That 's him ! Another bell heard L. There goes another . That 's Miss Aprilla . They does both be a-ringin ' like that every minute o ' the day , and nayther one of ' em does be knowin ' what they want . Bells ring again . Ha , ha ! Whin they are both at it , I do n't hear nayther . Both bells ring again . He goes up L. C. , singing . " The bells go a-ringing for Barry . " As he gets to the door the bells ring again , and he exits precipitately . DICK enters R. , petulantly . Dick . I might ring for that fellow all the morning . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duster . What 's this doing here ? Another evidence of Mrs. Dymond 's superior housekeeping . Takes up duster , and , gazing up at ceiling , sees a cobweb . A cobweb , by Jove ! Well , I declare ! Begins to run the duster across the ceiling . APRILLA enters , L. U. E. , rapidly . Aprilla . You might ring and ring  --  ! Stops suddenly at the sight of DICK 'S operations . Good gracious ! What 's he about ? One of his new-fangled fads , I suppose . Advancing quickly . Ah ! Doing the housework , eh ? Sits at R. of table L. , and cuts leaves of magazine , which she has brought on . Dick . Pausing and turning . It seems I 've got to . APRILLA makes a movement of impatience . That is , unless I prefer to have a colony of spiders in the parlor . Resumes . Aprilla . You do n't know how ridiculous you look . Dick . Hurt tone . Ridiculous ! I never  --  Laying aside duster . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mine , I suppose . Why do n't you say so ? Dick . I was just going to . This morning I rang half an hour for a servant  --  for one of our five servants . All of them were busy for you , or sent on some of your interminable errands . I know I ought to be used to it by this time . Excitedly . But when I came in here , and found a duster in the parlor , and cobwebs on the ceiling calmly I did the dusting myself . Going to the mantel , R. If you do n't mind , I 'll continue . Takes small vase from the table and tidy from sofa . I 'm a rather costly domestic , but if we ca n't get another  --  Dusting the vase , he drops it . It breaks . Aprilla . Smash goes the china . You are rather costly  --  that 's a fact . Goes to him . Dick . Gazing at the debris . Those Chinese things are so confoundedly awkward . Aprilla . No , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from table . Let me show you . Dick . Laughs . Do you want the duster ? Offers the tidy . Aprilla . Thanks , this will do . Takes another tidy from chair L. You see , you hold the vase , so  --  and then you dust , so  --  The vase drops from her hand and breaks . Dick . Laughing . And smash goes the china . APRILLA rings the bell . That 's the way I did it . Barry . Appears at back . Did you ring , sir ? Dick . No  --  it 's your mistress . Pick up these pieces . Goes to mantel , as BARRY comes forward . Aprilla . The idea of using a tidy for that sort of work . Tosses it on chair and turns up stage . Dick . Oh , yes  --  the tidy did it . Sits at table R. , to read newspaper . Aprilla . Observing BARRY as he stoops to gather her broken vase . Oh , you are back at last , are you ? Dick . Aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smash . Aprilla . To BARRY . I 've been ringing half an hour . Glares at DICK . Dick . Half aside . Ahem ! APRILLA looks at him  --  he turns away . Aprilla . To BARRY . You left everything upside down here . A duster in the parlor , and the housework left for me to do . Dick . Half aside . Phew ! APRILLA gives him a severe look  --  he goes up . Barry . Getting up with his arms full of the dbris . Why , ma'am , you sint me out yourself with them eight letters to deliver with me own hand . Dick . Meditatively . Eight letters ! Eight ! Aprilla . To DICK . To the ladies of my committee . We are going to have a board-meeting to-day  --  unless you object  --  Dick . Quickly . Oh , no ! I was only thinking of poor Barry . Aprilla . Repressing irritation , turns to BARRY . Did you begin with Mrs. Van Grooge  --  Washington Square  --  as I told you ? Dick . Washington Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the " Widows ' Quarter " now ? APRILLA gives him a crushing look . Barry . I did ma'am  --  and worked me way up . Aprilla . Tartly . Crosses and sets R. You can go now . Barry . Standing embarrassed with the dbris . What will I do with  --  Dick . With our work of destruction ? Takes a newspaper from table R. and spreads it . Put ' em in here . Assists and restores parcel to BARRY . Handle very carefully . They break easily . Now go . BARRY goes up C. Poor Barry ! Sits L. BARRY exit at back . Aprilla . Poor Barry ! You are very considerate all of a sudden . Dick . No  --  but you seemed rather down on him , and I wanted to say a kind word or so . Aprilla . Rises . Particularly as you thought it would provoke me further . DICK makes an angry gesture . That 's why you made the very delicate remark about Mrs. Van Grooge too  --  the Widows ' Quarter ! Dick . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fail to see the harm of the observation . Aprilla . No  --  Mr. Van Grooge is not dead  --  but it 's just the same to his wife as if he was . Dick . To his wife , perhaps , but not to him ; there 's a distinction ! Aprilla . Arranging tidy on sofa . Oh , I know he 's a friend of yours . Dick . He belongs to my club  --  that 's all . For that matter his wife 's a friend of yours . Aprilla . Well  --  and what have you to say against her ? Dick . Nothing in the world ! Aprilla . She 's a most charming woman . Dick . Well , she was never what you could call pretty , and there are some remains of it still . Crosses R. APRILLA goes L. Aprilla . A respectable woman need n't be pretty . Dick . No , she does n't need to be , as much as one who is n't . Anyhow , if a respectable woman has the right to be ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Goes to fire and puts more wood on , and rattles the tongs in fixing the logs . Aprilla . Mercy on me ! More fire at this time of year ? Rises . Dick . I 'm freezing . Rings bell . Aprilla . I 'm roasting . Fans herself and opens window L. Dick . Here , here ! What 's that for ? Turns up his coat collar and flings down tongs . Aprilla . Coming forward . You wish to suffocate me ? Dick . I shall catch a dreadful cold . Sneezes . There ! I was sure of it . Sneezes . I 've got it . BARRY enters with a newspaper . Barry . Did you ring , ma'am ? Aprilla . No ; it was Mr. Dymond . Sits L. Dick . Angrily . Where did this wood come from ? Barry . From the wood-yard , sure enough , sir . Dick . What wood-yard ? It 's all wet . What are you looking about there for ? As BARRY seems to be searching for something . Barry . Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I heard another smash . APRILLA laughs . DICK glares furiously at him . Sure it does be that way with meself , sir . Whinever I break one thing in the morning , I always break two or three more right along before I stop . Dick . Tartly . That 'll do . Get out . Sneezes . Aprilla . As BARRY exit . Poor Barry ! Dick . Poking logs . If that wood does n't burn in five minutes , I 'll change our wood-yard . Aprilla . I 'm sorry for that . They always allow me five per cent . off the bill . DICK turns , astonished . Oh , I do n't keep it . If you doubt my word you may search my trunk before you discharge me . Dick . That 's right  --  go on . Sneezes . Make fun of me . Sneezes . After giving me this cold . Sneezes repeatedly . Aprilla . Rising . Oh , Dick , I 'm so sorry . Let me close the window . Goes up L.

If he dares ! Aprilla . I begin to feel chilly myself . Sits at fireplace . Dick . Of course , as soon as I 'm not . But go on . Send for Barry . Call him " poor Barry " again to his face . That 's what I call overdoing consideration for a servant . Aprilla . Which of us " poor Barry 'd " him to his face first ? Dick . I did it out of genuine compassion . You do it to make yourself popular with the servants . Aprilla . Oh , of course ! while your popularity is too firmly established . It 's " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dymond must have his meat underdone . " I must eat things raw . Dick . Indeed ! and Cook replies , " Mrs. Dymond wants it well browned , " and everything is burned up , and I have to eat cinders  --  like that canvas-back yesterday . Aprilla . It was delicious . I had two helps . Dick . You had it all . I did n't touch it . I ca n't eat charcoal . Slams book down on table . I 'm sick of the whole business . Aprilla . Starts up . Do you mean that ? Dick .

Hands flowers to APRILLA , and crosses to DICK to explain . My music teacher . Dick . What music teacher ? Crosses to APRILLA , hotly . Not for the piano ? You are not going to begin that ? Aprilla . Calmly , smelling the flowers . Certainly , I 've engaged Madame Lauretta to instruct the child . Tetty . To DICK . She began yesterday . Aprilla . And she 'll come every day . Dick . Indeed . Very good . Grimly . Fortunately I 've made my arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Cousin Dick is going out for a walk . Dick . Oh , no  --  I 've got something better than that . Tetty .

Is n't he the son of papa 's oldest friend , and were n't we brought up together  --  and was n't he almost  --  Stops and laughs . Dick . Almost going to marry you ? Oh , I know that entitles him to some sympathy , of course , but it does n't justify him in coming here all the time to get his consolation ! Sits R. Aprilla . I believe you almost hate him . Dick . Oh , you can leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He delights in watching our quarrels , rubs his hands as much as to say  --  " Oho ! you 've got my wife , and now I 've got my revenge . " Aprilla . Rises . You 're crazy . Bob never had such a thought . And if he had  --  would you rob him of that poor consolation ? Dick . I would , the cub ! Rising . BARRY enters L. C. Barry .

Two men dressed like guys . Why , you have only to look at the teachers to see the difference . Dick . Indeed ! Aprilla . Madame Laurette is a lady of the highest social position . Dick . They all are . I never knew a music teacher that was n't . Aprilla . She was recommended by Bob 's sister , Maud . I believe there is some mystery about her . Maud 's to write me all about it in her next letter . She has pledged herself not to speak of it to anyone . Dick . But if she tells you ? Aprilla . That 's writing about it , not speaking about it . Dick . Oh , I see ! But , excuse me , dear  --  my fencing master is waiting . Exit R. U. E. , practising with an imaginary foil . Aprilla . Observing him . What tomfoolery !

Crosses L. Skin . Skinnaston Ha , ha ! Puts hat on table . Ah , I see you do n't like Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't his fault if I refused to let my daughter marry you . Bob . Yes , but just think of the way you did it , as if you were closing out a business transaction  --  by telegraph : " Letter received . Too late ! Just closed with another party ! " Crosses angrily . Skin . Skinnaston Do n't forget the winding up : " Very sorry ! Hope for your further favors . " Shakes his hand . That was shipshape , eh ? Fact was , Bob , I wanted for Aprilla and all her money a chap with what they call " position . " You were one of us , you know , one of our boys from the Lake front and the packing yards . I hear the New York girls are crazy after them . Go in and win  --  now 's your time . ' 93 gives you a big advantage . Honeymoon right at home in the middle of the big Fair . Bob . Position ! Why , what 's Dick Dymond 's position ? He 's nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's a good deal . Besides , he 's a lawyer . Bob . But he does n't practise . Skin . Skinnaston Well , mebbe that 's a pint in his favor . Anyhow , he 's good to ' Prilly ! and then , see how nice he was to take Tetty to live with ' em . Chuckles . Though , fact is , I rather shoved her off onto them . Got rid of my daughter and my niece at one shot . Not a bad operation for an old financier , eh ?

Aprilla . Dear ! Such a noise . Skin . Skinnaston Oh , that 's nothing . I do n't mind a little thing like that .

Do n't you hear him ? Skin . Skinnaston Oh ! Looking toward ceiling . That 's him ! Aprilla . He 's taking fencing lessons , just to provoke me .

Oh , the monster ! Skin . Skinnaston They are lively , that 's a fact . Hold on ! Takes the long-handled duster and knocks with the butt end on the ceiling . Noise stops . He chuckles . That rattled ' em . Noise redoubles . He raps again . That 's the way your grandfather used to let us boys in the attic know when we had enough . Then we quit and went to bed . Listens .

I only want you to stop for the present  --  you see , my daughter suffers from headache  --  and that racket of yours overhead just crazes her . You invent some excuse to stop Master Dick  --  tell him he 'll never fence if he lives to be a hundred . Littlejohn . Amused . What 'll he think ? Skin . Skinnaston Never mind what he thinks  --  I 'll get you some other pupils  --  or their equivalent . DICK enters R. U. E. putting on his coat . Dick . By Jove , this exercise is just the thing !

I 've been offered the biggest thing I ever handled . Dick . Drumming on the table with his fingers . What on earth do you want with any more money ? Skin .

My dear , let me introduce my fencing master APRILLA acknowledges slightly , who turns out to be a great friend of your music teacher . Aprilla . Interested . Indeed ! Dick .

Suppressing herself . And what prevents your sleeping at home , may I ask ? Dick . What ? The accumulated combination of unceasing disturbances which you have the barefaced effrontery to call by the holy name of Home . APRILLA sits . At daybreak there 's the strangulation with the first puff of smoke and dust from all the fires . Then the rattle and clatter and chopping and tumult of the preparation for breakfast .

If you wanted in your wife a girl who had seen everything , had soured on everything , why did n't you marry one of those used-up creatures you met season after season ? Why did you hunt me out of my unfashionable section of what you call the Wild West , and bring me here to taste , to feel , to live ? I acknowledge  --  I have been making up for lost time .

Poor girl ! Poor girl ! Aprilla . Rousing up . But it 's my fault , perhaps . I 'm too particular ; and besides , so far I 've only called on intimate friends . Dick . Oh , then , of course  --  Aprilla . But I shall widen the scope . Of course , what I should prefer for you would be a widow , not too old  --  Dick . No , no , not old ; and pretty movement of APRILLA while you 're about it . Aprilla . If I do n't succeed in that line  --  Dick . In the widow line ? Aprilla . Sighs .

If I 'm calling on a widow . Dick . Oh , I see : Schedule one  --  widows ! Aprilla . I hint briefly at the lonely existence of a woman bereft at an age when the heart is most capable , and so forth .

Compliment to the dear departed . Aprilla . Still imitating . " What , I marry again ? " sighs then another sigh . Then they get down to business . Changing tone .

Yes , it will be some time before it becomes common . Aprilla . But there 's no way out of it , so I begin to beat about the bush . Then my lady insists  --  and finally displays so much eagerness ! Such very bad taste in a woman Dick . In a woman , perhaps ! But a widow ! Aprilla . Well , that cools me right away . She does n't deserve my Dick ! Gazing at him in rapture . My poor baby !

Unfortunately I 'm hard to please . Aprilla . Ah ! you 've been spoiled . Littlejohn . Glancing at LAURETTA , who has gone down the stage with downcast eyes . Perhaps ! Dick . Claps him lightly on the shoulders . Put your case in my wife 's hands , she 'll find the right article .

Aprilla . I am . Madame R. Madame Rosa Reina Where from ? Aprilla . From America . Madame R. Madame Rosa Reina I thought so . Well , you do not know what love is . You marry , you settle down , you keep house , you send your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the shops : your husbands have their business , their horses , their clubs . What becomes of love ? It goes like the summer when the blizzard comes . In my country , under our blazing sun , love is a fire that runs in our veins , that warms our souls , that flows from our glance and from our lips . We live for love ; we die for love . APRILLA jumps up . Sometimes one , sometimes both , one sooner , one later ; but all of us , all . APRILLA is horrified , and starts up as DICK enters , hat in hand . Aprilla . Aside . How horrible ! Dick . I beg a thousand pardons . I see you have a caller . Aprilla . Suddenly interposes so as to conceal MADAME REINA from him , and motions him away . Aside to him . Go away , go away ! Do n't look ! Dick . Hey ? Aprilla . Hurriedly aloud . Madame Rosa Reina is just . going . To MADAME REINA . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have had such a pleasant call . Aside to DICK . Go away ! Madame R. Madame Rosa Reina Taking her aside and whispering . Just whisper to me  --  who is the gentleman you had in your mind ? Aprilla . Sh ! Not now . Motions her to keep silence , and motions DICK to go away , and tries to conceal him from her . Madame R. Madame Rosa Reina Well , come and tell me to-morrow . Be sure , now . Good-by ! So glad to have found you at home . With a gush . Ah , querido ! Mi querido ! Goes up , guarded by APRILLA , who prevents her seeing DICK , and off R. Aprilla . Good-by , dear ! good-by ! Sinks on back of divan . Dick . Nonplussed . You said I was to take a look , but you did n't give me a chance . Is n't she a widow , after all ? Aprilla . A widow ! She 's too much of a widow for you ! Taps bell . To BARRY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out calls again , I 'm not at home  --  you understand ? Not at home  --  never ! Barry . Nor Mr. Dymond nayther ? Aprilla . Quickly . Nor Mr. Dymond nayther  --  neither . BARRY exit . Ah , my darling , I was nearly sending you to certain death . She had three husbands . A regular female Bluebeard . Dick . You do n't say ! Tell me all about it . Aprilla . Decidedly . No matter , we 've scratched her off our books . Urges him off . Dick . Resignedly . Well , I suppose I may put my hat back . Exit L. U. E. BARRY enters R. U. E. Barry . There are two ladies outside , ma'am , want to see you about the committay . Aprilla . Tell them to call to-morrow . Stop !  --  Two ladies ? Barry . Yes , ma'am ! A young ' un  --  and an old ' un . Aprilla . Show them in . BARRY exit . It may be another donation . I can get rid of them soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exceedingly antiquated Russian gentlewoman , and her granddaughter NADGE , a handsome girl dressed with almost nun-like simplicity , but having a masculine voice and manner and gesture . BARRY exits after a glance at them . You wish to see me ? Wo n't you be seated ? Indicates the divan C. Madame Alticheff . Indicates seat to NADGE . Nadge ! NADEGE sits L. and MADAME ALTICHEFF reposes statelily R. , both on divan  --  and while NADGE interprets , she keeps her hand to her ear , listening , nodding approval at every sentence . Nadge . As she sits . Yes , grandma ! To APRILLA . Allow me to act as interpreter , Madame . My grandmamma , the Countess Alticheff , understands your language as well as I do , but speaks it , if possible , more incorrectly . Aprilla . More incorrectly ? Smiling . To judge from the few words you have just uttered , I do n't think that would be possible . Aside . I really do n't know what I 'm saying . Nadge . Bows with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received one of your circulars , and wishes to bring her contribution to your charity . Madame A. Opens her purse , and hands a bank-note . Nadge ! Nadge . Taking note and handing it to APRILLA . Pray accept my grandmother 's modest offering . Madame A. Prompting . Nadge ! Nadge . Yes , grandmamma ! To APRILLA . That is not all . My grandmamma has a favor to ask in her turn , as you are so much charitable . Aprilla . Oh , anything I can do ! Nadge . We come from Russia , and my grandmamma intends to settle in New York  --  but we are such strangers . In Moscow we had a circle , and she entertained . She would like to do the same here  --  but without acquaintance  --  Aprilla . Ah , you wish introduction . It is hardly necessary . All you have to do is to take a house ; fill it with pictures and curios ; select a day ; send cards to everybody ; get a line in the papers promising champagne and salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . Oh , I assure you  --  and if you will repeat the experiment every month you will become in time a social leader . Both nod . You are married ? Madame A. Nadge ! Nadge . Grandmamma ! Both then look at APRILLA and shake their heads . Aprilla . Yes , what you want is a husband . Have n't you thought of marrying ? Aside . Hem ! Eying NADGE approvingly . Nadge . Casting down her eyes . Oh , Madame ! NADGE and MADAME A. sigh . Aprilla . Another sigh ! A double-barrelled sigh ! Madame A. Prompting . Nadge ! Nadge . Yes , grandmamma . To APRILLA . My grandmamma has considered it . Aprilla . I was certain ; your grandmother is a woman of sense . Aside . This is the greatest piece of luck . Nadge . Do you know any one you could recommend ? Aprilla . I know the very person you want . A man moving in the best society . Good family , spotless character . Madame A. Clasping her hands . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My grandmamma accepts with joy  --  with gratitude . A person that you recommend . That is all-sufficient . Aprilla . Aside . At last  --  I have succeeded . Nadge . Embracing MADAME A. Ah , grandmamma , at last you are happy . Aprilla . To NADGE . And you are sure you will like him ? Nadge . Suavely . My grandmamma will be sure to like him . Aprilla . Archly . But you are to marry him . Nadge . Sweetly . Oh no , Madame . Aprilla . No ? Who then ? Nadge . Calmly . My grandmamma . Aprilla . Your grandmother ? Sinks into chair L. Nadge . She will think she is back in Russia again with a home and a husband . Madame A. In ecstasy . Oh Nadge ! Aprilla . But I thought it was you ! Nadge . Oh , I shall never marry . I am studying for a physician . When I am graduated , I shall go to Japan as a medical missionary . Loftily . Is there a higher aim than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can help him in many ways , without going to Japan . DICK enters , hat in hand , as before . Dick . I beg a thousand pardons ; I see you have callers . MADAME A. and NADGE courtesy . Aprilla . Dazed . Sir ! Recognizes him . Oh , it 's you ! Madame A. Going up . Nadge , come . Nadge . Also shaking APRILLA 'S unresisting hand . I thank you in my grandmamma 's name . Aprilla . Rousing herself . Do n't mention it , please . Goes up to see them both off . Madame A. Turns , and at door precipitates herself on APRILLA 'S neck , exclaiming . Ja was uvash . Then goes off , calling in high spirits . Nadge ! NADGE follows , bowing to DICK . APRILLA sinks into C. of divan . Dick . Down L. I heard you had two ladies , so I thought  --  Well ? Aprilla . What ? Dick . What about the young person ? Aprilla . It 's not a young person . Dick . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young woman . Dick . What is it ? Aprilla . It 's a doctor . It 's going to Japan as a medical missionary , to help its fellow-man . But there 's the old lady , her grandmother , you can have . She wants a husband . Dick . Energetically . What , that old girl ? Goes to table R. and rings bell . BARRY enters , R. U. E. If those ladies who have just gone out happen to call again , I 'm not at home ; never  --  you understand , never . Barry . Yes , sir . Nor Mrs. Dymond nayther ? Dick . Nor Mrs. Dymond nayther  --  neither . Barry . Yes , sir . Exit . Dick . Come , confess it 's all a joke on your part , and let 's give up this confounded divorce . TETTY appears at L. 1 E. , and stops as she hears the last words . Aprilla . With emotion . Give up the only means of making you happy ? Reproachfully . How can you ask me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go and put up my hat again . Exit L. U. E. , as TETTY , who has crossed L. , now comes down . Aprilla . Musing . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have a hard time about it . Sees TETTY , who comes down . Why , Tetty , what are you doing there ? What have you got ? Pointing to photos in TETTY 'S hand . Tetty . Our pictures  --  Madame Lauretta 's and mine . Aprilla . Absently gazing at them . Very pretty . Tetty . Yes . Where shall I put mine ? Aprilla . On the mantel . TETTY adjusts the photo on small easel on the mantel and stands back to admire it . How 'll that do ? Aprilla . Nothing would be better . Affectionately . Do you know , dear , that you are looking very well ? Pulls her upon cushions . Tetty . On the mantel ? Laughs . APRILLA goes up and brings her down , gazing quite intently into her face . She laughs to hide her confusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say to you . I heard what you and Dick were saying as I came in . Aprilla . Did you ? Tetty . Only a word , perhaps ; but it was one word too many . Aprilla . What one word ? Tetty . Divorce . APRILLA makes a movement , turning away . Poor Dick ! Aprilla . Is all your sympathy for him ? Tetty . Yes , for he is the one to be pitied . It is n't often that a man gets a woman like you . Aprilla . Touching her under the chin . Why , Tetty ! Tetty . Oh , I know you pretty well , and I know him , too . Aprilla . Amused . Indeed . Tetty . Laying other photos on divan . Yes ; do n't you remember last winter , when he had to leave you and come out to Chicago , on that business of uncle 's ? we were a whole fortnight together . Every morning we took a long ride together into the country , and then after breakfast , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my orders in the library , he sat there writing his regular daily letter to you . Then , after dinner , we both used to doze off asleep in our chairs , and wake up at the same time regularly , and play a game of cribbage . Then good-night , and next day same thing . It was awfully jolly being together . APRILLA makes a movement as if an idea struck her , and then gazes intently at TETTY . You are smiling ; you do n't think much of such a hum-drum existence . Rises and goes R. to chair . He liked it , and as for me  --  well , I 'm a fraud . I was an old woman when I was born , and I 've kept on getting older ever since . APRILLA has gone aside , taking the photo of TETTY off its easel , and is studying it . Aprilla . Well , for an old woman , you are very well preserved . You are a good , sensible , practical girl . Did you ever think about getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aprilla . You would be perfectly happy in married life . Tetty . Reflectively , but ingenuously . Well , I must admit that , if the right party came along  --  Aprilla . The right party has come . Tetty . Eagerly . Has he ? Artfully . Do I know him ? Has he seen me often ? APRILLA nods to each question . Aprilla . Very often , and he would be perfectly happy with you . Tetty . Rising impulsively . Oh I know he would  --  checking herself . At least I would try and make him so . Aprilla . Quickly . Then I may go on and arrange ? As for papa 's consent , I 'll manage him . First make sure of your own feeling . Tetty . Frankly . Here 's my hand . It 's a bargain . Aprilla . Going aside . That is the very woman for him . Aloud . It 's a bargain ! You precious dear . Hugs her , and goes up , aside . Well , if Dick does n't thank me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alone L. Wo n't Bob be happy ! Sees BOB enter R. U. E. Oh , there he is . Bob . Eagerly . I say , Tetty . Did you ever know such luck ? I 'm all right with your uncle . Tetty . Are you going to Patagonia for him ? Bob . I offered to go , but he got a telegram in the nick of time , that made it unnecessary . Of course I pretended to be disappointed and all that ; in fact , looked so blue , that he thought it was his duty to cheer me up . Tetty . Suspiciously . Who was the telegram from ? Bob . Oh , it was anonymous ! I did n't sign any name to it . Tetty . You sent it ? Was n't that very wicked ? Bob . Not a bit . I only checkmated a little game of Dick 's to ship me off to the South Pole . I was n't wanted in Patagonia at all . Tetty . Then your disappointment was all put on ? Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turns her back . Bob . Embracing behind her . I 'm glad you do , because I ca n't dissemble my joy at having discovered a way to remain in New York , near you ! Tetty . Oh , if you apologize  --  Bob . I say , have you got any news ? Tetty . No . Nothing ever happens with me . Stop ! There is something may interest you . Cousin Aprilla has found a husband for me . Bob . Alarmed . What ? Tetty . Archly . She says it is somebody I meet here often . Bob . Relieved . Is n't she a daisy ? Discovered our secret , and won Dick over , too . Tetty . Changing . Oh , but there 's dreadful news about her and Dick . Confidentially . They 're going to be divorced . Bob . Divorced , and they 've only been married such a little time . Tetty . Yes ! It 's all settled . At least so they imagine . But as I am opposed to it , I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get married first . TETTY starts away R. For their sakes . We 'll be so much stronger , two of us . Tetty . Pretending . Did I say it was you I was going to marry ? Bob . Why , I 'm the only one here . Tetty . The only one ? Well , that 's cool ! There are lots and lots of people coming here all the time . We 've got no end of acquaintances . Bob . Shaking his finger . Here , now , Tetty , I hate dissimulation , and I despise dissimulators . Tetty . I am in earnest . The man I 'm to marry is reserved , devoted , confiding . Bob . I fill the bill . Tetty . He will never have any will but mine . Bob . My sentiments exactly . Tetty . And I intend to-day to make him a present of priceless value taking photos up from divan , which I hope he will appreciate . She selects a photo . My picture ! BOB tries to take it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it behind his back . As she reaches for it . Now remember I did n't give you that . Going up with the other photos . Bob . Still holding it behind his back . I got it all the same . Tetty . Laughing as she looks at the others in her hand . You took it by violence ; you 'll be righteously punished . Exit L. U. E. , laughing . Bob . Never mind . I 've got it . My darling ! About to kiss picture , looks at it . Why , it is n't Tetty . It 's Madame Lauretta . How 's that ? Ah , I understand , the little rogue . You shall be righteously punished . Goes up to mantel , looks around and sees TETTY 'S portrait . There she is ! Runs to it and speaks to portrait in his hand . Will you kindly change places with your pupil ? Substitutes MADAME . LAURETTA 'S photo for TETTY 'S . Thank you . Places MADAME LAURETTA 'S portrait on the easel upon the mantel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , Miss . You shall be righteously punished . Take this ! Kissing it . And this ! And this ! Continues kissing the picture as he exits R. 1 E. DICK enters L. U. E. Dick . So we 've found the right one at last . I 'm anxious to make the acquaintance of the right one at last . I asked Aprilla who it was . " Go and look on the mantel . " " What 's her name ? " " Go and look on the mantel . " Approaches the mantel , and is surprised to see the portrait there . By Jove ! It 's the music teacher . That 's a pretty scheme ! Taking the picture down , and looking at it critically . I wo n't say that she might n't do very well for somebody else ; but none for me , thanks . LITTLEJOHN enters from L. U. E. Littlejohn . Hullo ! What are you mumbling to yourself about ? Dick . Mumbling ! Littlejohn . What have you got there ! Dick . What have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking it up . Laura ! It is she to the life . To DICK . Is n't it a startling likeness ? Dick . Very ! Aside . Startled me ! Littlejohn . Look at that mouth  --  so childlike ! Dick . Um  --  yes ! Littlejohn . And those eyes so lamblike ! Dick . Um  --  let me see it again . Takes picture . Littlejohn . Points over his shoulder . And those tiny little ears , so kittenish ! Takes picture . Dick . Yes , the ears are  --  Littlejohn . And that form ! That figure ! Dick . Yes , yes . Takes photo . I begin to take an interest . I say , old fellow , it 's your doing , after all . Grasps his hand . Aprilla will be eternally obliged to you . Littlejohn . My doing ? What have I done ? Dick . Taking another longing glance at the picture . Yes , she looks it . You remember you told us she moved in the highest circles ? Another glance at the picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Confidentially , and bringing him forward . First publication of the banns of divorce between Mrs. Dymond and myself . Chicago , Cook County  --  Fact ! Littlejohn . Divorce ! You 're joking ! Dick . Am I ? Listen . While we were married , we were constantly wrangling . As soon as we agree to separate , we live like turtle-doves . The conclusion is obvious . We are better apart . But to prevent my remaining a melancholy bachelor , my present wife is looking me up another . LITTLEJOHN disengages his arm and looks at him . Nobody ever did that before , did they ? She 's the first . Littlejohn . Laughing . I think she is . It 's certainly original . Dick . You do n't believe it ? Littlejohn . Nonsense ! Mrs. Dymond is looking for another wife for you ? Dick . Triumphantly slapping him on shoulder . Yes ; and if I mistake not , she 's found one . Shows him photo . Littlejohn . Thunderstruck . Madame Lauretta ? Dick . Is n't that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman I was going to turn out of the house if it had n't been for you . Tries to grasp his hand . LITTLEJOHN indignantly retreats and snatches it away . Yes , sir ! Kisses his hand at picture . I 'm going to propose to her on the spot , and if she accepts me  --  Turns to go up . Littlejohn . Stops him imperiously . You will do nothing of the kind . Dick . Amazed . What ? Littlejohn . Expostulating . You are going too fast . Suppose she wo n't accept , or ca n't  --  and there 's every probability  --  she may , very likely does , love another ? Dick . She does n't love anything but her piano . I 've heard her say so . MADAME LAURETTA enters hastily , L. U. E. Madame L. He 's in here . Seeing LITTLEJOHN . Do I intrude ? About to withdraw . Dick . Hurriedly going to her . On the contrary , you will presently have a perfect right here . Madame L. A right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  --  yet . Nobody would all of a sudden . It 's the first case of the kind on record .

Littlejohn . Yourself . That 's very kind of her , is n't it ? Madame L. I ? Laughs . It is very considerate . To DICK . But am I not to be consulted ? Dick . Oh , it wo n't be done without your consent , of course . Madame L. That is something . Dick . You know how much my wife thinks of you ; well , you can make her the happiest woman in the world . Madame L. And I suppose it would be considered the height of ingratitude in me to refuse the first little thing she asks of me . Littlejohn . You will refuse , of course ! To DICK . You hear ; she refuses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow . She had quite set her heart on my having you . Madame L. Who has shaken her finger at LITTLEJOHN behind his back . You are mistaken . She does not refuse  --  she does not accept . Crosses C. My dear Mr. Dymond , I do n't say yes  --  I do n't say no ! To LITTLEJOHN Why should I say no ? Laughs bitterly . I am as free to do as I please  --  as free  --  as you are ! Exit L. U. E. Littlejohn . She seemed agitated  --  excited ! Goes up after her . Dick . You noticed it ? That 's a good sign , is n't it ? She 'll be mine yet ! Ah , ' Prilla will capture her , my boy . Goes up . Littlejohn . Fiercely , and crossing down past him . Go to the devil . Dick . Turning on him . Look here , old fellow , you are exceedingly inconsiderate . Is that the way to talk to a man who is just going to be married ? Just going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SKINNASTON enters , L. U. E. Never mind ! I 'll leave you alone with this tart old party . Escapes SKINNASTON , who wants to buttonhole him , and goes off . SKINNASTON goes down to LITTLEJOHN , who is pacing to and fro , muttering to himself . Skin . Skinnaston Hollo , old chappie ! Littlejohn . Still going . Ah , good morning ! Quite well ? Thanks . Skin . Skinnaston Following . I 've just called on Murphy 's secretary . He 's a brick of a fellow , only he was n't at home . Littlejohn . Muttering to himself aloud . Infernally coarse proceeding . Still going . Skin . Skinnaston Still following No , no ! It was n't his fault . Do you know it was my own son-in-law that put up that job ? Littlejohn . As before . The man 's perfectly conscienceless . Skin . Skinnaston As before . So he is , but I 've got it all straight now . Littlejohn . I sha n't worry myself any more !

Now that man 's a perfect stranger , and yet he 's as indignant as I am . APRILLA enters L. U. E. , in dinner dress , and goes down to mantel . Hollo , ' Prilly ! I 've got the Patagonian ! Aprilla . With joy . It 's gone ! He consents . Papa , see ! Skin . Skinnaston See what ? Aprilla . He has taken her picture . Skin . Skinnaston Who ? Aprilla . Tetty 's . Skin .

BOB enters above at these words , and runs to APRILLA , seizing both her hands . Bob . To APRILLA . Oh ! how can I thank you ! To SKINNASTON . I have just come to ask you for Tetty 's hand . Skin . Skinnaston You are too late again , Sonny . She 's engaged to Dick  --  now . Bob . Engaged to Dick ? Skin . Skinnaston Dick 's going to be divorced ! Then  --  oh , come here .

Boxes his ears with force and then covers her own face with her hands and drops on seat . Dick . Oh , the devil ! BARRY throws open-doors at back . Barry . Dinner is served . Guests enter variously . DICK offers his arm to TETTY , who comes from L. , but LITTLEJOHN , who enters from R. with SKINNASTON , carries , her off . He offers his arm to MRS . VAN GROOGE who enters L. U.

The doors are open at the back , showing the brilliantly lighted dining-room , as a background to the conservatory , which is now illumined with colored lights amid the palms and ferns . The company of the last act are variously placed about the room . A table with coffee-urn and cups on a tray is placed in front of the mantel , at which TETTY is presiding , pouring the coffee , which BARRY is serving . APRILLA sits at R. of divan , and LAURETTA sits beside her , toward C. DICK stands behind them . SKINNASTON and LITTLEJOHN are seated together under the palms at R. BOB is sitting alone on the L.  --  with a coffee-cup in hand  --  sulky and restless . Several ladies and gentlemen are in groups at back , and BARRY is serving them . The groups in front all have coffee-cups in hand . Lively buzz of conversation at rise of curtain . Aprilla . To LAURETTA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was exquisite . Skin . Skinnaston As good as the club ! Littlejohn . How do you manage ? Aprilla . I 'll tell you the secret . I have only one table for the servants ' hall and for ourselves . The consequence is that the cook surpasses herself for the sake of the domestics , and we reap the benefit . Dick . Aside to LITTLEJOHN . Let it be a lesson to epicures . Aprilla . To TETTY . We are waiting for the sugar , dear . Why , what 's the matter ? Tetty . Nothing ; oh , nothing ! Getting the sugar-bowl and coming down , looking at BOB , and aside . What can be the matter with Bob ? He wo n't even look at me . Aprilla . To TETTY . The gentlemen are in a hurry , dear . They 're dying to smoke . Littlejohn . To APRILLA as he helps himself to sugar . You are too good to let us smoke . May we , really ? Aprilla . Yes , in the library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to her . Sugar , sir ? Bob . Dryly . No , thanks . Tetty . Aside as she goes back to table . He wo n't even take sugar from me . Crosses R. and serves LITTLEJOHN and SKINNASTON . Bob . Aside . She dares offer me sugar , after what has passed . Dick . Calling to BOB . Have a cigarette , Bob ? No answer . Oh , yes , I remember ; makes you sick . Crosses R. BOB scowls and goes up and off L. gloomily , passing TETTY with a profound bow . Other gentlemen at back go off with them . Their lady companions stroll off R. at a word from APRILLA , who goes up to them . DICK goes to SKINNASTON . Have a weed , sir ? Skin . Skinnaston Gruffly . No , sir ; none of yours . Besides , you know I never smoke . I tried once , I believe , at your suggestion . Turns to LITTLEJOHN and begins an animated talk . Did I tell you I had seen Murphy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DICK is listening . He rises , takes LITTLEJOHN by the arm , and they go up . I 'll tell you about it afterward . To BARRY , who is up L. Barry , have you got the evening papers ? Barry . I 'll get ' em , sir . They 're in the hall . Dick . What do you want the papers for ? To find out about the Patagonians ? Skin . Skinnaston No , sir . I want to see if they 've settled on a site for the world 's fair yet . Exit L. U. E. Dick . Extraordinary thirst for novelty . Laura . Rises and goes to APRILLA , who has gone down L. and is standing alone reflectively . Why are you so silent ? Aprilla . Am I silent ? Oh , there 's no cause whatever , I 'm feeling so well ! Looks toward DICK , and laughs half hysterically as both stroll up stage R. and C. and LAURETTA exit . Littlejohn . Lighting a cigar which DICK has given him . The fact is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughs , lighting his . Oh , not with me . I probably began with the second . Strolls off toward L. slightly behind LITTLEJOHN . APRILLA touches him on the arm to attract his attention . LITTLEJOHN pauses in the doorway , turns and waits . Aprilla . To DICK . Your cigarette is n't lighted . Dick . Eh ? Catching her meaning . That 's a fact . To LITTLEJOHN . I 'll join you in a minute , old chap . LITTLEJOHN exit L. U. E. BARRY goes down to table as if to clear it . Aprilla . To BARRY . Never mind that now . I 'll ring for you . Comes down stage with DICK . Barry . Very well , ma'am ! Aside . Yes , she 'll ring when I 'm sitting comfortable at table . You bet I 'll come . Not much . Exit C. , drawing the curtains . Aprilla . As soon as she perceives they are alone , flings her arms about DICK 'S neck . Oh , darling Dick ! Can you forgive me ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking your pardon before all these people . Dick . Passing it off . Oh ! Aprilla . Say you forgive , wo n't you ? I could n't help it . I was carried away , and I am so sorry . To think I should have raised my hand to you ! Dick . H 'm ! It was n't raising your hand that hurt ; it was letting it down so heavily . Aprilla . You 're still angry with me ? Dick . Angry ? I had forgotten all about it the next moment . Aprilla . Yes , you are angry , and quite right ; to box your ears ! Give it back to me . Dick . I will . Kisses her . I 'm sorry you only boxed once . Aprilla . Kissing him . Then take another . And you will never , never speak of it to anybody , not even to me . I should feel so ashamed . Promise me ! Clinging to him . Dick . I promise ! Never ! Aprilla . Dear Dick ! Pause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richly deserved it . Dick . Quickly . No , no ; I wo n't confess anything of the sort . Aprilla . Now come ! Would it ever have occurred to me to propose to that Madame Lauretta ? Dick . Shaking his head doubtfully . W  --  well  --  Aprilla . Urging . Say you were joking . Dick . But I was not joking . Aprilla . That 's just to vex me . You 're a tease . Dick . Insisting . But I tell you  --  Aprilla . As if to shut him off . Anyway , that 's all over now . You 'll marry  --  Dick . I shall marry Madame Lauretta . Aprilla . Irritated . Oh ! Crosses R. Dick . She was your own selection . Aprilla . You still persist  --  Dick . I beg pardon ; it 's you who still persist . Aprilla . Come , come . Let 's go back a little . I sent you here to find  --  Dick . Yes , Madame Lauretta ; here 's the proof . Producing the photo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to look . Aprilla . Snatching it from him . Why , this is n't Tetty . Dick . Of course not . It 's Madame Lauretta . Aprilla . And that was on the mantel ? You dare to tell me that to my face ? You have the cheek ? Dick . Yes  --  the cheek , the nose , the mouth , the eyes  --  the eyes that saw it . It was the only one there . Aprilla . It 's a shame , to tell me I chose a person for you whom I do n't know the first thing about . Only that she pretended to be unhappy and alone in the world , and I opened my doors to her . I was fool enough to do it . Dick . Correcting . Kind enough , you mean . Aprilla . I said " fool . " An adventuress , insinuating herself among us , Heaven knows how ! Dick . Lighting his cigarette . I know . Aprilla . Quickly . You do ! At last he has betrayed himself . Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aprilla . You know more ! Dick . Not a particle . That 's enough . Aprilla . No , no . You have betrayed yourself . What a simpleton I was ! How they have both blinded me ! First ingratiating herself with Bob Packer 's sister , getting her to write me , and all the while it was a plot between you ! Dick . Aroused . Between me ? Aprilla . You . You did n't even respect your wife 's roof . Dick . Indignantly . When I was begging you to show her the door ! Aprilla . Oh , of course . You knew very well that was the way to make me keep her . Suddenly . But you sha n't marry her ! Dick . I will ! Aprilla . Gasping . You  --  you will ? Dick . I did n't want to , at first . Raises his hand . Heaven is my witness ! Gets behind chair L. That 's a respectable witness , is n't it ? Heaven is my witness ! But I reconciled myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've done it to oblige you . I 've made up my mind to it , and now you want me to go back on it . Aprilla . Trying to be calm . I wanted  --  Dick . You see you acknowledge you wanted  --  Aprilla . Keeping her temper . And I still want  --  Dick . You see ! Aprilla . Cousin Tetty ! Dick . Shows photo . Madame Lauretta ! Here 's the proof . Going up L. to R. Aprilla . Oh , oh , oh ! Goes down L. , unable to restrain herself . Dick . Going up , flourishing photo . Madame Lauretta , Madame Lauretta ! Exit R. U. E. , as MADAME LAURETTA comes on L. U. E. Madame L. Did I hear my name called ? Aprilla . Running to her . Oh , my dear friend , my husband has just been telling me  --  but you do n't believe it  --  you do n't believe I told him to do anything of the kind ! Madame L. Well , perhaps he took in earnest what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proposing to find him another wife ! You see you played with the  --  and  --  Pause . Aprilla . And what ? Madame L. He has been ignited . Aprilla . You mean that he has fallen in love with you ? MADAME LAURETTA laughs . And is this the way you return my kindness ? By leading my husband off ?  --  that poor lamb ! For it certainly never entered his head  --  Madame L. Expostulating . Now , my dear  --  Aprilla . It was your vanity ! You wanted to see him at your feet . You do n't love him ; he thinks you do , but you 're only laughing at him . MADAME LAURETTA makes an indignant movement . Oh , you may protest as much as you please , but you do n't love him . I know you do n't . Madame L. Indignantly . Certainly not . I have a great many failings , but not that particular one . Aprilla . Incensed . Failings ? Madame L. Now come , could any woman possibly fall in love with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime impudence ! Could any woman ! A woman does love him , deeply , tenderly ; a woman who is neither old nor ugly , nor a fool . Yes , madame , a woman does love him , for qualities of mind and heart and breeding which justify any woman 's love , and you need n't pity him either . If it be a failing , she has that failing , and she 's proud of it . Madame L. Smiling . At all events , she preserves remarkable eloquence . Reflectively . So Mr. Dymond is refined and intelligent . If I had known that , I confess I might have been tempted . Aprilla . Defiantly . You know it now ! Madame L. If I were to take you at your word ! Aprilla . Motions off . He 's in the library . Madame L. Witty , well-bred , generous ! How very tempting ! Goes up . Aprilla . Trembling with excitement . Are you going ? Madame L. Yes , into the library . Aside . Poor woman ! Exit R. U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few steps with a rush , and the stops . Well , what is it to me ? What do I care ? What do they care whether I care ? Let her go to him ! I shall stay here . Wishes to look off after them , but restrains herself . Perfectly indifferent ! With a burst . Oh ! About to go up , pauses again , and comes down to table all agitation . Perfectly calm ! Perfectly cool ! Pours out and drinks in rapid succession two glasses of water . If I were not calm ! Violently dashes the glass on table , breaks a cup . Oh ! Tapping bell violently , with a long ring . BARRY appears at C. Barry . Did you ring , ma'am ? Aprilla . Ah ! You 've come at last . Barry . In C. We was just having coffy , ma'am . Aprilla . Where have you been all this time ? Why do n't you clear this table ? Barry . Sure you said you 'd ring , ma'am . Aprilla . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Barry . Sarah , ma'am  --  sure . Aprilla . She 's gossiping down stairs , I suppose . She 'll go when her month 's up . All of you will go ; one 's as bad as another ! You understand ? When your month is up . Well ? What are you waiting there for ? Clear this table ! She goes up R. and listens off . He is going over to her . And she 's grinning all over at him . BARRY rattles the cups and saucers noisily . What do you mean by making all that noise ? Go away , instantly ; finish that later . Resumes watching . Barry . Yes 'm . Aside , going with tray . And people believe that people keep servants to wait on ' em . No such thing , they keeps ' em to relieve their nerves and tempers on ' em . Exit C. Aprilla . He has actually gone to her . Before my very eyes ! Comes down in amazement . Oh , no ! We 'll make short work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. U. E. She stops . LITTLEJOHN comes down . Littlejohn . Ah , my dear Mrs. Dymond , I 'm so glad to have an early opportunity of speaking to you . Aprilla . I was about to  --  Going . Littlejohn . Join your husband ? Oh , he is engaged in a very energetic talk with Madame Lauretta ; very energetic . I really had n't the cruelty to interrupt him . Have you ? Aprilla . Have I ? You just wait and see . About to rush off . Littlejohn . Still above her . Do n't go , I beg , before you have heard me . Aprilla . You really must excuse me  --  I  --  Littlejohn . Only a second ! To make a very simple request . Aprilla . A request ? For what ? Littlejohn . For your hand ! Aprilla . My hand ? Coming down . Well , I declare  --  I  --  Littlejohn . Severely . I believe I am entitled to some compensation in this matter . Aprilla . Turns on him in surprise . Compensation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some men want two , like your husband . That 's too much . But wo n't you try and persuade him to let me have the one that formerly belonged to him , in exchange for mine , which he is trying to take from me . Aprilla . He is taking yours ? Littlejohn . Yes  --  my wife ! Aprilla . Madame Lauretta ? Littlejohn . Mrs. Littlejohn ! Aprilla . Your wife ? She is your wife ? He nods assent . But it is all a mistake . Presses her hand to her head . And everything is going wrong . My husband is wrong . It was Tetty he was to marry  --  a quiet young girl , not a full-grown woman  --  he shall never marry a woman ! Never ! And she is your wife ! Dazed . I 'll go and tell him . Makes a step up . Littlejohn . Detains her . She was my wife , but she has left me , forever ! No , not forever ! My heart has always been hers  --  I swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try and make it up ! Friends ! That finished the business ; it always does . We were surrounded by friends . The mistake we made was in not going by ourselves . Aprilla . I 'll make it up between you ! Not for your sake ; for her sake , for mine , for my husband 's ! Crosses R. Oh , Dick  --  Dick ! you want a wife  --  you shall have one , your own , and nobody else . I 've changed my mind  --  thank Heaven ! Littlejohn . And you will secure my pardon ? Aprilla . If your wife loves you the least little morsel in the world  --  Goes up , looking off . Here she comes . Returns to him and extends her hand . We 'll test her . Here , take my hand ! Quick . Cover it with kisses . MADAME LAURETTA appears R. U. E. Littlejohn . What ? I see ! Seizes APRILLA 'S hand and kisses it . Madame L. Starts back . Oh ! Aprilla . Feigning confusion . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon for coming in so unceremoniously . Coming down . So it appears that while I was bringing your husband to his senses , you  --  With an outburst . Oh ! it 's shameful ! Aprilla . Delighted . She looks daggers . Just as I would ! To LITTLEJOHN . She loves you ! She loves you ! Littlejohn . Crosses to LAURETTA . Laura , is it true ? Madame L. I love him ? What do you mean ? Aprilla . Ask your jealousy ! Let that answer . He was only begging me to plead his cause with you . I promised , and he was thanking me , with a kiss ! And thanks to that kiss , I have the honor to announce the re-engagement of Mr. and Mrs. Littlejohn . Courtsey . Madame L. With a sneer . Rather premature , I think . Crosses C. Littlejohn . Laura , look at me . Madame L. Even if I did persuade myself to love you a little , once more , after the scandal of our separation , I would not come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , ai n't you a woman ? It 's the privilege of our sex to be crazy . Madame L. No , no . He 'll deceive me again . Aprilla . Then forgive him again . That 's what women are in this world for . We never do anything else all our lives . And while we can do that , we 're not so bad after all . Madame L. Never  --  never ! Littlejohn . Seizing her hand . Try ! SKINNASTON hurries in from R. U. E. Skin . Skinnaston I say , old fellow ! To LITTLEJOHN . I must speak to you right away . To MADAME LAURETTA . You 'll excuse me , wo n't you , Madame Lauretta ? Aprilla . Gayly , as if introducing . Mrs. Littlejohn . Skin . Skinnaston No ? Well , this beats all ! Going to be married to each other , eh ? Littlejohn . Indicates APRILLA . Thanks to your daughter , my dear Mr. Skinnaston . Help me to find a way of showing my gratitude to her . Skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What way ? Skin . Skinnaston Between them . Easiest thing in the world . It seems that before I get that Patagonian subsidy I must make certain application  --  very delicate , quite personal . As you know , Count Murphy  --  Here , you come along with me , and I 'll tell you what I want said . Tucks MADAME LAURETTA 'S arm under his and trots her off R. 1 E. To LITTLEJOHN , who is following . Come right along . Not a moment to lose . They exeunt . Littlejohn . Goes to APRILLA . My dear Mrs. Dymond , you 're an angel . Aprilla . Other men 's wives always are . As for you , you 're a  --  Littlejohn . A monster ! Aprilla . Worse than that . A man ! Go away ! I hate you . Run after your wife . LITTLEJOHN runs off R. as DICK saunters in L. U. E , tying a bouquet . Oh , these men ! Sees DICK , aside . There 's one of them . Just wait till I worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What have you got there ? Dick . Still tying the ribbon . As you perceive , a bouquet . Aprilla . For your fiance , Madame Lauretta , I suppose . Dick . Yes , I got it for her , at first ; but after the talk we 've just had  --  Pauses . Aprilla . Oh , then the course of true love has n't run altogether smooth ? Dick . H 'm ! no . You were right . You always are . Yes , I found we were not sympathetic . She 's too volatile , too whimsical . So I came around to your way of thinking . Aprilla . My way of thinking ? Dick . Yes . I intend to be guided entirely by you . Presents bouquet . Let me  --  beg you  --  to present these flowers , with the assurance of my undying devotion , to Cousin Tetty . Aprilla . To Tetty ? Dick . Yes . I 'll take her . Aprilla . Ironically . Oh , no , you wo n't . You 're only saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , ' pon honor ! Tetty is the very person for me . Aprilla . Then you have really decided  --  Dick . Yes , it 's the least I can do for you ! Aprilla . Really ? Dick . I 've disappointed you so often ; but this time , honor bright . Aprilla . Practically . I 'm so glad . Now you 're settled , I can give a thought to myself . Dick . Uneasy . Yourself ? Aprilla . Yes . Crosses R. You can hardly expect me , at my time of life , to settle down with papa , forever ? Dick . Why not ? You said  --  Aprilla . Interrupting . Well , this is in strict confidence . I can acknowledge it now . If Cousin Tetty has made an impression on you , I have not remained insensible on my part  --  Dick . I did n't understand anything of that kind ! Aprilla . He 's a very nice fellow . Papa likes him . Crosses L. Dick . Likes whom ? Aprilla . Evading the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your love for Tetty releases him and me  --  Dick . Who is it ? Aprilla . Then you must also remember , he wanted to marry me when you did ! Dick . Bounding , angrily . Bob Packer ! Aprilla . Is n't it strange how everything shapes itself ? Cousin Tetty takes your fancy , and Bob  --  Dick . Do you mean to tell me that you fancy that fellow ? That you love him ? Aprilla . Madly ! Do n't you love Tetty ? Dick . Passionately . She is the only woman can ever make me happy ! Aprilla . And he is the idol of my dreams ! Dick . Pretending  --  after a savage struggle with himself . Dear old Bob ! He wanted you when I did , did n't he ? and now  --  now he 'll get you ! Aprilla . Yes . How true it is that a patient waiter is no loser ! Dick . Dear ' Prilla ! Aprilla . Dear Dick !

I 'll attend to you presently . BOB exit L. U. E. angrily . As for you , madame ! Aprilla . Coming down in a state of excitement . I forbid you , sir  --  do you hear me ? I forbid you to exchange a word with Cousin Tetty  --  except in my presence . Dick . I was just about to say the same to you , madame . Aprilla . From this out , you do n't stir one step without me . Dick . Have no fear ; you 'll find me at your heels wherever you go . Aprilla . And I wo n't have you speaking to any woman  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do n't you dare to address a single man  --  or any other man . Aprilla . You belong to me ! Do you understand ? You are my property ! Things have come to a pretty pass when a woman ca n't keep the little she has ! Dick . Oh , no ! You belong to me , madame , and I propose to assert my rights . Both . Oh ! Aprilla . Beside herself . Anything  --  Anything rather than see you belong to another . I 'd rather  --  I 'd rather  --  Makes a dash at him as if to shake him , but he escapes . She pauses  --  then with a revulsion of feeling . Oh , Dick  --  Dick ! Do n't listen to me  --  I 'm mad . I never thought of Bob Packer for a moment , and you know it . But I want you to be happy . Sits half hysterically , half whimpering . After it 's all over  --  after we 're divorced , and I 'm dead , to you ! you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember our wedding-day ? It had been threatening rain , and a big cloud was on the lake  --  then , all of a sudden , the big sun burst out and made everything gay , and I was so happy  --  so happy ? Dick . And your eyes were so bright ! Aprilla . But when we went away , going in the cars , how it did pour ! Cries hysterically . Dick . Do n't , ' Prilla ; do n't . BOB and TETTY enter . Aprilla . Do n't worry about me , dear . I shall die , and you will feel sorry . I know that ! very sorry ! But it ca n't be helped . I love you too much to live . Throws herself in his arms . Dick .

And we let them bother us ! Bob and Tetty . Oh , I say ! Aprilla . Yes , and you shall be punished . Putting their hands together . There ! Bother each other for the rest of your life . LITTLEJOHN enters R. 1 E. with MADAME LAURETTA . Littlejohn . This sounds festive ! Dick . Advancing to MADAME LAURETTA . Madame , you have well-nigh wrecked the peace of this happy household . You did know it , or you did n't . Anyway , you are to be punished . Places her hand in LITTLEJOHN 'S . There ! Wreck each other 's peace . That is to say , get married . It 's the same thing . Madame L. Impossible ! I am married . Litttlejohn . So am I. Dick . Both of you ? Aprilla . Explaining . Yes ; to each other . Dick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as you are .

Now , sir , here 's a chance for you to say something ; three happy unions ! and to do something for Tetty . She 's going to marry your favorite , and ' Prilla and I will always have a home for you with us ; and Littlejohn and his wife will always be near . Now , rise to the occasion ! Skin . Skinnaston I will . Getting on the divan . Children , I give you  --  my blessing ! How 's that ? Dick . Very well for Bob , but we 'll take ours in cash . Skin . Skinnaston Gets down and offers his hand . Do n't say another word ; all that 's forgotten and forgiven . For my part , in view of what has happened , I 'll never mention the subject of money again ; and if you feel like doing me a favor in return , indorse this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that ? Skin . Skinnaston Application for the decoration of the Patagonian Confederation . Since I 've got the contract , I might as well fly the colors ; consists of a medal , a big star , three yards of ten-inch green ribbon , and a pound of gold fringe . I shall look like the 17th of March ; but I do n't care . Dick . Oh , we 'll all indorse it . Skin . Skinnaston Will you  --  all ? Dick , Littlejohn , and Bob . All . Skinnaston . Then that 's settled . And now to you To LITTLEJOHN and MADAME LAURETTA who are married , To BOB and TETTY to you who are going to be married , To audience , and to everybody who has been , will be , would be , or ought to be married : one word ! Let me tell you that true happiness in wedded life can only be found when the pair of you hitch up together , and never when you try to go a-tandem ! To APRILLA That 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by APRILLA . Love and love 's troubles have many times inspired Metaphors by scores , as Poets ' needs required : As " Love on Crutches , " when true love halted sadly ; " The Lottery of Love , " should Hymen turn out badly ; " Railroad of Love , " whose swift run never tarried ; And " Love in Harness , " when the pair were married ; But " Love a-Tandem , " some ' d think a " rig " bewitched , And with it look to see their " turn-out " ditched ! Yet , wise and homely , let us bid you heed : That some things never change in human breed . Fashions may come and go , as Fashion wills ; But Nature is as changeless as the hills ! Single or double , may men and women abide , But if they go double , then ever side by side . Back matter CURTAIN
