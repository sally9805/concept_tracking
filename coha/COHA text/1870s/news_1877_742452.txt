txt It is painful to note the almost universal misconstruction which the public has placed upon the conduct of that able and excellent financier , Mr. WILLIAM C. GILMAN , who is now wearing his fingers to the bone and straining his joints and muscles , by toiling as a book-keeper in Auburn Prison . What was Mr. GILMAN 'S pretended offense I Technically it was termed by the lawyers forgery ; but , in point of fact , it was simply the negotiation of loans in a peculiar way . He needed money , and borrowed it by depositing with the lenders the bonds and stocks of certain corporations as collateral security . Mr. GILMAN was well aware that upon a security of the value of , say one hundred dollars , he could not borrow more than that sum . He therefore adopted the ingenious practice of adding a zero to the figures " 100 , " thus transforming a hundreddollar security into one of a thousand dollars , upon which he had no  --  trouble in borrowing at least five hundred dollars . The bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were worth much less than they had supposed , and , of course , they suffered what they regarded as a loss . That they slould be indignant was perhaps natural , since there are few grasping and bloated capitalists who possess sufficient liberality and magnanimity to be pleased when they suffer from what they term robbery : It is even probable that in an . effete monarchical country like England , where dull conservatism is preferred to really smart financiering , Mr. GILMAN 'S conduct would meet Nstith some disapproval . It is , however , little less than monstrous that in this free and enlightened country , Mr. GILMAN should be coarsely called a robber , and sent to jail , almost at the precise time when a Congressional commission was presenting a report which is a full and unanswerable justification of Mr. GILMAN 'S peculiar policy . Some years ago , the United States , being afflicted with a President who lacked sufficient intelligence to perceive that the Southern States could be readily conciliated by the surrender of Fort Sumter and the transferring of the Federal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a civil war which cost a great deal of money . In these circumstances the United States borrowed many millions of dollars , offering as security for the payment thereof their own bonds . At that time , although there was nominally a silver dollar in existence , few persons had ever seen such a coin and no one dreamed of paying debts with it . Subsequently the United States entirely abandoned the obsolete silver dollar , and made gold the sole monetary standard . The men who loaned money on the security of the Federal bonds expected to be paid in gold , and to avoid all possible doubt on the subject , Congress expressly promised that the bonds should be paid in gold and in gold only . The lenders of money fully believed that the bonds of the United States were worth what they professed to be worth and what Congress and various Seeretaries of the Treasury declared . that they were worth . But now comes the Congressional Monetary Commission , and announces as the result of its careful investigations that the United States bonds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the legal currency of the country when the bonds were issued no one denies , and it is equally true that while it was specified that the bonds were to be paid in coin , the words " gold coin " were not used . As for the promise subsequently made by Congress and by certain Secretaries of the Treasury that the bonds should be paid ill gold , it is clear in the minds of the Commissioners that ' what one Congress said another Congress can unsay . Hence these ingenious and excellent Commissioners hold that the bonds should be paid in silver , which , at present prices , is worth about six cents less than gold , thus saving the United States a very large amount of money . Of course , if this is done , the creditors of the United States will be as indignant as were GILMAN 'S creditors . They will say  --  as said the stubborn and grasping bankers who held GILMAN 'S securities  --  that they lent their money upon securities that they supposed were worth what theywere represented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worth much less . There is , it is true , this point of difference between the policy recommended by the Monetary Commissioners and that pursued by GiLmAx . The latter altered his securities before he borrowed money upon them , and the former propose to alter our national securities after we have obtained money upon them and spent it . But in principle there is no difference whatever between the two policies . In each case money is lent in good faith , and subsequently the lenders find that their securities have been tampered with , and that they themselves have been  --  as they would doubtless brutally express themselves ? " cheated . " It is with such reprehensible language that creditors are prone to characterize the result of any ingenious plan which interferes with their hopes of getting back their money . If the United States are prepared to adopt the views of the Monetary Commission , and to pay their creditors 6 per cent . less than they promised to pay , Mr. OILMAN will be completely vindicated , and the inconsistency of keeping him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished for doing on a small scale what the Commissioners propose that the nation should do on a large scale ? Why should it be called forgery for a private citizen to make money by altering securities , when it is called a wise financial measure for the nation to save money by altering its securities ? It was Mr. GILMAN 'S misfortune that ho surrendered himself and pleaded guilty to a coarse criminal indictment a few days too soon . He should have waited until Messrs . JONES , GROESBECK , and their associate Commissioners , had made their report . He could then have boldly justified his financial policy by insisting that it differed only in a slight matter of detail from that proposed by the commission . Instead of being in Auburn Prison , Mr. GILMAN ought properly to be in Washington , where his practical experience in the art of altering securities would be of vast service to the Commissioners who wish to alter the securities of the United States .                 @ @ @ @
