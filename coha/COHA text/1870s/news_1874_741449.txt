txt The danger from wooden buildings in cities has been again forcibly illustrated . It was a mere matter of accident that the illustration was not still more significant . The wonder in regard to the recent Chicago fire is , as our readers are well aware , not so much that it was so destructive , but that it was not a great deal more so . There are , we believe , in all our large cities , ordinances against the erection of frame buildings . These regulations are , in some places , very loosely enforced ; but we have nothing at present to say on that point . What we wish hero to speak about is the construction of such buildings in places where there are no enactments of this kind . It would seem to require no great sagacity to know that a combustible building would burn just as fast if other houses had been put up around it after it was erected , as it would if it bad been originally placed in the midst of the other houses ; and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur to the people of villages which are expected to grow into cities , or to the inhabitants of suburbs which the closely-built portions of cities are likely eventually to include . Our people have , as a general rule , a great propensity to build wooden houses . The only very marked exception to this which we can think of is the old settled counties of Pennsylvania . Almost everywhere else , stone or brick buildings are scarcely ever seen at all in the rural districts , and very few of them oven in pretty large towns . For this there are four principal reasons : First the frame buildings are considered more economical ; second , they are thought to be less liable to dampness ; third , they can be more rapidly constructed , and fourth , the people have become accustomed to them . The last mentioned of these reasons is , in many cases , the most potent . Houses are not the only thing in which people adhere to a custom long after the circumstances under which i t originated have disappeared . In former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the prevalence of frame buildings had much more force than now . Lumber was cheap , and . bricks and good . building-stone were dear , and often hard to obtain at any price . The only choice enjoyed by many families in regard to a residence lay between a wooden house and living out of doors . This is still true in some localities ; but , on the other hand , there are many men who fancy it to be true , when their only ground for such a supposition is that it was so in the case of their fathers . In regard to the quickness with which frame houses can be erected , there can be no doubt that they possess , iu that respect , a great advantage . It must be acknowledged , also , that while the importance of this rapidity is often overrated , there are sometimes circumstances which render it a matter of very great moment . This is especially true in the West . Still , a great deal more might have been done in many Western towns than has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures , which are as easily set on fire as a pile of shavings . In regard to the first two reasons which we have mentioned as occasioning the building of so many frame houses , we believe that , in many localities at least , they are both entirely fallacious . As for cheapness , the difference between the cost of a stone or brick wall and . of a frame and clapboards , forms , at the present prices of lumber on the seaboard , so small a percentage of the cost of a house that it is scarcely worth considering . Indeed. , there are many experienced builders who are decidedly of the opinion that , taking into the calculation the cost of repairing and keeping painted a wooden structure , a brick or stone one is , in the long run , much the cheaper . As for dryness , the superiority of a frame house in this respect is very much a ? matter of tradition . A stone or brick dwelling , with the rooms plastered in the old-fashioned way directly upon the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but a house in which the walls are furred and lathed , and . which is proper - ly constructed . in other =expects , is no more liable to be damp ; even in the open country , than a frame house . The tendency of population in the past few years has been greatly toward collecting itself in towns and cities . In the meantime , many people who have been brought up on farms forget that there is , any way in which a house can take fire except from the inside , or that , if it does ignite , it endangers any property but that of its owner or occupant . Such people , accordingly , when they move to a village or town , often build just as they had been accustomed to do in the open country . It would . be well if the local authorities in our villages and small cities would look to this matter more closely than they are doing . Many of these places are growing very rapidly . Even a few months ' delay may , inthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very disastrous tonsequences.
