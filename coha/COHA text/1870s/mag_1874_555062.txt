Journalism and Journalists . JOURNALISM AND JOURNALISTS . THE readers of Mr. Frederic Hudson 's entertaining history of Journalism in the United States from 1690 to 1872 - that is , from the birth of Franklin to the death of Greeley - have learned therefrom , long since , what the modern newspaper is , how it originated , and whither it is tending . It is a common sayin in England that America is governed by newspapers , - and this by way of sneer , according to the charming fashion of Englishmen . But long ago Jefferson anticipated and met this reproach , when he said , " I would rather live in a country with newspapers and without a government , than in a country with a government but without newspapers . " The alternative is seldom presented nowadays ; indeed , it has been found easier to overthrow a government at Paris , Madrid , Mexico , or Rome , than to stop a well-managed newspaper . The steam-press , the electric telegraph , the enormous development of commerce and industry in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of democratic ideas and institutions , social as well as political , have given newspapers a position and a responsibility which is but imperfectly understood , even by those who have the most to do with them . Journalism has been called the Fourth Estate ( though what the other three are in America , it might puzzle us to tell ) , and certainly it is somewhat in the attitude of the Third Estate of France , as described by the Abb6 Siey*s in his brief catechism : What is the Third Estate ? Everything . What has it hitherto been ? Nothing . What does it aspire to be ? Something . " Journalism in America is something , has been nothing , and aspires to be everything . There are no limits , in the ambition of enterprising editors , to the future power of the American newspaper . It is not only to make and unmake presidents and parties , institutions and reputations ; but it must regulate the minutest details of our daily lives , and be school-master , preacher , lawgiver , judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination . We find it intruding and interfering everywhere . It reports everything , has an espionage as universal and active as any despot ever established , and makes its comments with that species of boldness which the undiscriminating call impudence , on all that happens , or is imagined to happen or to be about to happen . It scorns to confine itself to the realm of the past and the present , but deals largely with the future . A German play represents in one of its scenes " Adam crossing the stage on his way to be created ; " and much of the news gathered by our dailies is of this anticipative sort ; imposing upon these active journals the necessity of contradicting on Tuesday the intelligence they have given on Monday . Sydney Smith was fond of dating events before or after " the invention of common-sense ; " and certainly the common-sense that contrived the modern newspaper does not go back many centuries . It is traditional to speak of newspapers as first originating in Venice early in the fifteenth century ; but this Venetian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government bulletin , and unworthy of the name of newspaper . Dr. Johnson , in his life of Addison , asserts that " this mode of conveying cheap and easy knowledge began among us in the Civil War , " that is , in Cromwell 's time ; but Cleveland , the loyal poet , affirms in his Character of a London Diurnal , that " the original sinner of this kind was Dutch ; Gallo-Belgicus the Protoplas , and the modern Mercuries but Hans en Kelders . " Fabricius , the German contemporary of Addison , gives the date of this Mercurius Gallo-Belgicus as from 18rT4. // 1555 to 1632 , and mentions that it had been collected into eighteen octavo vol .. umes , and published at Frankfort . Carew 's Survey of Cornwall , published in 1602 , quotes some news from this Flemish newspaper . Its title of Mercury was copied by the real founder of English newspapers , Marchamont Nedhain , whose Mercurius Britannicus did good service against King Charles and the prelates in the early years of the Long Parliament . As Captain Nedham is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern " able editor , " it may be well to speak of him more at length . Disraeli the elder ( whose account of the origin of newspapers , it must be said , is very inaccurate ) calls Nedham " the great patriarch of newspaper writers , a maa of versatile talents and more versatile politics ; a bold adventurer , and the most successful , because the most profligate , of his tribe . " Some account of his life is given by old Anthony h Wood in his Athense Oxonienses , from which we learn that he was a student of Oxford about the time that Milton was studying at Cambridge ; and that , like Milton , he came afterwards to London and was a school-master there . Then he dabbled in law and was an under clerk at Gray 's Inn ; afterwards " studied physic and practised chymestry ; " and finally , he became a soldier and was known as Captain Nedham of Gray 's Inn . By this time we have got to the year 1643 , when he began the publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , says the Tory Anthony , " siding with the rout and scum of the people , he made them weekly sport by railing at all that was noble in his Intelligence , called Mercurius Britannicus , wherein his endeavors were to sacrifice the fame of some lord , or any person of quality , and of the king himself , to the beast with many heads . " He soon became popular , and " whatever he wrote was deemed oracular . " In 1647 , however , either because he thought the Presbyterian party were going too far , or for a worse reason , he went on his knees to King Charles , was reconciled to the royalists , and , to quote Wood again , " he soon after wrote Mercurius Pragmaticus , which , being very witty , satirical against the Presbyterians , and full of loyalty , made him known to and admired by the bravadoes and wits of those times . " He began this second newspaper in September , 1647 , when the king was intriguing with Cromwell and with the Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms ; he seems to have continued it till the king 's cause became hopeless ; when , persuaded by Bradshaw and Speaker Lenthall , as Woods says , " he changed his style once more in favor of the Independents . " This was early in 1649 ; and now he again christened his Mercury , and called it Merenrius Politicus , under which name it continued for more than ten years , and through the whole of Cromwell 's reign . " He was then the Goliath of the Philistines , " says Wood , " the great champion of the late usurper ; and his pen , in comparison with others , was as a weaver 's beam . " In 1659 the government ceased to make his " weekly newsbook " their official organ , and , on the restoration of Charles II . in 1660 , Nedham fled to Holland , fearing for his life . After a while he was pardoned by the king and allowed to return , but forbidden to continue his newspaper ; and , instead of him , the servile wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career of Marchamont Nedham has been repeated in every generation since his day , by some able man , in every country where newspapers have flourished . His first successor was De Foe , the novelist , who began to publish his Review in 1704 , and continued it through nearly the whole reign of Queen Anne , supporting sometimes one side in politics , and sometimes the other , but always with spirit , and with an eye to the good of his country . His advice to editors , based , as he says , upon his own experience , is as good now as when he wrote it : " If a writer resolves to venture upon the dangerous precipice of telling unbiased truth , let him proclaim war with mankind , neither to give nor // take quarter . If he tells the crimes of great men , they fall upon him with the iron hands of the law ; if he tells their virtues ( when they have any ) , then the mob attack him with slander . But if he regards truth , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may go on fearless ; and this is the course I take myself " If De Foe meant to say that he had been martyred for his truth-telling , he was right , for he began his newspaper , as his contemporary , Bunyan , did his sacred romance , in jail , after he had been set in the pillory by Queen Anne 's government for writing satires on the high church party . He was thrown into iNewgate in 1703 , and pardoned out by the queen , at the request of Harley and Godolphin , in the latter part of 1704 , when his semi-weekly Review had been in course of publication for eight or ten months . In March , 1 705 , he made it tn-weekly , and it so continued till May , 1713 , when he was again imprisoned , fined , and compelled by his misfortunes to suspend the publication of his newspaper . He was a second time pardoned out by the queen , but she died the next year , and he was left with no powerful protector against the malice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed , along with other causes , now induced De Foe to accept a situation from which most men of honor would have shrunk , and which must be regarded as a blemish on his character , in spite of the arguments used in his behalf by his latest biographer , Mr. Lee . He became connected with the Tory newspaper , Mist 's Journal , and was concerned in its management for several years , during the reign of George I. , all the while acting as a spy on its contributors , and in correspondence with the Whig ministry , who were glad to make this use of his services . De Foe 's contributions to this and other newspapers , during the last fifteen years of his life , ' have been culled from them by Mr. Lee and published in two large volumes . They show with what zeal and industry he followed the profession of journalisiu , at an advanced age , and when he had become a famous and popular author . As Nedham and De Foe are good examples of public journalists discussing politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apart from political or religious controversy . The Spectator , though a daily , could hardly be called a newspaper . Its predecessor , the Tatler , had increased its circulation by publishing news from the Continent ; but when Steele gave up the Tatler in 1710 , and joined his friend , Addison , in beginning the Spectator ( March 1 , 1711 ) , he ceased to make news any part of his plan , and devoted the new journal solely to literature . At first it was somewhat colored with the liberal politics of its editors , but this was gradually changed , until it became equally popular with all parties . But Steele , who was a warm patriot and partisan , soon grew weary of this neutrality , aud in his Guardian ( 1713 ) , and Englishman ( 1714 ) , returned to political writing , in consequence of which be was censured and expelled from the House of Commons in 1714 . Nor did he take any share in the revived Spectator of 1714 , which was managed by Addison alone , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something extraordinary for that period . It was printed on a half sheet " of the vilest paper of which any specimens have descended to posterity , " says Chalmers , and sold at first for a penny , at which price it had a daily sale of from three to ten thousand . When the stamp duty was first imposed ( August 1 , 1712 ) the additional half penny thus exacted reduced the sale one half , for the price was raised to two pence . This tax eventually killed the Spectator , as it did Swift 's Examiner ; and no doubt it had something to do with the failure of De Foe 's Review . Occasional issues of the Spectator seem to have sold as many as fourteen thousand copies ; a very large number when we consider that the London Morning Post , nearly 1 He died in 1731 , at the age of seventy-one . Lee to have been in some way connected with his The misfortunes of his last years are believed by Mr. unhandsome behavior towards Mist and the Tories . 1874. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an enormous circulation when Coleridge 's leading articles and the news of Napoleon 's wars had increased its sale to four thousand five hundred copies ; and the London Times was some forty years in reaching a circulation as great as the Spectator acquired in a year . Before De Foe , or Addison , Steele , Swift , Berkeley , Bolingbroke , or any of their witty contemporaries had engaged in journalism in the mother country , New England , according to the traditions , had seen the first American newspaper , the Publick Occurrences of Benjamin Harris , of which one number was published in Boston , September 25 , 1690 , " at the London coffee-house , which Harris kept . " Mr. Hudson reprints this sheet in full ; its authenticity has been questioned , but , so far as can be seen , without sufficient cause . De Foe 's kinsman , the bookseller Dunton , gives a brief notice of Harris , who was a printer , and like De Foe , had stood in the London pillory for some publication . His Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city saw fit to suppress it , as they afterwards tried to suppress the Courant of the Franklin family , for its strictures on the Mathers and other Boston ministers . Their view of the matter , both then and afterwards , - and it is an opinion still discernible in some parts of Massachusetts , - had been expressed by Roger L'Estrange , when he succeeded Marchamont Nedham as official organ of the English government . " Supposing the press in order , " says L'Estrange , " the people in their right wits , and news or no news to be the question , a publique Mercury should never have my vote ; because it makes the public too familiar with the actions and counsels of their superiors , too pragmatical and censorious ; and * , ives them not only an itch , but a colorable right and license to be meddling with the government . " In 1722 , the Massachusetts General Court took notice of this impertinence of the Franklins in venturing to have a different opinion from the Mathers , and voted that James Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courant , or any other pamphlet or paper of the like nature , " except it be first supervised by the secretary of this province ; " inasmuch as " the tendency of said paper is to mock religion , and bring it into contempt ; that the Holy Scriptures are therein profanely abused , the reverend and faithful ministers of the gospel are injuriously reflected on , and the peace and good order of His Majesty 's subjects of this province disturbed by the said Courant . " In consequence of this vote , the newspaper was for a while published in the name of Benjamin Franklin , then a youth of sixteen . The rest of the story is well known ; the two brothers quarreled , and Benjamin , at the age of seventeen , went to Philadelphia , where a few years later he established the first really good newspaper in America - the Pennsylvania Gazette . When our Revolution began , a hundred years ago , daily newspapers had become common in England , and were not unknown in America . IDr . Johnson , writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Journals are daily multiplied without increase of knowledge . The tale of the morning paper is told in the evening , and the narratives of the evening are bought again in the mornincr " a description which may still apply in Boston , if not in London . A few of the London dailies now existing are as ancient as the Worcester Spy , which kept its centennial in 1870 , and of which that worthy old printer , Isaiah Thomas , was the founder . The Spy was not a daily , however , for the first seventy-five years , but generally a weekly . In 1794 it had the pedantry , not unusual then , to print its motto - The Liberty of the Press is Essential to the Security of Freedom - in four languages , English , Latin , Greek , and French . At that time it was just about one fourth of its present size ; that is to say , its readers received in a week less than a twentieth part of the matter that the readers of the daily Spy now get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a dollar and a half , instead 58 July , // of the eight dollars now paid for the daily Spy , and only a fourth of its space was given to advertising , instead of about three fourths , as now . Its news from Europe , in 1794 , was nearly three months old , from Canada and Georgia more than a month old , and from New York a week , instead of coming twice every day from all these and a thousand other places , as it now does . Its editorial writing was almost nothing ; and this was true of most American newspapers at that time . If principles were to be discussed or events commented upon , the task was usually left to correspondents , who , under various English and Latin names , maintained one side or the other of political and social questions . The connection of poets and literary men of the highest rank with the modern newspaper is well known , and need only be alluded to . Had Goethe lived in England , instead of Germany , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he was at Weimar . In Paris everybody commences by writing for the journals . Sainte-Beuve and George Sand did so from the beginning ; Thiers was and remains a journalist ; and the Revue des Deux Mondes - the first authority in the world in matters of literature and philosophy - is but an exalted and glorified newspaper . Of this review and its editor , Buloz , George Sand said twenty years ago , " With perhaps two or three exceptions , all that have preserved a name as publicists , poets , novelists , historians , philosophers , critics , travelers , etc. , have passed under the hands of Buloz , that man of sense , who can not talk , but who has great keennesa under his rough exterior . It is very easy , too easy , in fact , to laugh at this capricious and uncivil Genevese ; he is even goodnatured enough to let you make sport of him , when he is not cross ; but what is not so easy is to avoid being persuaded and controlled by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I have always squarely refused ; although his critics steadily asserted that I had a great deal of talent so long as I wrote for the Revue , but since my quarrel with it , - alas , alas ! * This is an able editor 's portrait , which might almost serve for a type of the class ; it is such men who succeed with newspapers and with magazines . Thoreau 's pungent criticism on the newspapers is not quite so true now as when he made it , twenty years ago . " I am sure , " says he in Walden , " that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. * To a philosopher all news , as it is called , is gossip , and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea . " " Read not the Times ; read the Eternities . " But even this philos .. opher admits that he read one newspaper a week , though he feared that was too much , and found that the sun , the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much to him as before he desecrated his mind by letting in idle rumors and trivial incidents . And it is very true that to the serious thinker the murmurs brought by every day 's report of the incessant stir of mankind are chiefly a disturbance and dissipation of his thought . But the journal of to-day is no longer a mere record of daily events ; it occupies itself with the thoughts of men , the discoveries of science , the treasures of literature , and the acts of heroes . There came a time after Thoreau had said these things , when he was driven to the morning paper with as much eagerness as anybody ; when , as he says , " I read all the newspapers I could get within a week . " It was when John Brown lay wounded at Harper 's Ferry , and his enemies , thronging about him , drew from him those answers that rang through the country for years , and still thrill the heart as we recall them . It was the everlasting reporter of the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words that might else have been lost , or distorted in the recital of the base men to whom they were spoken . Then it was made manifest for what purpose the Herald had been allowed to exist all these years , - no other paper could have had a reporter there , and without him the con1874. 59 // versation must have perished . All this was " foreordained and freely predetermined ; " and John Brown , lying there on the armory floor , was the final cause of the Herald and its otherwise unaccountable editor . In those days the Times and the Eternities got printed on the same sheet , as they always do when a hero appears . The*triviality for which Thoreau complained of the newspapers , he was no less sensible of in the . daily life of his fellow-men . " Nations ! " he cries , " what are nations ? Tartars and finns and Chinamen . Like insects they swarm . The historian strives in vain to make them memorable . " How , then , could he expect the journalist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds , be it trivial or momentous , if it only be significant . And the great struggle of the editor , as of the historian or the essayist , always is to choose the significant fact , the event that really means something , and to give prominence to that . The telegraph and the innumerable newspapers have made the world one enormous ear of Dionysius - a perpetual whispering gallery ; and out of the confused mass and rumble of rumors , the poor journalist must snatch and print what he can , for it is quite impossible to give currency to everything . But the best journals now aim to furnish their readers not only the news of the day , but the thought and spirit of the epoch ; and to some extent they do so . Of late , too , there has been a perceptible increase in the courage of our journalists . The same thing has been happening in this country within a dozen years , which an acute Frenchman , Baron d'Haussez , who was one of the ministers of Charles X. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in Europe forty years ago . " For a long time , ** he says , " the English newspapers limited themselves to studying public opinion ; to follow in its wake was their sole aim . But lately the English press , following the example of the French journals , has jumped from the tail to the head of popular opinion ; it seeks to mark out the course this opinion should follow , and aspires to direct it . The newspapers find fault with , denounce , menace one party and stimulate the other ; and public sentiment is no less the slave of journalism in London than at Paris . Every observer of our American newspapers since the civil war began will see how well these remarks apply to them . Their tone has greatly changed ; and though they are not yet models of courage , they are by no means deficient in boldness and confidence . They no longer deem it their highest duty " to feel round for the average judgment of their readers , and express that , " as Wendell Phillips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead rather than to follow ; and instead of drawing steadily in the traces of party , as political newspapers did in the days of Jackson and Polk , they now try , every now and then , to form new parties , and raise new political issues ; and sometimes they succeed . One reason for this change , which all must have noticed , is the vast change in the circumstances of our country and the features of American society . We have passed rapidly from a provincial to an imperial position among the nations , with all the attendants of our prosperous career , - fabulous wealth , increased culture , a prodigious diversity of tastes and interests , and a wide expansion of the horizon of individual ambition . These things stimulate us in all directions , and their influence is nowhere more keenly felt than in the field of journalism , where they are first noted and most frequently registered and compared . Under the spur of such excitements , a new class of newspaper editors has appeared . In the book of Captain Basil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occurs this graphic sketch of the editors of that day : " The conductors of American journals are generally shrewd hut uneducated men , extravagant in praise or censure , clear in their judgment of everything connected with their own interests , and exceedingly indifferent to all matters // which have no discernible relation to their own pockets or privileges . " How well this describes Thomas Ritchie , Isaac Hill , Thurlow Weed , and men of that stamp , a few of whom still remain at the head of newspapers they have founded or inherited ! But the new race of American editors is different . In spite of Mr. Greeley 's bucolic sneer , - " Of all horned cattle , a college graduate in a newspaper office is the worst , " - nearly all the rising and lately risen journalists in the country are educated men , many of them highly accomplished in scholarship or literature . Such as were not educated at the outset have oftentimes pursued their studies , and taken their degrees in half a dozen newspaper offices , - no mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , too , familiar with foreign countries , and , what is quite as necessary and less common , with their own ; accustomed to meet and deal with people of all sorts , and especially with the able men of their region . Not a few of them , in the late war , enriched their minds with the experiences of army life , either as soldiers or as war correspondents ; some are popular lecturers , others are cultivating literature with zeal and success ; all , as a class , are alert of mind , with their faculties ready at command , and trained to steady service as much as any professional men in the land . Moreover , journalism is drawing into its ranks every year more and more of the intellectual ability of the country ; cler* , ymen leaving , their pulpits , lawyers their briefs , school-masters their desks , and scholars their studies , to ply the pen for the daily and weekly newspaper . Add to these the multitude who , without abandoning their old avocations , are correspondents or occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; including , as it does , so many women of genius and culture . When Mrs. Child , that genial grandmother of feminine journalism in America , wrote her Letters from New York , and when Margaret Fuller went to the same city to help Mr. Greeley edit the Tribune , how daring and strange their venture seemed to their country-women ! But now their successors may be counted by the thousand ; and nothing so much surprises and delights a young editor as to find what rich stores of womanly talent and insight he can draw upon to enrich his columns . Every editor now rejects , for want of room , bushels of manuscripts from feminine hands , that twenty years ago would have been sought out and proudly printed , - only , twenty years ago they did not exist . And yet , with all this thronging of recruits to the rendezvous of journalism , the number of really able editors is small . Some years ago a journalist in another city was lamenting the poverty of Boston in this respect , and said with real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good journalist in all Boston , and they re spoiling him in the pulpit ! " Of course , things have changed for the better since then , in Boston - but hardly elsewhere . Brilliant and forcible and sensible as so many American journalists are , they seldom develop into marked superiority ; each has his foible , his impediment , and does not rise beyon d a certain level . Some of them remind us of the compliment paid by a German prince to Wellington 's troopers ; he liked the British cavalry , he said ; " there were none better in the world , ff they only knew how to ride . " Mr. Greeley , for example : how magnificently was he equipped for journalistic service ! how much he has done , too ! And yet , he too often suggested that homely figure of a cow who gives a good pail of milk and then kicks it over - so furious , so ungovernable , were his whims . His great rival , Mr. Raymond , certainly could ride , but he persisted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canter briskly southward , then amble easterly and westerly ; but always came back at last to his centre of indifference . Unequaled in the details of journalism , he lacked the steady force and moral purpose that alone accomplish great results . Mr. Dana , who , like Mr. Raymond , was for a while the associate and afterwards the rival of Mr. Greeley , has shown some of th' // rarest and most masterly traits of a successful journalist ; but in these later years he has wantonly sacrificed the best parts of his reputation by a coarse , sensational , and impudent manner of conducting his newspaper . No other names than these three , - who are , on the whole , the most famous of American journalists , - are needed to remind us how easy it is for editors of rare ability and opportunity to fall short of the lofty ideal of journalism . Had Franklin lived in our day , and devoted himself to the work of a newspaper , as he did in his own century , he perhaps would have come nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Franklin it was said by Timothy Pickering that " he was never found in a minority . " Yet the ideal journalist must , like the greatest general , sometimes lead a forlornhope , and often must resist the public for the public good . Courage , indeed , is the one quality indispensable for journalism of the highest order , and it is what our journalists still lack most . Of courage as an intellectual accomplishment , or a means of winning respect and deference , they have a much better perception than of its moral quality . They are , therefore , often bold and self-confident , audacious to the verge of insolence , and sometimes beyond it ; but for that steady courage which accepts certain risks for uncertain advantagcs , and for that modest courage which dares more than it proclaims , they are not conspicuous . But it must be said that our newspapers , of late years , have one increased inducement and guarantee for a courageous course , - a much greater pecuniary independence than formerly . It grows more and more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it can afford to hold its price high . Nor do newspapers now depend for success , except indirectly , upon their subscribers . It is advertising that supports them mainly , and a great subscription list is chiefly valuable , pecuniarily , to a great newspaper , as being certain to attract advertisers . This , to be sure , is only changing the burden of servitude , for an ed itor whose chief aim it is to please his advertisers and retain their " patronage , " as it is called , is but one degree less fettered than he who dodges and shuffles to please his subscribers . And it is important that newspapers should be the property , so far as possible , of those who have the editorial management ; for without this security from monetary dictation , a journal may be as venal as if it were purchased outright . Neither is it well for the owners of a newspaper to have much other property actively employed in business ; else they will be tempted to use their newspaper columns to promote their private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors and legislators , as we have lately seen illustrated , than by offering them an interest in schemes that depend upon public favor or special legislation for their success . The one excuse for all the annoyances and impertinences of which newspapers are guilty is their devotion to the public good ; and a journalist who is detected feathering his own nest , or helping his friends to do so , loses at once his privilege as public benefactor . Need we add that detection makes no difference in the offense ? It is the one unpardonable sin against journalism to cloak private gain or personal malice with professions of public virtue . Great as the temptations of a journalist are to enrich himself by subservient or corrupt courses , they are far less than his temptations to self-conceit , which is the main vice of modern editors , the sin that doth so easily beset us . To err is human ; this is a common frailty in ali occupations , especially such as are literary or political . We have an amusing instance in a religious poet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engraved , kneeling before a crucifix with a label from his mouth , " Lord Jesus , do you love me ? " which was answered by another label proceeding from the mouth of Jesus , " Yes , most illustrious , most excellent , and most learned Sigerus , poet-laureate of his Imperial Majesty , and most worthy rector of the University of Wittenberg , // - yes , I do love you ! " The flattery which our journalists devise for themselves is less heavenly-minded than this , but no less gross . Alc*eus and Callimachus are nothing to the titles we bestow on one another , when in good humor ; if you will take us at our own valuation you need be under no concern for the future of American literature . As Colonel Diver remarked to Martin Chuzzlewit , when handing him the Rowdy Journal for his perusal , " You 11 find Jefferson Brick at his usual post in the van of human civilization and moral purity . " The original Jefferson Brick has departed , no doubt , but he has left a family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them . Who is not forced to smile , sometimes , in the intervals of admiration , at the airs these gentlemen assume ? as if uncreated wisdom had taken bodily form in their persons . They will allow us to know nothing which they have not told us ; they give us epitomes of history after Tacitus , sketches of character after Clarendon and Kinglake , and systems of political economy as elaborate as Adam Smith 's . And so positive , too , in all their knowledge ! It should be the humble effort of a youn* , student 's life-time to acquire the omniscience of an American journalist under the age of thirty-five . " I wish I knew anything , " said Lord Melbourne , " as positively as Macaulay knows everything . " Why wonder that our American bishops at the tEcumenical Council easily agreed to the Pope 's infallibility ? Had they not seen an infallible chair in every one of the five thousand newspaper offices in their own country ? Still , let us be just to these instructors of ours ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole , ill-employed . It is common to laugh at newspaper English , and the knowledge that is derived only from the newspapers . But , except in those masters of style who are above comparison , there is no better English than we find in the newspaper ; and we can now fully appreciate what Horace Walpole meant in saying , a hundred years ago , " Every newspaper is now written in a good style ; when I am consulted about style , I often say , Go to the chandler 's shop for a style , ' " that is , read any old newspapers you may pick up . And he adds a strikingly just remark : " Had the authors of the silver age of Rome written just as they conversed , their works would have vied with those of the golden age . Writers are apt to think they must distinguish themselves by an uncommon style : hencc elaborate stiffness and quaint brilliance . What a prodigious labor an author often takes to destroy his own reputation ! " It is because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seeks to make himself understood rather than admired , that he writes so well ; and how well our best editors and correspondents write one can easily see by writing himself on one of their themes . These men and women are the lineal successors of Hobbes , who said if he had read as many books as the learned , he should have been as ignorant as they ; of DeFoe , whose " low style " is the admiration of all good critics ; of Franklin , who acquired his art of writing , by no means inferior to Addison 's , in a printing-office ; of the letter-writers and diarists , whose vocation has almost died out , except as they reappear in newspaper correspondents . Nor is it extravagant to say that the careful reader of a few good newspapers can learn more in a year than most scholars do in their great libraries ; while the multitude of men and women are actually instructed so , more rapidly than in any way ever tried before . At the same time , every able journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a smatterer ; he must have his say on every topic , and can not be well informed about all . There was no royal road to geometry in Euclid 's time , nor is there any railroad to universal knowledge now ; to acquire it is impossible , and to come within sight of it demands much time and much patience , neither of which our journalists commonly have . The fancied necessity of scribbling something about every 1874. 63 // event and every intellectual and social manifestation is the plague of an editor 's life , the ruin of his good manners , the cause of delusion , bewilderment , and skepticism in his readers . Couple this with that other superlative folly , the rule never to retract an assertion or correct a mistake , and we have the cause of more than half the impertinence , error , and mischief of which newpapers are guilty . A great deal is said about the slanderous character of the modern newspaper , and of its entire disregard of privacy and the right of individuals to be respected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our age is no worse than those before it . We have made error and slander more public by our inventions , but not more common , perhaps , nor more hurtful . In fact , the purely libelous industry of the press is probably less now , in comparison with its whole activity , than at any former time since pamphlets ( libelli ) began to be printed . This passage occurs in the letters of Prince Piickler-Muskau , written from England in 1826 , before the era of railroads , to say n6thing of the telegraph and the power-press : - " A strange custom in England is the continual intrusion of the newspapers into the affairs of private life . A man of any distinction not only sees the most absurd details concerning him dragged before the public , - such as where he dined , what evening party he attended , and so forth , - but if anything really worth telling happens to him , it is immediately made public without shame or scruple . Personal hostility thus has full scope , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the publication of articles to their own advantage , which they send themselves . It is easy to see what formidable weapons the press thus furnishes . Fortunately , however , the poison brings its own antidote with it ; this consists in the indifference with which the public receives such communications . An article in a newspaper , after which a Continental would not show himself for three months , here excites only a momentary laugh , and the next day is forgotten . " Would not this pass for a description of the - New York newspapers , we will say ? The personalities in which the editor of to-day delights , annoying as they often are , surely are no worse than those here censured , while they fill a much smaller space in the reader 's mind than formerly ; partly because the modern journal contains so much besides , and partly for the consoling reason given by the German prince , - that so much publicity defeats its own aim and makes little impression . It is also true , little as we may think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most respects from what they were thirty years ago , when Dickens saw , felt , and caricatured them . How we all winced under his satire in Martin Chuzzlewit , knowing so much of it to be deserved ! How the cries of the New York newsboys made our ears tingle I " Here s this morning 's New York Sewer ! Here s this morning 's New York Stabber ! Here s the New York Family Spy ! Here 's the New York Private Listener ! Here 5 the New York Peeper ! Here s the New York Keyhole Reporter ! Here s the Sewer 's article upon the judge that tried him , day afore yesterday , for libel , and the Sewer 's tribute to the independent jury that did n't convict him , and the Sewer 's account of what they might have expected if they had ! " etc. , etc . This satire no longer stings us as it once did , because , notwithstanding the occasional efforts of the New York Sun , Times , and Tribune to rival the scarcely imaginary Sewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - notwithstanding the recent appearance of the interviewing reporter , that pest of society , - the moral and intellectual standard of our newspapers has risen a great many degrees in thirty years . Nor is this the only change that has taken place . Since the death of Horace Greeley and the events which preceded and followed it , there is no difficulty in perceiving that we stand at the close of a long era of American journalism , and // are entering rapidly upon a new dispensation . The presidential campaign of 1872 , and the death of Mr. Greeley , mark the end of partisan journalism in its old form , - that epoch of which the New York Tribune was the product and the survivor . " With the death of the founder of the Tribune , " says Mr. Hudson , " party journalism pure and simple , managed by accomplished and experienced editors , inaugurated by Jefferson and Hamilton , aided by such writers as Fenno , Bache , Duane , Freneau , Coleman , Cheetham , Ritchie , and Croswell , has ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mir*ds of the people . " To Mr. Hudson 's mind , loyal as he is to the memory and the traditions of the New York Herald , this event is but a fulfillment of the plans and hopes with which James Gordon Bennett , in 1836 , announced the first publication of his great newspaper  --  the first successful example of an independent journal in the United States . The Herald was disreputable enough in those days , and for many a long year afterwards ; it has not yet achieved the best reputation in the world , with all its expeditions and discoveries , but it has been tolerably true to the purpose indicated in the first number . Mr. Bennett expressed himself with coarseness and cynicism , but with much sincerity , when he said , " In dibuts of this kind many talk of principle , political principle , party principle , as a sort of steel-trap to catch the public . We mean to be perfectly understood on this point , and therefore openly disclaim all steel-traps , all principle , as it is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be good , sound , practical common-sense , applicable to the business and bosoms of men engaged in every-day life . We shall support no party , be the organ of no faction or coterie , and care nothing for any election , or any candidate , from president down to a constable . We shall endeavor to record facts on every public and proper subject , stripped of verbiage and coloring , with comments when suitable , just , independent , fear VOL . XXXIV. - NO. 201. 5 65 less , and good-tempered . " This was not a very lofty ideal of editorial duty , but it was an honest one , and in the line of what the nation needed and the future promised . So far as it adhered to this profession , the herald succeeded and deserved success ; but its notorious faults have long kept its true and important mission from being fully recognized , and the proper credit given therefor . It has been the rude , low-bred , boisterous pioneer , preparing the way for the finer and better race of newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a keener sense of decency and responsibility , and a broader culture in the men who conduct them . Nor is it by any means impossible that the Herald elf may eventually become a newspaper of the kind just described . Delighting in the great advances now makin , , in American journalism , but not quite satisfied with any of the existing journals , there are a few persons so unreasonable as still to hope for a model newspaper , thou0h they have never seen one , and though the most brilliant instances of journalistic success are generally coupled with grave and incurable faults . Such enthusiasts deem it l ) OSsible to walk uprightly and deal justly with all mankind in the career of the journalist as much as in any other ; that it is inferior to no other in the interests it protects , the need it serves , the high standard of character and performance it exacts . It was not for the mean ; It requireth courage stout , Souls above doubt , Valor unbending . " Not less does it require the deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and culture , the most tolerant heart . Journalism now is what the stage was in Shakespeare 's time ; its purpose , as Hamlet says of the " purpose of playing , " " both at the first and now , was and is , to hold , as t were , the mirror up to nature ; to show virtue her own feature , scorn her own image , and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure . " But literature , of which journalism is now the most alert Journalism and Journalists . // Criticism . and prolific form , has even a nobler aim than this , to describe which we must borrow the words , not of the tolerant dramatist , but of the more heroic moral poet , Milton . Its office , like that of poetry , of which it is so apt a vehicle , is also " to inbreed and cherish in a great people the seeds of virtue and public civility , to allay the perturbations of the mind and set the affections in right tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from justice and God 's true worship ; lastly , whatsoever in religion is holy and sublime , in virtue amiable or grave , whatsoever hath passion or admiration in all the changes of that which is called fortune from without , or the wily subtleties and refluxes of many s thou*hts from within ; all these things , with a solid and treatable smoothness to paint out and describe . " To succeed in all this , without doing injustice to the shipping list and the price current , to the last great fire , mammoth squash , Cardiff giant , new novel , or new religion ; to discuss , be-July sides , all the social topics , little and large , that have come upon us in the present age for consideration , - this certainly gives scope enough for the greatest activity and the best talent . Moreover , this ideal journalist , like the poet in Rasselas , must " disregard present laws and opinions , and rise to general and transcendental truths , which will always be the same . He must therefore content himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause of his own time , and commit his claims to the justice of posterity , lie must write as the interpreter of nature and the legislator of mankind , and consider himself as presiding over the thoughts and manners of future generations ; as a being superior to time and space . " The reader , still subject to these limitations , is doubtless by this time ready to cry with Rasselas , " Enough , thou hast convinced me that no human being ever can be a journalist . It is so difficult that I will at present hear no more of his labors . " F. B. Sanborn.
