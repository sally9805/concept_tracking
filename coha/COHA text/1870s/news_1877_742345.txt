txt In one of the interior towns of California , a suit , attended with many curious disclosures , was lately brought before a local magistrate for the recovery of six hundred dollars  --  the cost of a marble monument ordered by a widow of the place for her deceased husband . She had been frequently dunned for payment , but had always deferred it on various pretexts , and had finally refused payment altogether : first , because the design had not suited her ; second , because the monument had been far more expensive than she could afford ; third , because she had never ordered it . The dunning had extended through two years , and , as at the date of instituting the suit , the widow had been for some time remarried , her new husband was held responsible for the debt , on the ground that she was his wife when the monument had been ordered . This the defendant , through his counsel , stoutly denied , and the plaintiff , through his counsel , as stoutly maintained . On this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , as reported in a local journal , have such a flavor of the Pacific slope that they are worth reproducing in this more methodical and less unconven ? tional section . One might imagine that nothing would be easier to establish than the date of one 's marriage ; that it is a thing the married parties could depend on the memory for , since marriage is presumed to be a memorable event in the history of most mortals . So it is hereabout , but it appears to bo different in the far West . In this instance , at least , the wife and . former widow swore she had been married Sia.y 4 , 1876 , while her husband , having become confused on the witness-stand , named the date as April 15 , under cross-questioning mentioned other dates as possible , and finally admitted that ho could not recollect his nuptial day . From this the plaintiff 's counsel deduced that the plaintiff was right in averring that the marriage had taken place in March , 1875 ? seine weeks before the marble shaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side demanded the right , after whispering some minutes with his client , to make a personal explanation , andhe was allowed to do so . He said the defendant was a " bighearted , whole-souled follow , " and had been so overcome with happiness at the prospect of his wedding that he " had been around " for a week or so with his friends in San Francisco , where the ceremony had been performed , and consequently , as became a big-hearted , whole-souled fellow , had become " somewhat obfuscated as to passing events . " It had been his intention to present a deposition of the clergyman who had united the couple , but who , unfortunately , had had trouble with his congregation , and returned to his lime in New-England . The lady was correct , however ; the date was May 4 , 1876 , as he should have boon able to show but for the unavoidable absence of important witnesses . Defendant 's counsel furthermore declared ? the privilege of personal explanation includes a good deal in California ? that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show , had been guilty of a base attempt to swindle ; that he had made the monument without consultation with the widow , intending to compel her next husband to pay for it , feeling confident that so handsome and attractive a woman could not long remain single in California , so renowned for gallantry and delicate appreciation of feminine charms . Indeed , ho had reason to believe that several stonecutters and marble-carvers iu the State were regularly engaged in " this nefarious business . " His client was known as an open-handed man , who did not care for money , and it had been thought that ho would not resist " this infernal ' machination . " Happily he had resisted , and " the audacious fraud stood exposed to the light of heaven . " A number of witnesses were examined as to the character and reputation of defendant and those of his wife , and they disagreed radically . The defendant was shown , on the one hand , to be a gentleman , a man of his word , and of strictest honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who at different times had been a miner , a hotel-runner , a gambler , a stock-operator , a bartender , a dance-house keeper , an agent of a traveling circus , and a distributor of religious tracts . He had had many feminine complications ; had been shot at on several occasions by superseded rivals ; had been twice prosecuted for broach of promise , and had been thrice divorced . His wife , according to the testimony offered , might be reckoned as peculiar . She had been an actress , a bar-maid , a lecturer , a subscription-book seller , an advertising agent , a rauche-keeper , and a Methodist mourner . She bad had a variety of husbands , or , as a witness expressed it , she had been addicted to miscellaneous matrimony . Still , as it was affirmed , there was no evidence that she was not respectable and worthy of belief under oath . The plaintiff 's counsel undertook to undo the tangled skein in his argument . He assorted that the case was plain enough ; that the woman had ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead 11 husband , and when the living one had been willing to please her by paying for " a marble symptom of her bereavement ; " but that as time wont on , she had ceased to mourn , and he had discontinued a sympathy needful to be expressed in dollars and cents . The pair had got so accustomed to being married that one marriage more or loss made no impression on their minds , and that whatever their disposition to toll the truth , they could not be expected to recollect all thoir connubial experiences . His client was a gentleman of unquestioned and un- . questionable voracity , and his declaration should be taken in preference to the declaration of persons who were liable , as they . themselves acknowledged , to " get thingsk wonderfully mixed . " The upshot was that the magistrate gave a decision for half the amount claimed by the plaintiff , as the monument still remained on his premises , the defendant hav- ing refused to allow him to put it over the grave . The defendant swore lie would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ho did not care a dash for money , it was not in nature to expect a man to pay for a marble advertisement of his wife 's love for another man . Tho woman said ho was right , and they both went out of court laughing at the thing as a good joke , and all the other parties to the suit laughed likewise .
