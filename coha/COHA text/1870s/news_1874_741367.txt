txt In accordance with a resolution ' passed yesterday an attempt was made this morning to bold a session of the Senate . The effort , however , resulted very much to the dissatisfaction of the very few gentlemen who really desire Saturday sessions . At 11 o'clock . the hour of meeting , only ten Senators were in their seats , and they were apparently in no frame of mind for the transaction of business . After the reading of the journal two other gentlemen lint in an appearance , making the whole number in attendance only twelve , or just five short of a quorum . Notwithstanding this , one of the Senators moved that the Senate proceed with business . This not being objected to , Senator Lord rose and said that he had never had much faith in the honesty of the majority when they expressed a desire for Saturday sessions , and the result . proved that he had not been mistaken . He did not . desire , however , that all the cheap notoriety should rest with the advocates of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then went home on Friday . and he would , therefore , move that the Senate adjourn on the 20th of March sine die . This proposition was greeted with laughter , and passed in a spirit of derision , only one vote being cast in the negative . ' Upon the motion to go into general orders . Senator Ganson called for the yeas and nays. and thou raised the point of order that there was no quorum present . The Chair decided the point well taken , and no further business was transacted . The effort to hold a Saturday session was a lamentable failure . and it is generally believed that no further attempt in the same direction will be made at present ..

THE BLACK LIST . The original motion made on Friday to adjourn over until Monday evening , was lost by a vote of 20 to 10 .

Gowan . Middleton . Wagner , and WOOditt . TILE BRITTON CASE . During a conversation had with Gov . Dix this morning , the Governor stated thatbe would not decide the Britton case this week-. as had been expected Tht general impression is that he will announce the result of his investigation on Monday or Tuesday . There are two very deckled opinions given as to what the result will be . Prominent Brooklyn politicians pretend to be assured of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well informed . state emphatically that he will be removed . The former opinion is most generally accepted .
