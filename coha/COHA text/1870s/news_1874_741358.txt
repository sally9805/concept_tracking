txt Parliament is dissolved by royal deCree . Premier Gladstone has issued an address to his constituents at Greenwich asking for reelection , and announcing that the Queen has been pleased to accept the advice of her Ministers to dissolve the present Parliament immediately , and summon a new one , to meet on the 5th day of March , 1874 . In his address , Mr.Gladstone gives as a reason for this measure that since the defeat of the Government upon the Irish higher education question by the concurrent efforts of the leaders of the opposition and the Catholic Prelacy in Ireland , the Government has not been possessed of sufficient authority to carry out great legislative measures . Its experience during the rectss of Parliament has not indicated that any improvement in its position was probable . The chief of the opposition having refused to accept office on the defeat of the Government , and the Cabinet feeling that they have not the support which every Ministry ought to enjoy , an appeal to the people is the proper remedy for such a state of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the estimates are so far advanced that the Government is able to promise a surplus of ? 5,000,000 sterling , with which it intends to abolish the income tax and to relieve local taxation . Among the matters likely to come before Parliament are the readjustment of the Educational act , the improvement of local government , and of the Land , Game , and Liquor laws . The address promises a large measure of relief from duties on articles entering into general consumption , and expresses a hope for the speedy assimilation of the county with the borough franchise .
