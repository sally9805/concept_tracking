txt Patriots and philanthropists ought to be greatly encouraged by the sale of Peruvian mummies and gods which took place in this City on Tuesday last . The prices obtained show that the effects of the panic have finally begun to pass away , and that the necessaries of life can not much longer be sold at prices which pinch the poor and pain : the rich . The mummies in question were not quite as valuable as the best quality of Egyptian mummies , but they were of the very finest brands of South American mummies . The stock included mummies in the original imported packages , and others which had been husked , or , in other words , stripped of their outer coverings . The prices ranged irom $11 for a full grown unwrapped mummy to fifty cents a piece for a job lot of inumtnied babies , while a fiuo collection of thirty-five Peruvian skulls , of assorted sizes and sexes , were sold for the trifling sum of $87 50 . The prices of Peruvian deities were equally low . A fine wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another six feet in height sold for half that sum . The small vest-pocket gods were sacrificed at prices almost as low as those charged in the shops for india , ? rubber dolls with the patent squeak attachment . Indeed , a person of theological tastes might have bought a large-sized parlor idol , besides filling his pockets with portable deities , for little more than the price of the reddest and yellowest prize chromo now in the market . Some one  --  possibly Timothy Titcombhas feelingly asked , in one of the popular songs of the day , " What is home without a mummy I " Whatever the correct answer may be , it is very certain that a mummy is one of the most useful of household utensils . When standing erect in the corner of the parlor it is an object of lively curiosity to visitors , and affords a topic of conversation which is of incalculable value to the bashful man . It gives an air of culture to the home which it adorns , and vastly increases the value of its owner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? It is also extremely useful as an aid to family discipline . There is nothing more thoroughly satisfactory to the small boy than the privilege of putting an embalmed relative in the back-yard and shooting at it with a cross-bow ; and although there is not quite as much pleasure in shooting at mummied Peruvians as there is in shooting at an embalmed aunt , it is nevertheless a precious privilege , which , when promised as a reward for diligent study and good conduct , will stimulate the small boy to unprecedented industry and unearthly goodness . The chief use of the mummy , however , is as a substitute for coal and lamp-lighters . Being impregnated with bitumen , and thoroughly dried , it is wonderfully combustible . In fact , mummies supply the native Egyptians with their cheapest and best fuel . A party of Bedouins encamped in the neighborhood of a mummy pit will boil their coffee  --  or rather the hot water with which coffee is made  --  with the heat of half a dozen fingers ; while a single adult leg , thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful blaze during an entire night . If we assume that a full-grown Peruvian can produce as much heat as a ton of anthracite coal  --  and this estimate is probably much too low ? it follows that Peruvians at $3 are cheaper than coal at $4 50 . Judging from Tuesday 's sale , any householder with an eye to business can lay in his Winter stock of Peruvian mummies at the rate of $3 each . Thus he not only secures cheap fuel , but he also has the aesthetic satisfaction afforded by the cheerful way in which a mummy blazes . To sit by an open fireplace and throw on a bead , a limb , or occasionally an entire mummied baby , is a pleasure which the consumer of coal , whether he uses a grate or a closed stove , can never know . Furthermore , a mummied arm makes a capital torch for the purpose of lighting gas chandeliers . One has merely to touch a match to the fingers , and they blaze up with a soft and rose-colored flame , which is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses the additional advantage of being readily put out by the aid of a common thimble used as an extinguisher . Wooden gods are , of course , less generally useful than mummies , but , at the same time , they are not to be despised . In serious families they constitute an excellent Sunday toy for children , and in that respect are even superior to a " Noah 's Ark . " The difference between a Biblical ark and a strictly secular mauagerie of wooden animals has long been recognized , even iu Scottish households , but the theological character of heathen idols is even more conspicuous than that of " Noah 's Arks . " A large eight-foot idol would be of enormous service to a Sanday-school which had exhausted the help of picnics or stereopticon exhibitions as counter-attractions to those offered by rival Sunday-schools . The small-sized idols would make admirable prizes to stimulate scholars to a rapid mastery of the catechism with its accompanying " proofs ; " and an ingenious superintendent , with the aid of a dozen gods , and au eloquent veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would be of more value in enticing scholars from other Sunday-schools than would be a strawberry festival , or a Christmas distribution of cheap candies . What has caused this sudden decline in the price of gods and many-Mies is not yet known . Possibly some great Peruvian mummy combination or idol monopoly has fallen to pieces , and it is thus no longer possible to compel the public to buy its mummies and gods at artificial and exorbitant prices . However this may be , the news that dead Peruvians have fallen to an average price of $3 each , and that Peruvian deities of the very largest size are worth only $3 50 in open market , ought to send a thrill of joy through every patriotic heart , and give us fresh confidence in the future of our beloved country .
