IVAN TURGENJEFF . OF the novelists now living , Tur* &amp; nieff is probably not the one who is most widely known , but in the estimation of those who are familiar with his writings he holds a place above any rivals . There is nothing strange in either his comparative obscurity or the warmth of the admiration which more than outweighs the calmer interest that might be felt in a writer who contented himself with a more superficial view of life and a less profound consideration of the problems which await us all , demanding some solution , or , more truly , some attempt at solution on our part . Of the novelist in general it may be said that he has two parts to * ) lay in order thoroughly to succeed : he has to entertain the listless , and at the same time , in order to be a great writer , in order to leave a mark on the history of his time , he has to bring to the treatment of the main ques tions of our existence a wise comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as of narratin , , the events he imagines and puts before us . In his own way , with somewhat different materials , he works at the same task as did the old dramatists , or as do musicians and artists of any sort . The first essential condition is that we be entertained ; no useful information unaided by imagination , no mere statistics , will draw spectators to see a play or get readers for a novel ; we migbt as well set the report of the State Board of Health to music . Entertainment , in its less ignoble sense , is what we demand of all artists , whether they work in marble , in colors , or with pen and ink . And of them all we ask for aid , not in the way of alms-giving , of formal philanthropy , but such as we feel in the sympathy of a friend , or 1874. // when we are encouraged by the sight of a noble example . The novelist differs from the others in the fact that he is more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of poetry ; the characters in his pla ) - , if it be necessary , need only be affected by a single dominant feeling which may raise them above the petty criticism of those details that are considered requisite in a novel , in which the characters , like people in real life , are under the influence of rules of etiquette forbidding the statuesque posing which is allowable in tragedy . in stories the tension of passion is relieved by the description of external l ) eculiarities such as the eye notices even at times of the greatest solemnity ; men 's and women 's faces are described , the motley sequence of feelings is told us ; in a word , our imagination is aided every way in forming a picture com ) lete in all the details . How much the predominance of novel-writing at the present day is due to this curiosity for detail is an important questi&amp;n which this is not the time to discuss . But at any rate it is interesting to notice how much that feeling , whatever may he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy , and favors the mechanical exactness to be found in the novel . But in spite of this difference in external form , the novel is a work of imagination , although drawn , with lighter and more varied touches . The more serious the nature of the problem it discusses , the higher its position as a work of art . Many novels are written which claim to do no more than help the reader to forget the monotonous routine of his daily life . Some , like The Initials , are the classics of this kind ; they always amuse and have thereby won warm admiration from old and young . Certainly it would be a harsh and futile sort of criticism that should seek to decry such innocent and agreeable work . But while there is a persistent demand for novels of this sort , which succeed more or less well in their business of entertainment , there are always certain writers of higher and May , more serious aims who take the same form for their writing , since thereby they reach their readers more easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportion as they are influenced by that mysterious thing , the spirit of the age . That these writers should choose this mode of expression need not cause us any regret , nor is it in any way necessary to open any discussion of the relative positions of a novel and other forms of artistic work . We should here as elsewhere take what we have set before us , with as much gratitude as possible ; and when we have novels to read , we should not weep for epic poems . Nowadays novels are written ; the authors sometimes dignify their task by the treatment of human life in a thoughtful way , and it is of a writer of whom this remark is exceptionally true that we wish to speak here . Ivan Tur*nieff was born in time district of Orel , in the centre of Russia , November 9 , 1818 , and there he passed his boyhood ; from 1834 to 1838 he studied at Moscow and St. Petersburg. ! Then , in his twentieth year he went to Berlin , and at the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years . Hegel 's philosophy , although it had lost somewhat of its earlier glory , still had a controlling influence in Germany at that time , as indeed it had until 1848 ; but on Turg*nieff 's mind it seems to have made , or at any rate to have left , an unsatisfactory impression , for we often find in his writings irreverent mention of the German philosopher . After returning to St. Petersburg he for a short time occupied a position - under government in the Ministry of the Interior , but this he soon left in order to devote himself to literature . He first tried his hand at poetry , but without success . We have never seen a line of his verse , but if , as we are told , it was written in the style of Pouschkine and Lermontoff , who were themselves imitators of Byron , its failure need not be wondered at . his first m vide Glagau'e Die Russiscite Literatur mend to-an Tmr*enjew , pp. 43 , 44 , to which we mere indebted for umoet of our statistieg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kalinitsch , which our readers will remember in his R&amp;its d'uu Chasseur . This appeared in 1846 . Soon afterwards he went to Paris , and there he wrote the greater part of the R*cits , which appeared from time to time in a Russian magazine . It was in 1852 that they first appeared in book-form , after eluding all opposition from the censors of the press , who , according to Mr. Otto Glagau , did not detect the hidden purpose which lay under what seemed to be merely a collection of pictures of Russian life , - the purpose , naTnely , of portraying the sufferings and degradation caused in that country by the existence of serfdom . Afterwards , however , when they were collected and published together , the censors avenged themselves in the following way . They took for their pretext an article which Turg6nieff had written on the death of Gogol in the same year , and had him banished to his estate for two years . Nothing but the intercession of the Czarovitch , the present Czar , freed him from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , and Germany until 1863 , when he chose Baden-Baden for his home . In that picasant little town , which was the resort , at one time or another , of almost all the interesting people of Europe , he has since for the most part lived , having for neighbors his friends Louis Viardot and his wife , the celebrated Pauline Garcia - Viardot . At times , too , we hear of his presence in En0land . Before discussing their literary merits , it should be said of the R*cits d'un Chasseur that they were in a great measure the cause of the abolition of serfdom by the present Czar . In this respect they may be compared with Uncle Tom 's Cabin , but there is no further likeness between these books . Turg*nieff 's method , here as everywhere , is so quiet , he is so careful to avoid anything like an expression of his own feelings , that the censor 's mistake seems very natural . He writes , not with an avowed purpose which is to be read between the lines by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely of another sort , simply to describe certain Russian peculiarities , and the inference about serfdom were almost something which had escaped his own observation . What we find in the Rdcits d'un Chasseur is a number of sketches by a hunter , who evidently , in fair weather and foul , morning and evening , has wandered about the country with his gun on his shoulder , making the acquaintance of all his neighbors , learning to know all the serfs he meets , spending the night in their huts or camping out with them when they have no roof over their heads . In almost every one of the sketches we find some wonderful ( lescription of the beauties of nature , which , too , has the merit of being appropriate and readable . Too often even the best of descriptions has an air of having been done under some other inspiration than that by which the story was written , into which it is inserted with more or less cleverness ; but Turgdnieff 's enjoyment of nature , and his keen observation , make him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might fatigue the reader saves him from the most frequent error of the landscape-painter who works with pen and ink . The sketch Le Bois et la Steppe especially deserves mention , for it is all description , and all natural . Among so many that are good it is hard , as well as , perhaps , unnecessary , to say which is the best , but among the most impressive , to our tbinking , is the one called in the French translation La Prairie . At the end of n hot July day which the writer has passed shooting grouse , he loses his way , when seeking to return home . At last he finds himself at the top of a precipice overlookin* a wide plain ; beneath him he sees two fires , around which are collected some human beings . He makes his way down to them , and on approaching he sees they are peasant boys who are guarding horses ; they call back the large dogs who are barking violently and threatening to attack him . By their fire he prepares to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , and the ever-increasin0 brilliancy of the fire ; every now and then a horse comes into its light , bites a twig from a small bush , and trots away . There is scarcely a sound to break the silence ; occasionally the splash of a fish in the river near by is heard as it springs out of the water , and the little waves it has made break softly against the shore . The boys , five in number , gather about the fire ; the oldest is only fourteen , the youngest not more than seven . Soon they begin to talk about all the uncanny beings which still exist in the imagination of uneducated Russians . A vague sound , such as often fills the night , is heard , and all , for their nerves are set on edge by their talk , are frightened except Paul , who laughs at them and bids them sup . They still go on with their anecdotes , with every now and then a little alarm at the cry of some nightbird breaking the deep silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away their terror at their ghostly stories , not with the aid of any superior knowledge , but as if he were anxious to silence his own alarm . Soon he determines to go to the river to draw some water ; his companions warn him to be careful , listen to his retreating steps , and are telling stories of boys who were drowned , who were dragged into the river by the water-nymphs , when Paul returns safely . He has been frightened , however , for he has heard some one calling him by name ; they are all much impressed by this , but soon they go to sleep . The writer , who had been listening to it all , likewise falls asleep , and early the next morning he is off , nodding good-by to Paul . The sketch ends as follows - " I ought to add that to my great regret Paul died that same year . He was not drowned , lie was killed by a fall from a horse . I am sorry for him ; he was a capital fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a study as could be written ; there is not an incident in it , but it is a perfectly complete picture . Another , which is drawn with similarly slight materials , is the one called Lgove . In this , the author merely gives us an account of a trifling accident while duck-shooting , the sinking of the boat in which he is with some peasants , and their wading ashore ; but the way in which he describes the conduct of some of the serfs , and his conversation with them , throws a great deal of light on his method . He gets talking , for instance , with an old fisherman whose leaky boat the others are putting in readiness ; he asks , - " Have you been a fisherman long ? ' " Seven years , " answered Soutchok . " And what were you before that ? " " I was a coachman . " " Why did you give that up ? ** " My mistress wanted me to . " " Who is your mistress ? " " The one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is Elena Timofehivun - a stout lady who is no longer young . " " Why did she make you a fisher-man ? " " Heaven knows ! She arrived one fine day from Tamboff , and bade us all assemble in the court-yard . Then she came out before us ; some went forward to kiss her hand ; that did not seem to vex her , and all the rest did the same thin0 . Then she began to ask us questions ; she asked each of us his name an ( l occupation . When my turn came , she asked me , Well , and what are you ? ' I am the coachman , ' said I. The coachman ! ' said she , a fine coachman you are ; you must be my fisherman . You must always keep the table supplied with fish . ' So that s the way I became fisherman . " " To whom did you belong formerly ? ' * " To Serg Pektereff . We had been left him by will , but he only kept us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , but not in town . " " So you had always been a coach-man ? " " Oh , no ; " and he goes on to tell that he had been cook , valet , and likewise an actor . " Our mistress , " he says , " had built a theatre . " " What parts ( lid you take ? " " I do n't understand . " 568 May , // " What did you use to do in the theatre ? " " Why , do n't you know about it ? They took me and gave me some *iandsome clothes ; and then I would walk about or stand or sit down , as it happened . They used to tell me what I had to say , and I would say it . Once I played a blind man ; yes , they stuck peas under my eyelids to make me keep them shut . " And then he mentions briefly his other occupations , showing us the absolute control held by masters and mistresses over their serfs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the brutality in those in authority . This sketch we have chosen for the lightness of touch with which the author performs this task . When the boat fills and sinks , the fisherman is afraid of nothing but the writer 's wrath . He is always perfectly uncomplaining and humble , demanding nothing for himself . In some of the R*cits , again , we are told of crueler sufferings , which it makes one 's blood boil to read ; and of some of the serfs he says , " They generally keep their eyes cast down , but yet one can not infer anything from that , for it is almost impossible in our beloved country , as every one knows , to tell whether it is sleepiness or hatred that is prominent in a servant 's face . " In short , Turg*nieff has drawn here a series of pictures which he has hardly anywhere , if indeed he has at all , excelled . In every one we notice the same keen observation , the same care in setting the scene before us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his writings . Nor is it to be said that he notices nothing but serfdom and the many misfortunes it causes ; he has a keen eye for the ridiculous pomposity of petty proprietors , the eccentrics , who would naturally make their appearance in a state of society in which respectable social position could be maintained in spite of disgraceful ignorance and utter idleness , , and for the young men who fall in love with the peasant girls . In short , he gives us nearly every element of Russian country-life in turn , 569 although it is of the peasants that he prefers to write . On the whole , the impression the book leaves is a sad one , so munch suffering is described , so hope . less seems the condition of the wretched people who are put before us ; and yet , we do not feel as if the writer had written it as an expression of his pessimism , which might be said of some of his later works , but as if he were merely setting before us , with exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws from the life , and he gives us lifelike pictures , in which the art seems like the utmost simplicity . It is of a sort that may perhaps be defined , but it can not be taught ; it depends on what is in the writer , not on what is outside of him . Turgdnieff sees what any one of us might see , although we are surer to do it wliemm it is pointed out than of ourselves ; and while he is more especially noticeable for the careful attention to detail by which he represents our idealized imagination , he directs it with that perfection of taste which in another form is humor , and in this form is sensitiveness , not only to what is effective , but also to whatever might offend , with regard to which it knows no mercy . It is a clumsy system of classification , which leaves us no chance to call it anything but realism as contrasted with the display of the writer 's own feelings , which has acquired the jiame of idealism ; neither term does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not define them . To call Turgdnieff a realist is riDht enough as far as it goes , but the word , as we generally use it , needs to be interpreted . He is a realist in the sense of hiding himself , and in the painstaking accuracy he shows with regard to everything his pen touches . But one may be accurate and likewise confusing , in the same way that a catalogue is not a picture . By what arts a great writer invents characters , and gets a deep insight into his fellowmen , of course no exposition is to be found here ; we can merely say that Turgdnieff performs this difficult task with wonderful skill . The men and women really seem to live . This praise Ivan Turg6nieff. // is by no means due to the shorter R*cits alone ; in his stories and longer novels he is equally admirable in this respect . The short tales are numerous , and have been written at various periods within the last twenty-five years . Some of the gloomiest of them he wrote during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Moumou , A Correspondence , The Antehar , and L'Auberge du Grand Clierniu . We say some of the gloomiest , and yet there are none which do not partake of his deep-seated pessimism . What these characteristics are can be judged from the brief analysis of a few . In Moumon , for instance , we have nothing but the account of a deaf mute of gigantic size , who leads a lonely , friendless life , and whose vague attempt at love-making has been thwarted by his mistress ; in despair he mattes friends with a dog . At first all goes well ; but after a while the lady of the house , who is delicate and nervous , takes a prejudice against the dog , and orders are given that it be sent away . This command is carried into effect ; its master mourns its absence , but the intelligent little beast returns . The mute then tries to secure a longer life to his pet by keeping it in his room safe from observation , and taking it out by night for exercise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard , and the enraged mistress of the house orders it to be killed . This is told the mute , who undertakes the sad task himself ; he washes the little dog with especial care , gives it one last meal , and then takes it out on the river in a boat . lie fastens a stone by a rope to its neck and then throws the poor dog overboard , and rows swiftly back . That night he leaves the city and walks to the place in the country whence he came , and which he never leaves again . In A Correspondence there is even less of a story . Two men had passed the summer in the country with two young girls , sisters , and had both fallen in love with them and become engaged . Neither engagement , however , came to anything ; one of the men was already about to marry another girl , when the May , other wrote to her who had formerly been betrothed to his friend , giving this news and begging permissiofi to correspond n*ith her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters are only fifteen in number , but they picture wonderfully the state of the writers ' minds ; He is a man past his first youth , with plenty of idle time and his discontented self on his hands , and he writes to her in great measure out of ennui , to disburden his heart , which is wearied with contemplation of itself . He , as it were , makes his confession to her ; she , for her part , is at first silent ; but at length , moved by his frankness , she writes freely , in order to put before him the condition of a girl whose one romance has turned out ill , and who sees nothing before her but an uneventful life which is all disappointment and miscomprehension . He admires and pities her , and determines to visit her ; she is pleased and makes ready to receive him ; her letter urgin* , him to conic is full of deli*ht ; but there is a long silence ; he ( does not appear , and the next letter she receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four years later , in which he explains his silence and bids her farewell . He had , it seems , falleu in love with , or rather been infatuated by , a dancer , and had followed in her train for years , all the time conscious of his degradation , and equally unable to break the chain which held him . He writes to his old friend a full confession . It may perhaps be objected that a man of the sensitive and refined nature that we can see in his letters could not make so decisive a step in the contrary direction ; but we are told , it is to be remembered , that he is a man accustomed to follow every whim ; indeed , that is but a natural result of his excessive idleness ; and hence we need feel less surprise at his conduct , although even when this is borne in mind it is to a considerable extent remarkable . But in spite of this flaw , the story is very extraordinary on account of the pathetic interest of the letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disappointment it is sure to bring to others . // There is not a superfluous word ; we are not shown how to grieve ; we have given us merely the materials of grief , and no one can read the story unmoved . The Antehar , a translation of which appeared in The Galaxy rather more than a year ago , is another even gloomier tale . Faust , which has likewise been translated for the same magazine , is of higher merit , and , like A Correspondence , is told by means of letters . In it we read of a man who meets , after an interval of years , a woman with whom he had formerly been in love . Her education bad been peculiar , and she had never read any poetry , in fact , no works of imagination , in obedience to the whims of her mother , whom she adored . The hero first makes her acquainted with this part of literature , but with a far more serious result than he had anticipated . They fall in love with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghost of her mother , and flees from him distracted . That is the beginning of the delirium in which she dies . We need not give an analysis of any more . First , out of fairness to the author , who gets but feeble justice in this way , and , secondly , because these few examples may suffice to give an accurate impression of certain qualities which especially deserve mention . Still , by telling the story we do less harm than mio-ht be done if other authors were treated in the same way , because our appreciation of wbat is Turg*nieff 's great merit , the power of setting the scene before us , is not diminished any more than is our delight in a picture by a written description of what is painted on the canvas . In both cases we are left free to enjoy the work of the artist . What we observe in all is the unfailing melancholy which exists , not only in the turn of the plot , but also in the circumstances of many of the stories . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasantry , but in all there is a dreary picture of superstition , affectation , pretense , half-civilized polish , and idleness . They give us a very black picture of Russian life , which has , apparently , all the outside forms of civilization , distinctions of caste more marked by observance than by intrinsic difference , with a ( Ireary formality wholly unrelieved by humor . In this respect there is a marked resemblance to the Southern States , and especially to them as they were before the war . Perhaps this lack of humor is to be explained by the necessity of preserving fanciful social distinctions which rest only on conventionality . Humor tends to overthrow any such formalities ; it implies a certain equality , and so it is not likely to appear among those who feel uneasy about their position . In this country there is pretense enough , and this without invidious distinction of North and South , but there is also plenty of humor to temper it . Of course , our explanation of its absence in Russia is not intended to cover all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth . Fully to explain it , we must take into consideration many other things , such as the repressin* and degrading effect of the despotic *ovcrnment , the possible influence of the deep religious feeling of the people , etc . That this lack of humor is not due to any want of it in the author should be borne in mind . He himself has plenty of it , as any one who is familiar with his novels will recall ; we need only mention , for instance , Pantaleone in The Spring Floods , and Uvar Ivanovitch in On the Eve . Another characteristic , and one which like all of his is equally noticeable in the lou novels , is his tragic treatment of love . And with this connects itself the quality just mentioned , the lack of humor in the persons about ' whom the stories are written . Not one of Turg6nieff 's women ever laughs ; there are plenty who giggle , but there is not one who fairly laughs . All the foibles , and indeed the faults of women , lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , widely diverse as they are with regard to most of their qualities , arc alike in never laughing even when ludicrous things take place before them . Iii this way , perhaps , they are more idealized , for there is a decided difference between 1874. 571 // the charm of good-natured bonliommie and the seriousness and mystery of halfpoetic reserve ; and a writer who knows that his main strength lies in the delineation of exalted passion may well be excused for preferring that to the simpler pathos which Turg*nieff disregards . But defense is idle where there is no attack , and no one would blame the author for this curious omission ; it is more than outweighed by the skill with which these women are drawn . Every novelist of modern thhes gives us more or less profound studies of women in his writings , and the more thoroughly he performs this task , the more sure he is of arousing the reader 's interest . He makes a completer picture of life , because to be accurate he has to introduce some man or men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing the feelings of a woman in their unselfishness and freedom from sordid motives , than would be the case in writing of men under similar circumstances , who , to make the representation of their lives complete , need an account of the numerous outside influences which occupy so much of their time and attention . Turg6nieff gives us most thorough studies of men , but he is excelled by no one in the drawing of women . He knows them as well as a woman could ; but his knowledge , if it be sometimes lacking in such sympathy as a woman writer might show for one of her heroines , is always accompanied by a certain reverence , a poetical half mystery , which women do not have when writing about their own sex , probably from their nearness to it , and which , it is hardly necessary to say , differs widely from the contempt which distinguishes some authors who may have made as thorough study , but with unworthy text-books . Another thing , which more than half follows from what we have just pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader all the conditions of the problem and yet leaves him to solve it as best he may , just as puzzles are put before us in life without a key . Thus in Turg&amp; nieff 's Smoke we have the baffling character of Irene ; and how far she was a May , flirt and how far a passionate woman it would be hard to say ; she is at any rate wholly a riddle . Lisa , in the story of that name , is a less complicated character . Ellen , in On the Eve , is puzzlin* with regard to the way in which she loves Insaroff . We see him with all his peculiarities , and we see her fascinated by his strength of purpose , which is so conspicuous amid the weakness and negligence of his companions ; but here , as in all the cases mentioned , Turg6nieff never explains ; he states the circumstances , and we guess at the cause as well as we can . All of the novels introduce some coniplication of love-making , and this is of a tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some , such as Smoke , The Spring Floods , and A Correspondence , to take the most prominent instances , we have the melancholy spectacle of a man yieldin* to a passion which he knows is degrading , but which he has not the strength to withstand . The plot is to a certain extent the same in these stories , but the treatment is very different . In Smoke we have a man who is engaged to his cousin , and who , while awaiting the arrival of his betrothed at Baden-Baden , meets a woman , now a fashionable belle , whom he had formerly been in love with . This is the Irene mentioned above ; and the novel tells us of her wiles , the way in which the web is wound about the wretched Litvinoff , her former lover , and pictures to us his gradual succumbing to the temptations which so fatally attract him , and his final release . Spring Floods is even more tragically drawn . We have in it the whole story of a young man 's first love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compel him to leave her for a few days ; he departs , sure of his love and his own strength , vowin* , to return soon - but he meets the wife of an old schoolmate of his , a thoroughly viciomz* woman , and he forgets everything in his degrading love for her ; he hurls every duty and every noble feeling aside in order to make himself her slave . This baleful passion ruins his whole life . As may be seen , // these are not stories for every one to read , but they do not err by making sin seem sweet . They contain no luscious descriptions of vice with a sermon tardily following like the " applications " of A*sop 's Fables . Far from it ; they mention crimes which it is well to discuss , especially in public , as little as possible , but the moral goes hand in hand with the fault , the punishment is surer than it sometimes is in life . These books show - and herein is a wisdom that mi*ht well be followed by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that the wicked man suffers , not by mysterious accidents to life and limb which in fact do not inquire into the victim 's moral character , but through agonies of remorse and shame , hy making vain re0ret the inevitab ) *i result of folly or wrong-doing . In others the tragedy is of a different sort . Lisa , for instance , is gloomy enough in its incidents , but there is in it the description of so much loveliness of life that the sadness is more than outweighed . It is the story of a man who when a boy in heart , although older in years , fell in love with the first pretty face he saw , and this happened to belong to a very frivolous young girl , who , after marrying him , proved false to him . Thereupon he left her and returned to his home , where he made the acquaintance of a young girl , Lisa , the heroine of the story . She , by her di0nity and lofty nature , gets great influence over him , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to marry him . She consents , but to their great surprise the news turns out to be false ; the wife returns and asks for for0iveness . Lisa bids him to receive her again , and to forgive her ; as for herself , she withdraws to a convent , and the unhappy husband has to put the heavy load on his shoulders . The reader 's feeling is one of sympathy for those poor people who are defrauded of their happiness ; and it is sympathy one need not be ashamed of , that is given them , for they bow to their fate without seeking to break higher laws for their selfish profit ; the lofty resignation of Lisa , and 573 her pathetic justice , which the husband of the other woman can not help hoping will be less rigid , while they leave us sad , do yet con*Me us by showing us how much better and higher it rightdoing than happiness . We pity and approve at the same time . On the Eve , again , is a novel which , though full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more wonderful art than any other we know , - that is to say , even more wonderful in this respect than any of Turg&amp; nieff 's , - is deeply tragic , but in a way that we can not help feeling is more the result of the willful determination of the author , than of those conditions of life which inevitably bring misery in their train . We hope our readers are already familiar with the story : with Ellen 's preference for the young Bulgarian , and her impatience with her other lovers ; with the way in which with mingled modesty and fearlessness she lets him know of her love for him ; and with her sad fate . The very skill with which this is told us , the wonderful revelation of a young girl 's heart , the appeal to our sympathy throughout , all combine to give us so tender a love for the heroine that we yield entirely to our feelings , and mourn her story without stopping to consider that the poor girl is more the victim of the gloomy nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There would seem to be a needlessness about her sufferings ; we feel almost as if a girl had been sacrificed for our intellectual entertainment . In life there is misery enough which strikes blindly right and left without bringing a satisfactory explanation for its existence ; but in a work of art we have a right to from suffering , but for such an account of suffering as shall seem needful and necessary , and not the invention of mere wantonness ; it should be the natural outgrowth of the circumstances of the case . In On the Eve , is Ellen punished for falling in love ? is it for falling in love with a Bulgarian ? No , Ivan Turg6nieff. // there is no proportion between the conduct of the girl and her sufferings ; they are beautifully told , but this inconsequence mars what in tome respects is the best of Turg*nieff 's novels . Nor is the heroine 's affliction made use of as a means of amending her faults : she is not rendered less headstrong ; she does not return to her feeble-brained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as she can , and the novel ends leaving us to understand , apparently , that Ellen is lost at sea . At any rate , she is never heard of again . But in spite of this serious drawback how delightfully is the story told ! The ( different characters of Bersieneff an ( l Shoubine , the one serious and timid , the other light-hearted and fascinating , and Ellen 's pompous father with his hollow affections , - no novelist equals Turg6nieff in setting people before us . It is especially as a study of character that Dimitri Roudine is remarkable . It . has for its subject a few incidents in the life of a Russian , a man who began life with attractive talents , but whose nature is poisoned by an insuperable desire to shine by words rather than by deeds . The whole novel is nothing hut a study of this man and his effect on other and different characters . His ready tongue and apparent enthusiasm make him win the heart of a young girl , but his feebleness , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , makes her utterly despise him . Her mother , a self-willed , affected old lady , who is very fond of admiration , is pleased at getting a new man who is ready to listen to her , but she is very unwilling to let her daughter think of marrying him . Then there is his old fellow-student , who is at first ready to condemn Roudine , but who , after his disgrace , takes a more generous view of him ; and his modest rival , who at last turns upon him ; and the youn0 tutor , with his boyish , enthusiastic admiration . The upshot of the whole book is a sort of recommendation to our mercy of those persons whom it would be the easiest to condemn , those , namely , who excite general envy May , by their brilliancy , or who disappoint our confidence by letting fine speeches stand for fine actions ; indeed , more fairly , it is a sort of warning to be generous in our estimate of others . Not that it is written to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learns from it , as one learns from his own experience . Then , too , we ought to observe the life-like way in which the novel is written ; we are never granted any side views of the hero which are denied the people in the story ; we are deceived or put on guard just as they are ; we have to study him just as they ( 10 ; hence it is that a novel so barren of incident , and in a way so clumsily put tether , succeeds so well in interesting the reader , who finds his curiosity aroused and his sagacity baffled in a way that is not overcommon about the heroes of fiction . Too often these gentlemen are beings whose characters stand out strong , ly marked with this or that quality , which we either admire or condemn at sight ; but in this novel we are perplexed as we are in real life , and this it is which gives the story its great charm . Fathers and Sons , which appeared in 1860 , besides its particular interest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then at its height in Russia , has a general interest from its representation of the frequent conflict between the older and younger generations , which is never to be felt more acutely than in times of intellectual change . Russia , with its uneasy yearning for civilization , seems to have shown the same eagerness to adopt a theory which was to solve the universe without the necessity of lone preliminary training , that one can observe among the Japanese , for instance ; and to have given it the devotion which is found only among those who have not had to blush frequently for misplaced enthusiasm . But with all its wonderful power the novel is yet not perfectly satisfactory ; Bazaroff , the young student of advanced opinions , without mercy for the softer graces as represented by the nobleman Kirsanoff , comes to an un // timely end , not in a way that is at all connected with his peculiar views , but merely at the will of the author . Still , there is much to outweigh this defect ; we need only mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that of his friend , but who is soon brought around to conventionalities by his love for Katia . All systems of philosophy are pretty much alike to her . We first see Bazaroff 's views clashing with the world at large while he is staying with his friend , but it is later , when he reaches his own home , that the full force of the tragedy is felt . All families know more or less of it , but in this story it is peculiarly poignant , and there is little that even Turg*nieff has written more touching than the confused efforts of the father to understand his son 's new ideas , and the young many s vain efforts to convert his father . This it is which lifts up the novel from being a study of an exceptional phase of Russian society to being an account of something of wider interest through its truth , which rises above geographical distinction . Such , in brief , are Turg*nieff 's novels . Of books which go so far towards setting before us pictures of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow limits of a magazine article ; the novelist has taken so large a field of human nature for his subject , that only detached points can be touched upon , but we have endeavored to indicate some of the most noteworthy of his qualities , which may tempt more novel-readers to the perusal of his writings . The foregoing analyses may show the serious nature of the problems he discusses , as well as the poetical idealization of everything his pen touches . This quality it was that made the R&amp;its d'un Chasseur a book so dangerous to the Russian government ; and in everything lie has written he has known how to touch the heart , not always , to be sure , with equal success , but in a way that no novelist of the time has excelled . We can not be too grateful to an author who brings the world " To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not . " To his skill in drawing character , in setting the dramatis personce before us , it would be impossible to give too much praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what in life is the only effectual means , by letting us see them face to face , so to speak , and not by merely telling us about them . In a word , his method is picturesque , not analytical . We see the pictures and analyze them by ourselves . And what more need be asked of a novelist than that he draw men and women as they are , with their faults and virtues ever merging into one another , and that he put these people into such relations as arouse our sympathy for some of the most serious matters of human experience ? To do this is the constant . ini of all creative writers , who are ever aspiring to represent the infinite emotions of life . Those who touch genuine springs of feeling *tre few , but among the few of the present day Ivan Turg&amp; nieff is prominent . Thomas S. Perry . 1874. 5Th
