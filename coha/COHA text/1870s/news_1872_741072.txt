txt Can the Democratic Party be revived ? If it can be revived at all , can it regain the strength it possessed four years ago , and add to its numbers by a pronounced advocacy of the milder type of State rights ? One or two ambitious journals , and -a leader here and there , are inclined to say yes to these questions . They expressly abjure the State rights claimed by the secessionist and the nullifier , but they declare that there are other rights , some of which the Federal Government has absorbed , and others of which are threatened ; and that to reclaim the former and defend the latter is a task that will unite the Democracy of 1868 , and give it enough recruits to carry the country in 1876 . This is a long look ahead . It would be absurd in any newspaper to presume to take it with any confidence in the present condition of political affairs . But charity compels us to remember that Democratic newspapers are not , in any ordinary'sense of the word , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are but the surviving fragments of a defunct organism of a very low order . Possibly they may at some future time become attached to a different organism ; but at the present time they get on at all only by the momentum of an accomplished past , which grows more and more remote with every election . It is natural they should struggle to recall the impulse that gave them life , and it is not singular that they fall back on some modified form of the old familiar cries . But will it avail them ? . Have they really any basis for a practical belief in the resurrection of their party by the doctrine of State rights in any shape whatever ? On what question do they foresee that the doctrine can again be appealed to ? It has unquestionably been involved in certain legislation enacted during and . since the war , and this legislation is still in force , most of it applying to affairs as they still exist , and subject , therefore , to be repealed , if the people can be convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent portion of this kind of legislation consists of the acts for enforcing the recent amendments , particularly the Kuklux act . Will the Democrats agitate for the repeal of those ? If so . they will be met by two ugly obstacles . One is that these acts were made an issue in the last election , and the decision was in their favor . The people were asked to turn out the Republican Administration . and replace it by one that did not believe in the Kuklux legislation . They refused . Any man that does not see that the American people fully approve of the Purpose , and do not disapprove of the method of the Kuklux acts , is incapable of learning anything from or about that people . The second obstacle is that the parties immediately concerned  --  the Southern States have accepted the Administration which enforced the Kuklux laws , and elected members of Congress who are nowise in favor of their repeal . The heavy Republican majority in the South makes the Kuklux legislation as dead . an issue as the renewal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another portion of the legislation referred to , concerning which a great deal of senseless fuss was made just previous to the last election , was the Election law , by which Congress asserts the right of Federal agents to supervise the casting and counting of votes in elections at which members of Congress are to be chosen . Does any Democrat suppose that his party could be rallied in opposition to that law ? Portions of it , who see the law prevents fraud , might oppose it because they wish to practice fraud ; but the men who would act on principle in the matter , would be sure to sustain the law . Its motive is excellent , its constitutionality is perfectly plain , and its machinery , if rough in some places , needs perfecting , not smashing . The only remaining portions of recent legislation involving the relative rights of the State and ; National Governments , is that which relates to finance  --  the legal-tender laws , the laws exempting United States obligations from taxation , and the national banking laws . An attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation of these laws , would be absurd . " I can call spirits from the vasty deep , " boasted Owen Glendower . " So can I , " replied the practical Hotspur , " but will they come ? " The Democrats have repeatedly shown that they will not come in response to any call of this kind . In 1868 they forced  --  that is the word , they forced  --  their leaders to favor the payment of the United States bonds in greenbacks ; in other words . to favor the widest possible extension of Federal power over the currency . The mass of them are today in favor of expansion of the currency rather than of a return to specie payments . And the great body of those who care anything about the question would never think of such a thing as rejecting the benefits of the National Banking system on the ground that it rests on a strained interpretation of the National Constitution . Where , then , is the fulcrum on which the Democrats can hope to rest this lever of State rights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be as foolish to say that it never can exist , as it is for the Democrats to count so confidently on it . But if State rights is ever again a real question in American politics , it will divide , not unite , the men who have heretofore been Democrats .
