CONFESSIONS OF A PATENT-MEDICINE MAN . " J TELL you , sir , it is all a matter I of destiny ! If a man is going to be a great patent - medicine man , or anything else , he ca n't help it ; he is just going to be one , that s all . " This remark was addressed to me one evening last summer on the veranda of the Cohgress-Water Hotel at Saratoga . The sentence was pointed at its close by a very decided brushing of the ashes from a cigar which had the unmistakable aroma of high price and direct importation about it . The finger which precipitated the hot , ashy meteor to the gravel-walk below gleamed for a moment in the light of what with us ordinary mortals would be termed two extravagances : first , of course , in the new baptism of fire at the end of the weed , - a coal of great cost ; and second , in the multitudinous sparkle of a large diamond , - a crystallized coal , as you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels exalted to the top bar of the railing , and his silk hat thrust arear at such a perilous angle with his capacious occiput , that , as he leaned back in his armchair , the pose of his whole form came very near presenting , in the uncertain light of that summer evening , the admired semi-spiral line of sculpture . When he took his cigar from his mouth his hat became invisible in the corner of the veranda . Then it was that the indescribable something of acknowledged authority in his tone and manner , and in the independent elevation of his feet and legs , suggested a Western justice of the peace in full court . But no justice of the peace , I take it , ever wore so gorgeous a solitaire diamond ring . As this glittered in the light of his cigar , or was eclipsed in the clouds of fragrant smoke , you might have taken him for a shoddy contractor come to the Springs to marry his daughters , or you might , perhaps , have taken him for a first-class sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faro-bank . Indeed , there is no end of surmises you might have made , if it had not been generally known that he was the great patent-medicine man , a millionnaire whose name has been so married to the board fences of our land that one has come to suggest the other . His Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1870 , by FIELDS , Osooon , &amp; Co. , in the Office of the Librarian of Congress , at Washington . VOL . XXVL-NO. i*8. 41 Art , // advent at Saratoga was considered of so much importance as to be announced in the newspapers ; and I am very much mistaken if one of the local journals of that Spa did not , the day after his arrival , insert a free advertisement of his celebrated " Tecumseh Oil , " out of mere compliment and gratuitous good-nature . He had been nearly a week at Saratoga , and the hopeless tedium and lonesomeness of a crowded hotel had begun to work upon him . I know not what else could have made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember the conversational stages leading to the remark quoted at the beginning of this paper . It was not till then that the reportorial instinct of taking notes of his observations asserted itself in me . I think the first expression of interest I discovered in his brown face and black eyes , for three whole days , was when he saw that his story seemed attractive to me . " You ye noticed my wife ? " he asked . Yes , I had ; it would have been hard not to have noticed her , as she came down to breakfast of a morning in the same diamonds which she had worn at the " hop " the previous evening . There was a certain determination about her walk , and about the plumpness of her form , even . Her dark gray eye had a managing , financiering look which would of itself have drawn attention to her , I should say , if its owner had not been the proprietor also of the unseasonable diamonds , and if ; too , it had not been noised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great patent-medicine man . " Well , sir , " he continued , " I 11 give you an introduction to my wife tomorrow . She s up stairs at the hop ' there . She likes such things , you see , for she - well , we me neither of us old yet . " As he spoke the music of a trois /ern*s came swooning out of the open windows of the ball-room above . I had barely time to think of that portly , middle-aged lady moving with her wonted heavy determination to the ex hilarating strain , and of her breakfasttable jewelry glancing in the festal gaslight , when her admiring husband went on : " Now , sir , that wife of mine made my fortune. ** " Indeed ? " " Yes , sir . You think , perhaps , she was rich , but she was n't ; just smart , sir : that s all , - smart . It was her and two dollars that made my fortune . " Then , without any further solicitation on my part than was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave me a running account of his life . I wrote down all I could remember , and as nearly in his words as possible , when I reached my room that evening . The one or two recipes which occur in the course of the narrative he gave me in his own writing the next day . I shall here try , however , to follow his facts rather than his phraseology ; and the general correctness of the former can be relied upon . Any attempt to reproduce his exact language , without the aid of a verbatim report , would result , I fear , in disastrous failure . His grammar especially was that of the American nouvecut ric/*e , which is remarkable in this , that it gets well over all the real difficulties of our syntax , but sticks perversely at all the simplest points . What seemed to me the most extraordinary thing about his whole narration was that he never in any way betrayed the slightest consciousness of the want of principle which marked , as you shall see , so many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the ones in which he evidently delighted most . I fear that he does not present the loveliest sort of character , and that , in a moral point of view , he has little claim to attention , except as the representative of a class in all kinds of colossal fortune-making which is still growing and which is already appalling in numbers . But the reader can form his or her own judgment . Herewith is submitted as faithful an account as I have been able to give of the confessions of the great patent-medicine man : - // 1870 . I commenced to serve the public with liquid at an early age . I was a mere lad when I opened a lemonadestand in my native place . Some one was building a large factory in the town , and I began business in the immediate neighborhood . My principal customers were the workmen employed upon the building . I sold two glasses of lemonade for five cents ; and before that factory was done I had made twenty-two dollars , all in silver , not counting what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't my present knowledge of chemistry in those days . I did not know the virtues of old lemon-peels , tartaric acid , and brown sugar , in the concoction of lemonade ; but no matter . I made money out of the legitimate article , though it was rather weak . It was about this time , I think , that I commenced to wonder if I should , when I grew to be a man , have to work so hard as I saw most of the people in my thrifty neighborhood working , and I resolved that I would not . To sell lemonade to the builders of that factory , for instance , was far easier than to carry a hod toilsomely up the building , I thought , and about as profitable . So I determined that some one else must carry the hod through life , and leave me to merchandise in the shade . My next venture was in sewing-silk . The foreign article was then selling for five cents a skein . I purchased the American stamp for sixty cents the hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeins for five cents . The only connection which I can discover between this and my next business is such an imaginary one as would be suggested by two wooden spools . These I had turned together , with artful little creases between for the insertion of a bogus cement which I took to selling . Of course I challenged people to pull the two spools apart , and , when they failed in the attempt , I generally sold them some of my ware . My cement was represented to be infallible in the mending of leather , wood , and crockery . I had a pair of traces from an old harness which I allowed the incredulous teamster to try with his horse . The places where they had ostensibly been stuck together had been merely peeled up and filled around with cement , leaving the leather all sound beneath . That test was , in the main , satisfactory to the unsophisticated farmer and others , and my sales were large . My attempts , however , with crockery were for a long time hazardous , and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement would not hold in that brittle ware till it had had three days to dry ; and before the three days expired I took good care to be well out of reach . This venture was generally profitable , but some uncontrollable influence , as you will see , kept me always drifting toward the great pursuit of my life , the patent-medicine business . By some lucky inspiration I now made my first invention in that line . I discovered a new style of cough-lozenges and corn-salve . One invention sprang directly out of the other . It was in a consumptive country , which of course suggested the cough-lozenges ; but everybody could not be supposed to have a cough , so it occurred to me that , in that country at least , those who did not have the consumption had corns : hence the complemental inspiration of the salve . It was a boyish guess , but proved tolerably correct . I had the general public , as you see , by the throat and feet . I have since learned , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture of any kind , their stomachs will take almost anything prescribed . I think , however , any unprejudiced person will see a natural talent for my peculiar line of business in the comprehensiveness which , in this early scheme , took in human nature , as I may say , by means of its two extremities . Indeed , a scientific gentleman now in my employ assures me that I had even then hit upon what he announces as the most general principle in the // application of patent ma/eria medica , namely , produce for sale only such medicaments as shall be deemed the necessary products of the extremes of the general public , and they will always be equal to the products of their means . My corn-salve was made of potash and gum-arabic . It would do its work in five minutes , but of course it made the foot outrageously sore afterward . This was a matter of very little inconvenience to me , because my business required me to be moving continually from place to place . I always managed to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective chiropodist . It will be easily believed that I did not acquire my skill and self-reliance as an operator all at once . My corn-salve grew in my confidence from the feet it fed on . You think that is a queer expression ? You can not , then , be aware of the corrosive nature of potash . Well , sir , experience and special knowledge are everything in one 's business . I will confess that I was nervous before my first patient . The salve had never been tried , and a friend told me I had better not try it . But my subject was a good one , and rather an anomaly , too , in life . I think you hardly ever heard before of a poor shoemaker with corns . That describes my first patient . I mustered up courage , at last , and flourished an old razor at him with quite a professional air for a youth of sixteen . The job was not as neat a one as I learned to do afterward , but still it gave temporary satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salve . And thus I went about over a wide extent of territory , leaving I know not what number of sore feet behind me . I have no better idea how much more pedal distress I might have worked on a credulous community , had it not been for an accident which , at the end of a couple of years , overtook me in my career . I had left a great quantity of my salve and lozenges stowed away in a town which I was then making my head-quarters . They were carefully packed , I remember , in neat paper boxes . On my return , after an unusually long trip , I found that the infernal potash had eaten up the paper boxes , and , making its devouring way to my cough-lozenges , had involved my whole stock in one agglomerate mass of ruin . Out of my temporary despair , however , sprang a lucky inspiration . You have doubtless heard much of the happy elasticity of youth . There is , I grant , something available in that , but I found something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth and physical changes of that period of my life . The fact is , I had grown and altered so in appearance since I had first started out with my corn-salve , that at the time of this appalling accident no one of my first patients would have recognized me from a mere surgical acquaintance of two years before . I may say here , in fact , that these repeated changes in my physical appearance , aided by the cropping of my hair , or the abandoning of it fo excessive length , and at last by the coming of my beard , were , all through my early experiences , of untold advantage to me . Thus , in the course of time , I became personally acquainted with all the people who could be duped in a given region of country , and with every new project or nostrum I returned unrecognized to them over and over again . Now out of the potashes of the agglomerate ruin of my entire stock in trade sprang , Phcenix-like , a lucky inspiration , as I have before said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidental . While contemplating my irretrievable loss I conceived the idea of a patent pain-killer , which I would go about selling to cure the sores left by my corn-salve . As a general thing , money , or , I should say , the want of it , gets the immortal work out of first-class brains . I read the substance of that remark in a newspaper ; or was it a magazine ? It does n't matter ; I believe it , and I verified it in the production of that pain-killer ; that 's enough . Well , sir , the project worked to a charm . I com // menced operations , of course , in almost the exact traces of my former chiropodal exploits . It was not long , therefore , till I came upon my first patient , the shoemaker . I began cautiously to extol the stomachic virtues of my medicine , and gradually led up to its external application . It was good , I assured him , for bruises , sprains , - still keeping my eye stealthily on his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recognition , - bruises , sprains , wounds , sores - " On the feet ? " asked he , interrupting me in my catalogue of positive cures . " Certainly ; better for the feet than for anything else . " " Well , I have sore feet , and that s the fact , " said the shoemaker . " You see there was a rogue of a fellow around here a couple of years ago curing corns , and he made my feet so- If I ever catch the villain I 11 use a strap on him ; that s what I 11 do . " I now felt sure , I need scarcely add , that my former patient did not recognize me , and so I sold him two bottles of pain-killer to cure the sores I had made two years before . It was not , perhaps , a remarkable fact that my pain-killer went faster than my pain-maker , the corn-salve . I did a thriving business in this , - so thriving , indeed , that I gradually caught up , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of the latter and former articles . That is , my earlier traces became so recent that my disguise grew perilous . But there was such a demand for the pain-killer that I went on , notwithstanding the danger . One day , however , I encountered a sturdy young fellow upon whose feet I had operated not very long before . In his eagerness for relief he was in the act of purchasing it at my hands , when , suddenly recognizing me , he changed his mind and gave me a sound thrashing instead . That put an end to the pain-killer business . I returned considerably bruised to my head-quarters , and set all my energies to work on the invention of something less perilous to others as well as myself . I may say here that I always kept the little town which I have called my head-quarters open to me as an asylum , by leaving it and its immediate neighborhood free from all my medical and surgical experiments . The result of my arduous creative thought culminated this time in a paste to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work by a simple application ; yet it did not sell very well . From the very nature of things I did not have the credulous woman half of the world to work upon : they had little or no interest in superannuated razor- strops . It was this consideration more than any other , I think , which inspired me with the brilliant afterthought of changing the name of my paste into that of a healing salve . Thus the same article became at once endowed with universal curative virtues , and became also the professed desideratum of all human nature . I suppose it would not be modest in me to say that my salve was too good for its original purpose . It is at least true that , if it failed upon razor-strops , it succeeded admirably upon mankind . You will hardly believe me when I tell you , but still it is also true , that , by means of an incipient beard and my hair grown long , and of a broad-brimmed slouch hat , as a disguise , I sold a box of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already twice figured as my customer . Owing to my pain-killer , or the recuperative nature of his healthy frame , his feet were about well ; and I am glad to add that there was nothing in my healing salve that would materially prevent his ultimate recovery . At this time my life was rather wild and thoughtless . I looked upon money only as a means of enjoyment . I did not save it for itself , as I learned to do afterward . Still , I had quite a sum by me , and I resolved to take a trip of pleasure and exploration to the South . I sold out my healing salve and started . I know not what ill-advised courses I adopted ; but youth is youth , you // 646 know , and at last I found myself without money in the middle of one of the remotest Southern States . I can not tell what but the exigency of my circumstances prompted me to the thought , but I straightway announced myself as a plain , fancy , and ornamental painter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , my Yankee cheek and versatility helped me out , and I did tolerably well till I was taken sick of one of their Southern fevers . I lay helpless for six weeks . It was a long struggle between life and death ; but I lived through it , and on my first return to consciousness I was made aware that all my money was exhausted . As I lay there on my bed in tedious convalescence , I thought and thought again how I could earn the means to get immediately out of that deadly climate . My weak stomach revolted at the idea of resuming my toilsome attempts as a painter ; and , if I had not long ago forsworn hard manual labor , my feeble condition then would have been enough to make that impossible . What could I do ? How many times I asked myself that question , in utter hopelessness , I am glad that I can not now remember . Of course my thought wandered back again and again to what was to be the absorbing pursuit of my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind just above my grasp , breaking themselves to pieces , as I may say , one against the other , and never leaving anything tangible behind in the wreck . I think a grand universal fever-cure was , at this time , the principal burden of my thought , suggested , as you will understand , by the malady from which I was slowly recovering . I am not sure that I would not have discovered something in that line which would have been beneficial to the world , or , at least , to my depleted pocket , if the idea of vinegar had not in some way been suggested to me . Vinegar was very dear in that country just then , - fifty cents a gallon ,  --  and a good article could hardly be obtained at that price . I determined forthwith to get up some plausible receipt for making vinegar at a cheaper rate . As my plan took form gradually in my mind it seemed to communicate new courage , and my body positively recovered a portion of its old strength under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It even occurred to me , as an afterthought , to change the name of my invention to that of a fever catholicon , in view of its reviving effects upon myself ; but then I was so anxious to get out of that malarious climate that I applied my discovery only to the object for which it was first made . As it was an invention to depend for its success wholly upon its plausibility , I did not need to make any experiments . As soon , therefore , as I was able to leave my bed , my receipt was ready . It was as follows : Take five gallons of soft water , one gallon of whiskey , two pounds of alum , one pound of cream of tartar , and one gallon of yeast . Let them work three days . A prime article , of vinegar , it was claimed , would be the fair result , at the cost of from three to five cents a gallon . I borrowed or begged a bottle of good cider-vinegar for a sample , and commenced operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stated that they were copyrighted - whatever that meant - in Charleston , S. C. , and that I was expecting a new supply in a few days . I would , however , as a favor , write out a limited number of them for any impatient customer who was willing to pay the regular price , which was one dollar . I called my invention United States Premium Vinegar ; and by means of challenging people to discover the difference between my sample and the best article made from the old , exploded , conventional cider , I sold eight receipts the first half-day . Going on to the next town , I had five hundred receipts printed , purchased an additional bottle of cider-vinegar , and started on my travels North . I never waited long enough in a place to learn the results of my amateur chemistry ; but one day I happened // to be overtaken at some village by one of my recent customers , residing at a town a little way back in my route gone over . He beckoned to me across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He beckoned again , and I had a sudden call around the first corner . Following , he overtook me and observed : " Hello ! my friend , that vinegar does n't seem to work . " " My friend , " I answered , " your yeast was probably not good . " He had never thought of it in that light , and would take my advice to get some yeast that he was sure to be fresh , and go home and try it again . Escaping him , I left that town by the first conveyance . I have said that I purchased an additional bottle of cider-vinegar , and it is strange what advantage this was to me . I would often come across some village wiseacre , loafing about a blacksmith or shoe shop , who , tasting the first sample , would elevate his eyebrows , purse out his lips , and say that did n't taste like cider - vinegar . He knew something about that article himself . Then it was my custom to produce the other bottle ; and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably pronounce that " something like it , " " the original article , " etc. ; being in reality the same as the vinegar first presented . Some days I cleared by the sale of my valuable recipe as high as ten dollars above expenses . I would often give the printed secret of my vinegar in payment for a night 's lodging and breakfast . Sometimes I paid for my dinner at a farm-house in the same way , taking a half-dollar in change . When I found people doubtful about investing , I would agree to show the recipe on condition that they would take it if they thought it would make vinegar . This move , as strange as it may seem , was almost infallible . They could see at once that alum alone , or cream of tartar , or yeast , would make something sour , and which , united with whiskey , they were easily convinced would make vinegar . By the time I reached the Western States my health was estab 647 lished again . But the fever had so changed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new venture upon my old acquaintances , or rather patients . I did eventually drive a thriving business in U. S. P. Vinegar receipts in the scenes of my first professional exploits . My shoemaker , however , had moved away and was never afterward one of my constituency . Nor did 1 ever again meet my pugilistic friend who ruined the pain-killer business for me , because I omitted his town thereafter in my travels . Going out West again , I took a friend in partnership with me . He was too big a coward ever to be successful as a patent-medicine man ; but then he was a jovial rascal , and was good company . I know now , it was a great mistake to take him with me , for , some way , we managed to spend not only all I had made by myself , but all we made jointly . There must have been something bad about that fellow 's face . One evening in a thinly settled country where we were travelling afoot , as we generally did , we knocked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eying us a moment , told us we could not stay all night . We were importunate , for it was late and the nearest tavern was miles away . The farmer , persisting in his refusal , said at last that they had had horses enough stolen in his neighborhood lately , and bang went the door in our faces . We took it , of course , as an insult to ourselves and to United States Premium Vinegar , through us ; but the case was closed with the door , and we had to trudge on wearily to the distant village . At another time we were belated , and we sought shelter at a respectable-looking frame-house by the roadside . It was very dark , and the person who opened the door came without a light . To our plea for a night 's lodging a man 's voice said that its owner thought he could hardly accommodate us . We asked him why ; was his house not large enough ? Yes , but he was a little short of groceries , and on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa/en/-Medicine Man . // entertain us . We wanted a bed , we assured him , more than his groceries , and by remarkable persistency we gained admission to the house . We found it to be the home of a well-to-do negro , who had made the excuses fearing that we would not care to lodge in his house , if we knew the color of its occupants . That , of course , was long before the time of the Fifteenth Amendment , but , in our fatigue , we had no scruples , as we afterward had no cause to complain of the quantity or quality of his groceries . Even at that period , it seems , men were free and equal'in the dark . My partner somewhere stole a dog , carrying him away in a bag . When well outside of the town he threw away the bag , but could not make the dog follow . In the midst of his struggles with the animal a man suddenly appeared from some unexpected place on the road . It was a fine thing to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the stranger for the owner of the dog ; but when that innocent fellow paused and regarded philosophically the amusing scene , it was a still finer thing to see the swaggering airs which my partner straightway assumed . He accused the silent spectator of preYenting the dog from following , and made him stand to one side of the road . Seeing the non-resistance of the man , he vented his spleen furthermore on him in all manner of opprobrious epithets , and ended by making him get over the fence . I do n't know when I ever saw anything so neatly illustrating the peculiarities of your true coward . The recalcitrant disposition of the dog was conquered in the course of time , and he followed us faithfully . He was christened " United States Premium Vinegar , " a name which he heard so often , in the course of our business , that he knew it well . His title finally crystallized into " Vin " ; but he was never present at the sale of a recipe without pricking up his ears and manifesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the transaction was brought about . He became very fond of me in time , and had a disagreeable and expensive way of showing his fondness by going through windows after me of nights . So there was a sense of pecuniary gain mingled with our sorrow at his loss , when he was stolen from us and we saw him no more . After a while , when there was little left of the gullible world to conquer , we changed our business into the sale of recipes for a " lightning " process of tanning which I invented . There was , as you shall see , more merit and money in this venture . But in dismissing here my United States Premium Vinegar , it is due to it to state , that , for the next few years whenever , in the course of a wild life , I found myself without money , I was in the habit of distilling it , as I may say , from the secret of this bogus compound . If I was overtaken in a strange place by Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , I always sallied forth and sold vinegar recipes enough to put me in funds . One time , I remember , I was penniless in St. Louis , and made a hundred dollars in an afternoon by confiding my secret to wholesale and retail grocers of that city . My tanning process would , in reality , tan the smaller furs in twenty-five minutes . It required our presence therefore in the far Western States , where furs were abundant . Our custom was to stop at a tavern for a week or so , exhibiting the merits of our recipe in the bar-rooms to all comers . We hired boys to bring us cat-skins , paying ten cents apiece for them . Thus it happened that the honest villagers would be the unconscious and astonished witnesses of the swift tanning of their own grimalkins . When we stayed long in a place , " the neighbors " would miss their cats and the animals would become scarce . To prevent an undue supply and a too promiscuous slaughter , we learned at last to insist upon paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black . This equalized matters . There was an old tan , from which I // partly plagiarized mine , whose principal ingredient was oil of vitriol . When asked - as I sometimes was - whether my tan had that in it , " No , " I always told my inquisitor ; " 0 no , nothing but sulphuric acid " ; which , as you know , is the same thing . To carry on this sort of business , in fact , it always requires a good degree of presence of mind . One day , I remember , I was tanning a black cat-skin before a great crowd in a bar-room , and holding it up to dry before a red-hot stove , I inadvertently burned and ruined it . By a dexterous movement , however , I substituted for it another of the same color , which I had tanned admirably the day before ; and I sold a half-dozen recipes on the spot . The usual price was five dollars for a recipe . I will give it to you as nearly as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pour hot water on it ; then strain ; also dissolve salt in water at blood heat until no more will dissolve ; mix equal parts of the bran and salt water , and to each two quarts of the mixture add one ounce of sulphuric acid ; put the pelts in and stir for twenty-five minutes ; then rinse and dry . We made more money than even my reckless partner could spend ; but still we were not contented . We got out some sort of a great legal document nearly three feet long , with immense seals appended , and went to " selling territory , " that is , we disposed of our right to use or peddle the recipe in certain towns , townships , and counties , giving one of these vast documents to the purchaser . Now we prospered grandly . We took horses , sheep , and all sorts of live stock in pay for " terntory . " We drove our business everywhere . On one occasion a fellow out hunting crossed the road we were travelling , and we gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he carried , and which from its exceeding length and weight we were forced to throw away before we reached the next town . On another occasion we met a man driving a heifer , and sold him a township for her . We always disposed of our live stock at auction . We finally hit upon a still more lucrative move ; we disposed of our territory by lottery . We put up in sealed envelopes the recipe of the lightning tan and documents entitling the winner to the right of a town or township in the particular county where the drawing took place . We rated a county generally at a hundred dollars , and charged five dollars for an envelope , which was , as I have said , the regular price for the recipe alone . Each purchaser was assured of an individual right to use the recipe , and had a chance of winning the right of selling it to a whole town or township . Our profits were so large now that I convinced my partner of the benefit which would accrue to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hundred dollars cash down and safely in my pocket , the arrangement was completed . A line , very much like the one drawn up by the good Pope for the kings of Spain and Portugal , I once read about , in Irving 's Works , was agreed upon by us . This line divided between us all the New World not yet discovered and disposed of by us jointly . We parted and never met again . He was scarcely out of sight , when I took my eight hundred dollars with my other gains and started directly for the East . I was young and very reckless yet . My money did not last me long . When it was almost gone , I paid my fare West as far as it would take me . It was not a great while , therefore , till I found myself in a far inland town , without a cent . I resolved this time to go into something that would make money so fast and in such quantities that I could not get poor again . Our late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a grand gift concert . The authorities of the town told me that they did not see any objection ; and though I was not able to pay my board at the time , I entered into negotiations with my concert company , engaging them to // come own from the nearest large city for the appointed evening . I secured my tickets on credit , and paid with them the rest of my printing bills . I managed to get the editors , lawyers , doctors , and principal citizens interested in my long list of building-lots , horses , carriages , watches , etc. , etc. , by securing their prizes to them in advance . This style of lottery was a new thing in the country then , and everything worked admirably till , I roped in a deacon of one of the local churches . I gave him , two or three weeks before the concert and drawing were to come ofi ; a splendid watch which cost me fifty-two dollars at wholesale , buying it with the money accruing from the rapid sale of tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets at one dollar each ; but he was in reality the source of all my subsequent misfortune in this promising scheme . His share in the enterprise , some way , got to the ears of his church , and he was expelled . This seemed to change the minds of the town authorities about the , legality of my measures , and they refused to give me my license . That exploded the whole scheme . As fast as my money had come in for tickets I had expended it in prizes for the principal citizens . The thing was well planned . I have not time to enter into details , but if they had let me alone I would certainly have cleared ten thousand dollars . As it was , I came out of the enterprise , not only without a cent , hut in debt ; and I had to leave the town in the night . I made my way to a smaller town farther West , and turned my hand to making baskets , resolved , however , that I would soon go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something worthy in that line . I had , of course , no previous experience in basket-making , any more than I had had in drugs and simples before I went into constructive chemistry . It takes , I suppose the same kind of Yankee confidence and handiness to make a basket or a patent catholicon . At any rate , I was tolerably successful at my new business . When I had had finished enough of my wares , I went around selling them . It was in a neighboring village , where I was peddling my baskets , that I encountered what I have learned to call my destiny . My knock at the door of a trim little cottage was answered by a plump , gray-eyed young lady of about nineteen . She looked to me the prettiest girl I ever saw in my life . She had on a neatfitting calico dress , and then such lovely slippers Well , sir , when she would n't buy a basket , I asked her for a drink of water . That was an excuse to have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she returned with the water in a bright tin cup , I thought of Rebecca at the well , and all the good things that I ever heard of in my childhood . You see , of course , I was in love with that girl . In some way I became inspired with a sudden interest in the adjoining country , and I asked her innumerable questions about the distances of the neighboring towns , just to keep her talking ; for it seemed so pleasant to hear her . Finally getting back to the subject of my wares , I observed that if she did n't want a basket , probably she might want a willow cradle , if I would make her one . She turned red , and looking right down at the toe of her lovely slipper , she said that she reckoned she did n't need any of those things . I told her that she might , and she replied that she was sure she did n't know , - *-  which latter remark I took for encouraging . So when I saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that I would be around in a week or ten days , and then , probably , she would have made up her mind about the cradle . Well , to make a long story short , I went to her house so regularly , with and without baskets , that she agreed , at last , to marry me . The xith of March was set for the wedding-day . I resolved in the mean time to make a large stock of baskets , hire a one-horse wagon , and peddle them out so as to have ample funds for the great occasion . As soon // as I could get my baskets done , I started . I wandered away sixty or a hundred miles , I suppose , through all sorts of late winter and early spring storms , before my wagon was empty of its stock . At last my baskets were all sold and I was on my return journey . The rivers and watercourses were swollen with the usual floods of that season of the year ; but it lacked only four days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose , than was prudent . I attempted to ford a river after dark , I know , and drowned the horse and lost the wagon , barely escaping with my life from the swift current . I had to pay for the horse and wagon , and that left me just money enough to huy a marriage license , and no more . I went and stated the case to my intended . She was a brave girl , and made only this memorable remark : " I reckon our wedding-day was set for to-morrow ; the old folks is willing ; and I do n't see why it should n't come off . " And come off it did . While working over my baskets , my mind had been constantly struggling over a great idea ; no other , sir , than the composition of what has since become my celebrated " Tecumseh Oil . " I borrowed two dollars of my wife , and made the first halfdozen bottles of that famous medicine . You have seen it advertised all over the world ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the founda*ion of my fortune . I sold the six bottles and made eighteen more . Selling those , I increased my stock further , and started out through the country to introduce my invention . For a long time it was my custom to travel afoot , my medicine on my back and my paint-jug in my hand , blazoning the fences on my way with " Tecumseh Oil . " Gradually I got to leaving it at the drug-stores , working up a demand for it rather than peddling it wherever I went . My wife stayed at home , manufacturing the medicine . Our business grew so that she had to have a man to help her , then two men , and then I had to build a little house , separate from my own , over which I painted " Laboratory " in mammoth letters . I commenced now that great system of advertising which has since been imitated by so many interlopers in the business . All the money that could be possibly spared from the manufacture of the oil was invested in heralding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians scalped and healed by my medicine were scattered everywhere . The death scene of Tecumseh himself became our trade-mark . His last agonies were so vividly portrayed in colored ink , that the sympathetic beholder was at once inspired with regret that the great chief 's namesake , my celebrated oil , had not been discovered in time to relieve his terrible sufferings . My humble laboratory at last made way for a great manufactory , and my wife retired to the exclusive management of her household . I spent thousands and thousands upon advertisement , and yet my money came back to me tenfold . You will probably think I was satisfied with this prosperity , but I was n't . I had introduced all sorts of other medicines , but never could succeed in getting up a " bitters " that could compete with a certain Eastern article of the kind . I finally determined , if I could not make a better one , or even as good a one , I would at least make the same " bitters . " I went quietly incognito to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the principal men in their laboratory . I say " their , " because it was a joint-stock concern . I took home the new man whom I had bribed , and set him to work ; but the " bitters " did not sell as I expected they would , on their own merit . So I came out with the trademark of my rivals , adding an " o " and doubling an " 1 " in the name of the medicine . This , of course , brought a great lawsuit , which , however , at great expense to lawyers and witnesses , I won , ostensibly on the strength of my additional letters . But my rivals now brought a more formidable suit against me for infringement of their patent . I might have added some new ingredient Confessions of a Patent-Medicine Man . // to the mixture , I suppose , and have beaten them in that way ; or I might have adduced in defence , what was actually the fact , that , in the failure of the necessary supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - I had substituted prussic acid ; but that being well known as a poison , I did not care in either case to take the trouble . I had beaten my rivals once by means of the best counsel , and I had no doubt I could do it again . When , however , I came to consult the most eminent lawyer I could find , he shook his head , and told me that I was a ruined man ; he , at least , would not go into court with such a suit . He spoke of injunctions which the opposition could bring , and in fact talked to me in the most hopeless , discouraging way . I told him of other injunctions which we might get out , since I might claim the invention of the " bitters " myself , for the sake of law ; and I ended by asking him how long he thought , by appeals and counter-injunctions , he could probably stave off the suit . He was of opinion that it might be delayed for two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trust the rest to me . He left me with the assurance that he would obey orders , but that the case would certainly be my ruin . I went back to my manufactory , trebled my force , and put them all to work in the concoction of the " bitters . " The medicine sold hundreds of thousands of bottles . The original makers of the " bitters " were , as I have said , a joint-stock company . Well , in that two years I made money enough out of the infringement of their patent to buy up , in an underhanded way , the greater part of the stock of the whole rival concern ; and , when it came time to bring on the suit , I had the majority of the votes to cast as I would , and , of course , the suit was abandoned . Both of the great establishments are now wholly in my hands , and I think you have heard for yourself how prosperous they are . My wife manages her house on Fifth Avenue as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory ; and , by the way , I must go up and see how she and the " hop " are getting on .
