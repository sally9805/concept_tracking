ART . VI . - THE RATIONALE OF THE OPPOSITION TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT . IN Burke 's " Celebrated Trials of the Aristocracy , " it is related that when the young Lord Altham was a slave near Philadelphia , and was running away from his master , he fell in with a man and woman riding upon the same horse . The young lady had been forced to marry somebody against her will , and the pair of lovers , taking with them some money which was not their own , were hurrying away from an angry father and a deserted husband . They invited Altham to partake of their meal by the roadside ; and while they were eating their pur* suers came upon them and they were taken to Chester . The young woman and her lover*were tried for theft and hanged . A hundred and fifty years ago this happened just outside of Philadelphia , quite as a matter of course , which reads oddly // to persons who have heard of Mrs. Fair 's lectures . Gilly Williams writes to George Selwyn : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she is going to have an execution of her own . Draper , the butler , has turned out the d-dest thief in the world . She says she finds several hundred pounds unpaid which he ought to have discharged . He has fled for the same , but Mr. Fielding and his myrmidons are after him ; and , her ladyship not being very compassionate , he must go to the gallows . " From this it would appear that ladies of that day might discuss over the breakfast-table the pros and cons of the hanging of an old butler who had mu away with some money . There is one thing , at least , which this age has learned to do : it can pity . The change which has come over us , by whatever adjective it may be described , is none the less a fact which it is necessary to accept , and with which it is idle to expostulate . It may be asked , now , what has the sentimental as distinguished from the experimental opposition to capital punishment to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . " We need not call it a " relic of the dark ages " ; it is simply passe . As a means of punishment in good working order , it has been rendered impracticable . Society can not be kept up to it ; the public is generally very glad to sneak out or to cheat itself out of an execution , if it can . But every now and then , say once in two years , murders occur very rapidly , the newspapers become vehement and the governors inexorable . At such a time any man under sentence of death will be likely to suffer ; but the public attention will soon be diverted , the pendulum will swing back . A permanent reform in the direction of rigor and thoroughness , however much it may be desired , is simply out of the question . We must either stop executions at once , or go on hanging in our slack , inefficient manner , until the executions stop themselves . The opponents of the death penalty , knowing it to be " impossible " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have a right to take its horribleness into account as a reason for its immediate discontinuance . The great mass of people , the country through , I suppose , hold the question in abeyance ; most men who have strong opinions upon the subject are op // posed to executions . And yet we go on hanging people in this absent-minded , mechanical manner , because we seem to find no appropriate place to stop . We condone the few executions that take place with the reflection that these are to be the last of them . But this does not make it a bit better for the men who are hanged . On the contrary , it must be particularly trying to be executed under the present state of things . An intelligent culprit must reflect bitterly that all this altered public sentiment goes for naught . The compunctions of the sheriff and the sympathy of the newspaper reporters rather aggravate the case . No man can do more than die , nor could have done any more in the days before Sir Samuel Romilly . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who never dreamed of such luxuries as the public petitions for his reprieve , the condolence of the clergy , and the tears of the sheriff . I do not intend in this paper to consider the question of the expediency of hanging . There are half a dozen facts one may count on one 's fingers which go far towards proving its retention unnecessary . A great empire like Russia does without it ; commonwealths like Michigan and Wisconsin have abolished it , and do not return to it ; while its abolition has succeeded in many places , I have yet to hear of a case in which it has been tried and failed ; if we try it and fail , twenty-four hours ' legislation will put us back where we are . These points I merely name in passing ; my object is to show that hanging is a very extraordinary and terrible thing . I do not oppose it , let me here remark , because it is terrible ; but I say that because it is terrible we should see to it that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader how strange a thing it is to be hanged . I wish to point out a few of the accidents of capital executions , and to describe and examine some impressions that control our own thinking about them . One is struck by the caprice and inequality seen everywhere in the administration of the capital sentence . I have referred to the fact that the public mind is not very lofty and solemn in its thinking upon this subject . I have said that it continues to hang because it has not definitely decided not to hang , and that it administers this awful punishment in an " absent-minded and mechanical " manner . It would seem // the height of levity and sacrilege to lay hands in such a frame of mind upon the mysteries of death and the future state . It would be especially dreadful for men to bring into this thing the shiftlessness , haste , and triviality they exhibit in their ordinary concerns . However they may feel towards the general question , they must at least act with circumspection and firmness . Putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether capital punishment is administered with that dignity and equality we should expect . The mere fact that a man who is hanged in one part of the country should escape in another seems indecorous . In some States , Wisconsin and Michigan , for instance , there is no capital punishment . A man is hanged in New Jersey for killing his mistress 's paramour ; while a person in Michigan who might murder and horribly mangle a whole congregation , pastor , Sunday-school , and infant class , would get off with imprisonment for life . This is a mere accidental difference in State laws , but there are other social differences which are more radical and necessary . The farther you go west the harder it is to condemn a murderer to death . Capital punishment exists by law both in Leavenworth and in Boston . Yet in many cases where the same crime has been committed , the convicted man would suffer in Boston and escape in Leavenworth . Then , again , culprits are hanged at certain times who would not be hanged at others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or alarmed , the criminal will have less chance of escape than when the community is unconscious of insecurity . When two men are to suffer at the same time in the same State , the likelihood of commutation of the sentence of either by the governor is slight . Both Twitchell and Eaton , who were convicted of niurder a few years since in Philadelphia , would perhaps have escaped death , had their crimes fallen at different times . Both were convicted on circumstantial evidence . Twitchell 's murder was an exceptionally brutal one , but he was defended by a very able , influential , and indefatigable man . Eaton 's guilt was not so great nor so clear . The governor was one of those imitators of Brutus who think it an impressive and distinguished thing to hang somebody . // He would not have dared to reprieve both , though he might not have hanged Eaton had Eaton been alone . But as he was pressed very energetically in Twitchell 's behalf , it was the natural , though unconscious , concession to that gentleman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the mere accident of a governor 's personal character , whether he was a clear-headed , firm man , or a soft , weak man , or an obstinate , conceited , heartless man . There is no doubt that popularity will be considered by governors in this as in other matters . Pardons are supposed to be unpopular , and governors , with that sensibility to indefinite alarm common to office-holders , are often afraid to interfere . An executive who was a candidate for re-electioii would be less apt to commute a sentence of death than one who had no intention of taking office again . Just before an election he would be particularly careful not to confront what was or what he would think to be an offended public sentiment . Here the reader may think me inconsistent . I say that pardons may make governors unpopular , and yet I say that most people are opposed to capital punishment . This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that people feel very differently towards hanged and unhanged criminals . We do not clearly enough perceive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no middle course . We would like some arrangement by which both things could be done . Accordingly , when a murderer is reprieved , our nerves are not shocked by the spectacle of his execution , while we may satisfy our sense of justice by blaming and ridiculing the governor who reprieves him . It is true , also , that we dislike the mere idea of any mitigation of penalty for a convicted murderer . Were there no hanging , there would be no idea of mitigation when a criminal was sent to the penitentiary for life . It would be satisfactory to know that the culprit had suffered all the punishmerit we had it in our power to inflict . As the case stands at present , governors are wise in thinking that too many commutations of the death penalty will make them unpopular and ridiculous . The question of personal popularity will enter into the consideration of the act , along with the questions of justice and public policy . // It will not do to say that the governor is a mere executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that his only business is to see the sentence of the law properly carried out . Practically , he is the umpire who has the culprit 's life hanging upon the thread of his predispositions and his policies . There are cases in which he could decide at once , but very often it would happen that much could be said on both sides ; and when the mind is thus evenly balanced , we know how the slightest impulse or half-perception will turn it one way or another . I know of a case in which a governor , a halfeducated man , was at a watering-place when compelled to come to a decision upon the fate of two persons under sentence of death . One was a boy of seventeen . The hotel formed itself into a kind of executive council , and the question was discussed in the walks , on the promenade , and at the dances . Some of the ladies warmly advocated reprieve ; while others , strange to say , took strong grounds on the other side . The mother of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , who got in everybody 's way and sat about red and swollen . His Excellency was in great perplexity . He finally decided upon hanging . From what an eye-witness told me of the proceedings , I think his decision would have had quite as much intrinsic value had he tossed a copper and left the result to the chance of heads and tails . There is yet a grosser inequality than any of these . We can not shut our eyes to the fact that social position makes a difference . A man can not easily be hanged who has a very good position in the community . It has been done in one or two cases , but the circumstances were peculiar . The causes of this immunity of the respectable people are twofold : first , a lack of thoroughness and tenacious adherence to principle among our people ; secondly , the inability of the immense comfortable middle class of the country to bring distinctly before them the sufferings of the very low . That young ladies who go to tea-parties and have accomplishments should lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful . We do not so easily conceive the miseries of people who live in uncarpeted hovels . Another explanation is to be found in the inertia of an impression which once gets into the mind . That a man is // fortunate is a reason with us why he should continue to be so ; that he is unsuccessful is also a reason why he should continue to be so . Republicans as we are , I believe there is no country where respectability claims so many immunities , and has them so instinctively accorded , as in America . If a man of wealth and respectability is put in the penitentiary , it is very difficult to keep him there ; not only because of the pressure brought to bear for his pardon , but because of the wide-spread commiseration his family receives from the public . To hang such a person would be next to impossible . If he committed some very exceptional crime , he might be hanged ; but for the same offence for which many a Hans and Patrick would suffer he would go free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found in any particular respect for " good circumstances , " as in our peculiar ability to pity . And we pity the lawyers and clergymen , and the well-toAo people of middle life , more than the Wares and the Eatons , because we know more about them , and have a more vivid notion of the sufferings such a death would entail upon them and their friends . Another inequality is in the method of administering punishment . Some people are much better hanged than others . This may seem to be a fine point , but I am not so sure there is nothing in it . Men have always laid great stress upon the manner of execution . There must be as much difference between good and bad hanging as between most entirely distinct ways of inflicting the death penalty . A man who dies at once is certainly more fortunate than one who is compelled to suffer through some minutes of strangulation . In England , not more than a year ago , a culprit who had not the good luck to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . The hanging all over England is done by Calcraft , who goes about the country from place to place , wherever his services are needed . But in America the distances are too great for such an officer to get over ; and in remote localities they have to rely upon the best amateur talent the neighborhood can improvise . Hanging in our cities , I suppose , is pretty well done ; in the country it is often very badly done . This seems to constitute an advantage for the urban over the rural malefactor . // But the gi*avest inequality , the essential radical injustice , of hanging has yet to be stated . The punishment draws a circle of infamy and terror about the sufferer which is factitious , conventional , and untrue . As men stand before God , does anybody think judge and jury , counsel , sheriff , and culprit , have their proper places ? I now remember a hanging which took place years ago in an American town . A very weak young fellow was accused of a murder and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt of his guilt . The district attorney , a man of notorious character , had made up his mind to hang him ( as perhaps all district attorneys should ) , and had carried his point . This lawyer was very generally charged with peculation and bribery , and some other sins to which society is more lenient , for the reason that in their enjoyment the sinner hurts nobody but himself . I do not know that these charges were true , nor is it important that they should be ; for we all know that persons occupying good positions may very well be guilty of such things . The prosecutor who was loudly applauded by the press for his vigilant attention to the public weal , not content with securing the murderer 's conviction , seemed disposed to act as undertaker , and actually went with him upon the scaffold to see him hanged . To witness the last miserable hours which his own ability and energy had brought upon this wretch , the custodian of the public morals may , for all I know , have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The body of the young murderer was handed to his sisters , while the district attorney went back to dine in the bosom of his family . It is well that the reader should remind himself of how strange a thing it is to put a man to death . If one 's gardener were going to be hanged , he would discover that he had all his lifetime been very ignorant of hanging . The sufferings of the gardener and of his wife and children would put the thing in quite a new light to him . He has , of course , known that men are hanged , and has read from time to time accounts of the executions in the newspapers ; but he has never with his mental or bodily eyes really seen an execution . He does not , then , know what it is to be hanged . Immemorial custom and tradition have deprived him of the sense of how strange a // thing it is to put a perfectly well man to death . . Darius once asked some Athenians , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of sons eating their dead fathers . The Athenians said they could conceive of nothing worse than to eat their dead fathers . **lle then asked some Scythians , who were there also , what they thought upon this point . They said they could conceive nothing worse than not to eat their dead fathers . We can get used to anything . That which coincides with the experience we accept without looking into , no matter how terrible : things comparatively trivial which cross rather than coincide with the experience shock us much more . Men are often shot , and nobody is very much surprised at the shooting of Ferr6 . He was not killed at the first fire , and the coup de grace had to be given him with a pistol . This again does not much surprise us , as the proceeding is not at all a rare one . But no sooner had he fallen , whirling round and tumbling upon his face , than two dogs , who had been running about the ground , sprang upon his body , and had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and yet reason must tell us that it is a far more terrible thing that a perfectly well man should be deliberately put to death , than that dogs should spring hpon and tear his dead body . For this very reason , then , of the terribleness of what is strange and unusual , it would be impossible to change the present method of punishment to something less severe . We might put men to death by a cloth of chloroform over the face . The reader , I am sure , recoils at the suggestion . What is the reason ? Surely the punishment would be infinitely milder than suffocation or neck-breaking . One man may say that for that very reason he should reject it . Another may say that it would not suit the Saxon temper , that it savors more of the feline and insidious Latins . But in point of fact we recoil from its horribleness . It is more horrible to us than hanging , because its strangeness arrests our attention and forces upon our imagination the nature and the impressive incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arguments from imagination works both ways . If we do not know what it is to be hanged , neither do we know what it is to be murdered . If we are about to punish a garroter we must bring to our minds the suf // fe rings and sensations of his victim . On a dark night when the fellow 's hand is at your throat and you get a near view of his hateful countenance , you may be sure you will think the gallows too good for him . The spot looks very different the next morning when you come to visit it in broad , secure daylight , and the incurious passer-by will regard the event as quite trivial . I see in the paper that a man has been murdered . The fact makes no impression upon me , represents nothing to my mind , 1 ) ut it would mean a great deal more to the man 's brother . He would be a better judge of what murder is than I , because he would better understand its consequences . He knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knows what opportunities , what felicities , have been extinguished . He appreciates better the sufferings entailed upon the dead man 's family and friends . He is therefore a better judge of the crime of murder than I. But , it will be answered , society already knows the terrihle results of the murder , for it hangs the murderer ; let us now understand the horribleness of hanging , and see if it be not in excess of what justice may demand . If we can discover no other punishment which is , in our apprehension , severe enough , it will make no difference in the result . Our principle is that we are not to punish guilt , but to prevent crime . It may be said , too , that if we do not understand hanging , neither do we understand imprisonment or any other kind of punishment . No doubt , if we undertook to try any of these , we should find them very different from what they seemed from the outside . But it must be a very perverse man who refuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of punishment . The incarcerated sufferer can tell his own story ; we can look through the bars and see him . But who knows the last agony of the death struggle ? Who knows its real duration in the opinion of him who is the last judge ? Who can conceive decapitation ? Who can understand strangulation ? Who knows through what a universe of misery flashes or struggles the soul of the sufferer ? When we put a man to death we simply take advantage of that power which we hold in common with the beasts of the forests , with the insensible stone , with the earthquake and the hurricane and the forces of // nature itself , - the power to inflict suffering utterly beyond our ken and understanding . I have sometimes thought of a court-martial of gorillas , that in the depths of Central Africa might sit in judgment upon Dr. Livingstone , and it seems to me that such a tribunal would in some respects resemble a modern court of justice . The judge and jury , indeed , are not gorillas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential feature the two things would have in common , - ignorance of what they are about to do . Do the gorillas know the effect of their deed in that far-away English home , the sympathy of Christendom , and the innumerable obituaries in all the newspapers ? But is our ignorance and foolhardiness any the less when we presume to lay our hands upon the awful mysteries of death and immortality ? Some very superior people would no doubt think this a contemptible way of approaching the subject . " The London Spectator , " a few days before Margaret Waters 's execution , in a very offhand manner advised Mr. Bruce to pay no attention whatever to the petitions for her reprieve . The " Spectator " admired itself , and thought it fine that such decision of character and practical adherence to theory should exist in a journal otherwise so humane , liberal , and enlightened . On the evening of the day of the execution , a letter appeared in " The Echo " from a man who had witnessed the woman 's death , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning believed in capital punishment . " This man excited the profound contempt of the " Spectator . " " His opinions must have been very poorly grounded , if the realization of Margaret 's sufferings caused him to change them , " was the drift of its criticism . But the man was right enough , or he could have been , had he retorted that he did not believe there was anything in the present condition of society to render necessary the horrible act he had witnessed . He saw Margaret Waters , leaning upon Calcr*ft 's arm , enter the gate of the court-yard ; saw her standing upon the trap-door , her lips moving while the chaplain prayed ; and then , when the moment came , saw the whole machine " fly all to pieces " and the woman suspended in the air . He thinks we had better dispense with this kind of thing , and the " Spectator " ridicules him for his weakness . Yet half a dozen reflec // tions like the following would have made his method of thought sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If murders are many , it proves that hanging does not prevent them ; if murders are few , there is no need of resorting to such extreme means in dealing with them . We have no experience which shows that murders increase when hanging is abolished . We have the histories of states and empires that have done away with it , and do not return to it . Its enemies are practical ; its friends , a priori and theoretical . The thing itself is very horrible , and the time has come to try if we can not do without it . Moreover , we can devise some very unpleasant things for malefactors , if we hut tax our ingenuity a little . Society makes it hard enough for some of us , by merely minding its own business and letting us alone . What could it not do , if it set itself to work to make things disagreeable . At the worst , if our experiment fails , we can go back to hanging or burning or anything else . Trust the Anglo-Saxon to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lie will continue to do it ! I have made use iii this paper of what may appear to be a kind of bravado . In writing upon this subject one is impelled to tell the bare truth with a certain recklessness , - to describe the scenes and incidents of the gallows as nakedly as possible and with very few expressions of sympathy or horror . I have not repressed this impulse , because I have thought it might be the best way to quicken the imagination of the reader to the realities of hanging . I would state , however , that any man who is hanged , just at present , calls for our sincere commiseration and sympathy . Had lie been born twenty years later into the worjd , or had his crime fallen twenty years later in life , he would not have been hanged . His especial misery consists in the fact that he came so near not being hanged . I look upon him as the unhappy victim of one of the levities of Fate , than which she has no moods more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature of any Eastern State is hardly to be expected . I have said that some imagination is needed to possess a clear idea of what it is to be hanged ; legislators have no more of that quality than most other people . The few sensitive enough to know the realities of hanging have not the self-confidence to
