txt That the Assembly may have no excuse for misapprehending the character of Senate bill No. 273 , which mill at once be presented for their concurrence , we present the following details of the claims which the bill seeks to legalize , and of the system under which these claims have been concocted . The purpose of the bill , as declared in its title , is to make " certain clainis of Jossx M. TRACY , for supplies . furnished by him to the County Jail , legal and , valid claims against the County of New York . " By the law of this State , prisoners on civil process must be supported at their own expense . It has been the invariable practice of the Sheriff or others to exact from such prisoners compensation for theirsupport at rates varying from $10 to $20 or upward a week . There are , however , instances where prisoners are wholly unable to pay for their own support , and . it has been for many years customary in the City of New-York to make an allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this class of imprisoned debtors . The method originally followed was for the Sheriff to , present bills against the County for provisions supplied to prisoners , specifying the items and amounts so furnished , Twenty years ago these bills used to amount to $1,200 or $1,500 a year . By degrees , these allowances increased , but up to a period comparatively recent they never exceeded $4,000 or $5,000 a year . About the time of TWEED 'S supremacy . in the Board of Supervisors , the bills began to grow at an alarming rate , till they reached an annual average of $45,000 . Of this amount nearly $40,000 represented fraudulent charges . Warden TRACY conturned for some years to receive allowances on this fraudulent basis . On Mr. GREEN 'S accession to the Controller 's office a minute investigation was made into the composition of these bills , with the following results : There are usually about ninety prisoners in Ludlow Street Jail , of whom about third are United States prisoners , whose support is paid for by the Federal authorities at the rate of $6 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-third , or about twenty , are unable to support themselves . TRACY 'S bills , as presented by him to the Board of Supervisors , and duly " audited " and allowed by that body , were analyzed . Reducing to pounds the'amount of food pretended to have been furnished to prisoners , and comparing the amount with the liberal allowance of the United States Navy ration , it appeared that enough was charged to provide for the continuous support of 400 men . The prices charged for food in these bills were usually double and sometimes treble the regular market price . The bills were accompanied by TRACY 'S affidavit that they were just and fair , and the facility with which they were allowed by the Board of Supervisors is an argument in favor of continuing the powers of audit to the board , which Aldermen FLANAGAN and MONFIEDIER may possibly forget to use at Albany . So far as TRACY 'S equitable claim for relief is concerned , it is tolerably clear that he should be allowed nothing whatever in return for these claims . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was entitled to , and after deduction of the disputed bills , he is still heavily in debt to the tax-payers of New-York . It appears that he now pretends that out of the proceeds of these bills he had to pay his own salary and that of several assistants . This , of course , involves the confession that the pretense that the provisions charged for were actually furnished is a purely fraudulent one . But the claim for salary is as unjust as the claim for food . The Warden and his assistants are employes of the Sheriff , and their salaries ought to be paid out of the enormous fees of that official . On every conceivable ground , therefore , Senate bill No. 273 ought to be thrown out , and Warden TRACY left to seek his remedy iu the courts , like other claimants of like character . The Senate passed the bill last night , with the amendin*nt that TRACY 'S claims should be reaudited by the present Board of Supervisors before being paid . As the passage of the County Consolidation bill would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mode of dispbs-.1 ing of the matter is , to say the least , rather absurd . Any other legislation imposing the burden of supporting civil ' prisoners on the party putting them in jail , ought to be carefully considered . Two bills have been introduced in the Assembly with this view , but they are open to the obvious objection of depriving poor suitors of the benefit of process against the person . If any legislation is needed on this subject it is in the form of a carefully drawn bill providing that the Sheriff should state by name every prisoner in confinement unable to support himself , and that an allowance not exceeding the value of the United States ration should be made on the basis of that statement .
