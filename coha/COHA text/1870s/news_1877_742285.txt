txt We commend the recent debate in our Legislature over the report of the Municipal Commission to such . Republicans as joined the ranks of the Democrats in the recent campaign for the purpose of " reform . " Here was a carefully-prepared report , from an able commission , on a subject affecting the interest of every man , woman , and child in this Metropolis . It was an unpartisan report , and was approved , we suppose , by even Gov . TILDEN himself . Most of the recommendations were such as all sensible men would approve of , but were not vital , as affecting the future disposition of public moneys and the burden of taxation . Ono clause , however , of the proposed amendments was exceedingly important , and reached to the very heart of the whole difficulty . It was that feature of future government of cities which we IEL WO HO often urged as indispensable to economy of expenditures . That is , the giving the control over the expenditure of taxes to those who pay them . Without this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious that our cities will become swamped with debt , and our property will almost lose their value under the burden of taxation . Here was certainly an opportunity for Dunocratic legislators to show their genuine interest in reform . If there had been in the Senate a single leading Democrat with the intellect of a statesman , or even with the honest purpose of a reformer , this amendment would have been discussed on its merits , and received a fair consideration . The proposition contains no fresh innovation on the spirit of our Constitution . We have had this feature in the government of our villages for ninny years . With the single exception of improvements to roads and certain small and fixed expenditures , none can vole in our New-York villages to appropriate public moneys but those who pay the taxes . No one considers this provision in our village constitutions as " aristocratic " or " restricting suffrage , " or oppressive to the " hard-handed sons of toil . " It has worked well , and both parties approve it . It has saved the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities . When this proposition came before the State Senate , though it had the approval of the Democrats of the commission , and was in itself ' so wise , how do we find the Democratic " reformers " Every Democratic vote is given against it , and all on the affirmative are Republican . Certainly , from D.unoerats like Mr. WAGSTAFF and Mr. GERARD , with their surroundings and education , better things might have been expected , and . it is due to the latter gentleman to say that he expressed his determination , on the final vote , to rise above party and vote for the amendments with this clause , if it were included . It is a striking instance of the mode ill which the lower elements of 11 ; party control the bettor , that the other Democratic Senators , some of whom are privately gentlemen of character , did not dare to support a reform which they no doubt heartily approved of . Senator JAG alS was demagogue enough to make a popular point of the precise rent which disqualified a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any fixed limit of suffrage did not have somewhere persons who were fully qualified to exorcise it . They were such captious objections as could be equally urged against the limit of twenty-one years . All the " reformers " plead for the ignorant and reckless who have so long plundered us , or permitted others to plunder us , in New York . Not a Democrat rose to any position approaching that of a statesman in such a discussion . We assure these eminent reformers , however , that all the former catchwords and appeals against " aristocracy " and the " suffrage of caste " and " the purse , " fall now on dulled ears . The great substantial middle class , who pay most of the taxes and . bear most of the Lurdens in this Commonwealth , are determined , whatever party cry is raised , that the former wasting of public moneys shall not go on as it has done . They feel that one of the principal objects of a free government ought to be to protect hard-earned savings . They will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it has been . And whether they " restrict suffrage " or not , they are fixed in their resolve to put the spending of taxes in the hands of those who pay them . There is still left all reasonable political power in the hands of the ignorant and poor masses , in their control of the National , State , and City elections . Here they can have the same privileges as the wealthiest ; but when it comes to spending money , levying taxes , and making loans , secured by every one 's property , the tax-payers hold that business principles should guide public policy , and that those should control who pay . We believe that the Democratic Senators , with the usual fatuity of a party having no ideas , have mistaken in this the temper of their own followers . The most ignorant laborers are beginning to see in this City that waste and taxation fall eventually on them . The rural Democrats and the intelligent business mon of the party have long been convinced of the wisdom of some such check over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the amendments adopted by both Legislature and people by a large majority .
