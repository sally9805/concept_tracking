txt The case of fraudulent marriage recently made occasion of a suit for divorce in Ulster County , of this State , is very interesting , not , however , because of its singularity , but , on the contrary , because it brings to light one of many cases in which there is fraud in marriage on one side or the other . In most of these cases the deceived party bears the sorrow of a life to avoid the brief shame cousequent upon an application for relief under such circumstances . Iii the case referred to the marriage was proposed and urged on the part of the friends of the woman with her consent and co-operation , and we are told that the man was finally won to consent " by perseverance and big promises " on their part . Why It was that they and she were so very anxious that she should be married , and to this particular man , does not appear ; but so it was , and although he seems to have been very coy and reluctant , they finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the woman was in a state of health which ' made her entirely unfit for married and household life , and that he was tied for the rest of his days , or , certainly , for the rest of hers , to a sickly semblance of a woman . He thereupon brought a suit for divorce , and the case , as usual , was tried before a referee , who , after hearing the testimony and the counsel , decided that the husband ' was entitled to a judgment declaring the marriage void on the ground that " his consent to it had been obtained by fraud . " 7 It is to be remarked that this is not a divorce for cause , either from bed and board , or from ? . the bonds of matrimony . It is a remedy much more radical and far-reaching , being a decision that there was no marriage . The effect of this iu regard to property , liabilities , and the remarriage of either party , is important : It simply leaves both parties where they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not now be successfully brought by the deceived . party for any damages that he may have suffered by reason of expenditure or a change in his mode of life is not positively clear ; but it would seem that any injury whatever consequent upon fraudulent representations is good ground for a claim in damages ; and it is not improbable that the woman and . her friends may see themselves not only publicly shamed , but compelled to compensate her intended husband for the loss and inconvenience to which they had put him . Such cases are not so uncommon as the rarity with which they are heard of would seem to imply . The case of a man of letters of some distinction , now dead , will occur to many of his surviving acquaintances . The deceit assumes various forms . Not uufrequently there is no mercenary purpose in view ; but the friends of a woman , or of a man , think it would be a good . thing for the two , and for themselves , if there were a marriage , and thereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using on one side or the other deceit , which if practiced in a business contract would send them all to the State Prison . But most generally the fraud is practiced on the part of the woman , or of the man , alone . For some one of the various reasons which lead to marriage , one desires the other , and sets diligently to work to accomplish the purpose at heart . So long as there is fair wooing , or fair proposals , clear and aboveboard , there is nothing to be said . With the mysteries of love-making the law can not interfere , nor may a slip in the court of love be made the occasion of proceedings in equity . Bat when , as is too often the case ? too often , although in proportion to the number of marriages not often  --  there is deceit as to the condition of mind , body , or estate , there would appear to be no reason why fraud should not vitiate this contract as well as any other . In the not sufficiently uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the height of unreason to deny her this remedy , should she demand it . For she was not married to the person to whom she gave her consent . The beautiful and gifted ANGELICA . KAUFFMAN 'S mar-riage is a case in point . She , leading a happy life in the highest circles of English society , wits courted and . won by a man wh o represented himself , and who was at first received , as a nobleinau ; but he proved t o be a swindling sharper , and her life was made wretched . Marriage being regarded by the law simply as a civil contract , it would be difficult to assign a reason good at law why this marriage , and any one like it , should not be pronomiced absolutely void from the ? beginning , ou the demand . of the deceived party . For good . faith is the ground . of all mutual relaticaiS ; and the violation of that in the beginning of any relations should make them voidable . The difficulty , however , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman that is deceived . It is by no means always so ; and the contrary is true very much oftener than is supposed ; men enduring in silence much more in this way thou would be believed . by those who have not observed closely or been in a position to receive confidences . But in the case of a deceived woman she naturally shrinks from declaring that she is- the victim of a *and in such a patter ; to her a completed . marriage is very different from what it is to a man ; and so she takes up her cross and bears it all through her life . Whether she is wise in so doing , who shall say But in many cases there . can be no doubt that she is not wise , and that it would be much better to break at once a chain riveted by fraud , and secure honorable freedom for rite at the cost of a short but galling notoriety . The " woman 's pride " that prevents this is not a passion of the highest order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while the sharpness of the suffering would pass away , and that , so far as society is concerned , the injured w:oman who freed herself from a faithless man who deceived her into marriage - Would receive only honor and ? sympithy . Nor need it be feared that were this the case women would be tempted often to seek such a remedy . For , in the first place , from its very nature it would have to be sought almost immediately after the fraudulent marriage , when there could be no other motive to it than the discovery of the deceit , and in the nest it is the very last step that any woman would be likely to fake . ' But it is a remedy that is needed ; and this decision , if confirmed , establishes a precedent the force of which is much stronger on the side of the woman than of the man who is defrauded in this the most important relation of life .                   @ @
