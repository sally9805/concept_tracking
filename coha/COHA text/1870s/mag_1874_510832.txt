ARMY ORGANIZATJON. * Bx GENERAL GEORGE B. M'CLELLAN. *rbfrb 3 ) aper . II AVING concluded our last paper with a general account of the methods of obtaining recruits , we will now very briefly state what is done with them . In the English service each regiment has its d6pOt , which sends out recruiting parties for the regiment , and receives the recruits for instruction , so that when they join their regiments they are generally fairly disciplined and instructed . In our service most of the recruiting is for the general service , and not for particular regiments , except in cases of re-enlistment at the post where a man has served , or chance recruits offering themselves at a post . It is true that men are specially enlisted for the cavalry , but the government does not always hold itself bound to keep its part of the implied bargain . The recruits made by the general recruiting parties are collected at a few principal rendezvouses or stations , where their instruction commences immediately , but they are generally assigned to regiments before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of our best officers have thought that a considerable extension of the system of enlisting for particular regiments would be very beneficial , and that something akin to the English system of regimental d6p6ts would be very desirable . In Italy the conscripts are frequently sent to regiments serving in a part of the kingdom remote from their native province . Thus conscripts from Sicily and Naples are sent to Piedmont and Lombardy , while those from the latter places are sent to the south . It is said that very beneficial effects result from this course in hasteniug a real feeling of Italian unity , and in giving to the iguorant and slothful natives of the south some practical ideas of the advantages of the education and energy of the people of Piedmont and the north . Under the new French laws recruits in time of peace are assigned to regiments serving elsewhere than at their homes , but when they have completed their service with the colors , and take their places on the reserve , they are assigned to regiments serving as near as possible to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render the active army national by bringing together in the same regiment men from different parts of the country , and , on the other hand , to render mobilization prompt by the regional system of reserves . In Germany the whole system of recruiting and reserves is on the regional basis , except for the Guards . The empire is di- * Continued from the June number , page 111. voL . XLIX. - No. 291. - 27 vided into as many regions as there are army corps , less the Guards Corps . Each of these regions furnishes the recruits and reserves needed for one army corps , and this army corps , in addition to its number , takes also the name of the region or province in which it is stationed and recruitedas , for example , the Second or Pomeranian Corps , the Third or Brandenburg Corps . The Guards Corps is recruited from all the Prussian provinces , and its reserves are the men who passed their active service in its ranks . For the purposes of military administration in regard to the recruits and reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " there being two of these districts for each regiment of infantry of the line . These two battalion districts ( forming a Landwehr regiment ) have to furnish the recruits for the corresponding regiment of the line , also the proper quota for the Guards , and the proper proportion of men for the rifles , artillery , etc. , etc. , of the army corps of the region .. As the several army corps are essentially equal in strength , it is just that the regions should be equal in population ; as originally established they were very nearly so , but the increase has been unequal . By means of the organization of " reserve Landwehr battalion districts , " and other arrangements which we have not space to describe , these inequalities are provided for , and justice to all secured . Each Landwehr battalion district has a permanent district staff , which is not the staff of the mobilized battalion . It is the duty of this permanent staff ( which remains at its post in war , and does not accompany the mobilized battalion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men belonging to the battalion , to keep the lists of the names and residences of all about to become liable to the conscription , of all soldiers on furlough , of the reserve men and Landwehr men of the district . It is to them , in connection with the civil authorities , that the duty is committed of enforcing the attendance of conscripts and reserve men when called for . They see to their proper equipment , and dispatch them to the head- quarters of the regiment to which they belong . In addition to these and similar duties , which will naturally suggest themselves , the district staff officers keep a list of all the horses in the district , so that in the event of sudden necessity all may be ordered in for selection for army uses . In time of war the Landwehr infantry men may be used to fill the gaps in the regiments of the standing army , or , being formed into // Landwehr battalions and regiments , may be used as such in the front line , or in sieges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communication , guard prisoners , etc. , thus relieving the troops of the line to that extent . The cavalry Landwehr men are also in time of war formed into regiments . The Landwehr men of the artillery and pioneers are not formed into Landwelir batteries or companies , but are used in filling up the batteries of fortress artillery , and for the formation and completion of reserve batteries of foot artillery and pioneer companies for garrison service . Experience having shown the percentage of losses in campaign for the different arms of service , it is made the duty of each Landwehr battalion district in time of war to forward to the corresponding line regiment , without any special requisition , the men required to maintain the companies at their full strength . When the war of 1866 broke out too few years bad elapsed since the last changes in the organization of the Landwehr and the increase of the standing army for the accumulation of the reserves necessary to supply all the wants of the regular regiments . It was therefore necessary to transfer many Landwehr men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large numbers of Landwehr regiments and bring them to the front . In the war of 1870 , however , the new system was in full operation . Without any extraordinary measures being resorted to , the reserves of the first class sufficed alone to maintain the field army of the North German Confederation always at the full strength . The orders for mobilizing the army were issued on the 16th of July , and so complete were all the arrangements for calling in the reserves , for arming and equipping them , and for transporting the troops by rail , that on the 4th of August the army of the . Crown Prince defeated the French at Weissenburg , and on the 6th the same army again defeated them at W6rth , while the armies of Prince Frederick Charles and of Steinmetz defeated the French left on the same day at Saarbrilek . In addition to maintaining the field troops at their full strength , there were mobillzed during the war 166 Laudwebr battalions , 2 reserve rifle battalions , 16 reserve cavalry regiments , 39 reserve batteries , 173 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of which took part in the active operations , chiefly in the numerous sieges , and partly in guarding communications . There were also organized five additional telegraph divisions , one railway division , one torpedo detachment , one balloon detachment , one photographical detachment . There were besides organized for garrison duty and guarding prisoners 72 garrison battalions , each 750 strong , and 53 ( lismounted Landwehr squadrons , each 250 strong . All this was done without disturbing any of the organizations of the field army , . and employing solely thoroughly instructed and disciplined soldiers . Before proceeding to the subject of the measures adopted to secure proper instruction for the officers and non-commissioned officers , it will be profitable to examine for a moment the general principles on which the German system of reserves is founded , and the chief objects they seek to accomplish ; for from these principles inferences. may be drawn useful to ourselves , should we ever be so unfortunate as to become involved in another serious war . The governing and most important principle at the bottom of army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies are organized and wars conducted at the present time , other things being equal , the superiority must rest with that army which possesses the best organization and the most thorough discipline and instruction ; in oth-* er words , that such an army as the German must inevitably be successful against such troops as composed the French armies of the Loire . Of course it may happen that in peculiar cases , as when sheltered by perma-. neat defenses or field fortifications , brave men , who are well armed but imperfectly organized and instructed , may successfully* resist the attacks of good troops ; but such cases are exceptional , and can not in the long-run influence the result of a war if their opponents are numerous and determined , and the field of operations extensive . From this it follows that , so far as circumstances permit , the regiments , batteries , etc. , of the standing army should be sufficient , when filled to the war strength , for all the purposes of field operations , and that means should exist of supplying the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We may anticipate a little by saying that the same principle clearly applies , and if possible with still greater force , to the officers and non-commissioned officers . It is also true that in time of peace aniple provision should be made of such kinds of war material as are comparatively imperishable in their nature , which require some considerable time for their preparation , and which are least likely to become useless in consequence of improvements . When the circumstances are such that it is either impossible or injudicious to do all these things , then the only alternative is to do the next best thing , but always to keep in view the principles themselves . For instance , when war breaks out the regiments of the peace establishment should at once be filled to the maximum , and the number of new regiments organized should be strictly commensurate with a liberal estimate of the probable ultimate requirements of the war . The greatest care should be exercised in the appointment of new officers ; that is to say , // qwq our own , if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draft or conscription necessary , the first step would seem qwq SELECTION OF NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS . // for non-commissioned officers , which are filled by volunteers from seventeen to nineteen years of age , who are fitted for their intended positions in three years . The best pass into the infantry as non - commissioned officers immediately upon completing their course , while the others join their regiments as privates or lance-corporals , but are soon promoted . These men are peculiarly fitted fur such duties as require especial intelligence and skill in the use of the pen , as quartermaster - sergeants , company clerks , first sergeants , etc. , and finally as paymasters . Each of these four schools consists of 19 officers , 46 non-commissioned officers , 500 privates , etc. , etc. , and is organized in four companies . The Military Orphan House at Potsdam , the Military Institute for Soldiers ' Sons at Annaburg , and the eleven garrison schools for the free education of the children of non-commissioned officers , may all be regarded as to a great extent preparatory schools for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such positions . SELECTION OF THE LOWER GRADES OF OFFICERS . The necessary supply of second lieutenants is derived partly from the corps of cadets and partly by promotion from the ensigns , or Porte-6p6e Fiihnrichs . The Prussian corps of cadets consists of the main institution at Berlin , and six preparatory schools at other places , containing altogether about 1700 cadets . Each preparatory school consists of four classes ; the main establishment has the two higher classes , and in addition two special classes . Upon completing the course , the members of the first class-about 200 in number-undergo the examination for promotion as ensigns . Those who fail under the test enter the army as privates ; those who pass become brevet ensigns , but about fifty of the best of the class remain another year in the select ela8s of the cadet corps , and at the end of that time become second lieutenants immediately , if they pass the requisite examination . Those of the first class who are too young or too weak to enter the army with their classmates remain another year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensigns ; these average about thirty annually . The cadet corps supplies less than fifty per cent . of the vacancies . The Porte - 6p6e Fiihnrichs , or ensigns , through whom the remaining vacancies are supplied in peace , form a special class of noncommissioned officers , created for the particular purpose of supplying competent officers . Any non-commissioned officer or soldier , between the ages of seventeen and a half and twenty-three , who has served six months , and possesses the requisite certificate of fitness from his superiors , may apply for oxamination as an ensign . It is more usual , however , for this application to come from youths before entering the service , and at the age of seventeen . These applicants are assigned to a regiment , and must serve five full months in a company ; if they then obtain from their officers the requisite certificate of moral anJ physical fitness , etc. , they are allowed to present themselves for examination . The obligatory branches are the German , Latin , and French languages , mathematics , history , geography , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution in which these branches are taught may be excused from this examination . The results of these examinations and the certificates of the officers are now sent to Berlin , where the appointment of ensign is made , if the circumstances of the case are satisfactory . As already stated , the cadet corps furnishes about 110 brevet ensigns annually . These young men are assigned to regiments , and become full ensigns if on the expiration of five full months ' service they procure the requisite certificates from their officers . Although these young men are now in the line of promotion , they are required to do the duty of non - commissioned officers , and are completely under the orders of the first sergeants of their respective companies . Every care is taken to make them fully acquainted with all the details of the service , the duties of all the non-commissioned officers , the duties , habits , and wants of the men , etc . On the other hand , the officers are desired to associate with them as much as possible off duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Those of the ensigns who have not passed through the cadet corps , or in some other manner acquired the requisite theoretical instruction , are sent to one of the seven military schools established especially for them to fit them for promotion ; the course lasts nine months . To be allowed to apply for examination as a second lieutenant the candidate must be less than twenty-five years old , and have served at least six months with his regiment as a full ensign . The examination comprises only the strictly military subjects , e. g. , tactics , fortification , service in garrison and the field , surveying , drawing , etc . This examination successfully passed , it is still necessary that the candidate should have the written consent of the officers of his regiment to his promotion . Any officers desiring to transfer from the reserve or Landwehr into the standing army must give proof of their thorough acquaintance with the branches of knowledge alluded to above . In the German army promotion is as a rule according to seniority ; the exceptions to this rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , 1 , officers of the general staff corps ; 2 , aids-de-camp on // some of the highest staffs ; 3 , officers of the cadet corps ; 4 , officers specially and very highly recommended by their comrades and inferiors ; 5 , cases of distinguished actions in war . If an officer is not recognized as possessing the qualifications required in the next higher grade , he is passed over , and usually goes on the retired list . In addition to the means of instruction for officers already mentioned , it will be snificient to allude to the united artillery and engineer school at Berlin , which provides for the complete education of the lieutenants of these two arms of service . There are certain schools of practice that should also be briefly mentioned , e. g. , the school of target practice , to which are sent annually 60 lieutenants , 135 non-commissioned officers , and 360 men to be qualified as instructors ( the course lasts from April 1 to September 30 ) ; the model infantry battalion in Potsdam , to which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 650 men , in order to insure uniformity in drill throughout the army ; the riding-school at Hanover , the object of which is to furnish riding-masters for the cavalry and artillery , and to which each regiment sends one lieutenant and two lance - corporals ; finally , the artillery school for target practice at Berlin , and the central gymnastic school in the same place . Our present purpose is answered by merely indicating the existence of these among other similar institutions , as showing the extreme care taken in the German service to perfect the instruction of the army in all details , and to secure uniformity . We stated in a preceding paper that the company , and the corresponding unit in the other arms , i. e. , the battery or the squadron -- is the true foundation of the whole military fabric , that within it are performed the most important portions of the interior service , and that the soldier receives therein all the most essential elements of instruction . While the company is the smallest independent unit , it is at the same time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is acquainted with all their personal characteristics , while it is also the largest fraction in which every man knows all his comrades personally : it is the true military family , the head of which is the captain . Subject to the general regulations of the service , and the general orders regulating the drills , discipline , etc. , he has the direct and almost independent control of his command . In well-regulated armies no one interferes between the captain and his command , all orders from above passing through him , and all communications from below also going through his hands . His superior officers should confine themselves to such a general supervision as will enable them to ascertain that he does his duty properly ; and whenever they have reason to be dissatisfied , or to require any change in his conduct of affairs , their observations should be made directly to him , and never to any of his subordinates . He is in every respect responsible for the condition of his company , and can not throw the responsibility upon his subordinates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duties properly and in exact accordance with his views . This being the case , it is just that he should as far as possible have the selection of his non-commissioned officers ; in other words , his recommendations in regard to their appointment and the reverse should be affirmed by the regimental commander , except in special cases where there is some grave reason to the contrary . In the German service the grade of captain is the lowest conferring the right to inflict punishment , the lieutenants and non-commissioned officers being limited to placing men in arrest when necessary , and reporting the facts immediately to the captain for his action . It is the captain 's duty not only to guide his lieutenants in the performance of their duties , and to mark out their work for them , but also to superintend their instruction and improvement in the knowledge of . their profession , that they may become fitted for the functions of the higher grade . For the purposes of interior service the company is divided into squads of from ten to twenty each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , whose duty it is to maintain a constant watch over the men of the squad to sbe that all orders and regulations are strictly obeyed ; that they take proper care of their arms , clothing , equipments , ammunition , etc. ; observe the necessary hygienic precautions in regard to their food , persons , etc. ; in brief , it is the province of the non-commissioned officers to see that all orders of the captain are carried out , and to report to him every thing necessary to keep him fully informed as to the condition of the men . Upon the non-commissioned officers also devolves the immediate instruction of the recruits in the school of the soldier , and the first elements of duty and discipline . It is also their duty to act as guides and assistants in the company and battalion drills , to command the small detachments for guard , patrol duty , etc. , and in battle to keep the men to their duty , and to aid in carrying out the captain 's orders . The immediate superior of the non-commissioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is called Feldwebel-who is the direct agent of the captain , and through whom all orders and reports pass . It is his duty to keep all the company books and records , to make all details , to form the company whenever it is assembled , to superintend the messing of the men , keep the mess accounts when the men // all mess together , etc. , etc . He should never be selected from mere seniority , but the most intelligent , trustworthy , and soldierly non-commissioned officer should always be chosen for this position , provided his character is such as to inspire all his subordinates with respect . The senior non-commissioned officers replace absent officers , where necessary , in the command of platoons and other duties . It is the duty of the lieutenants to assist the captain , and to represent him in his absence . They must therefore endeavor fully to understand his views , and work in perfect harmony with him , and must make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the personnel and materiel of the company and all the arrangements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several squads , but this does not constitute an intermediate authority between the captain and the men , as nothing can be allowed to intervene between the captain and his command . In most armies there is in every company a lieutenant " of the day " or " of the week , " whose duty it is to remain at the barracks or camp , to be present at all roll-calls , to superintend all issues of rations , forage , or material , to take immediate action in any sudden emergency requiring prompt decision , etc. , etc . In those services where the men are paid daily or weekly it is also the duty of the lieutenant of the day or week to be present when the first sergeant receives the money from the battalion paymaster , and also when the men are paid . At drills the sellior lieutenants command platoons , the juniors acting as file-closers . In the field they frequently command detachments , such as advanced guards , strong patrols , outpost guards , etc . The duties of the field-officers vary slightly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more battalions , each battalion commander is charged with the general supervision of the affairs of the companies . He must see that all orders ceming from a higher authority are strictly carried out , and that the captains perform their duties faithfully and intelligently ; but he must not interfere with them except in cases of neglect or mistakes . He of course assumes the direct command of his battalion whenever it , or the greater part of it , is formed for any duty , whether of instruction or otherwise . The battalion adjutant is appointed by the colonel on the recommendation of the battalion commander . It is his duty to keep all the battalion books and records , to make the various details for duty , to form and inspect the details for guard duty , to instruct the non - commissioned officers in the battalion drill , and , in the winter , in regard to their general duties ; he has also the charge of the band . When there is an extra major with a regi ment he is specially charged with the administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the maintenance of the general discipline and the administration of jiistice in minor cases . He must also superintend the instruction and administration of his command , and must pay especial attention to the instruction of his officers . He gives the general orders necessary to insure uniformity in the instruction of the battalions , and interferes directly with the battalions only under circumstances similar to those which justify the interference of the battalion commanders in the affairs ef the companies . The regimental adjutant is appointed by the colonel , and need not be senior to the battalion adjutants . He keeps all the regimental books and records , makes the details , etc . In the German army the principle is fully estabjished that every commander of a distinct unit , from the captain of a company upward , is independent and responsible ; that is to say , that his superiors have no right to come between him and his command , or to interfere with him in the performance of his duty , unless he shows himself negligent or incapable . Every commander is responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , for the proper employment of the officers , and for the preservation of the health of the men under him ; but he must be careful to conduct himself in such a manner that all under him may do their duty with cheerfulness , and preserve the greatest zeal for the good of the service . If the superior interferes unnecessarily or too quickly with his subordinates , he will necessarily impair their efficiency , destroy their interest in the service , lessen their influence over their men , and at the same time impair his own usefulness and dignity . It is especially the duty of the generals to guard against this evil ; they should never take the place of the regimental commanders , and issue orders for the minute details of service . Too many orders and too much writing should be avoided as far as possible . The rule is that each commander has the general control and supervision of all the units intrusted to him , and that so long as his subordinates do their duty properly he should , as much as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just laid down will explain sufficiently well the usual duties of general officers under ordinary circumstances ; it is only necessary to add that where the larger units-corps , divisions , and brigades-are permanently organized it is the duty of the brigade commander to make at least once in two years a careful inspection of his entire command to satisfy himself that the administration is properly conducted , that the men are fully // anstructed , and that every thing is completely ready for passing at once to the war footing . The ( liViSiOll commander directs the combined instruction and manoeuvres of the different arms of service under him , and is responsible that they receive all the necessary practical instruction for field service . Upon him also devolves the administration of justice in most of the important cases . It is the duty of the army corps coinmander to inspect his troops , and to see to it that the generals and field and staff officers under him maintain their places only so long as they are fit for field service , and retain the requisite mental faculties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat that for the infantry and the engineer troops the company , for the artillery the battery , and for the cavalry the squadron , are the really independent units which are the foundation of an army , and on the condition of which the efficiency of the army mainly depends . These smaller units are never merged in the larger ones , which are simply aggregations of companies , and which are established for the convenience of the service , and to conform to the principle that no commander should have more than five*or six independent subordinates under his immediate orders . It should also be repeated that the system of strong companies-that is to say , of those composed of about 250 non - commissioned officers and men-is rapidly gaining ground in Europe ; it now holds in Germany , Russia , and Austria , and within a year or two has been adopted for the Italian army . In France and England it has many and able supporters , but has not yet been adopted . It has already been stated that this number of men has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiently under all circumstances , and which permits him to acquire an accurate personal knowledge of all his men hy name and individual character . The economy resulting from this organization , as compared with that of the small companies , has been already pointed out . We have thus sketched , in a very general way , the main features of army organization , the principal duties and functions of the component parts , and the various methods pursued for procuring the reqnisite number of officers and men . An army is the most powerful yet the most delicate and complex of machines , and every one knows that the work for which it is intended is of the utmost difficulty and importance . Its importance is measured by the fact that , under Providence , a war , a campaign , or a single battle may , and often does , determine the fate of a nation for centuries , and thus affect the liberties and happiness of families and Ludividuals yet unborn . The task is diffi cult , because it requires every member of an army to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and danger ; to devote all his faculties to his duties ; to give up his own will and opinion for those of his superiors ; and to he ready to expose his life at any moment . It is clear that a mere form of army organization , no matter how perfect in theory , will not suffice to produce good results , and that the frame-work must be animated by a moral force which shall impel and enable every man to do his best . This moral force , which is often called " the military spirit , " includes the various military qualities or virtues , and must be accompanied , guided , and to some extent produced by instruction . Among the highest military virtues-indispensable to all ranks and grades-are devotion to the country and the flag , moral and physical courage , and subordination ; besides these qualities , honor , courtesy , and truthfulness in all the relations of life come within the category of military virtues . Bearing in mind how widely individuals differ in respect of moral qualities , it is plain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely be left to individual impulse , but that some standard rule must be established for the guidance of all , and which shall teach all how to use the qualities they possess or may acquire . This is discipline , which , in its widest and most correct sense , involves the knowledge of tactics , regulations , etc. , so that " a well-disciplined army " should mean one that is not only obedient , but also well instructed in all military duties . The term discipline is sometimes used in a narrower sense , as about equivalent to subordination , and then means that habit of mind which should lead every member of an army to yield prompt , cheerful , and intelligent but unquestioning obedience to all orders coming from his superiors . This frame of mind is not natural with all men , nor is it equally easy of attainment with all nations . Some individuals and some nations acquire it more readily or through different means from others . Some natures require harsh measures to produce the habit of discipline ; but it may safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intelligent men are , the more readily do they perceive the necessity of discipline , and the more readily do they acquire it , especially when they can trust and respect their superiors . The habit of obedience is acquired in the squad , at drill , and in the various duties of the interior service - thus within the company , and under the eye of the captain . Rewards and punishments must both be used according to circumstances ; but the better the class of men , the less of the latter . In support of this , the German soldiers are no doubt the most intelligent in Europe , and the German army is the best disciplined ( in all senses of the // qwq tablish and maintain an entirely satisfactory the age . discipline among Americans it is quite essential that they should respect and have entire confidence in the knowledge and skill of their officers . With good officers , there are no people more amenable to intelligent discipline than the Americans , none who can so rapidly be made good soldiers , and none who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the men who served in our last war have passed from the scene , should it ever again become necessary for our country to raise large armies to meet a sudden emergency , the main danger and difficulty will always lie in the lack of a sufficient number of competent officers and noncommissione ( l officers . The duration of our last war , as well as its cost in blood and money , would have been vastly reduced had we possessed a sufficient supply of good officers at the outbreak . Fortunately for us , our antagonists were in nearly the same situation ; fortunately again for us , we have no neighbors in a condition to oppose highly organized and numerous Lamies to the hastily formed battalions we will too probably rely upon . UNIFORMS . There are several reasons for clothing troops in uniform ; that is to say , as nearly alike as the necessary distinction of arms of service , etc. , will permit . In the first place , it is more economical to provide clothing made of similar materials than where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiencies than when a great variety of patterns and colors are employed . As the occupations and habits of the soldier are very different from those of the civilian , it has been found expedient to distinguish the soldier by his dress ; and it has likewise been found conducive to neatness , personal selfrespect , and good conduct to make this distinguishing dress ornamental to a certain extent . Further than this , experience has also shown that , especially in armies of some size , it is very necessary that the uniform should present such distinctions as will indicate the arm of service , army corps , division , brigade , regiment , and companyto which each man belongs . The essential qualities of a uniform are that it should be of strong and warm material ; that it should fit easily , so as not to interfere with rapid or violent movements ; that it should be so cut as to protect the more delicate portions of the body ; and that the colors , while distinctive and pleasing , WEAPONS . It is hardly necessary to state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years have the changes been so great and so important as in respect of firearms . When the Mexican war broke outless than twenty-eight years ago-our army was justly regarded as at least as well armed as any other in the world ; yet at that period the old flint-lock musket had just been superseded by the percussion smooth - bore musket , which was regarded as the best possible weapon for infantry of the line ; a very limited number of troops were armed with the short and heavy " Mississippi rifle ; " the Colt revolver was not yet introduced in the army , but the old smooth-bore horse-pistols were yet in vogue ; rifled cannon were unknown , and the field batteries consisted entirely of smooth-bore bronze six and twelve pounder guns , and twelVe and twenty-four pounder howitzers . Now the rifled weapon has every where in Europe superseded the smooth-bore , and the breech-loader has in all Continental services taken the place of muzzle-loading small-arms and guns . It is perhaps hardly an exaggeration to say that the changes just recorded are quite as great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last changes have not yet made themselves fully and universally felt , but enough is already known to justify the assertion that the result must be an entire change in the method of handling troops in battle , and probably important modifications in the organization of armies . It seems very certain that the new weapons , and the corresponding manner of fighting , demand a higher order of intelligence and better discipline and instruction than did the old . The greatest effect of the new weapons consists in their enabling men to deliver a rapid and crushing fire at the decisive moment and place ; this will always give the advantage to intelllgence and discipline , and the future will probably show that comparatively small armies composed of picked men very thoroughly disciplined will possess greater advantages than ever before over large masses of inferior quality and discipline . The long ranges and rapid and accurate firing of the small-arms and field-guns of to-day have seriously affected the uses and mode of employing the different arms of service . The employment of large masses of cavalry on the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some very exceptional // circumstances , for where the ground is sufficiently open for them to form and act they will be fully exposed to such a fire as will prevent their advancing , or even retaining their position . The experience of the war of 1870-71 , as far as it went , proved that cavalry could uot attack good infantry armed with breech-loaders without incurring certain destruction . Again , in reference to the other duties of the cavalry , such as escort and patrol duty , it is quite certain that the breech-loader will enable very small parties of infantry to at least annoy cavalry parties so much as to hamper them exceedingly in their operations . The fact that small parties of the German cavalry ranged so far and freely in France will not serve as a rule for other cases . In a moderately broken or wooded country two or three good men with breech-loaders could , with entire safety to themselves , very soon put an end to the movements of ordinary cavalry patrols . It is quite probable that the future changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part of it to mounted infantry . While the cavalry has lost something of its importance , the artillery , on the other hand , has gained in power and independence . The breech-loading field-guns can be so readily placed under cover and fired so rapidly that it is possible to place them in positions that the old muzzle-loaders could never have held , and also to trust them to themselves with very slight infantry supports . In 1870-71 , especially in the latter part of the war , the German artillery was usually in advance of the infantry line , and often really decided the battle when practically entirely without their infantry supports . The changes now being made in Europe seem to be in the direction of small calibres , heavy charges , fiat trajectories , and long ranges ; all this accomplished by means of a material so light that it can pass over rough ground , and find positions almost any where . A consequence of all this will probably be a large increase of the relative strength of the artillery . In regard to the mitrailleuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small - arm bullets opinions vary exceedingly . There is reason to believe that the last war did not impress the Germans with a very high idea of the value of such weapons , but that they have reached the conclusion that in face of active and accurate and long-range artillery the mitrailleuse can accomplish very little . There seems good ground for believing , however , that for the defense of works , of defiles , or of a position of limited extent the mitrailleuse , or , still better , the Gathin gun , will prove to be a very reliable adjunct . The effect of the modern improvements upon the infantry has been no less marked than upon the other arms of service . If , on the one hand , their new weapon has freed them from all danger from the once-dreaded cavalry , on the other hand the new artillery is so formidable as to render a resort to new formations and new methods of attack obligatory ; for the dense columns and successive parallel lines of former years can not withstand the distant , rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those old formations possibly succeed in the attack of positions held by good infantry armed with breech-loaders . Destruction and wild disorder must be the results of any such attempt . Before touching upon the measures now being adopted in Europe to meet the new conditions of modern warfare , it is necessary , for the benefit of the general reader , to describe very briefly what is meant by strategy and tactics . Strategy is the highest and most important branch of the art of war , requiring an accurate and extended knowledge of all branches of the profession of arms , and the highest intellectual gifts . Although its principles have guided great commanders from time immemorial , it has been reduced to the form of a science , and its principles clearly expressed in a scientific form , only within a century . Wars have been successful where the victors violated the requirements of strategy , but only when the conquered departed still more widely from them , or were greatly inferior in respect of quality , or number of troops , or some other vital need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , and to regulate the movements of armies in such a manner that their operations may produce the greatest possible results . For example , when war is about to break out , it is within the domain of strategy to determine whether to take the offensive by marching into the enenmy 's country , or to assume the defensive , receiving his attack on the frontier , or in rear of it , as the circumstances of the case may determine . Again , when an army is about to assume the offensive , there are usually several lines of operations available ; strategical considerations decide which shall be used , and , if more than one , how the disposable forces shall be distributed between them . It is also within the domain of strategy to select the objective points or lines the possession of which-as the result either of strategical movements or of battles - will probably prove decisive in the campaign . While strategy thus occupies itself with the general movements of masses , tactics concerns itself with detailed movements . For example , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops from the encampment or bivouac and set them on the march ; to pass from the order of march to the order of battle , and the reverse ; to pass from one order of battle to another ; from // one part of the battle-field to another to attack the enemy , or receive his attack , etc . Modern improvements have not changed the principles of strategy in the slightest degree , although they have modified the application of those principles , through the introduction of railways , steam-ships , the telegraph , etc . With regard to tactics , however , the case is very different . The principles of tactics and the formations of troops for combat mu*t , of course , vary with the weapons employed . As fire-arms have been gradually improved during the last thirty years , the systems of tactics of most nations have gradually but insufficiently changed , tending toward quicker movements and looser formations ; but with the development of the full power of the breech-loader we are on the eve of a very great change in tactics ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in the use of breech-loaders is also leading the way in the adoption of the new tactics proper to meet the changed state of the case . Let us separate , in our hurried description , the defensive from the offensive tactics . When acting on the defensive against troops armed with breech-loaders , the new system requires infantry andartillery to seek cover as much as possible . If the nature of the ground permits them to find it behind the brow of a hill , that is availed of ; if otherwise , then it is obtained by the hasty excavation of a shallow ditch-throwing the earth in front to form a parapet-in which the men lie , or the gnus are placed . In a wooded country timber answers the same purpose . In the disposition of the troops it is no longer so necessary to preserve continuous lines , and , instead of massing large reserves in a few points , more numerous and smaller reserves are posted wherever the accidents of the ground will afford them shelter . In regard to the offensive , the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy 's fire . This end is accomplished by bringing the artillery into action as soon as possible , and after its work is effected , sending forward the infantry in parties of such size that each can readily find shelter , and move rapidly from cover to cover . Experience seems to have proved that the large company is the most convenient unit for this kind of work ; and according to the orders now in force in the German army , no larger column than that of the company is to be used by infantry under fire . Thus , under the new system , infantry attacks will be made by swarms of company columns , each covered by its own skirmishers , every four companies under the superintendence of the battalion commander , every three groups of four companies under their regimental commander , etc. , etc . This kind of work requires great intelligence on the part of the captains and their men in finding the best and most sheltered routes to their objects of attack , as well as in securing harmony of action with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose order and a departure from the conventional formations of the drill ground , whenever the field of battle is wooded or broken ; hence arises the necessity for a discipline of the most strict and highest nature , which will preserve authority and mutual reliance even in the most scattered order , will cause the men to rally to and obey the nearest officer or non-commissioned officer , and in the first pause of the fighting to seek their own company , or if that be impracticable , the nearest company of their own battalion or regiment . So also with regard to the artillery , in the new state of affairs more independence of action will be left to the individual battery commanders , all working together toward a common end under the general direction of the division commanders . The cavalry also will no doubt find its most useful action hereafter , as a rule , in small bodies , where the squadron will play a principal part as an independent unit . While stating clearly the changes in tactics that have resulted from the introduction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the battery , and the squadron , we desire again to lay the strong gest possible emphasis upon the fact that this change renders necessary the strictest and most intelligent discipline , and that , far from reducing the importance of the battalion and regimental commanders , it simply modifies the character of their duties , really rendering them none the less important ; for while they no longer interfere in the details of the captain 's work , so long as he does it properly , it is their duty to watch that their captains commit no errors , and to direct all the efforts of the companies to a common end , and to co-ordinate the movements of each battalion with those of its neighbors . To dispense with the regimental or battalion organization would be a fatal error . In closing these papers upon army organization , the writer feels that it is just to himself to state again that they are intended only for general readers , and that they do not profess to treat the subject in a scientific or exhaustive manner . The sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the subject permits , the main features of army organization for the benefit of those outside of the army , omitting many details that would not interest them , and not attempting minute accuracy when a general description conveys the idea sufficiently well for the special purpose in view . Written as these papers have been in the few leisure moments occurring while traveling , with very little in the way of books of // reference at command , they are comparatively imperfect , but not too much so , it is hoped , to accomplish their main object , which is to convey to such of the general public as may take the trouble to read them a fair understanding of the structure of the armies that have played so important a part in the af-. fairs of modern Europe . Such an understanding will suffice to convince most men that a modern army can not be improvised out of nothing , and that a mass of brave but undisciplined and uninstructed men does not form an army . It will , moreover , make it quite clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , which can not learn the secret of keeping closed forever the doors of its own special temple of Janns , must make up its mind to maintain a military academy and a standing army which shall not only suffice for the ordinary demands of peace , but even be so much larger as to furnish a nucleus commensurate with probable wants in time of war .
