The presentation of these resolutions as a report of the Conference Committee gave rise to much discussion . There was evidently an unwillingness on the part of the Executive Committee to change the name of the organization . Messrs . Jacob Cohen and John A.

He thought that the change of name proposed might better be deferred for the present . Mr. Davenport said that be appeared as a suppliant for an opportunity to co-operate with this organization , but he believed that the word Reform added into the name of the party would add many voters to it . One of the National Democrats was opposed to the adoption of the word " Reform " as a part of the title of the organization . He thought it would weaken it . Many people were disgusted with so-called Reformers , and believed that parties calling themselves such were humbugs , and their members " beats . " It was finally resolved to refer the resolutions to the General Committee of the National Democracy for its action upon the matter , after winch the meeting adjourned . The National Democracy will immediately go to work to reorganize the party , such action be-in g deemed necessary , owing to the redistricting of the City .
