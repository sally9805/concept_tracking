OUR WHISPERING GALLERY . II . THE last time , my dear nephew , we sat together in this small apartment I talked with you about Pope and Thackeray , the portraits of whom are still looking at us from the wall . To-day we will sit opposite the likeness of the rarest genius America has given to literature , - a man who lately sojourned in this busy world of ours , but during many years of his life " Wandered lonely as a cloud , " - a man who had , so to speak , a physical affinity with solitude . I hope you have read and enjoyed , as I have done , the writings of this author , who has never soiled the public mind with one unlovely image . His men and women have a magic of their own , and we shall wait a long time before another arises among us to take his place . Indeed , it is highly probable no one will ever walk precisely the same round of fiction which he traversed with so free and firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by Rowse ( an exquisite drawing , as you perceive ) , and is a very truthful representation of the head of Nathaniel Hawthorne . He was several times painted and photographed , but it was impossible for art to give the light and beauty of his wonderful eyes . I remember to have heard , in the literary circles of London , that , since Burns , no author had appeared there with so fine a face as Hawthorne . Old Mrs. Basil Montagu told me , many years ago , that she sat next to Burns at dinner , when he appeared in society in the first flush of his fame , after the Edinburgh edition of his poems had been published . She said , among other things , that , although the company consisted of some of the best bred men of England , Burns seemed to her the most perfect gentleman among them . She noticed , particularly , his genuine grace and deferential manner toward women , and I was interested to hear Mrs. Montagu 's brilliant daughter , when speaking of Hawthorne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same terms as I had heard her mother , years before , describe the Scottish poet . I happened to be in London with Hawthorne during his consular residence in England , and I was always greatly delighted at the rustle of admiration his personal appearance excited when he entered a room . His bearing was modestly grand , and his voice touched the ear like a melody . You can see , from the face before you , that its impression among strangers would be no common one . Here is a golden curl which adorned the head of Nathaniel Hawthorne when he lay a little child in his cradle . It was given to me many years ago by one near and dear to him . I have two other similar " blossoms , " which I keep pressed in the same book of remembrance . One is from the head of John Keats , and was given to me by Charles Cowden Clarke , and the other graced the head of Mary Mitford , and was sent to me after her death by her friendly physician , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " There seems a love in hair , though it be dead . Isis the gentlest , yet the strongest thread Of our frail plant , - a blossom from the tree Surviving the proud trunk - as though it said , Patience and Gentleness is Power . in me Behold affectionate eternity . " There is a charming old lady , now living two doors from me , who dwelt in Salem when Hawthorne was horn , and , being his mother 's neighbor at that time ( Mrs. Hawthorne then lived in Union Street ) , there came a message to her intimating that the baby could be seen by calling . So my friend tells me she went in , and saw the little winking thing in its mother 's arms . She is very clear as to the beauty of the in-246 February , // fant , even when only a week old , and remembers that " he was a pleasant child , quite handsome , with golden curls . " She also tells me that Hawthorne 's mother was a beautiful woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that she was a person of singular purity of mind . Hawthorne 's father , whom my friend knew well , she describes as a warm-hearted and kindly man , very fond of children . He was somewhat inclined to melancholy , and of a reticent disposition . He was a great reader , employing all his leisure time at sea over books . Hawthorne 's father died when Nathaniel was four years old , and from that time his uncle Robert Manning took charge of his education , sending him to the best schools and afterwards to college . When the lad was about nine years old , while playing bat and ball at school , he lamed his foot so badly that he used two crutches for more than a year . His foot ceased to grow like the other , and the doctors of the town were called in to examine the little lame boy . He was not perfectly restored till he was twelve years old . H is kind-hearted schoolmaster , Joseph Worcester , the author of the Dictionary , came every day to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not fall behind in his studies . He used to lie flat upon the carpet , and read and study the long days through . Some time after he recovered from this lameness he had an illness causing him to lose the use of his limbs , and he was obliged to seek again the aid of his old crutches , which were then pieced out at the ends to make them longer . While a little child , and as soon almost as he began to read , the authors he most affected were Shakespeare , Milton , Pope , and Thomson . The " Castle of Indolence " was an especial favorite with him during boyhood . The first book he bought with his own money was a copy of Spenser 's " Faery Queen . " One who watched him during his childhood tells me , that " when he was six years old his favorite book was Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress ' ; and that whenever he went to visit his Grandmother Hawthorne , he used to take the old family copy to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , and read it by the hour , without once speaking . No one ever thought of asking how much of it he understood . I think it one of the happiest circumstances of his training , that nothing was ever explained to him , and that there was no professedly intellectual person in the family to usurp the place of Providence and supplement its shortcomings , in order to make him what he was never intended to be . His mind developed itself ; intentional cultivation might have spoiled it He used to invent long stories , wild and fanciful , and tell where he was going when he grew up , and of the wonderful adventures he was to meet with , always ending with , And I m never coming back again , ' in quite a solemn tone , that enjoined upon us the advice to value him the more while he stayed with us . " When he could scarcely speak plain , it is recalled by members of the family that the little fellow would go about the house , repeating with vehement emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he had overheard from older persons about him . One line , in particular , made a great impression upon him , and he would start up on the most unexpected occasions and fire off in his loudest tone , " Stand back , my Lord , and let the coffin paaa . " When Hawthorne was a little more than twelve , the family moved to Raymond in the State of Maine ; here his out-of-door life did him great service , for he grew tall and strong , and became a good shot and an excellent fisherman . Here also his imagination was first stimulated , the wild scenery and the primitive manners of the people contributing greatly to awaken his thought . At seventeen he entered Bowdoin College , and after his graduation // returned again to live in Salem . During his youth he had an impression that he would die before the age of twenty-five ; but the Mannings , his everwatchful and kind relations , did everything possible for the care of his health , and he was tided safely over the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a journey into New Hampshire with one of his relatives . They travelled by wagon , and met with many adventures which the young man chronicled in his letters home . Some of the touches in these epistles were very characteristic and amusing , and they showed in those early years his quick observation and descriptive power . The travellers " put up " at Farmington , in order to rest over Sunday . Hawthorne writes to a member of the family in Salem " As we were wearied with rapid travelling , we found it impossible to attend divine service , which was , of course , very grievous to us both . In the evening , however , I went to a Bible class , with a very polite and agreeable gentleman , whom I afterwards discovered to be a strolling tailor , of very questionable habits . " When the travellers arrived in the Shaker village of Canterbury , I-lawthorne at once made the acquaintance of the Community there , and the account which he sent home was to the effect that the brothers and sisters lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it were not for the ridiculous ceremonies , a man might do a worse thing than to join them . " Indeed , he spoke to them about becoming a member of the Society , and was evidently much impressed with the thrift and peace of the establishment . This visit in early life to the Shakers is interesting as suggesting to Hawthorne his beautiful story of " The Canterbury Pilgrims , " which you will find in his volume of " The Snow-Image , and other Twice-Told Tales . " A lady of my acquaintance ( the identical " Little Annie " of the " Ramble " in " Twice-Told Tales " ) recalls the young man " when he returned home after his collegiate studies . " " He was even then , " she says , " a most noticeable person , never going into society , and deeply engaged in reading everything he could lay his hands on . It was said in those days that he had read every book in the Athenaeum Library in Salem . " This lady remembers that when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stories , she used to sit on his knee and lean her head on his shoulder , while by the hour he would fascinate her with delightful legends , much more wonderful and beautiful than any she has ever read since in printed books . The traits of the Hawthorne character were stei-n probity and truthfulness . Hawthorne 's mother had many characteristics in common with her distinguished son , she also being a reserved and thoughtful person . Those who knew the family describe the son 's affection for her as of the deepest and tenderest nature , and they remember that when she died his grief was almost insupportable . The anguish he suffered from her loss is distinctly recalled by many persons still living , who visited the family at that time in Salem . I first saw Hawthorne when he was about thirty-five years old . He had then published a collection of his sketches , the now famous " Twice-Told Tales . " Longfellow , ever alert for what is excellent , and eager to do a brother author opportune and substantial service , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work in the North American Review ; but the choice little volume , the most promising addition to American literature that had appeared for many years , made little impression on the public mind . Discerning readers , however , recognized the supreme beauty in this new writer , and they never afterwards lost sight of him . In 1832 Hawthorne published a short anonymous romance called Fanshawe . I once asked him about this disowned publication , and he spoke of it with great disgust . and afterwards he thus // 249 referred to the subject in a letter written to me in 1851 " You make an inquiry about some supposed former publication of mine . I can not be sworn to make correct answers as to all the literary or other follies of my nonage ; and I earnestly recommend you not to brush away the dust that may have gathered over them . Whatever might do me credit you may be pretty sure I should be ready enough to bring forward . Anything else it is our mutual interest to conceal ; and so far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on you , my dear friend , not to read any unacknowledged page that you may suppose to be mine . " When Mr. George Bancroft , then Collector of the Port of Boston , appointed Hawthorne weigher and gauger in the custom-house , he did a wise thing , for no public officer ever performed his disagreeable duties better than our romancer . Here is a tattered little official document signed by Hawthorne when he was watching over the interests of the country it certifies his attendance at the unlading of a brig , then lying at Long Wharf in Boston . I keep this precious relic side by side with one of a similar custom-house character , signed Robert Burns . I came to know Hawthorne very intimately after the Whigs displaced the Democratic romancer from office . In my ardent desire to have him retained in the public service , his salary at that time being his sole dependence , - not foreseeing that his withdrawal from that sort of employment would be the best thing for American letters that could possibly happen , - I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , and I well remember the rebuffs I received in my enthusiasm for the author of the " Twice-Told Tales . " One pompous little gentleman in authority , after hearing my appeal , quite astounded me by his ignorance of the claims of a literary man on his country . " Yes , yes , " he sarcastically croaked down his public turtlefed throat , " I see through it all , I see through it ; this Hawthorne is one of them ere visionists , and we do n't want no such a man as him round . " So the " visionist " was not allowed to remain in office , and the country was better served by him in another way . In the winter of 1849 , after he had been ejected from the custom-house , I went down to Salem to see him and inquire after his health , for we heard he had been suffering from illness . He was then living in a modest wooden house in Oliver Street , if I remember rightly the location . I found him alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the day was cold , he was hovering near a stove . We fell into talk about his future prospects , and he was , as I feared I should find him , in a very desponding mood . " Now , " said I , " is the time for you to publish , for I know during these years in Salem you must have got something ready for the press . " " Nonsense , " said he ; " what heart had I to write anything , when my publishers ( M. and Company ) have been so many years trying to sell a small edition of the Twice-Told Tales ' ? I still pressed upon him the good chances he would have now with something new . " Who would risk publishing a book for me , the most unpopular writer in America ? " " I would , " said I , " and would start with an edition of two thousand copies of anything you write . " " What madness " he exclaimed ; " your friendship for me gets the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued ; " I have no money to indemnify a publisher 's losses on my account . " I looked at my tvatch and found that the train would soon be starting for Boston , and I knew there was not much time to lose in trying to discover what had been his literary work during these last few years in Salem . I remember that I pressed him to reveal to me what he had been writing . He shook his head and gave me to understand he had produced nothing . At that moment I cauTht sight of a bureau or set of drawers near where we were sitting ; and immediately it occurred to me that hidden away somewhere in that article of furniture was a // 250 story or stories by the author of the " Twice-Told Tales , " and I became so positive of it that I charged him vehemently with the fact . He seemed surprised , I thought , but shook his head again ; and I rose to take my leave , begging him not to come into the cold entry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days . I was hurrying down the stairs when he called after me from the chamber , asking me to stop a moment . Then quickly stepping into the entry with a roll of manuscript in his hands he said : " How in Heaven 's name did you know this thing was there ? As you have found me out , take what I have written , and tell me , after you get home and have time to read it , if it is good for anything . It is either very good or very bad , - I do n't know which . ' On my way up to Boston I read the germ of " The Scarlet Letter " ; before I slept that night I wrote him a note all aglow with admiration of the marvellous story he had put into my hands , and telling him that I would come again to Salem the next day and arrange for its publication . I went on in such an amazing state of excitement when we met again in the little house , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to think I was beside myself , and laughed sadly at my enthusiasm . However , we soon arranged for his again appearing before the public in the shape of a book . This quarto volume - handle it carefully , my dear lad - contains numerous letters , written to me by him from 1850 down to the month of his death . The first one refers to The Scarlet Letter , ** and is dated in January , 1850 . At my suggestion he had altered the plan of that story . It was his intention to make " The Scarlet Letter " one of several short stories , all to be included in one volume , and to be called OLD-TIME LEGENDS : TOGETHER WITH SKETCHES , EXPERIMENTAL AND IDEAL . His first design was to make " The Scarlet Letter " occupy about two hundred pages in his new book ; but I persuaded him , after reading the first chapters of the story , to elaborate it , and publish it as a separate work . After it was settled that " The Scarlet Letter " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote to me : - " I am truly glad that you like the Introduction , for I was rather afraid that it might appear absurd and impertinent to be talking about myself , when nobody , that I know of , has requested any information on that subject . " As regards the size of the book , I have been thinking a good deal about it . Considered merely as a matter of taste and beauty , the form of publication which you recommend seems to me much preferable to that of the Mosses . ' " In the present case , however , I have some doubts of the expediency , because , if the book is made up entirely of The Scarlet Letter , ' it will be too sombre . I found it impossible to relieve the shadows of the story with so much light as I would gladly have thrown in . Keeping so close to its point as the tale does , and diversified no otherwise than by turning different sides of the same dark idea to the reader 's eye , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it safe , then , to stake the fate of the book entirely on this one chance ? A hunter loads his gun with a bullet and several buckshot ; and , following his sagacious example , it was my purpose to conjoin the one long story with half a dozen shorter ones , so that , failing to kill the public outright with my biggest and heaviest lump of lead , I might have other chances with the smaller bits , individually and in the aggregate . However , I am willing to leave these considerations to your judgment , and should not be sorry to have you decide for the separate publication . " in this latter event it appears to me that the only proper title for the book would be The Scarlet Letter , ' for The Custom-House* is merely introductory , - an entrance-hall to the magnificent edifice which I throw open // to my guests . It would be funny ig seeing the further passages so dark and dismal , they should all choose to stop there If ' The Scarlet Letter ' is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print it on the title-page in red ink ? I am not quite sure about the good taste of so doing , but it would certainly be piquant and appropriate , and , I think , attractive to the gre at gull whom we are endeavoring to circumvent . ' One beautiful summer day , twenty years ago , I found Hawthorne in his little red cottage at Lenox , surrounded by his happy young family . His boy and girl were swinging on the gate as we drove up to his door , and with their sunny curls formed a beautiful feature in the landscape . As the afternoon was cool and delightful , we proposed a drive over to Pittsfield to see Holmes , who was then living on his ancestral farm . Hawthorne was in a cheerful condition and seemed to enjoy the beauty of the day to the utmost . Next morning we were all invited by Mr. Dudley Field , then living at Stockbridge , to ascend Monument Mountain . Holmes , Hawthorne , Duyckinck , Herman Melville , Headley , Sedgwick , Matthews , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top with great spirit , and when we arrived , Melville , I remember , bestrode a peaked rock , which ran out like a bowsprit , and pulled and hauled imaginary ropes for our delectation . Then we all assembled in a shady spot , and one of the party read to us Bryant 's beautiful poem commemorating Monument Mountain . Then we lunched among the rocks , and somebody proposed Bryant 's health , and " long life to the dear old poet . " This was the most popular toast of the day , and it took , I remember , a considerable quantity of Heidsieck to do it justice . In the afternoon , pioneered by Headley , we made our way , with merry shouts and laughter , through the Ice-Glen . Hawthorne was among the most enterprising of the merry-makers ; and being in the dark much of the time , he ventured to call out lustily , and pretend that certain destruction was inevitable to all of us . After this extemporaneous jollity , we all dined together at Mr. Dudley Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkling and unwonted manner . I remember the conversation at table chiefly ran on the physical differences between the present American and English men , Hawthorne stoutly taking part in favor of the American . This *th of August was a happy day throughout , and I never saw Hawthorne in better spirits . Often and often I have seen him sitting in the chair you are now occupying by the window , looking out into the twilight . He liked to watch the vessels dropping down the stream , and nothing pleased him more than to go on board a newly arrived bark from Down East , as she was just moored at the whart . One night we made the acquaintance of a cabin-boy on board a brig , whom we found off duty and reading a large subscription volume , which proved , on inquiry , to be a Commentary on the Bible . When Hawthorne questioned him why he was reading , then and there , that particular book , he replied with a knowing wink at both of us , " There s consider'ble her'sy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em . " He liked on Sunday to mouse about among the books , and there are few volumes in this room that he has not handled or read . He knew he could have unmolested habitation here , whenever he chose to come , and he was never allowed to be annoyed by intrusion of any kind . He always slept in the same room , - the one looking on the water ; and many a night I have heard his solemn footsteps over my head , long after the rest of the house had gone to sleep . Like many other nervous men of genius , he was a light sleeper , and he liked to be up and about early ; but it was only for a ramble among the books again . One summer morning I found him as early as four o'clock reading a favorite poem , Grainger 's " Ode on Solitude , " a piece // he very much admired . That morning I shall not soon forget , for he was in the vein for autobiographical talk , and he gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who died of the yellow-fever in Havana , and of his beautiful mother , who dwelt a secluded mourner ever after the death of her husband . Then he drew a picture of his college life , and of his one sole intimate , Franklin Pierce , whom he loved devotedly his life long . In the early period of our acquaintance he much affected the old Exchange Coffee - House in Devonshire Street , and once I remember to have found him shut up there before a blazing coal-fire , in the " tumultuous privacy ' * of a great snow-storm , reading with apparent interest an obsolete copy of the " Old Farmers Almanac , " which he had picked up about the house . He also delighted in the Old Province House , at that time an inn , kept by one Thomas Waite , whom he has immortalized . After he was chosen a member of the Saturday Club he came frequently to dinner with Felton , Longfellow , Holmes , and the rest of his friends , who assembled once a month to dine together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rather reticent than conversational , but when he chose to talk it was observed that the best things said that day came from him . As I turn over his letters , the old days , delightful to recall , come back again with added interest . " I sha' n't have the new story , " he says in one of them , dated from Lenox on the 1st of October , 1850 , " ready by November , for I am never good for anytl*ingin the literary way till after the first autumnal frost , which has somewhat such an effect on my imagination that it does on / the foliage here about me ,  --  multiplying and brightening its hues ; though they are likely to be sober and shabby enough after all . " I am beginning to puzzle myself about a title for the book . The scene of it is in one of those old projectingstoried houses , familiar to my eye in Salem ; and the story , horrible to say , is a little less than two hundred years long ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present time . I think of such titles as Tile House of the Seven Gables , ' there being that number of gable-ends to the old shanty ; or The Seven-Gabled House ' ; or simply , The Seven Gables . ' Tell me how these strike you . It appears to me that the latter is rather the best , and has the great advantage that it would puzzle the Devil to tell what it means . " A month afterwards he writes further with regard to " The House of the Seven Gables , " concerning the title to which he was still in a quandary : - " The Old Pyncheon House : A Romance ; The Old Pyncheon Family ; or the House of the Seven Gables : A Romance ' ,  --  choose between them . I have rather a distaste to a double title otherwise , I think I should prefer the second . Is it any matter under which title it is announced ? If a better should occur hereafter , we can substitute . Of these two , on the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I write diligently , but not so rapidly as I had hoped . I find the book requires more care and thought than The Scarlet Letter ' ; also , I have to wait oftener for a*mood . The Scarlet Letter ' being all in one tone , I had only to get my pitch , and could then go on interminably . Many passages of this book ought to be finished with the minuteness of a Dutch picture , in order to give them their proper effect . Sometimes , when tired of it , it strikes me that the whole is an absurdity , from beginning to end ; but the fact is , in writing a romance , a man is always , or always ought to be , careering on the utmost verge of a precipitous absurdity , and the skill lies in coming as close as possible , without actually tumbling over . My prevailing idea is , that the book ought to succeed better than The Scarlet Letter , ' though I have no idea that it will . " On the 9th of December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes : " My desire and prayer is to // get through with the business in hand . I have been in a Slough of Despond for some days past , having written so fiercely that I came to a stand-still . There are points where a writer gets bewildered and can not form any judgment of what he has done , or tell what to do next . In these cases it is best to keel ) quiet . " On the 12th of January , 1851 , he is still busy over his new book , and writes " My ' House of the Seven Gables'is , so to speak , finished ; only I am hammering away a little on the roof and doing up a few odd jobs , that were left incomplete . ' At the end of the month the manuscript of his second great romance was put into the hands of the expressman at Lenox , by Hawthorne himself , to be delivered to me . On the 27th he writes " If you do not soon receive it , you may conclude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not consent to the universe existing a moment longer . I have no copy of it , except the wildest scribble of a first draught , so that it could never be restored . " It has met with extraordinary success from that portion of the public to whose judgment it has been submitted , viz , from my wife . I likewise prefer it to The Scarlet Letter ' ; but an author 's opinion of his book just after completing it is worth little or nothing , he being then in the hot or cold fit of a fever , and certain to rate it too high or too low . " It has undoubtedly one disadvantage in being brought so close to the present time ; whereby its romantic improbabilities become more glaring . " I deem it indispensable that the proof-sheets should be sent me for correction . It will cause some delay , no doubt , but probably not much more than if I lived in Salem . At all events , I do n't see how it can be helped . My autography is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printers do mistake a word , it is just the very jewel of a word , worth all the rest of the dictionary. ** I well remember with what anxiety I awaited the arrival of the expressman with the precious parcel , and with what keen delight I read every word of the new story before I slept . Here is the original manuscript , just as it came that day , twenty years ago , fresh from the author 's hand . The printers carefully preserved it for me ; and Hawthorne once made a formal presentation of it , with great mock solemnity , in this very room where we are now sitting . After the book came out he wrote : " I have by no means an inconvenient multitude of friends ; but if they ever do appear a little too numerous , it is when I am making a list of those to whom presentation copies are to be sent . Please send one to General Pierce , Horatio Bridge , R. XV . Emerson , XV . E. Channing , Longfellow , Hillard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will yourself give one to Whipple , whereby I shall make a saving . I presume you wo n't put the portrait into the book . It appears to me an improper accompaniment to a new work . Nevertheless , if it be ready , I should be glad to have each of these presentation copies accompanied by a copy of the engraving put loosely between the leaves . Good by . I must now trudge two miles to the village , through rain and mud knee-deep , after that accursed proofsheet . The book reads very well in proofs , but I do n't believe it will take like the former one . The preliminary chapter was what gave The Scarlet Letter ' its vogue . " The engraving he refers to in this letter was made from a portrait by Mr. C. G. Thompson , and at that time , 1851 , was an admirable likeness . On the 6th of March he writes : " The package , with my five heads , arrived yesterday afternoon , and we are truly obliged to you for putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The children recognized their venerable sire with great delight . My wife complains somewhat of a want of cheerfulness in the face ; and , to say the truth , it does appear to be afflicted with a bedevilled melancholy ; but it // 254 will do all the better for the author of The Scarlet Letter . ' In the expression there is a singular resemblance ( which I do not remember in Thompson 's picture ) to a miniature of my father . " His letters to me , during the summer of 1851 , were frequent and sometimes quite long . " The House of the Seven Gables " was warmly welcomed both at home and abroad . On the 23d of May he writes : - " Whipple 's notices have done more than pleased me , for they have helped me to see my book . Much of the censure I recognize as just ; I wish I could feel the praise to be so fully deserved . Being better ( which I insist it is ) than The Scarlet Letter , ' I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen makes me write awfully ) . - Esq. , of Boston , has written to me , complaining that I have made his grandfather infamous ! It seems there was actually a Pyncheon ( or Pynchon , as he spells it ) family resident in Salem , and that their representative , at the period of the Revolution , was a certain Judge Pynchon , a Tory and a refugee . This was Mr. -s grandfather , and ( at least , so he dutifully describes him ) the most exemplary old gentleman in the world . There are several touches in my account of the Pyncheons which , he says , make it probable that I had this actual family in my eye , and he considers himself infinitely wronged and aggrieved , and thinks it monstrous that the virtuous dead ' can not be suffered to rest quietly in their graves . He further complains that I speak disrespectfully of the s in Grandfather 's Chair . He writes more in sorrow than in anger , though there is quite enough of the latter quality to give piquancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I never heard of his grandfather , nor knew that any Pyncheons had ever lived in Salem , but took the name because it suited the tone of my book , and was as much my property , for fictitious purposes , as that of Smith . I have pacified him by a very polite and gentlemanly letter , and if ever you publish any more of the Seven Gables , I should like to write a brief preface , expressive of my anguish for this unintentional wrong , and making the best reparation possible ; else these wretched old Pyncheons will have no peace in the other world , nor in this . Furthermore , there is a Rev. Mr. resident within four miles of me , and a cousin of Mr. - , who states that he likewise is highly indignant . Who would have dreamed of claimants starting up for such an inheritance as the House of the Seven Gables ! " I mean to write , within six weeks or two months next ensuing , a book of stories made up of classical myths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Golden Touch , Pandora 's Box , The Adventure of Hercules in quest of the Golden Apples , Bellerophon and the Chimera , Baucis and Philemon , Perseus and Medusa ; these , I think , will be enough to make up a volume . As a framework , I shall have a young college student telling these stories to his cousins and brothers and sisters , during h Is vacations , sometimes at the fireside , sometimes in the woods and dells . Unless I greatly mistake , these old fictions will work up admirably for the purpose ; and I shall aim at substituting a tone in some degree Gothic or romantic , or any such tone as may best please myself , instead of the classic coldness , which is as repellant as the touch of marble . " I o*ive you these hints of my plan , because you will perhaps think it advisable to employ Billings to prepare some illustrations . There is a good scope in the above subjects for fanciful designs . Bellerophon and the Chimera , for instance : the Chimera a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mounted on Pegasus ; Pandora opening the box ; Hercules talking with Atlas , an enormous giant who holds the sky on his shoulders , or , sailing across the sea in an immense bowl ; Perseus transforming a king and all his subjects to stone , by exhibiting the Gorgon 's head . No particular accuracy in costume need be // 1871. aimed at . My stories will bear out the artist in any liberties he may be inclined to take . Billings would do these things well enough , though his characteristics are grace and delicacy rather than wildness of fancy . The book , if it comes out of my mind as I see it now , ought to have pretty wide success amongst young people ; and , of course , I shall purge out all the old heathen wickedness , and put in a moral wherever practicable . For a title how would this do : A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys ' ; or , The WonderBook of Old Stories ' ? I prefer the former .

" Throughout the summer Hawthorne was worried almost out of existence by people who insisted that they , or their families in the present or past generations , had been deeply wronged in " The House ofthe Seven Gables . " In a note , received from him on the 5th of June , he says : - " I have just received a letter from still another claimant of the Pyncheon estate . I wonder if ever , and how soon , I shall get a just estimate of how many jackasses there are in this ridiculous world . My correspondent , by the way , estimates the number of these Pyncheon jackasses at about twenty ; I am doubtless to be remonstrated with by each individual . After exchanging shots with all of them , I shall get you to publish the whole correspondence , in a style to match that of my other works , and I anticipate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My last correspondent demands that another name be substituted , instead of that of the family ; to which I assent , in case the publishers can be prevailed on to cancel the stereotype plates . Of course you will consent ! Pray do ! " Praise now poured in upon him from all quarters . Hosts of critics , both in England and America , gallantly came forward to do him service , and his fame was assured . On the i5th of July he sends me a jubilant letter from Lenox , from which I will read to you several passages : - " Mrs. Kemble writes very good accounts from London of the reception my two romances have met with there . She says they have made a greater sensation than any book since Jane Eyre ' ; but probably she is a little or a good deal too emphatic in her representation of the matter . At any rate , she advises that the sheets of any future book be sent to Moxon , and such an arrangement made that a copyright may be secured in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wonder Book ? And do you think it would be worth while ? I must see the proof-sheets of this hook . It is a cursed bore ; for I want to be done with it from this moment . Ca n't you arrange it so that two or three or more sheets may be sent at once , on stated days , and so my journeys to the village be fewer " That review which you sent me is a remarkable production . There is praise enough to satisfy a greedier author than myself . I set it aside , as not being able to estimate how far it is deserved . I can better judge of the censure , much of which is undoubtedly just ; and I shall profit by it if I can . But , after all , there would be no great use in attempting it . There are weeds enough in my mind , to be sure , and I might pluck them up by the handful ; but in so doing I should root up the few flowers along with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man calls weeds another classifies among the choicest flowers in the garden . But this reviewer is certainly a man of sense , and sometimes tickles me under the fifth rib . I beg you to observe , however , that I do not acknowledge his justice in cutting and slashing among the characters of the two books , at the rate he does ; sparing nobody , I think , except Pearl and Phcebe . Yet I think he is right as to my tendency as respects individual character . // " Jam going to begin to enjoy the summer now , and to read foolish novels , if I can get any , and smoke cigars , and think of nothing at all ; which is equivalent to thinking of all manner of things . " The composition of the " Tanglewood Tales " gave him great pleasure , and all his letters , during the period he was writing them , overflow with evidences of his felicitous mood . He requests that Billings should pay especial attention to the drawings , and is very anxious that the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He seemed greatly pleased that Mary Russell Mitford had fallen in with his books and had written to me about them . " Her sketches , " he said , " long ago as I read them , are as sweet in my memory as the scent of new hay . " On the i8th of August he writes - " You are going to publish another thousand of the Seven Gables . I promised those Pyncheons a preface .. What if you insert the followino* ? " ( The author is pained to learn that , in selecting a name for the fictitious inhabitants of a castle in the air , he has wounded the feelings of more than one respectable descendant of an old Pyncheon family . He begs leave to say that he intended no reference to any individual of the name , now or heretofore extant ; and further , that , at the time of writing his book , he was wholly unaware of the existence of such a family in New England for two hundred years back , and that whatever he may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Insert it or not , as you like . I have done with the matter . " I advised him to let the Pyncheons rest as they were , and omit any addition , either as note or preface , to the romance . Near the close of i8gi his health seemed unsettled , and he asked me to look over certain proofs " carefully , " for he did not feel well enough to manage them himself . In one of his notes , written from Lenox at that time , he says : - " Please God , I mean to look you in the face towards the end of next week ; at all events , within ten days . I have stayed here too long and too constantly . To tell you a secret , I am sick to death of Berkshire , and hate to think of spending another winter here . But I must . The air and climate do not agree with my health at all ; and , for the first time since I was a boy , I have felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 that Providence would build me the merest little shanty , and mark me out a rood or two of garden-ground , near the sea-coast . I thank you for the two volumes of De Quincey . If it were not for your kindness in supplying me with books now and then , I should quite forget how to read . " Hawthorne was a great devou rerof books , and in certain moods of mind it made very little difference to him what the volume before him happened to be . An old play or an old newspaper sometimes gave him wondrous great content , and he would ponder the sleepy , uninteresting sentences as if they contained immortal mental aliment . He once told me he found such delight in old advertisements in the newspaper files at the Boston Athen*um , that he had passed delicious hours among them . At other times he was very fastidious , and threw aside book after book until he found the right one . De Quincey was a special favorite with him , and the Sermons of Laurence Sterne he once commended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his library was an old copy of Sir Philip Sidney 's " Arcadia , " which had floated down to him from a remote ancestry , and which he had read so industriously for forty years that it was nearly worn out of its thick leathern cover . Hearing him say once that the old English State Trials were enchanting reading , and knowing that he did not possess a copy of those heavy old folios , I picked up a set at a book-stall and sent them to him . He often told me that he spent more hours over them and got more delectation out of them than tongue could tell , and he said , // if five lives were vouchsafed to him , he could employ them all in writing stories out of those books . He had sketched , in his mind , several romances founded on the remarkable trials reported in the old volumes ; and one day , I remember , he made my blood tingle by relating some of the situations he intended , if his life was spared , to weave into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to worship , and was accustomed to read them aloud in his family . The novels of G. P. R. James , both the early and the later ones , he insisted were admirable stories , admirably told , and he had high praise to bestow on the novels of Anthony Trollope . " Have you ever read these novels ? " he wrote to me in a letter from England , some time before Trollope began to be much known in America . " They precisely suit my taste ; solid and substantial , written on the strength of beef and through the inspiration of ale , and just as real as if some giant had hewn a great lump out of the earth and put it under a glass case , with all its inhabitants going about their daily business and not suspecting that they were made a show of . And these books are as English as a beefsteak . Have they ever been tried in America ? It needs an English residence to make them thoroughly comprehensible ; but still I should think that the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I fear I am tiring you with this long talk about the man I knew and loved so well . You ask me if all his moods were sombre , and if he was never jolly sometimes like other people . Indeed he was ; and although the humorous side of Hawthorne was not easily or often discoverable , yet have I seen him marvellously moved to fun , and no man laughed more heartily in his way over a good story . Wise and witty H , in whom wisdom and wit are so ingrained that age only increases his subtile spirit , and only enhances the power of his cheerful temperament , VOL . XXVII . - NO. i6o. 17 always had the talismanic faculty of breaking up that thoughtfully sad face into mirthful waves ; and I remember how Hawthorne writhed with hilarious delight over Professor L s account of a butcher who remarked that , " Idees had got afloat in the public mind with respect to sassingers . " I once told him of a young woman who brought in a manuscript , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what to do with myself sometimes , I m so filled with mammoth thoughts . " A series of convulsive efforts to suppress explosive laughter followed , which I remember to this day . He had an inexhaustible store of amusing anecdotes to relate of people and things he had observed on the road . One day he described to us , in his inimitable and quietly ludicrous manner , being watched while on a visit to a distant city , by a friend who called , and thought he needed a protector , his health being at that time not so good as usual . " He stuck by me , " said Hawthorne , " as if he were afraid to leave me alone ; he stayed past the dinner-hour , . and when I began to wonder if he never took meals himself , he departed and set another man to watch me till he should return . That man watched me so , in his unwearying kindness , that when I left the house I forgot half my luggage , and left behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers . They watched me so , among them , I swear to you I forgot nearly everything I owned . " I see you are still interested , my dear boy , in this remarkable author ; and , if you desire it , I will continue my reminiscences of him when we meet again . I could go on in this desultory conversational way a long time if I were as sure of my audience as I am of the genius of my subject . So you must decide if we shall continue our Hawthorne talk next month , or if you are to move your uncle 's chair opposite some other portrait , of which there are many more in the room .
