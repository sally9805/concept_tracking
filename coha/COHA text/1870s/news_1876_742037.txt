txt The silver inflationists aim their attacks chiefly at the " bloated bondholders , " who are pictured as sucking the life-blood of the nation . A short time ago the same class of men were clamoring for the payment of the principal and interest of the public debt in greenbacks , on the ground that they constituted the currency for which/ the bonds were originally sold . Recently they have espoused the cause of the discarded silver dollar , which was a legal tender when the bonds were issued , and when the Public Credit act of 1859 was passed , and which , they claim , the bondholders may therefore be justly compelled to accept in payment for their bonds . All of these arguments are based upon the supposition that the bondholders are a fixed and permanent class , and overlook the fact that the public securities are to a great extent constantly changing hands ; and that the bondholders of to-day are not the bondholders of five or ten years ago . Exact statistics are not , in the nature of the ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moderate proportion of the Government bonds are now in the hands of the original purchasers , while the greater part of them have changed owners many times . Great profits have . doubtless been realized by their appreciation in value , but they have been divided , in most cases , among several holders . If the present holders of the bonds were in all cases the persons who purchased them from the Government at a discount of from forty to sixty per cent. , there would be some show of plausibility in compelling the bondholders to accept payment in a currency , whether paper sr silver , worth less than par in gold . Of course , such an act would be repudiation of the distinct engagement of the Government : made in consideration of the risk which purchasers of Government securities during the war assumed , but the bondholder could not complain that he had not received a fair return for his investment . But this is not the case . Many , perhaps most , of the present holders of the bonds have paid the full equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of paying them in a depreciated currency has no application to the case . Every person who has purchased a Government bond since 1873 , has done so in the faith and expectation that it would be paid in gold . Even it ' tdiat act placed an unjust burden upon the Treasury , by requiring payment of the public debt to be made in gold instead of the depreciated silver , it is too late to retrace the step honorably . The assurance has been given that payment will be made la gold , and whoever has purchased a bond on that assurance has acquired a vested right which can not be invaded without dishonor to the Government . A law compelling him to accept payment iu silver would be a much more flagrant invasion of , the obligation of contracts than the Coinage act of 1873 is represented to be . The latter simply forbade debtors to pay in a currency not really intended ? when the contract was made , and which has since depreciated to three-quarters of its former value . It still loft them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor diminished in value . It subjects them to no hardship . It simply deprives them of the right to do a moral wrong to their creditors . The former , on the contrary , would enable debtors to inflict a direct and grievous wrong upon their creditors . It would require the Government of the United States , which should cherish its financial honor as a jewel above price . to razee the public debt by one shameful stroke to fourfifths of Ifs present amount and to strike off one-fifth of the income of every ward or orphan , of every trust estate , and of every savings bank , whose means had been invested in the public securities on a misplaced faith in.the public honor . The advocates of the misnamed " double " standard are fond of referring to the example of France as a country where both gold and silver are a legal tender . The truth is , that France has done substantially the same thing that the Coinage act of 1873 has done , although another way . The silver fivefranc piece , or eon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true at a valuation of gold to silver of fifteen and a half to one , while the commercialvalue has been as twenty to One . But there is a wide difference between the French law and that proposed by the silver inflationists of the United States . Here it is proposed to permit every holder of silver bullion to take it to the Mint , and to receive as many silver dollars as can be coined from it , or to deposit it and receive a legaltender certificate of equal amount . In France , the bullion is purchased by the Government , and the resulting coins are issued at par in the same manner as the subsidiary silver coins of this country . Moreover , by an agreement between France and the other members of the Latin Monetary Union , the quantity of silver which each shall annually coin in this manner is restricted to a certain amount . By this means the silver eon is prevented from depreciating . It is , to all intents and purposes , a token coin ; it has a nominal value above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same means that the token coin is  --  by keeping the coinage and the resulting profit in the hands of the Government and . by limiting the issue . If the amount of silver in the coin were only one-half as much , these measures , rigidly enforced , would keep it at par . It is plain that this state of affairs bears no analogy to that which would result from permitting the unlimited coinage of silver dollars for private parties and making them a full legal tender . The adoption of the French system here would be comparatively innocuous . If the silver dollar were coined only on Government account , and were issued only at par in gold , it would offer no advantages to debtors for the cheap and easy payment of their debts , and if the coinage were restricted to the moderate annual amount which would be required for legitimate purposes , it would not afford a very large market for the product of the bonanza mines . Thus shorn of its principal charms , the double standard would go begging for advocates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
