txt Of late years the newspapers have fallen into the habit of prefacing long news reports with an introductory summary . Men are in such a hurry , and there is so much to read , that a descriptive paragraph or two at the head of a voluminous account is taken as a favor by those who thus get the news " in a nutshell . " Of course this is a dangerous thing  --  this acceptance of one man 's version of a series of facts , in order to avoid the necessity of reading the full statement . Conversations , testimony , and real occurrences , when their details pass through the , mind of a prejndicedperson , are sure to come out in the form of a summary with a color and bias which do not belong to them . An editor 's opinions appear in the editorial page ; they have no right in the daily record of current events . We get very far away from the newspaper when the " brief abstract and chronicle of the time " is insidiously made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business it is to prepare it . And we have observed with regret the growing practice of some who skillfully use the time-saving " introduction " to distort the news . In many instances the head-lines and introduction actually form a leading article upon the report which follows . The partisanship of the writer influences him so powerfully that he parades as facts certain statements which ampler details in the same columns positively contradict . This is dishonest ; and when , as in some cases , it is done to prejudice a case on trial , it is monstrous . One of the most flagrant sinners in this respect is the Herald , which not only by insinuation , innuendo , and prurient suggestion , attempts to influence opinion in a certain cause *now in a Brooklyn court , but deliberately and daily falsifies the record . By common consent all newspaper ? comment upon the apparent guilt or innocence of parties to a suit is avoidedby newspaperswhile the trial is in progress . The meanest criminal is entitled to this protection . It is a great outrage on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in court . More than that , it is contempt of court , and the person guilty of such an invasion of justice or should be clapped into prison  - -  for his insolence . In the paper above referred to , a writer who has a fixed opinion as to the merits of the Brooklyn case daily builds up , in an " introduction " to the report of the trial , a fabric designed to fortify his theory of - the cause . Instead of being an impartial narrator of events passing under his observation , he is arguing the case to the jury , the counsel , and the general public . In the - midst of the twaddle about millinery , physiognomical phenomena , and things purely within the imagination of the writer , there is a deliberate purpose to mislead and belie . We can afford to laugh at the snobbishness of the reporter who prattles about a lady 's handkerchief being " frequently used at her nose , " as if she should have used it at some other person 's nose , but he purposely falsifies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendant 's letters , " I am full of healthy vigor , " instead of " I am full of mental vigor , " which the verbatim report shows were the words used . Such a perversion of truth shows great cunning ; but it is not honest journalism . We may be amused with such expressions as " an excited , doomful smile , " " somewhat wild lights " on somebody 's face , and " the roundheaded man , CARPENTER , who was eating up the orator with his nostrils , eyes , and ears . " We hope the round-headed man relished his unnatural meal ; but to be put into such unutterable bosh as this is a public humiliation . Evidently , the Herald writer having made up his mind that the defendant is guilty , sets about the work of proving his case , and with a cheerful impudence that ought to engage the attention of the court . When he describes the personal - appearance of the defendant , it is done with a power of imaginaCion that supplies all the points that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaking the Judge for the accused , swore that his very leeks proved his guilt . We do not care to reproduce in our columns the indecent and infamous pictorial argument by which the Herald attempts to prove that the defendant and the late companion of the plaintiff must be guilty . Such a shameless use of descriptive language belongs to a journal which is the advertising organ of a nameless business . The whole end and aim of this perverted " introduction " to the trial scene is a laborious attempt to show why an alleged offense , which seems incredible to some , was not only possible but probable . To accomplish this , a foul imagination reeks with distorted imagery , and a prurient fancy sees in faces , movements , and personal characteristics what no pure mind could see , and what , if perceptible , does not belong to any public statement of the case . In other words , to quote one of the least offensive figures in this hysterical gush , it is sought to show by innuendo " the power of a buttercup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All this may be great trash , but . it is a very dangerous quality of that article . It . is not only highly wrought but highly colored , and is clearly designed to prejudice the case on trial . No paid attorney could be more partisan nor more constant to the interests of his client . The merest tyro in journalism knows that any attempt to prejudice a case on trial by means of publications is shocking to every sense of justice . A conspiracy to influence a verdict is one of the gravest crimes against society ; and a plan to use the public press to secure that . end ought to bring the plotters to condign punishment . In this particular case the court has the remedy . The newspaper that lends itself to such a scheme , or permits itself to be so used , has no right in the court-room . Under our system of jurisprudence , the utmost publicity is accorded to reports of judicial proceedings ; but when reporters become lobbyists in the interests of either party to a stilt , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since this unhappy trial has begun , the press has generally been circumspect in its comments . The guilt or innocence of the persons involved has become for the present a sealed question . It is to be determined by the jury . If anybody outside of the counsel engaged has any theory of the case , he has no business to publish it now . In the interest of common justice , as well as decency , we protest against the officious interneddhng of newspaper reporters .
