txt The courts have declared repeatedly and decidedly that they will not hear a fictitious case , a make-believe lawsuit , contrived to obtain a judicial opinion where the parties coming before the court have no real rights or interests in controversy . Judges are kept pretty busy , in modern times , in trying real causes , and whenever they detect that a cause presented is fictitious they throw it out of court . This rule is even more firmly held in recent years than formerly . A little more than a century ago , in England , RANDALL had taken an appeal from a decision of the Chancellor to the House of Lords , and wanted to " hedge . " He therefore made a bet.With JONES that the case would be decided against him , If the Lords decided in his favor , he was to pay JONES . ? 50 . This he considered he could very conveniently do , out of the money he would receive under their decision . If the Lords decided in his favor , JONES was to pay him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment . The case was decided in RANDALL 'S favor , but he would not pay the bet . JONES then brought suit for his ? 50 , and Lord MANSFIELD gravely heard the lawyers on both sides , and decided in JONES 'S favor . But it is not probable that such a suit would at the present day be heard through ; indeed , it has been considered that Lord MANSFIELD himself afterward , in effect , expressed his regret that he sustained the claim , Obviously there would be no limit to the labors of courts if , for instance , Republican Thompson and Democrat Smith were allowed to make a bet that TILDEN. not HAYES , was elected , and then to litigate a suit to determine which had won , and call upon the courts to go through the canvass and decide how the votes ought to have been counted . In the days of the noted Chevalier D'EoN , who lived , dressed , and behaved as a man , but was by many persons believed to be a woman in disguise , DA COSTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-five guineas against three hundred pounds on this question of sex . Then DA COSTA sued JONES . Tho cause was tried , and the trial made , as Lord MANSFIELD says , " a great noise all over Europe . " But upon reflection the Judges were of opinion that the trial ought not to have been allowed , and , they re . fused DA COSTA any judgment upon the verdict the jury had rendered in his favor . This decision was upon the ground that , as the parties to the suit had no real interest in the question involved , they ought not to be allowed to worry and distress the third person with a trial about it . The inconvenience to the courts of having to try such cases does not seem to have been particularly an objection . Early in the judicial history of Ohio , a case arose out of a slander circulated by CysrEttn . LOUGHEAD about DRUSILLA BARTHOLOMEW . What CTN . THIA said of DRUSILLA. was grossly abusive . DRUSILLA , however , took no steps about it . But ALBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a relative or not the report in the books does not show , and by way of redressingher wrongs published a notice that the slanderous report circulated by CYNTHIA about her had been proved false , but as CYNTHIA had no property , suing her for slander was not worth while . Then CYNTHIA brought a libel suit against ALBERT for this notice . The Supreme Court refused to try it , because it involved the Question whether the original charge against DRUs/LLA. was true ; and this was a matter in which ALBERT had no legal interest . It was not fit that CYNTHIA and ALBERT should drag DRUSILLA into court to investigate a charge against her which she preferred to let die out , unless they had in some way a right depending on the question . When the the Legislature of Indiana created the County of Dearborn many persons believed the act to be unconstitutional . They wished , however , to know for certain . For this purpose a suit was arranged in the name of a man who owned lands lying in the new county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new county . The plaintiff told a story of how the defendant bad committed trespass on his lands . The defendant did not deny the trespass , but said the lands were not in Dearborn County , for there was no such county ; they were in Ohio and Ripley Counties . These were the old counties from which the Legislature had undertaken to construct Dearborn . If this had been a true case , the court would have had to decide the validity of the new county , for if the law was unconstitutional the Dearborn court had no jurisdiction. , But upon the argument it transpired that the story of the trespass was made up for the purpose of eliciting the opinion of the court upon the validity of the law . The court refused to hear the cause any further . They said it is no part of the business of courts to decide questions in the abstract , but only to ascertain existing rights . Unless some individual right , arising out of real facts , and directly affecting the parties to the suit is in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give an opinion on the constitutionality of a law . This was in 1848 . Twenty years after a similar attempt was made before the same court , with like result . There was a law passed for increasing the capital stock ' of a railroad company . Gentlemen interested thought they would like to know whether the Supreme Court would sustain subscriptions , so they prepared a record in the name of a fictitious person , James Smith , setting forth a case presenting the question . There was no real controversy , The Supreme Court declared that this was a contempt of court and a breach of prosessional duty by the lawyers engaged . Older New-York lawyers may remember a case in which the parties were more successful . They wished a decision on the right of one of them to money in hands of the other ; the first made a demand , and the second refused ; . and then the first brought a suit . Although all this was done for the purpose of making a test case and obtaining a decision , the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is real money in possession of one person , but belonging to another , and a real refusal to pay it over on lawful demand , the rightful owner may , and indeed needs to , resort to the courts to get it , The motive of the defendant in refusing payment does not matter , if the facts are actual , and the right claimed is a real one .
