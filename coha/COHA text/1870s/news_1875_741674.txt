txt One of the influences which keeps the dangerous classes of our large cities quiet and orderly is not often considered , and yet we are persuaded it acts with considerable power . We refer to the kindness and thoughtfulness shown by the fortunate for the unfortunate classes . Take , for instance , such undertaitings as the clithlren 's picnics of a year or two since , or the Seaside Home afforded now by the Children 's Aid Society to thousands of children of the poorest class . They are an unmingled offering of good-will and generosity from those whom Providence has blessed , to those who have nothing . There can be no selfish motive in the benefaction ; no sectarian or political object . It is simply that the people who have villas at Newport , or houses at Long Branch , or country places on the Hudson , or whose children are rejoicing in the fresh air of the mountains and the sea , remembering the thousands of little ones in the tenement-houses and hot lanes and alleys of New-York , desire to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ' sea-bathing and good food at a seaside resort . Those who have much , share with those who have nothing . It is merely a practical illustration of Christian teachings . Now , the news of this kindness and consideration goes out through all the slums of the City . It reaches down to the very depths of our worst society . The forlorn and homeless children , and . the unremembered poor , and the discontented and unfortunate , crowded into our tenement , houses , and all the classes which form such a difficult element in our poorest quarters , hear of it , and it comes like a gospel of good-will to them . It leaves an impreision with these great unfortunate masses that the fortunate care for them , and have some feeling for their condition . English economists have said that their famous Poor law has , for similar reasons , preserved them from social -revolutionssuch as have shaken France . How much more likely is an unforced charity like this to quiet those bitter resentments which so often disturb the Minds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is for a family to live in such weather as we are now passing through , in the upper rooms of a tenement the - iir fetid With foul gases , the walls and roof heated like an oven , no sleep possible till a late hour , and heat and miasma combining to bring on - with the young children that curse of our City , . cholera infantum. * In such nights , thousands of human beings sleep in this City on the docks and barges , and wherever a breath of cool air can be found . The loss of young life every Summer in this Metropolis , from heat and bad air , is like the loss from ' a great battle . We believe fohat more than half of the deaths during our Summer mouths are among babes and . young children . It may be easily imagined how great is the contrast of the country scenes and pleasures offered by our citizens to these suffering children after their tenement-house life . They find trees and meadows instead of hot , lanes , and breathe cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poorer wards . The sea and its changing scenery and the salt-water bathing offer an endless enjoyment . Good country fare is given the half-starved little ones , and even a few days of such a change produce a marvelous improvement in them . The pleasure is a delightful memory for the whole year , and Maup acquire a love for the country which afterward tends to withdraw them from its temptations and its poverty . Such enjoyments offered by the rich to the poor are the most unselfish of benefactions . They could only occtu under the influences of Christianity . They must convince the most skeptical of its elevated spirit of humanity . Those who would see the practical working of this pleasant charity may go down at any time during the week to the " Summer Home " of the Children 's Aid Society , at Bath , Long Island , where each week some hundred and fifty poor children are enjoying the sea-bathing and country fare .
