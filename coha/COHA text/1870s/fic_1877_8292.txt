Sears , Edmund H. ( Edmund Hamilton ) , 1810-1876 : EMANCIPATION . from Christ in the life ( 1877 ) Hark ! through the North a Spirit waking slow , And rousing like a strong man after sleep : Its murmurs come like whirlwinds speaking low , Ere yet they lift the billows of the deep . What though this power is long and slow to wake ! Oh ! ye are mad , its strength to brave and dare ; For , if its thunders from their mountains wake , They 'll smite your fields , and clear the northern air . Then from the North , along its whole frontier , A light shall stream in columns to the skies , And like a new Aurora shall appear To the whole land that South in darkness lies ; And while its flames do shake their banners near , Your slaves will hail them with rejoicing eyes . 1844 .

They 'll take thy life : For dangerous enough , In these our sweetly piping times , Are men of hero stuff . We should tread soft above the fires That underneath us lie : You 'll crack the crust of compromise , And set them spouting high . Where Henry 's cry for " Liberty " Once sent its shivering thrill , There 's only room , six feet by two , For heroes now to fill . And o'er the spot the years will roll , As spring its verdure weaves , And autumn o'er the felon 's grave Shakes down its yellow loaves .

Last on our gaze when , outward bound , We plough the ocean 's foam ; First on our longing eyes again , To waft our welcome home . Beneath thy shade we 've toiled in peace , The golden corn we reap ; We 've taken home our bonny brides , We 've rocked our babes to sleep ; We marched to front the battle storms That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sank Beneath the eagle 's eye .

We reach across the line , And pledge our faith and honor now , As once in Auld Lang Syne . We 'll keep the memories bright and green Of all our old renown ; We 'll strike the traitor hand that 's raised To pluck the eagle down . Still shall it guard your Southern homes From all the foes that come : We 'll move with you to harp and flute , Or march to fife and drum . Or , if ye turn from us in scorn , Still shall our nation 's sign Roll out again its streaming stars On all the border line . And with the same old rallying cry , Beneath its folds we 'll meet ; And they shall be our conquering sign , Or be our winding-sheet !

Still the blinded nations leading , Are the hosts of martyrs bleeding ,  --  Bleeding till the morning come . Where the stars and stripes are streaming , Fall the martyrs , grandly dreaming Of the coming Age of Gold ; And we write their names in glory , Fighting in the battle gory , Lying in their coffins cold . But those other martyrs ' praises , Which no trump of fame upraises , But whose works their glory show ,  --  Parents , teachers , wives , and daughters , Leading by the gentle waters Where the trees of knowledge grow ,  --  Faithful Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your works forever shine ; For they break the night of terror , And drive back the ancient error , Leading in the Day Divine .

O Crispus , foe to sordid gain ! The man whose heart is tender Makes all the gold his hands obtain Shine with redoubled splendor . Thus Proculeius lives in song , And all our love engages : Fame bears him on her wings along The never-dying ages . For when , upon his brothers , Fate With cruel hand was pressing , He shared with them his own estate , With all a father 's blessing . Add field to field ,  --  rule all the climes Whose shores the sea is laving : ' T is nobler far to rule betimes The soul that 's in thee craving . Sears , Edmund H.

My friend , where'er you tread this scene Of varied joys and cares , Preserve thy mind alike serene In sad or gay affairs . Whether you live in sorrow 's shade , Or on the grass recline In bowers by pines and poplars made To quaff the generous wine ,  --  There , while the boughs above thy head A living roof weave high , And purling brooks with quivering tread Run bounding gladly by ,  --  Let them bring wine , and sweet perfume , And roses fresh and gay ; For soon , like these , we cease to bloom , And fade from earth away . The house , the grove , the costly field Which yellow Tiber laves , This heaped-up wealth to heirs we yield , And seek forgotten graves .

All nature sleeps ; nor only sleeps , But , like a corpse , lies dead . Across the charmed and glassy sea No morning zephyr strays : The sun , with face of blood-red hue , Looks angry through the haze . The sky above , and the sky below , With rival fires are seen ; And midway in this awful space Our vessel hangs between . But we move ! not o'er the heaving main , Where cool sea-breezes blow , But we 're sinking down , we 're sinking down , To lodge in that sky below . Look yonder ! for some spectre moves In terror o'er the sea : Beneath his wings the waves look black , And quiver frightfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before his threatening ire ; And from our prow , on either side , Roll floods of foaming fire . He smites the air , and from their cells Rush out the shrieking gales : They catch the canvas as they come , And flap the bellying sails . Across the noon his ghastly form Its baleful shadow flings : He lifts the spray , and through the air He shakes it from his wings . Ah , treacherous calm ! like that which comes O'er souls that sleep in sin , What time the passions cease to stir , And stillness reigns within . I thought my sins removed ; I felt Their power within me die : I thought the peace of souls redeemed Came sweetly from on high . And then , alas ! they woke again , And raged without control : Storms that had seemed forever hushed Swept o'er my darkened soul ; O'er the dead waves of deep desire Some dark temptation came ; And so my bark was tossed again On waves of rolling flame . Methinks that on this solemn scene , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's never-changing power ; While from the quickly pulsing waves , The loud sea-anthems roll ,  --  A more prevailing prayer might rise From the heavenward breathing soul :  --  Send then , O God , thy cherubim All fragrant with thy love , And let their whitely-flashing wings Around my spirit move ; There let them breathe no treacherous calm , But breathe a holy rest Till thy glorious heavens see themselves In my clear and tranquil breast .

Kindred saints , and angels holy , Bore thy heavenward soul away . Sad , we gave thee to that number Laid in yonder icy halls , Where above thy peaceful slumber Many a shower of sorrow falls .

Lord , send thy pure , baptizing fire To cleanse my heart anew ; And o'er my spirit let thy grace Descend like heavenly dew . Come as thy Spirit came of old , Soft on the rushing breeze , And fit me for those " heavenly troops And sweet societies . " July 19 , 1847 . Sears , Edmund H.

And oh ! another thought than that Comes o'er my spirit now , Deepening the shade that sickness flings Across my throbbing brow . For ere the cheek had lost its glow , Or the arm had lost its power , Oh ! did I serve Thee as I ought , And seize the golden hour ? Mine was the sorrowing to console , The sinful to reprove ; Did I give my people all my strength And undivided love ?

Oh ! in these long and silent hours , Send thy baptizing love , That I on earth may do thy will , As they in heaven above . Oh ! now I see a Father 's love , And not a Father 's frown : Thou mak'st the burning tongue be still , And the hands hang feebly down . For in thy name the tongue must speak , And in that name alone ; That feeble hand thy glory serve , But never serve its own .

Show us the Father ! Now the sun Sinks in his " golden grave , " And weary whirlwinds droop their wings Upon the peaceful wave . The land and sea unite to raise Their grateful evening hymn ; While Nature 's altar-fires burn bright , Devotion 's fire burns dim . Show us the Father !
