txt The Buffalo Commercial Advertiser of Wednesday evening publishes the following particulars of the foundering of the Canadian schooner Juliette , obtained from the protest of the only survivor , Mr. WM . H. THAYER , which was taken before Capt . jjE . P. DOER , of that city : " I shipped as cook and steward on the schooner Jutzette. of Wallaceburg , Ont. , Capt . Basserr . I made several trips in her . We left Buffalo for Vermillion , Friday , Nov. 8 , at about 7 P. M. Our crew consisted of the following , viz. : ALBERT BASSETT , master ; JOHN REED , mate ; HANNEGAN. seaman . and three other men . ( two Irishmen and one Englishman ; ) do n't know their names . We finished loading Wednesday , Nov. 8 ; the wind was not favorable to leave , and we laid there all day Thursday , Nov. 9 , wind still . ahead . We sailed from Vermillion on Friday morning at 7 o'clock , Nov. 10 , bound for St. Catharines , Ont. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large stones , the smallest weighing 1,500 pounds , and from that size up to as large again ; wind fair , fresh breeze ; all sail set on the start ; during the day the wind freshened and blew strong , and the sea began to make and the vessel began to make water about 1 P. M. We got dinner at 12 , noon . I was called on deck at 1 P. M. ( Friday ) to help pump ; the vessel was leaking badly , the wind was dead aft ; we were running before it ; the ? sails had been reduced  --  reefed down . We had two pumps , one forward and one aft ; they worked well ( wooden pumps . ) The vessel was shipping a good deal of water over the sides ; our waist-boards were kept open to let the water run oft . I staid at temps until 5 P. M. I went below to get simper . I got it ready about 6 P. M .. and was waiting for the Captain and crew to come and eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the deck ; we bad two tier of stone on deck from abaft foremost to cabin aft . All the afternoon the crew worked and got off what stone they could ; we worked some time at throwing over the stone , and then at the pumps pumping . Those we got overboard we got over with handspikes and hoisting tackles . We tried to break them up with an axe and sledge , and did break some into chunks and threw them over until the sledge-handle broke . Then we could not do much with the axe . as it was too light . We all worked bard ; we all knew that our situation was critical in the extreme . I thought the men must eat or they would give out , and so I got supper for them as above stated . / was up and down the stairs looking out . About 636 or so o'clock our main boom carried away in the jaws . It was blowing bard , and the sea running all over the vessel . Just about this time the mate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in my shirt ( sleeves , and be said , " Steward , we are going to try to beach her or to get the boat down to try and save our lives ; you put ou some clothes , do n't dress too light nor too heavy ; get yourself ready to jump . " He went right on deck again . ? I put on an extra shirt and vest and a pair of overalls , and jumped on deck quick . The vessel was heading for the beach ; the Captain had broken his ankle , when getting stone overboard , and was helpless ; he was sitting on the skylight , right aft , between the cabin and the wheel ; two men were steering the vessel for shore . The mate had a new line feet to the boat , and he sent two men forward with the other end of the line to make it fast to the fore-boom , which was off outside against the rigging . The plan was to lower the boat and let her swing clear from the vessel when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves and get asnore in her . I do n't think the Captain or mate bad any idea the vessel was so near sinking ; the men came back and said they could not get forward with the line , as the jaw-end of the main boom projected out with the sail so that they could not get past it ; the Captain gave orders from where he sat to the mate , and told him to let the anchors go the moment she struck the breakers ; we were all trying to clear away the boat , when suddenly , and without any previous warning , the vessel went down , before we could get the boat cleared away ; the Captain cried out , " Boys , she is gone ; I had hold of the rope , with the mate . that the men had taken forward to attach to the fore-boom ; when the vessel went down she pitched or careened over sideways ? to a port side  --  throwing the mate and myself down to leeward ; we jumped as far . as we could from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get clear of the stones ; I saw the Captain pulling himself up to the weather side of the after part of the vessel as she careened over . When the vessel settled to the bottom , I seized hold of a piece of the mainsail , but the sea swept me clear . all but one hand . I was almost gone , when the retnrning sea brought me back , and I caught a rope swinging from aloft , and was swept in against , and right on the stump of the mainboom. as it was floating , attached to the mast , a distance off . The sea then swept the boom in against the mainmast and main-rigging . I caught bold of the mainrigging and climbed up to the main-crosstrees . The main masthead was about twelve or fifteen feet above the water when the vessel was on the bottom . The mate had hold of the canvas with me at first , but he soon disappeared ; I do n't know how or when ; he must have been swept off by the sea . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did not understand what he said . I clung to the mast all night ; the sea would just come to my feet when I sat down on the cross-trees . I think one of the men got into the fore-cross-trees . I ' thought I saw one of them over there . If so he must have been washed out and away , as the sea would reach and sweep over the fore-crosstrees . It was a hard gale all night ; the sea ran very high , and my position was a very critical one , clinging to the maintopmast rigging , with the wind blowing a gale from the westward . I was very cold , not being warmly dressed , but after awhile I got so benumbed that I got past feeling . Then I began to get drowsy . It was an awful long night to me . I thought the morning and daylight would never come ; but it did come at last , and I saw the land . I thought I e as about two miles off the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward learned . ) I coula see the people on the beach ; they were looking at me with a glass , bat could not aid me ; the sea was too rough . I waited until about 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon , when live noble young men manned a flat-boat or skiff , three of them to pull , one to bail the boat , and one to steer . The man steering , and one of the men pulling were sailors . There was a good large sea running ; oneof the oars they used belonged to the Juliette , and it floated ashore and was picked up on the beach . They pulled the boat up under the cross-trees and I jumped in . They landed me on the beach after being nineteen or twenty hours clinging in the cross-trees . It was a most wondrful escape from death . I was the only survivor of seven persons composing the crew of the Juliette that had left Vermillion only the morning previously in good health and spirits . I desire publicly to express my thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Everett Harris and Walter Church . the live brave young men who , with a poor boat , came out to rescue me at the risk or their lives . I was treated with the greatest kindness by Mr. SOLOMON SWEATLAND , a farmer living at Maaison , Ohio . He and his family Were very kind to me indeed . "
