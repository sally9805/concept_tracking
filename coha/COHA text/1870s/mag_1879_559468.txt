No . CCLXXV . THE WOMAN QUESTION . THE nineteenth century will be the riddle of history . With its universal activity and universal restlessness , currents and countercurrents , progress and reaction ; now assailing old faiths , and now patching their venerable battlements to make itself a den there ; now proclaiming the religion of science , now prone before the Vatican , and now groveling in prehistoric superstition ; attacking the foundations of modern society ; denouncing mediawalism and borrowing its rusty tools to build a new order of things-this nineteenth century , among its heterogeneous progeny has brought one to light that the world has not seen for many a day . The demand that women shall take an active part in politics is not quite new . That marvelous people of antiquity , the richness of whose political experience matched the power and splendor of their intellectual and aesthetic achievement , were not strangers to this supposed product of modern democracy . It appeared at Athens in the time of Aristophanes , who mocks it with not over-delicate satire . Much has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a few words more . It involves the whole question of the relations of men and women . One would think that the subject to which men have given their chief attention since the world began would by this time be tolera // bly well understood , and that little doubt would remain as to the nature , capacities , and position of women . Varieties of race , modes of life , degrees of barbarism or civilization , have modified their relations to the other sex and changed the estimate set upon them . But , while shading and coloring differ , the outlines remain the same , answering in the human race to those that rudely but plainly mark the relations of sex through all the orders of animated nature . Nevertheless , when one sees the vast changes for the better which have already taken place in the position of women , it is impossible not to hope that the future has still others in store . In what direction are we to look for them , and through what influences ? These are questions on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words of all humanity , have differed and will no doubt continue for a long time to differ . Let us hope that , in discussing them , the airs of benign mastery which naturally annoy women will be avoided on one side , and postures of antagonism on both . The two sexes are one , and their interests are the same . The order of Nature is marked by a prevailing consistency . Over all her great fields of action , she is at one with herself , though irregularities and contradictions appear in special cases . Individual men and women are often inharmonious in physical or mental structure , but it is not so with men as a whole , or women as a whole . The typical man or woman is perfectly self-consistent . The one is made for conflict-whether the physical conflict of actual war , or that sometimes no less bitter and cruel , of the competitions of business and ambition . His greater stature and firmer muscles are matched with a sterner spirit , less tender sensibilities , and susceptible nerves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masculine natures , with a certain remnant of primitive ferocity , which lies latent in the bosom of the highest civilizations and impels their male offspring to adventures of war , the chase , and travel in savage and perilous lands . In short , this fighting animal is well appointed for his work , whether to confront his enemy in deadly strife , or to battle in the interest of a purpose or an idea against cold , hunger , fatigue , want , obloquy , or hope deferred . And to these qualities of achievement , he joins , at least relatively , a mind governed rather by reason than emotion , and a deliberate and logical adaptation of means to ends . There is equal harmony on the other side . Here , the whole nature corresponds to the rounded outlines and softer muscles of the physical frame . There is the same universal fitness to a pur // pose , but a widely different one . The susceptibilities that unfit the typical woman for rude conflict are joined to high and priceless qualities , without which life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equal moral elevation . In this respect we believe that men and women stand , in different attitudes , on about the same level . Nor , because , under the inspiration of passion , men have drawn ideal portraits of women in prose and verse , does it follow that women are superior to the other sex . Women have admired men as much as men have admired women ; but their admiration has not found the same expression , by reason of that principle of universal nature which makes the man the wooer , and not the woman . The ideal woman is a very noble creature , and so is the ideal man ; and this is not the less true because the ideal is not often realized in either case . It has been pretended that the distinctive mental qualities of women are inherited from ages of oppression . Never was there a shallower fallacy . Whatever qualities of a woman are transmissible by inheritance , may descend to all her offspring alike . The male infant would be as apt to receive them as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more results of hereditary oppression than her bodily qualities . The supreme law of sex has decreed that the boys shall be boys and that the girls shall be girls . The natures of the two sexes are like the two electricities of the magnet . Each needs the other , and is drawn to the other ; and as each is emphatically masculine or emphatically feminine , so is the strength of this mutual need . The reciprocity between the two separate halves of human nature extends over a wide field , not only in passions and emotions , but in the regions of moral and intellectual life . Most intelligent men have felt the stimulus and refreshment of the faculties that spring from the companionship of an intelligent and congenial woman , and which is unlike anything resulting from the contact of a male mind . It is a fructifying power , with which neither the world of thought nor the world of action could well dispense . Many men of the higher sort recall as an epoch in their lives that wonderful awakening of energies , ambitions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of the other sex . Sometimes the change amounts to revolution in character , and the young man can hardly recognize himself in the boy of two or three years before . The influence that begins the awakening is powerful to maintain it . Hunger , thirst , the instinct of self-preservation , ava // rice , malice , envy , and other of the lower motive forces , are selfsustaining . But , excepting those that belong to the province of religion , the nobler desires and energies draw impulse and aliment from the principle of sex . Truth itself would seem hardly worth the pursuit if women were not in the world . This principle of sexual reciprocity , reigning through all organized nature , except its lowest forms , widening and strengthening as the scale of being rises , and culminating at last in man , more intense and more comprehensive in him as he is more highly and variously endowed than the creatures beneath him-this principle is the most pervading among the forces of human life . Its degrees of power over individuals are almost infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in subjection to it , or to the influences that rise out of it . Other forces may outrival it in different persons at different times , but none of them has the same character of universality , and none is so prolific in results of all kinds , for evil and for good . It is the spring of the chief pleasures and the chief pains of life . It fires the noblest ambitions , and , misplaced or abused , becomes the source of unspeakable degradation . What we are to observe is , that this imperial and all-essential power is founded not on resemblances but on differences of nature and function . These differences are so great that it may be doubted if men and women can ever quite understand each other . Women have a nice perception of male psychology in certain phases of life and character ; but there are regions of masculine nature in which their perception is exceedingly faint and dim , because there is nothing that answers to them in their own consciousness ; and no doubt the same holds good of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differences between the sexes are not uniform in degree . There are masculine women and feminine men . But when the two thus resemble each other , it is , for the most part , rather through defects than positive qualities . A woman is called masculine oftener because she lacks womanliness than because she possesses manliness ; and a man is called feminine oftener because he lacks manliness than because he possesses womanliness . There are men who , through defects of nature , are indifferent to the society of women ; and there are women equally so to the society of men . But the ocean rolls and surges , though in lazy nooks and quiet bays the waters lie unruffled , unconscious and incredulous of the turmoil without . It has been said that the question of the rights and employment // of women should be treated without regard to sex . Mr. Wendell Phillips tells us that all those who so treat it are " high-minded , " and all the others " low-minded . " It should rather be said that those who consider it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will not do to exclude from the problem the chief factor in it , and deal with women only as if they were smaller and weaker men . Yet these have been the tactics of the agitators for female suffrage , and to them they mainly owe what little success they have had . Hence their extreme sensitiveness whenever the subject is approached on its most essential side . If it could be treated like other subjects , and discussed fully and freely , the cause of the selfstyled reformers would have been hopeless from the first . It is happy for them that the relations of women to society can not be so discussed without giving just offense . Their most important considerations can be touched but slightly ; and even then offense will be taken . It is only for us to see that it be not taken reasonably . The immense disadvantages under which women are placed ; the cruel hardship and injustice to which many of them are often subjected ; the terrible and crushing penalties , sometimes grievously disproportioned to the real fault , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a numerous class , resulting in many cases more from circumstance than from intrinsic viciousness-all these taken together form the most perplexing and painful problem in human life . A remedy is looked for in a change of public opinion which shall visit the breach of chastity with equal condemnation in men and women . This remedy has long been urged , and probably at this moment there is in the world at large as little disposition to accept it as ever . There is nothing in the case of men in the slightest degree answering to these penalties imposed on women , except the contempt and disgrace with which every spirited people visits a display of cowardice . Fear , or the yielding to it , is great shame in a man , and none at all in a woman . But the cases are not parallel , for a man can retrieve lost honor , and a woman can not . Whence arise the different values attached to the same virtue in men and women , and why has every attempt to make them equal signally failed ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , on both its political and its social side , is built on the family . Women , and not men , are of necessity the guardians of the integrity of the family and the truth of succession , with all the interests of affection , of maintenance , and of inheritance involved in them . // Hence the virtue in question is far more important in them than in men . Some savage or barbarous peoples have evaded the difficulty by refusing to recognize the father at all in the question of kinship . When the whole system of lineage is traced through the woman alone , the reason for imposing special penalties upon her ceases , for her children must always be legitimate . This remedy , which exempts the father from any obligation to support his children if he does not choose to do so , can belong only to a low state of barbarism , though a practical adoption of it has lately been proposed , professedly in the interest of women . Nations less barbarous have tried to secure the object by constant watching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses better and more effective means . It establishes a standard of honor , and trusts women to conform to it . In this they are generally aided by more delicate sensibilities , by passivity of temperament , and by being protected from the countless temptations that beset every man who mingles much with the world . Nor to him is the temptation from within less than those from without . To impose the same penalties on him that are imposed on a woman would not only be without the same necessity , but would be a far greater hardship . Whatever liberty the best civilization may accord to women , they must always be subject to restrictions unknown to the other sex , and they can never dispense with the protecting influences which society throws about them . A man , in lonely places , has nothing to lose but life and property ; and he has nerve and muscles to defend them . He is free to go whither he pleases , and run what risks he pleases . Without a radical change in human nature , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be equally emancipated . It is not a question of custom , habit , or public opinion ; but of an all-pervading force , always formidable in the vast number of men in whom it is not controlled by higher forces . A woman is subject , also , to many other restrictions , more or less stringent , necessary to the maintenance of self-respect and the respect of others , and yet placing her at a disadvantage , as compared to men , in the active work of the world . All this is mere truism , but the plainest truism may be ignored in the interest of a theory or a cause. ** Again , everybody knows that the physical and mental constitution of woman is more delicate than in the other sex ; and , we may add , the relations between mind and body more intimate and subtile. // It is true that they are abundantly so in men ; but their harder organism is neither so sensitive to disturbing influences nor subject to so many of them . It is these and other inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's special functions , that have determined through all time her relative position . What we have just saidand we might have said much more-is meant as a reminder that her greatest limitations are not of human origin . Men did not make them , and they can not unmake them . Through them , God and Nature have ordained that those subject to them shall not be forced to join in the harsh conflicts of the world militant . It is folly to ignore them , or try to counteract them by political and social quackery . They set at naught legislatures and peoples . Notwithstanding limitations on one side and comparative freedom on the other , it would not be safe to say that the allotment of happiness to the two sexes is unequal . The life of men , like that of women , has its own hardships  --  the deadly strain of fierce competition , exhaustion without possibility of rest , heavy responsibilities , agonies of suspense and ruin . Aside from the low state of health of women in some civilized countries , and in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , they have about the same share as men in the enjoyment of life . It is among those who have no part in the occupations and duties of the rest of their sex that one is most apt to find that morbid introversion , those restless cravings , that vague but torturing sense of destinies unfulfilled , and activities without an object , which rarely receive much pity , but perhaps deserve it as much as any of the more positive woes . There is no misery like the misery of vacuum . But among all the causes of female unhappiness , and involving and aggravating all the rest , there is none more fruitful of tribulation than ill health , which , in American women , brings with it disabilities equal , probably , to all the rest together . If our women are to rise to the height of their capacities , the first and indispensable requisite is physical regeneration . It is the interest of men in general that women should reach their best development , just as is it the interest of individual men that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intelligent , and high-minded . The question is only of means . There is a universal law of growth and achievement . The man who knows himself , understands his own powers and aptitudes , forms purposes in accord with them , and pursues these purposes // steadily , is the man of success . He who takes no account of his own nature , makes his will the father of his thought , shuts his eyes to unwelcome truths , places himself in false positions , and turns from the good within his reach to strain after the unattainable , is predestined to vexation and failure . Every one has his place in the world , and the wise and fortunate find it . As it is with men , so , in a measure , it is with women ; and as it is with men and women as individuals , so it is with men as a whole , and women as a whole . One must make Nature an ally and not an enemy , for the strife is unequal . The palm Will not grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphors express more or less than the truth ; and so does this . Between the life for which men alone are fit and that for which women alone are fit there lies a region where both may prosper . They may pursue the same objects , though seldom in precisely the same way , or with exactly the same results . In some employments women , with equal application and persistency , would certainly have an advantage . We do not mean to consider the relative intellectual power of the sexes . It is enough for our purpose to remember that the faculties of the two are exercised under different physical and moral conditions , which modify their action . It is often and most justly said that the intellectual growth of the country bears no proportion to its material progress . The drift toward pursuits called practical is so strong that it carries with it nearly all the best male talent . The rush and whirl of business catches the men as in a maelstrom , and , if it sharpens and invigorates some of their powers , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are free from these disadvantages . Many of them have abundant leisure and opportunities of culture better than the best within the reach of men on this continent forty years ago . Their sex is itself a power if they use it rightly . They can , if they will , create and maintain higher standards of thought and purpose , raise the whole tone of national life , and give our civilization the fullness that it lacks ; for , if they raise themselves , they will infallibly raise the men with them . But they will not do it by frothy declamation on platforms , or flooding the bookstalls with sensation stories , any more than by those other trivialities which professional female reformers denounce . Nor will they do it by trying to forget that they are women . There is a strange want of dignity in the attitude of some of these reformers toward the question of the relations of their sex to // society . Instead of claiming for them what is theirs , a nature of their own , with laws of its own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the aim of their ambition , the imitation of men . The position in which they try to place women may be said to answer to that of a colony to its metropolis ; a provincialism which can not disappear till the colony learns the nature of its own worth , and accepts the conditions of its own vitality . Till then , its attitude is a continual admission of inferiority . There is no country in which women enjoy such large and various liberty as with us ; but it would be bold to say that American women , as a whole , are superior to those of other leading nations . In spite of their advantages , a vast proportion of them fall immeasurably short of the influence and consideration that ought to belong to them . We would by no means be understood to intimate that this is a consequence of liberty . It proceeds from a variety of causes , some of which act injuriously on men also ; and foremost among them is an overstrained and morbid activity , an incessant tension of nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peculiar social conditions of a country where all kinds of competition , spurred by all kinds of stimulus , keep mind and body always on the stretch . The men feel them in the struggles of active life ; the women in the ambitions , anxieties , and worries of a social existence , where emulation prevails from the highest to the lowest . And they , as the more susceptible and more easily deranged , suffer more than the men . To reach the best results there must be a harmony and balance between body and mind , which can only come by giving its due exercise to each . In an athlete , who devotes his life to nothing but athletics , the mus*les and sinews thrive at the expense of the mental faculties ; but , in a man or woman whose brain is overwrought , whether by important matters or by trifles , the body suffers without profit to the mind ; for the abused physical nature quickly reacts on the mental , and both are impaired together . Worn as so many of our women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , it is impossible for them to reach that full womanhood than which the world has nothing more beneficent or more noble . In this condition of things , what do certain women demand for the good of their sex ? To add to the excitements that are wasting them other and greater excitements , and to cares too much for their strength othc*r and greater cares . Because they can not do their own work , to require them to add to it the work of men , and // launch them into the turmoil where the most robust sometimes fail . It is much as if a man in a state of nervous exhaustion were told by his physician to enter at once for a foot-race or a boxing-match . This brings us to our object , the consideration of the movement for female suffrage . It has been claimed as a right that women should vote . It is no right , but a wrong , that a small number of women should impose on all the rest political duties which there is no call for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which , if duly discharged , would be a cruel and intolerable burden . This pretense of the female suffragists was reduced to an absurdity when some of them gravely affirmed that , if a single woman wanted to vote , all the others ought to be required to do so . Government by doctrines of abstract right , of which the French Revolution set the example and bore the fruits , involves enormous danger and injustice . No political right is absolute and of universal application . Each has its conditions , qualifications , and limitations . If these are disregarded , one right collides with another , or with many others . Even a man 's right to liberty is subject to the condition that he does not use it to infringe the rights of his neighbors . It is in the concrete , and not in the abstract , that rights prevail in every sound and wholesome society . They are applied where they are applicable . A government of glittering generalities quickly destroys itself . The object of government is the accomplishment of a certain result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of reaching it vary in different countries and different social conditions . Neither liberty nor the suffrage are the end ; they are nothing but means to reach it ; and each should be used to the extent in which it is best adapted to its purpose . If the voting of women conduces to the greatest good of the community , then they ought to vote , and otherwise they ought not . The question of female suffrage thus becomes a practical question , and not one of declamation . High civilization , ancient or modern , has hitherto rested on the family . The family , and not the individual , has been the political unit , and the head of the family , in esse or in posse , actual or prospective , has been the political representative of the rest . To give the suffrage to women would be to reject the principle that has thus far formed the basis of civilized government . It is said , and incessantly repeated , that the influence of women has kept even pace with the growth of civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untrue . In former times , // and under low social conditions , women have occasionally had a degree of power in public affairs unknown in the foremost natior*s of the modern world . The most savage tribe on this continent listened , in solemn assembly , to the counsels of its matrons , with a deference that has no parallel among its civilized successors . The people of ancient Lycia , at a time when they were semi-barbarians , gave such power to their women that they were reported to live under a gynecocracy , or female government . The word gynecocracy , by the way , belongs to antiquity . It has no application in modern life ; and , in the past , its applications were found , not in the higher developments of ancient society , but in the lower . In the splendid civilization of Athens , women held a very subordinate place . In the France of two centuries and more ago , they had a share of political power greater than at any time since , though France had not then mounted to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost mystical in character , has been ascribed to " woman , " which , it is proclaimed , will purify our politics . That , in some relations of life , the instincts of women are preeminently delicate and true ; that in them the moral nature and the better emotions are more apt to rule than in the other sex ; that their conscience is more sensitive , and their religious susceptibilities quicker and more controlling-is , happily , not to be denied ; but they are no whit less human than men . Like them , they have " the defects of their qualities , " and the very delicacy and impressibility of their mental and moral structure give efficacy to these defects . There are circumstances under which they rarely appear to advantage , or avail much for good . There are some means of judging from experience whether they are likely to exert , in public life , the beneficent power ascribed to them . Many countries of Europe have been governed by queens , and this at a time when to wear a crown meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these female reigns ought to have shown more virtuous and benign government than is generally found under the rule of men . The facts do not answer to the expectation . Isabella of Castile was full of amiable qualities , but she permitted herself to be made the instrument of diabolical religious persecution . Catharine II . of Russia was one of the ablest women who ever held a scepter , and one of the most profligate . Maria Theresa of Austria was in many respects far above the common level ; but she was a sharer in what has been called the greatest of political crimes  --  the partition of Poland . That outrage // was the work of three accomplices , two women and a man-the Empress of Russia , the Archduchess of Austria , and the King of Prussia . The reign of Henry IV . of France was one of the most beneficent in history . His first queen was a profligate and his second a virago , gravely suspected of having procured his assassination in collusion with her lover . The last wife of Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dragonnades , and called her brother to share the spoils of those atrocious persecutions . A throng of matchless statesmen , soldiers , philosophers , and poets made the reign of Elizabeth of England brilliant and great . It was adorned by the high and courageous spirit of the Queen , and sullied by her meanness , jealousy , and inordinate vanity . Mary of England lives in the memory of her bloody persecutions . Mary of Scotland was the thorn of her kingdom . Her fascinations have outlived three centuries , and so have her tumults of unbridled love and the dark suspicion of crime that rests upon her . The queenmother of Charles IX . of France fomented , if she did not cause , the frightful massacre of St. Bartholomew , and surrounded herself with a band of beautiful and unscrupulous girls , whose charms she used systematically as means of political influence . There have been many bad kings , many indifferent ones , and a few who have earned the gratitude of all time . Many women have worn crowns , but we look among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race . Not that women have less power for good than men . In some circumstances they have more . Their desire of good is often intense ; but this desire has not been best fulfilled in the field of politics . Besides queens , women in less eminent stations have sometimes had great political influence . This was never more true than in France at the middle of the seventeenth century , when the wives and daughters of the high nobility played a remarkable part in the politics of the day . The sagacious and able De Retz , who lived in the midst of these events , and took an important partinthem , had unrivaled opportunities of studying women in their political character . His judgment is that they were very adroit in managing the strings of a party intrigue , but failed on great questions of policy . Two other points are prominent at this time First , the action of these political ladies always had a personal bearing , and turned about some man or men from motives of love , predilection , jealousy , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they used their own charms , or those of other women , as means of // gaining political advantages , and this without scruple , and sometimes without shame . Instead of purifying politics , they corrupted them . Finally  --  and this instance , if it yields an argument to only half the country , yields it to the half that alone has need of it-the women of the South were more ardent for secession and slavery than the men ; and , when the men knew that the cause was lost , their weaker partners refused to yield . Fighting was useless ; but fair lips still cried , " Fight on ! " It was the action of those two very different qualities  --  a woman 's will and a man s resolution . The one can be argued with , and the other can not . The one is subject to reason ; ths other sees nothing but the object on which its heart is set , and strains after it in the teeth of ruin . Not that one does not continually meet women entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; but this intractable element of " a woman 's will " will have to be accounted with whenever the sex enters the lists of active politics . Shakespeare gives a superb illustration of these two qualities , or rather of one of them . An intense desire possesses Lady Macbeth , and masters her whole being . A crown glitters before her eyes , and , as she gazes on it , fear , conscience , loyalty , the sacred law of hospitality , are all forgotten . The vehemence of her longing bears her on like a fate . Her husband hesitates , divided between duty and ambition . She taunts him with fear , and his admirable an-swer " I dare do all that may become a man ; Who dares do more is none " is wholly lost upon her . He yields ; the deed is done , and the prize seized . Then come the avenging furies . She pines and dies under the tortures of the mind , while the sterner nature lives on , to perish at last by the sword , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetuous property of feminine nature , no doubt , may have its use at times . When a people is afflicted by some overwhelming evil , to be thrown off at any risk or sacrifice , then a oneidea vehemence of attack is not out of place . Such modes of attack are not confined to women . Ardent philanthropic reformers have commonly shown feminine characteristics , and assumed corresponding attitudes toward the objects of their zeal . But , useful as men of this stamp are in exceptional emergencies of a certain kind , the // habitual reformer is generally a nuisance when he tries to deal with the broad and many-sided questions involved in the government of nations . These demand qualities widely different from his ; and , as the foundation of them all , the essentially masculine one of justice . One of the chief dangers of popular government is that of inconsiderate and rash legislation . In impatience to be rid of one evil , ulterior consequences are apt to be forgotten . In the haste to redress one wrong , a door may be opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most impulsive and excitable half of humanity had an equal voice in the making of laws . And , in the administration of them , abstract right would then be made to prevail after a fashion somewhat startling . A lady of intelligence and admirable intentions , an ardent partisan on principles of pure humanitarianism , confessed that , in the last Presidential election , Florida had given a majority for the Democrats ; but insisted that it was right to count it for Hayes , because other States had been counted wrongfully for Tilden . It was impossible to make her comprehend that government conducted on such principles would end in anarchy . In politics , the virtues of women would sometimes be as dangerous as their faults . But it is not their virtues that we should see in the dust and scramble of the political arena . As , when white sand is mingled with black , the black is drawn to the magnet and the white is left behind , so the coarse and contentious among women would be drawn to politics by a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scruples would remain in more congenial climates , and the law of natural selection would rule in all its force . The great majority of the sex would employ themselves in the duties which must be discharged so long as the world goes on , and distract themselves as little as might be with primary meetings , canvasses , conventions , and election campaigns . It has been said , and too truly , that the best men shun politics . Their endless complication , the innumerable wires that guide their machinery , and the dexterity required to work it , give to the practiced trickster who has made them his trade an advantage over far abler men who have not . The system of spoils draws hungry and rapacious crowds to choke incessantly the highways and by-ways of the public service , and the brevity and uncertainity of the tenure of office make it certain that those most fit for it will least care to accept it . If these and other causes have deterred the best men from taking // part in active politics , they would deter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one would be incomparably more so to the other . If politics are to be purified by artfulness , effrontery , insensibility , a pushing self-assertion , and a glib tongue , then we may look for regeneration ; for the typical female politician will be richly endowed with all these gifts . Thus accoutered for the conflict , he may fairly hope to have the better of her masculine antagonist . A woman has the inalienable right of attacking without being attacked in turn . She may strike but must not be struck , either literally or figuratively . Most women refraiii from abusing their privilege of non-combatants ; but there are those in whom the sense of impunity breeds the cowardly courage of the virago , and makes the tongue more terrible than the sword . A man 's tongue is strong only as the organ of reason or eloquence ; but a woman*s is a power in itself . During some angry party debate , the future House of Representatives will present an animated scene when , in or out of order , the female members take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians , there is one which can by no means be left out . None know better than women the potency of feminine charms aided by feminine arts . The woman " inside polities " will not fail to make use of an influence so subtile and strong , and of which the management is peculiarly suited to her talents . If  --  and the contingency is in the highest degree probable-she is not gifted with charms of her own , she will have no difficulty in finding and using others of her sex who are . If report is to be trusted , Delilah has already spread her snares for the Congressional Samson ; and the power before which the wise fail and the mighty fall has been invoked against the sages and heroes of the Capitol . When " woman " is fairly " inside politics , " the sensation press will reap a harvest of scandals more lucrative to itself than profitable to public morals . And , as the zeal of one class of female reformers has been , and no doubt will be , largely directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shrill-tongued discussions of subjects which had far better be let alone . It may be said that the advocates of female suffrage do not look to political women for the purifying of politics , but to the votes of the sex at large . The two , however , can not be separated . It should be remembered that the question is not of a limited and select female suffrage , but of a universal one . To limit would be impossible . It would seek the broadest areas and the lowest depths , and spread itself through the marshes and malarious pools of soci // ety . Those instincts that dart to their goal while the reason of man gropes and wanders ; that love of the good and the beautiful which is to soothe the raging waters , and guide their currents in ways of peace and right-these belong to the chosen of their sex alone ; and , even in them , it may be doubted whether they would find profitable exercise in American politics . Faith is indispensable to all achievement ; but it must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut . If it does , it will lead not to success , but to disaster . Now , the most ardent faith , if joined with common sense and the faintest knowledge of human nature , will fail to discern in the great mass of the female sex any promise of purer and wiser government . Women , as a whole , have less sense of political responsibility than men . For this there are various reasons , but one will suffice . They have shared very imperfectly in the traditions , and not at all in the practice of self-government . The men of free countries have been trained to a sense of political responsibility by long striving for political rights , the memory of which has acted as a continual education , special to one sex because the other has had neither the will nor the opportunity to share it . By slow progress in the acquisition of these rights , they have acquired a consciousness of their value , some knowledge of the conditions on which they rest , and the skill to use them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are large numbers of men who have not received this training , have never learned the art of self-government , and can not share in it without injury and danger to the state . Women as a whole may be said to be in the condition of persons devoid of this training , and of the sense of political responsibility that grows out of it , excepting a minority composed of the more thoughtful , who have acquired it by education , conscientiousness , and association with the better sort of men . But the vast majority have little or none of it ; and hence , if they are to be admitted at all to a share in public affairs , they should be admitted very gradually . We say nothing here of those differences of nature that have hitherto in all ages , countries , and races , made men the governing half of the race . What we urge is , that now and for generations to come , woman as a whole must of necessity come into politics far less prepared for them than men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprepared to vote . The unprepared women are incomparably more numerous , and in many of them the want of preparatiou is complete and absolute . This is the condition of nearly all those in the lower strata of society . We shall of // course be told that they must go into the water before they cau learn to swim ; but what is proposed is not to teach them to swim : it is to throw them all at once into a fathomless ocean , where they will drown themselves , and pull down those who were swimming there , or trying to swim before them . A French statesman once said that , against a mob of women , the Government is entirely helpless . There are no means of repression . Bullets , bayonets , sabers , and grapeshot are out of the question . And yet , in the French Revolution , female mobs were fiercer and more destructive than those of men . To give women the suffrage is to expose the most excitable part of the human race to the influence of political passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of legislators coerced by a female mob would be in a position as pitiable as ridiculous . There are those who think that the suffrage would act as a safety-valve to political passions ; but it has not so acted in the case of men . Dissatisfied masses , foiled of their purpose at the polls , are more apt to resort to force than if they had not already tried lawful means without success . The bloody riots of 1877 were the work of men in full enjoyment of the suffrage . It is to the dread of lead and steel that the friends of order must look in the last resort ; and , when this does not exist , political frenzy will have its way . If the better class of women flatter themselves that they can control the others , they are doomed to disappointment . They will be outvoted in their own kitchens , without reckoning the agglomerations of poverty , ineptitude , and vice that form a startling proportion of our city populations . It is here that the male vote alone threatens our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormously increase the evil , for it is often more numerous , always more impulsive , and less subject to reason ; and , through causes which we gave above , almost devoid of the sense of responsibility . Here the bad politician would find his richest resources . He could not reach the better class of female voters , but the rest would be ready to his hand . Many women will sell themselves ; many more would sell their votes . Three fourths of them , when not urged by some pressing need or contagious passion , would be moved , not by principles , but by personal predilections . These , even with the best of their sex , do not always lean to the soundest and most stable wisdom , either for public or private life . We deprecate any interpretation of disrespect . We have known a gracious and noble example of cultured womanhood who could by no means voi*. cxxix. - No. 275. 22 // be persuaded that one of the worst of our politicians , reputed also one of the most agreeable , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him her vote , if she had had one to give . The female cohorts of crowded cities would espouse the cause of their favorites with a vehemence unknown to men ; but it would be fatuity to believe that they would choose them in the interest of good government . We say nothing of the outcasts of society ; though they , too ; would have their watchword and their chief . The evils of universal female , as of universal male suffrage , would be greatest in dense industrial populations . In the country , they would be less felt , and least of all in the rough and simple life of the thinly-settled borders , or the far West . Like other political evils , they would reach their climax in great cities . The government of these is difficult enough already . To make it impossible would be madness . If it is urged that tax-paying women ought to vote in virtue of their tax-paying , it should be remembered that men have no such right . With us , the beggar and the millionaire vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not granted to the poor ; or , in other words , property is not acknowledged as a basis of representation . It is taxed , not because it confers a franchise , but because the Government protects or is presumed to protect it . The same measure of protection is given to the property of a woman as to that of a man . If female tax-payers were allowed to vote , one of two things would happen : a principle of government which was repudiated in the interest of democracy would be restored in the interest of wealth ; or else all women , rich or poor , would receive the franchise together . The first alternative is hardly possible ; under the second , the female property-holder would have her own vote to defend her property along with several needy female votes to imperil it ; for the poor women outnumber the rich . Those who wish the Roman Catholic Church to subvert our school system , control legislation , and become a mighty political force , can not do better than labor day and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is opposed to every principle and tradition of that great Church , which , nevertheless , would reap from it immense benefits . The priests have little influence over a considerable part of their male flock ; but their power is great over the women , who would repair to the polis at the word of command with edifying docility and zeal . // The right of voting and the duty of fighting should never be divorced . Women , though non-combatant , are abundantly combative when excited . It is conceivable that they might discover a cctsus belli when the men could not see it ; and , with or without the help of sympathizing male zealots , might vote in majority that the men should fight . This they would probably refuse to do against their wishes and convictions , and the women , with law clearly on their side , could not help themselves . Law with no power to enforce it is futile and sometimes ridiculous . The above contingency is not likely to occur ; but that it is simply possible shows the false position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the States , nor the united voice of the whole people could permanently change the essential relations of the sexes . Universal female suffrage , even if decreed , would undo itself in time ; but the attempt to establish it would work deplorable mischief . The question is , whether the persistency of a few agitators shall plunge us blindfold into the most reckless of all experiments ; whether we shall adopt this supreme device for developing the defects of women , and demolish their real power to build an ugly mockery instead . For the sake of womanhood , let us hope not . In spite of the effect on the popular mind of the incessant repetition of a few trite fallacies , and in spite of the squeamishness that prevents the vast majority averse to the movement from uttering a word against it , let us trust that the good sense of the American people will vindicate itself against this most unnatural and pestilent revolution . In the full and normal development of womanhood lie the best interests of the world . Let us labor earnestly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain , let us save women from the barren perturbations of American politics . Let us respect them , and , that we may do so , let us pray for deliverance from female suffrage . FRANcIs PAIIKMAX.
