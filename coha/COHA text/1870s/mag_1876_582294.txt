WILSON , THE ORNITHOLOGIST . VERY few of the men whose force of character has raised them from obscurity to eminence have had to make their way by the aid of slenderer qualifications , or in the face of more insuperable obstacles , than were the lot of the pioneer of American ornithology . Born at Paisley , in the West of Scotland , in 1766 , a younger child of a poor distiller , Alexander Wilson had little education beyond that afforded by the indifferent local school . When he was not yet ten years old he lost his mother , and the introduction of a stepmother into the household led to his removal to the neighboring home of his eldest sister as an apprentice to her husband , William Duncan , a weaver . Thus , at the age of twelve or thirteen , he left school to learn a means of livelihood , which , in more than one emergency of his after-life , stood him in excellent stead . Through three years of apprenticeship , and four others , during which he worked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaving , though hating it with a cordiality to which he gave utterance in a poem entitled " Groans from the Loom . " Throughout this period he addicted himself to those efforts in patriotic verse-making which the success of Burns had made universal among the young Scots of that day . Encouraged by the flattery of his townsmen to devote himself to literature , he determined , when he had reached the age of eighteen , to fly the imprisonment of the loom and gratify his longing for freedom and rural scenes by taking up the calling of a peddler . So far as regarded the enjoyment of nature in the wildness and beauty of Scottish scenery , his enterprise was successful . " These are pleasures , " he rhapsodizes in his journal of this time , " which the groveling sons of interest and the grubs of this world know as little of as the miserable spirits doomed to everlasting darkness know of the glorious regions and eternal delights of Paradise . " But , as might be expected , no very large gains were in store for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by interest in scenes notable for their own romantic beauty or their associations with poets and heroes of tradition . Two successive peddling trips , during which he vainly sought subscribers for his intended publication , left him empty of pocket , but unshaken in resolve . So , in July , 1790 , fallaciously trusting to their sale to indemnify his printer , he published his " Poems , Humorous , Satirical , and Serious , " - poems of such quality that his admirers have been content to let them sink out of sight , while the poet in after days resented mention of them . In his mortification at his failure , Wilson left his own town and resumed weaving and solitary study in the seclusion of a neighboring village . From this retirement he was presently enticed by the intelligence that a debating society in Edinburgh was about to discuss the question whether Robert Ferguson or Allan Ramsay had most honored Scottish poetry . He had never read Ferguson 's poems , and but a few days remained before that fixed for the debate ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own mind , embodied the result in a poem , did enough over-work at weaving to provide means for the journey , and walked to Edinburgh , where he arrived just in time to take his part in the contest . In the poem which he recited ,  --  " The Laurel Disputed , or the Merits of Robert Ferguson and Allan Ramsay Contrasted , " - Wilson espoused the losing side , that of // Ferguson ; but his production gained him the applause which he craved , as well as opportunities for publicly reciting two others of his poems before leaving the capital . These successes , together with the acquaintanceships thus procured with Edinburgh men of letters , and especially with Burns , led him into periodical writing and a meddling with politics that involved him in serious troubles . He had long been infected by that enthusiasm for liberty and reform which filled the minds of men during the earlier days of the French Revolution and when the storm broke , and the manufacturing interests of Great Britain began to be deranged , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the distresses which fell with peculiar severity upon the artisans of Paisley . In that industrial center , upon the decline of business , there had grown up a bitter feud between the weavers and the capitalists and manufacturers , and among the latter was one who had risen from a low origin to great wealth and influence by dint , it was currently believed , of a long course of avarice and extortion . Upon this obnoxious individual , Wilson , as champion of the weavers , proceeded to wreak vengeance in a galling satire , " The Shark , or Long Mills Detected , " in which he exhausted the fertility of the Scottish dialect in epithets of reproach . The artisans were delighted , and the victim proportionately incensed by the severity of this lampoon , which circulated largely , and was generally attributed to Wilson , though evidences of the authorship had been sedulously concealed . He was , however , waylaid by spies as he returned by night from the printer 's ; papers were found upon him which established his offense ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sentenced to undergo a short imprisonment , and with his own hand to burn the libel at the town cross of Paisley-a sentence which he fulfilled on February 6 , 1793 , surrounded by enthusiastic crowds of his townsmen , who regarded him as a martyr in their cause . This incident , probably , together with the suspicion with which he was thenceforth regarded by those in authority , his own discontent at the oppressions he saw going on about him , and his experience of the small hope of bettering his condition in his own land , led him to dream of seeking political and pecuniary independence beyond the Atlantic . Learning from a newspaper that on the ist of May in the following year an American ship would sail from Belfast with passengers for Phila delphia , he confidentially enlisted hisnephew , William Duncan , a boy of sixteen , as the companion of his voyage . He formed the plan of qualifying himself for mercantile employment in America by attending the school of a friend-an attempt which he abandoned after one day 's experiment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an economy so rigid , that for four months his expenses of every kind were less than a shilling a week ; and , at the appointed time , he bade adieu to the friends and scenes he was never to revisit . The two emigrants set out on foot for Port Patrick , and sailed thence for Belfast , which they reached at so late a day that the ship had already her full complement of passengers ; but they elected rather to sleep on the deck during the whole voyage than to turn back ; and on the *4th of July , 1794 , they arrived at New Castle , Delaware . Wilson 's impatience to set foot on the promised land was such that he chose to disembark at New Castle and proceed thence on foot to Philadelphia , a distance of thirtythree miles . He began life in the New World without a friend to whose hospitality he could appeal , or of whom he could seek advice how to find employment ; he had not even a letter of introduction ; and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few shillings from a fellow passenger . His first walk was marked by an incident which after events made noteworthy . As he advanced , gun in hand , the pedestrian had scarcely entered the Delaware forests before his attention was arrested by the strange birds , especially by one , whose rich plumage and active habits make it perhaps the most attractive inhabitant of our northern woods , the red-headed woodpecker . This he shot , and years after dwelt with fervor upon his sensations at finding himself possessor of " the most beautiful bird he had ever beheld , "  --  a judgment which the glowing hues that represent it in the plates of his " Ornithology " fully justify . Arrived in the city , his want of means made it imperatively necessary for him to find immediate occupation ; and he applied , with success , to a countryman , a copper-plate printer , who provided him with work for some weeks until he formed a more permanent engagement at his own trade of weaving with a Mr. Joshua Sullivan , a few miles out of Philadelphia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loom , and persuaded by representations of the // excellent field Virginia offered to colonists , he made his way on foot to Sheppardstown , in the part of the State then known as New Virginia ,  --  a locality in which his ideal of Virginia life was so thoroughly dispelled , that he turned back to Sullivan and weaving , with a maledictory tribute to Virginia , whose felicities of meter , syntax , and rhetoric go far to explain the habitual miscarriage of his muse : " Farewell to Virginia , to Berkeley adieu , Where , like Jacob , our days have been evil and few ! So few-they seemed really but one lengthened curse ; And so bad-that the devil only could have sent worse . " One more season of perfunctory application to the loom was followed by another peddler 's excursion ; this time , through the northern parts of New Jersey , in which Wilson spent the autumn of 1795 , finding not merely success in the way of trade , but leisure to commit to his journal some shrewd observations on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the natural productions of the region , and of its birds and quadrupeds , that foreshadow the great talent for this kind of description he was ultimately to develop . His tour in New Jersey seems at least to have effaced the impressions of his Virginia experience , since , at this time , he sent home hopeful reports of the country of his adoption , though , if we are to credit the charitable view of his Scottish biographer , " he did this on the principle of the fox who had lost his tail . " Driven from out-of-door employment by the approach of winter , Wilson , now thirty years of age , entered upon what may be considered the second stage of his life and the time of preparation for his life-work , by becoming the master of a village school . At first , he taught near the town of Frankford , which has since become , through the growth of Philadelphia , one of the northern suburbs of that city ; then , finding a better situation at Milestown , Pa. , he remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , at once to qualify himself for the instruction of his pupils and to remedy those defects in his own early education of which he was painfully sensible . Among the studies to which he applied himself with most zeal was that of mathematics , at which he soon obtained sufficient practical knowledge to make him the recognized surveyor of the neighborhood , while he in time acquired a considerable proficiency in mathematical sci ence . But scarcely had Wilson thus become settled to a definite pursuit , when he was called upon to meet a constant and exhaustive drain upon his slender resources . Poverty and misfortune had come upon that sister with whose husband he had learned weaving ; and she had been driven , with her family of small children , to follow her brother and son across the sea . To provide her with an asylum , Wilson had procured a loan from his employer , Sullivan , and had joined William Duncan in the purchase of a farm near the town of Ovid , in Cayuga County , N. Y. , and for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was even forestalled , in remittances for the relief of his kindred . But all his sacrifices constitute a less impressive evidence of the man 's generosity and worth , than the courage with which he sought to inspirit his nephews at times when he was himself almost borne down by penury , and by the despondency to which he was constitutionally prone . To William Duncan , the oldest of his nephews , and whom he treats as the head of the colony , he writes in deprecation of their discouragement with farming and plan of relinquishing the farm to seek employment at their trade : " Were my strength but equal to my spirit , I would abandon my school for ever for such an employment . * * * In the month of March next , I shall , if well , be able to command two hundred dollars cash once more . Nothing stands between me and this but health , and that I hope will continue at least till then . * * * I shall keep nightschool this winter , and retain every farthing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger nephew , Alexander Duncan , who appears still more disposed than his brother to break away from farm labor , Wilson addresses similar encouragement . " I have laughed on every perusal of your letter , " he writes ; " I have now deciphered the whole , except the blots ; but I fancy they are only by the way of half mourning for your doleful captivity in the backwoods , where there is nothing but wheat and butter , eggs and gammon , for hagging down trees . Deplorable ! what must be done ? * * * A farm of such land , in good cultivation , is highly valuable ; it will repay*all the labor bestowed upon it a hundred-fold , and contains within it all the powers of plenty and independence . These it only requires industry to bring forth , and a small stock of money to begin with . The money I doubt not of being // able to procure next summer , for a year or two , on interest , in dependent of two hundred dollars of my own , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March next . " Yet , at the time when , in the goodness of his heart , he was writing in this almost jovial strain to those whom his fraternal affection had made his dependents , Wilson himself was in such a state of depression at the little hope of advancement a teacher 's life afforded , and from the deprivations to which he subjected himself in order to increase his savings , that his friends about him were in dread lest his mental health should give way . While these burdens were weighing upon him , Wilson had moved from his school at Milestown to one in the village of Bloomfield , N. J. Here , however , he learned that a more agreeable situation might be had in the Union School of Kingsessing , near Gray 's Ferry , on the Schuylkill River , and but a short distance out of Philadelphia . He solicited an engagement from the trustees , and obtained it ; and thus , in 1802 , he took the step which fixed his residence thenceforth in the same region that had already inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought him under influences that shaped his own future labors . Among Wilson 's neighbors at Gray 's Ferry , were two , whom congeniality of tastes soon transformed into his intimate friends and life-long allies and counselors-Alexander Lawson , an eminent engraver , and William Bartram , whose whole life had been that of a naturalist , and who , until the advent of Wilson , had probably a larger acquaintance with birds than any other person on the continent . The latter was the son of that John Bartram whom Linnieus had pronounced " the greatest self-taught botanist in the world ; " he had inherited his father 's tastes and his collections , together with hi* celebrated Botanic Garden , on the western bank of the Schuylkill , and within easy reach of Wilson 's school and lodgings . Under the guidance of this friend , who took unaffected pleasure in directing a mind in such perfect sympathy with his own , our schoolmaster now-now , at last , when but ten years of life remained to him-entered upon the study of subjects which he had always regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly destitute of scientific knowledge . Bartram 's library was limited in the department of Ornithology , containing little beyond the works of Catesby and Edwards ; * but Wilson studied these attentively , and soon found that even the casual observation which he had given to the habits of birds enabled him to detect manifold errors and absurdities to which his authors had been content to give currency upon merely hearsay evidence . To one of his disposition it was inevitable that this discovery should suggest the idea of observing and correcting for himself  --  a design which Bartram both encouraged and assisted in ; so that it is probable that the very lack of elementary books , by driving him to field-study , instead of tempting him to labors , in the closet , was , on the whole , in Wilson 's favor , notwithstanding the drawbacks under which he labored , by reason of his small scientific knowledge . While he was thus taking his first steps as a naturalist , a wholly independent train of circumstances drew Wilson into the acquisition of another equally essential qualification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty and the burdens of his sister 's family , he began to betray the effects of confinement in the close air 01 his school , and of the nervous worry of its wearisome routine , and labored under such constant dejection of spirit as seems to have alarmed his neighbor Lawson for his health , if not for his reason . Very judiciously , this friend counseled him to abjure poetry and the flute ,  --  with which , on the plea of solacing his gloom , he was wont to intensify it ,  --  and in their stead to take up an amusement which must give new direction to his thoughts , that of drawing . Wilson assented , and set himself with diligence to the copying of the landscapes and figures with which his artist-friend provided him , but with such poor success that he was on the point of giving up in despair , when Bartram , in a happy moment , bethought him of suggesting a trial at the delineation of birds , and offered copies from the portfolio his own skillful hand had filled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson and of his friends , and had a fascination , especially after he began drawing from the life , * " The library of Wilson occupied but a small space . On casting my eyes , after his decease , over the ten or a dozen volumes of which it was composed , I was grieved to find that he had been the owner of only one work on Ornithology , and that was Bewick 's British Birds . ' For the use of the first volume of Turton 's Linna*us , ' he was indebted to the friendship of Mr. Thomas Say ; the Philadelphia Library supplied him with Latham. ' " - Ord 's " L*/e of Wilson . " // which kept him working at his desk by candle-light through the hours he had been used to spend in social relaxation . One of his letters at this time to Bartram , written in March , 1804 , reveals the extent of one of the difficulties he had to contend with in pursuing the task upon which he had already unconsciously entered : " Be pleased , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings , with a pencil , the names of each bird , as , except three or four , I do not know them . " Undaunted , however , by his ignorance , he had already conceived the plan of making a complete collection of the birds of the surrounding region ; for , as he proceeded with these recreations in natural history , he perceived the expediency of limiting his inquiries to the subject of ornithology , and there gradually dawned upon him a desire to interest his fellow-citizens in a study which seemed to him inexplicably neglected . After long pondering and much examination of the strength of his mind and his resources , he at last ventured upon stating his plan to his two friends . Bartram had no doubt of the abilities and perseverance of his pupil , but dreaded lest his zeal - should lead him into embarrassments from which he could not be extricated , and accordingly he dwelt upon the lack of mechanical resources in this country for the production of such a work as Wilson proposed , and of adequate patronage when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detailed the difficulties which his professional experience enabled him to foresee must beset the enterprise - objections which Wilson , in his ardor , pronounced " the offspring of a cold , calculating , selfish philosophy . " He seems at once to have adhered to his scheme , and to have dreaded his friends ' alienation through his disregard of their advice , for , on March 12 , 1804 , he wrote to Lawson : " I dare say you begin to think me very ungenerous and unfriendly in not seeing you for so long a time . * * Six days in one week I have no more time than just to swallow my meals , and to return to my sanctum sanctorum . Five days of the following week are occupied in the same routine of *edagoguing matters ; and the other two are sacrificed to that itch for drawing which I caught from your honorable self . * * I am most earnestly bent on pursuing my plan of making a collection of all the birds in this part of North America . Now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare says , on this notion , Quixotic as it may appear . " Nevertheless , in sending some of his draw . ings of birds for Bartram 's criticism , a month later , he says : " These are the last I shall draw for some time , as the employment consumes every leisure moment , leaving nothing for friendship or those rural recreations which I so much delight in . " This resolve , apparently , was in consequence of a determination to emancipate himself , if possible , from the bondage of the school by the use of his pen . Poetical contributions of his begin from this time to appear in Charles Brockden Brown 's " Literary Magazine " ; but he received for them no more substantial return than the thanks of the publisher and some gratifying laudations ; and he apparently persisted from the hope-which , indeed , seems ultimately to have been justified-that the reputation thus to be acquired might lead to some such advancement as should facilitate the production of the work he was already brooding upon . In the autumn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strength for the fatigues his project must involve , by setting out , with two companions , upon a pedestrian excursion to the Falls of Niagara . With the Falls and the surrounding country he was enraptured ; but the pilgrimage had not been commenced until October , altogether too late in the season for wanderings through so desolate a region as that they traversed , and winter overtook them in the Genesee country , obliging them to make their way through snow nearly mid-leg deep . One of the party , William Duncan , fell off at Cayuga Lake , remaining among his friends ; Wilson 's remaining companion , after dragging himself in the track of his leader , through snow and mud , until he was completely worn out , took to a boat descending the Mohawk River , soon after they had passed Utica ; so that the persevering tourist was left to trudge alone , gun and baggage on his back , to Schenectady , whence , rejoined b* his companion , he proceeded by stage to Albany , and by schooner to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter recounting to Duncan the conclusion of the trip , " were now reduced to legs and upper leathers ; and my pantaloons in a sad plight . Twelve dollars were expended - on these two articles . * * On Friday , the 7th December , I reached Gray 's Ferry , having walked forty-seven miles that day . I was absent two months on this journey , and I traversed in that time upward of twelve hundred miles . The evening of my arrival I went to L *** h 's , whose wife had // got twins , a boy and a girl . The boy was called after me ; this honor took six dollars more from me . After paying for a cord of wood , I was left with only three quarters of a dollar . " Yet , nothing daunted either by this foretaste of the labors he was proposing to himself , or by the imminence of financial collapse , he had scarcely settled himself at home before he was projecting new wanderings . Just a week after his return , he writes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commence some more extensive expedition , where scenes and subjects entirely new , and generally unknown , might reward my curiosity ; and when perhaps my humble acquisitions might add something to the stores of knowledge . * * J have at present a real design of becoming a traveler . But , " he goes on , with a confession which is almost pathetic , " I am miserably deficient in many acquirements absolutely necessary for such a character . Botany , mineralogy , and drawing , I most ardently wish to be instructed in , and with these I should fear nothing . Can I yet make any progress in botany , sufficient to enable me to be useful , and what would be the most proper way to proceed ? " Preliminary to any new excursions was the necessity of replenishing his wasted exchequer through the irksome instrumentality of the school . But the school had now become at best a precarious dependence . The winter of 18o4- ' 5 was an extraordinarily severe one , and the suffering and want throughout the country were so universal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his first letter to William Duncan , after his return , Wilson wrote : " This quarter will do little more than defray my board and fire-wood . Comfortable intelligence truly , methinks I hear you say ; but no mattem " Toward the close of March , he reverts to the subject : " I told you in my last of the thinness of my school : it produced in the last quarter only twenty-six scholars ; and the sum of fifteen dollars was all the money I could raise from them at the end of the term . I immediately called the trustees together , and , stating the affair to them , proposed giving up the school . Two of them on the spot offered to subscribe between them one hundred dollars a year , rather than permit me to go ; and it was agreed to call a meeting of the people ; the result was honorable to me , for forty-eight scholars were instantly subscribed for ; so that the ensuing six months my school will be worth pretty near two hundred dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an income of less than four hundred dollars a year , would be melancholy enough ; but it must further be remembered that during all this time the support of the Duncan family hung like an incubus upon him . In May of this same year , in writing to William Duncan concerning a proposed sale of the farm and the obligations he had incurred on account of it , he observes : " I am living a mere hermit , not spending one farthing , to see if I can possibly reimburse * * * * , who I can see is not so courteous and affable as formerly . I hope to be able to pay him one hundred dollars , with interest , next October , and the remainder in the spring ; we shall then be clear of the world ; and I do n't care how many privations I suffer to effect that . " Meanwhile Wilson had not lost sight of his design to make his name known in literature . After his return from Niagara , except for drawings of two birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he appears to have devoted all his leisure hours for many weeks to the composition of " The Foresters , " a poem descriptive of his recent tour , which grew to a length of two thousand two hundred and eighteen lines , and was published with illustrations on steel in the " Port Folio . " But , as the return of spring brought back the birds , he was absorbed more intently than ever in his ornithological and artistic pursuits . Learning about this time that the plates illustrating Edwards 's work on natural history had been etched by the hand of its author , Wilson examined them carefully and remained persuaded that , with some instruction and practice in etching , he could produce figures more accurate in their delineation and greatly superior in spirit and life . At once he applied for Lawson 's assistance , provided himself with copper , and took his first lesson under the supervision of the engraver . On the very next day the latter , according to his own story , was astounded by his pupil 's " bouncing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my plate ! Let us bite it in with aquafortis at once , for I must have a proof before I leave town . " The prints did not equal his expectations ; and , after completing a second plate , which was finished about the close of the year , he was reluctantly convinced that nothing but the accuracy of the graver could give his illustrations the elegance he desired. * Of the art of * These two plates , the only ones which Wilson himself executed , stand at the commencement of the illustrations of the " Ornithology. " // engraving he knew nothing , and its acquisition was too laborious an undertaking for even Wilson 's enthusiasm , while the means of paying for the illustrations of a single volume on the scale he designed were wholly beyond his reach . In this emergency , and as the only solution of his dilemma , he proposed to Lawson to unite with him in the production of the work as a joint undertaking ; but the latter could not in prudence see his way to assume the risk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared his intention to go on with the publication alone . " I shall , at least , " he said , " leave a small beacon to point out where I perished . " He began , accordingly , early in i8o6 , to plan for the journeys necessary to complete his researches , when he learned through the newspapers that President Jefferson purposed fitting out expeditions during the ensuing summer for the scientific exploration of the tributaries of the Mississippi . Bartram 's relations with Jefferson , as a correspondent of many years ' standing , and his own recent self-introduction in the affair of the bird-pictures , might serve , he thought , to bring about his employment upon one of these surveying parties ; so , early in February , seconded by Bartram 's attestation of his capacity and acquirements , he addressed an application to the President , stating the nature of his own design , and requesting his attachment to any of the exploring parties . For some reason which has never been explained , Jefferson took no notice of this application , a circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of republics to science , and which Wilson , with more justice , treats as a great " unpoliteness " on the part of the President , adding that " no hurry of business could excuse it . " As weeks passed without bringing him a response , Wilson seems to have yielded so far to this disappointment and to the exigencies of the Duncans , as to have given up his trip for this year . At the end of February he writes to William Duncan : " If I should not be engaged by Mr. Jefferson , a journey by myself and at my own expense , at a time , too , when we are just getting our heads above water , as one may say , would not be altogether good policy . Perhaps in another year we might be able , without so much injury , to make a tour together through part of the South-west countries , which would double all the pleasures of the journey to me . I will proceed in the affair as you may think best , notwithstanding my eager wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this darkest hour of his fortunes , when the future seemed to have nothing in store for him , an opening presented itself for the accomplishment of all his ambitions . A Philadelphia bookseller , Samuel F. Bradford , who was about bringing out a new edition of " Rees 's Cyclopedia , " heard of Wilson as a person qualified to superintend the work , and engaged his services at what the half-paid*school-master considered " a generous salary , " the articles of agreement being dated April 20 , i8o6 . The arrangement proved mutually satisfactory , and it was not long before Wilson had laid the plan of his projected " Ornithology " before his employer , who promptly agreed to become its publisher and to provide the cost of its production . For a year Wilson now labored with an assiduity that filled him with pity for himself , " immured among dusty books , " as he wrote to Bartram , " and compelled to forego the harmony of the woods for the everlasting din of the city . " As the result of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1807 , that his drawings were already in the hands of Lawson , who was just on the point of completing his first plate , and that the prospectus of the work was in the press , and would be circulated through the newspapers and by agents " in every town in the Union . " In September , i8o8 , the first volume was published . Thus , after forty-two years of privation and struggle , our indomitable naturalist was rewarded with the first tangible evidence of success in the work to which he had dedicated his life  --  a life to which only forty-seven years were- allotted . Almost the moment the hook was published-on September 21st , 8o8-Wilson writes from Philadelphia to Bartram : " In a few minutes I set out for the Eastern States , through Boston to Maine , and back through the State of Vermont , in search of birds and subscribers . " Very much in the manner of the poetico-peddling excursions through Scotland years before , he now voyaged eastwardly , purposing to visit each town of importance along his route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of submitting his book to the " reverend doctors of the college , " of whom Dr. Smith , the President , and Dr. McLean , Professor of Natural History ; were the only members of the Faculty he found at home . They received him with hospitality and // great interest , and-as , indeed , did all who inspected the work , or as one must do even now who turns for the first time the pages of the original edition-professed amazement that a work so elegant in every detail could have come from an American press . The Princeton Professor of Natural History , on his part , had a surprise in store for Wi-son . " I expected , " the latter wrote , " to ? dceive some valuable information from McLean on the ornithology of the country , but I soon found , to my astonishment , that he scarcely knew a sparrow from a woodpecker , At his particular request I left a specimen of the plates with him , and from what passed between us I have hopes that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has hitherto done . " This first indication of the lack of intelligent appreciation for his labors , even among the presumably learned , was to be succeeded by abounding evidences of the worse than Bceotian impenetrability of the popular mind upon a subject whose practical utility was not obvious ; and our naturalist was not long in discovering that he must create the very taste upon which the encouragement of his labors depended. * * To this exigency , doubtless , is to be attributed the pains which Wilson is at , throughout his work , to enlist the interest of the public in the birds themselves and the study of their habits . He argues , for instance , that many which are really men 's benefactors have been most basely requited , and that legislative bounty has even been offered for the extermination of species which , when it had become too late , the farmers would gladly have recalled . To VOL . XI. - 45 . ALEXANDER WILSON . // From Princeton he proceeded by way of New Brunswick , Elizabeth , and Newark , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , " the most extravagant compliments , which I would have very willingly exchanged for a few simple subscrzjp/ions . " In New York , as elsewhere , Wilson found more admirers than patrons , the latter including Tom Paine , the author of " The Rights of Man , " already moribund and living in seclusion . " I spent the whole of this week , " he wrote , " traversing the streets , from one particular house to another , till , I believe , I became almost as well known as the public crier or the clerk of the market , for I could frequently perceive gentlemen point me out to others as I passed with my book under my arm . " From here he went by schooner to New Haven , and thence by Middletown , Hartford , Springfield , and Worcester , to Boston , visiting the colleges of Yale and Harvard , and receiving subscriptions from their presidents , as he did afterward from that of Dartmouth . In the general condition of New England he seems to have been miserably disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the " vulgar prejudice " against the woodpecker he returns again and again . He argues that " it is neither from motives of mischief nor amusement that he slices off the bark or digs his way into the trunks ; " that " the sound and healthy tree is not in the least the object of his attention ; " that " the diseased , infested with insects and hastening to putrefaction , are his favorites ; there the deadly crawling enemy have found a lodgment , between the bark and tender wood , to drink up the very vital part of the tree . * And yet , " he concludes , " ignorance and prejudice stubbornly persist in directing their indignation against the bird now before us , the constant and mortal enemy of these very vermin . " The ignorance of the populace was less disgusting to Wilson than that of the naturalists . He protests strenuously against " the abject and degraded character which the Count de Buffon , with equal eloquence and absurdity , has drawn of the whole tribe of woodpeckers ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to his own delineations of them , to dispel the notion that " the whole family of woodpeckers must look sad , sour , and be miserable , to satisfy the caprice of a whimsical philosopher , who takes it into his head that they are and ought to be so . " He is especially exasperated at Buffon 's eternal reference of every species in the new world to one of the old , which , he says , leaves an impression that American katydids are merely European nightingales , degenerated in voice by residence in this country , a theory really advanced by the Count to explain the voicelessness of the woodthrush , which is , in reality , a beautiful singer . Latham also sinned in this affirmation : " Bluebirds are never seen in the trees , though they make their nests in the holes of them ; " to which Wilson added , as a parallel generalization , " the Americans are never seen in the streets , though they build their houses by the sides of them . " paper , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not recollect having seen one hard dollar since I left New York . Bills even of twenty-five cents , of a hundred different banks , whose very names one has never heard of before , are continually in circulation . I say nothing of the jargon which prevails in the country . * * * * Except a few neat academies , " he further specified , after having traversed the New England States westwardly and emerged at Albany , " I found their school-houses equally ruinous and deserted with ours ; fields covered with stones ; stone fences , scrubby oaks and pine-trees ; wretched orchards ; scarcely one grain-field in twenty miles ; the taverns along the road dirty and filled with loungers brawling about lawsuits and politics ; the people snappish and extortioners , lazy , and two hundred years behind the Pennsylvanians in agricultural improvements . " The Eastern limit of his journey was at Portland , Maine , where he remained three days , and , in consequence of the Supreme Court being then in session , " had an opportunity of seeing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States in this quarter , and received much interesting information from them with regard to the birds that frequent these northern regions . " Turning back at this point , he made his way " through regions where nature and art have done infinitely less to make it a fit residence for man than any country I ever traversed , to Albany , where the Legislature was assembled , and where his canvassing tour ended . At this place the ornithologist met with a characteristic discouragement on the occasion of his visit to the Governor of New York , who " turned over a few pages , looked at a picture or two , asked me my price , and , while in the act of closing the book , added : I would not give a hundred dollars for all the birds you intend to describe , even had I them alive . ' " * As a summary of his labors , Wilson writes : " I Wilson 's biographers have exercised an unmerited forbearance in suppressing the name of this enlightened ruler , which was Daniel D. Tompkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of the New York Legislature , is worthy of preservation . The pinnated grouse was at this time in a fair way to be exterminated , and some sportsmen had introduced a bill for its protection , calling the bird by its popular name of " heath-hen . " The title of the bill , accordingly , was read by the chairman of the Assembly , as " An Act for the Preservation of the Heathen , " which impressed the members with a momentary belief that some philanthropist was incomprehensibly intent upon preserving the Indians . // have labored with the zeal of a knighterrant in exhibiting this book of mine wherever I went , traveling with it , like a beggar with his bantling , from town to town , and from one country to another . I have been loaded with praises-with compliments and kindnesses ; shaken almost to pieces in stage-coaches ; have wandered among strangers , hearing the same 0/i 's and A/i 's , and telling the same story a thousand times over  --  and for what ? Ay , that 's it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the whole when I reach Philadelphia . " His total return , in short , for his long and expensive Eastern tour , was the obtaining of forzy-one subscribers , even the most vociferous of his admirers having stood aloof when the author came to name $120 as the price of the projected nine volumes , thus justifying his misgiving that he had published " a work too good for the country . " The trip had , however , not been wholly unproductive , since Wilson had bestirred himself in " fixing correspondents in every corner of these northern regions , like so many pickets and outposts , so that scarcely a wren or . tit shall be able to pass along from York to Canada , but I shall get intelligence of it . " Undeterred by the limited success of his first trip , after spending but a few days in Philadelphia , Wilson sallied forth anew , in midwinter and alone , for a tour through the South . His first stop was at Baltimore , where he remained a week " with tolerabl. success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Annapolis , and " passed my book through both houses of the Legislature . The wise men of Maryland stared and gaped from bench to bench ; but having never heard of such a thing as one hundred and twenty dollars for a book , the ayes for subscribing were none , and so it was unanimously determined in the negative . " From Annapolis he journeyed " through the tobacco-fields , sloughs , and swamps of this illiterate corner of the State , " - opening , he records , fifty-five gates in a distance of thirtyeight miles , each of which obliged him to descend into the mud ,  --  and reached Washington in the last week of December . With the capital itself he was naturally disgusted ; but President Jefferson received him " very kindly , " and furnished him with letters to persons having ornithological tastes . South of Washington , especially after passing from Virginia into North Carolina , the difficulties of travel became very great . The route lay " through solitary pine woods , perpetually interrupted by swamps , that covered the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile at a time , looking like a long river or pond . These in the afternoon were surmountable ; but the weather , being exceedingly severe , they were covered every morning with a sheet of ice , from half an inch to an inch thick , that cut my horse 's legs and breast . After passing a bridge , I had many times to wade , and twice to swim my horse to get to the shore . * * * . * The taverns are the most desolate and beggarly imaginable . Bare , bleak , and dirty walls , one or two old broken chairs and a bench form all the furniture . * * * * At supper you sit down to a meal , the very sight of which is sufficient to deaden the most eager appetite ; and you are surrounded by half a dozen dirty , half-naked blacks , male and female , whom any man of common scent might smell a quarter of a mile off . " Through all these difficulties Wilson made his way with an impunity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ague was immoderate brandy-drinking , whereas he neverrelaxed his rigid abstemiousness . Of Charleston , which he reached in the latter part of February , 1809 , he subsequently reported , " I found greater difficulties to surmount there than I had thought of . I solicited several people for a list of names , but that abject and disgraceful listlessness and want of energy which have unnerved the whites of all descriptions in these States put me off from time to time , till at last I was obliged to walk the streets and pick out those houses which , from their appearance , indicated wealth and taste in the occupants , and introduce myself . " Nevertheless , he found patrons enough to bring up the number of WiLSON 'S SCHOOL-HOUSE AT KINOSESSING. // subscriptions collected since leaving home to one hundred and twenty-five . Proceeding from Charleston to Savannah , he stayed his travels at this city , being prevented by the low state of his funds from visiting Augusta , where he was assured ten or a dozen subscribers might be procured . " Here I close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " obtained at a price worth more than five times their amount . * * * * This has been the most arduous , expensive , and fatiguing expedition I ever undertook . I have , however , gained my point in procuring two hundred and fifty subscribers in all for my Ornithology , ' and a great mass of information respecting the birds that winter in the Southern States , and some that never visit the Middle States ; and this information I have derived personally , and can therefore the more certainly depend upon it . * * * This journey will be of much use to me , as I have formed acquaintance in almost every place who are able to transmit me information . " From Savannah he returned by sea to New York , reaching home before the end of March , 1809 . XVith so little loss of time did he apply himself to working up the materials for his second volume , that , on the 4th of August , he wrote to Bartram , announcing it as " nearly ready to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The success which had thus far befallen the enterprise justified the publisher in increasing the two hundred impressions , of which the original edition consisted , to five hundred ; but still Wilson was forced at this time to confess to Bartram , This undertaking has involved me in many difficulties and expenses which I never dreamt of and I have not yet received one cent from it . " That he was not tempted by the absence of returns , however , to slight his work , appears from one of his notes to Lawson concerning a plate the latter had in hand : " I hope you go on courageously with the eagle ; let no expense deter you from giving it the freest and most masterly touches of your graver . I think we shall be able to offer it as a competitor with the best that this country or Europe can produce . " How cordially the engraver responded to his friend 's enthusiasm is established by his own computation that the time expended upon the plates was remunerated at the rate - . ACE of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i8io , the second volume was published ; and by the close of the month , Wilson , according to his custom , had started for Pittsburgh on a trip to the West and South , which was to terminate at New Orleans . At the outset of this expedition , at Lancaster , he was encouraged by the Governor of Pennsylvania , who " passed some good-natured compliments on the volumes , and readily added his name to my list " ; but , on seeking patrons among the Legislature , he found them " such a pitiful , squabbling , political mob , so split up and justling about the mere formalities of legislation , without knowing anything of its realities , that I abandoned them in disgust . " A still more displeasing experience awaited // him a little farther on ,  --  at Hanover ,  --  where a certain Judge took upon himself to say that such a book as mine ought not to be encouraged , as it was not within the reach of the commonalty , and therefore inconsistent with our republican institutions / " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by admitting the principle involved , and inveighing against the Judge 's gross infraction of republican institutions in living in a large and elegant house , wholly beyond the reach of the commonalty ; and , after establishing this position , he went on , " pointing out to him the great influence of science on a young , rising nation like ours till he began to show such symptoms of intellect as to seem ashamed of what he had said . " At Pittsburgh ,  --  where he succeeded beyond expectation in getting subscribers ,  --  he learned that at that season the obstacles in the way of his further journey by land were insuperable by reason of the freshets ; so , buying a skiff , which he named the " Ornithologist , " and , turning a deaf ear to cautious advisers , who discouraged his attempting such a voyage alone , he waited only for the ice to leave a passage down the Ohio River , and , on Febmary 23d , set out on his solitary row of more than five hundred miles to Cincinnati . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , he reached in the second week in March , and , according to his diary , " visited a number of the literati and wealthy of Cincinnati , who all told me that they would think of it , viz. , of subscribing ; they are a very thoughtful pe6ple . " Continuing his boatjourney , with several halts for excursions inland to points of interest , or of possible profit , beguiling the time by composing a poetical narration of his expedition , which he entitled " The Pilgrim , " and encountering some prolonged rain-storms which obliged him to put off his coat that he might wrap it about the skins of the birds he had shot , he came at last to Louisville , where he shouldered his baggage and sold the " Ornithologist " for exactly half her cost to a man who was curious to know after what old Indian chief she had been named . Here occurred his first meeting with John James Audubon , then a merchant at Louisville , and unknown in science  --  a meeting so noteworthy as to justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One fair morning I was surprised by the sudden entrance into our counting-room , at Louisville , of Mr. Alexander Wilson , the celebrated author of the American Ornithology , ' of whose existence I had never until that moment been apprised . This happened in March , i8io . How well do I remember him , as then he walked up to me ! His long , rather hooked nose , the keenness of his eyes , and his prominent cheek-bones , stamped his countenance with a peculiar character . His dress , too , was of a kind not usually seen in that part of the country ; a short coat , trowsers , and a waistcoat of gray cloth . His stature was not above the middle size . He had two volumes under his arm ; and , as he approached the table at which I was working , I discovered something like astonishment in his countenance , " " I felt surprised and gratified at the sight of his volumes , turned over a few of his plates , and had already taken a pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner rather . abruptly said to me in French , My dear Audubon , what induces you to subscribe to this work ? Your drawings are certainly far better ; and again , you must know as much of the habits of American birds as this gentleman . ' Whether Mr. Wilson understood French or not , or if the suddenness with which I paused disappointed him , * can not tell ; but I clearly perceived that he was not pleased . Vanity , and the encomiums of my friend , prevented me from subscribing . Mr.Wilson asked me if I had many drawings of birds . I rose , took down a large portfolio , laid it on the table and showed him ,  --  as I would show you , kind reader , or any other person fond of such subjects ,  --  the whole of the contents , with the same patience with which he had shown me his engravings . His surprise appeared great , as he told me he never had the most distant idea that any other individual than himself bad been engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my intention to publish , and when I answered in the negative , his surprise seemed to increase . * We hunted together , and obtained birds , which he had never before seen ; but , reader , I did not subscribe to his work , for even at that time , my collection was greater than his . Thinking that perhaps he might be pleased to publish the results of my researches , I offered them to him , merely on condition that what I had drawn , or might afterward draw and send to him , should be mentioned in his works as coming from my pencil . At the same time I offered to open a correspondence with him , which I thought might prove beneficial to us both . He made no reply to either proposal , and before many days had elapsed left Louisville on his way to New Orleans , little knowing how much his talents were appreciated in our little town , at least by myself and my friends . " Some time elapsed , during which I never heard of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Philadelphia , I inquired for him , and paid him a visit . Mr. Wilson spoke not of birds or drawings . Feeling , as I was forced to do , that my con pany was not agreeable , I parted from him ; and r ter that I never saw him again . But , judge of my astonishment , some time after , when , on reading the thirtyninth page of the ninth volume of his - American Ornithology , ' I found in it the following paragraph : March 23d , i8io : I bade adieu to Louisville , to which place I had four letters of recommendation , and was taught to expect much of everything there ; but neither received one act of civility from those to whom I was recommended , one subscriber , nor one new bird ; though I delivered my letters , ransacked the woods repeatedly , and visited all the characters likely to subscribe . Science or literature had not one friend in this place . ' " From Louisville Wilson proceeded on foot through the cave-region of Kentuckythe // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soft soap-toward Lexington and Nashville , making several halts by the way for purposes of exploration , and one of eight days ' duration at Nashville . During this last , as the result of every moment of leisure and convenience he could obtain , he committed to paper portraitures of all the birds he had procured , and forwarded them to Lawson ; but the parcel was lost in the mails , and never more heard of . Dismal stories were now told him of the route through the wilderness to Natchez , his next objective point . " I was advised by many not to attempt it alone ; that the Indians were dangerous , the swamps and rivers almost impassable without assistance , and a thousand other hobgoblins were conjured up to dissuade me from going a/one . " On the 4th of May , nevertheless , he set out on horseback , armed to the teeth , and though he found that the difficulties of the road had scarcely been exaggerated , the Indians , who were Chickasaws , proved to be friendly and inoffensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that he broke down under the alternations of drenching rains and excessive heat which he now encountered . " The water in these cave-swamps is little better than poison , " he wrote ; " and under the heat of a burning sun , and the fatigues of traveling , it is difficult to repress the urgent calls of thirst . " He was so weakened by an attack of dysentery that he was scarcely able to keep in the saddle ; yet , on May 17th , he completed his ride of nearly five hundred miles to Natchez . Thence he proceeded to New Orleans , reaching it early in June , just at the advent of the sickly season , which , in his present condition , he did not dare to encounter . Hastening his business there , he sailed , on the 24th , for New York , where he arrived on the 3oth of July , bearing with him a copious stock of materials for future volumes  --  the result of six months ' wanderings , the whole expense of which his rigid economy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return , Wilson set to work upon the preparation of his third volume , the labor of which was very much increased by the necessity of reproducing the lost dr4wings which he had committed to the mail at Nashville . This ground made up , and the third volume given to the public , he withdrew to the rural retirement of his friend Bartram 's Botanic Garden , and here , during the years i8ii and 1812 , he worked up the materials he had already amassed , into his fourth and fifth volumes . Yet , even here , his difficulties and worries continued . The persons employed in coloring his plates proved so negligent and incompetent , that it became necessary for him to take charge of this process himself ; and , indeed , for a time this mere drudgery furnished his only resource for his support , as he was absolutely without other income . In the preface of the fifth volume , published in the year i8i 2 , we read : " The author 's only reward ki//zerfo has been the favorable opinion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the preparation of this fifth volume , Wilson suffered punishment for his protracted sedentary labors in repeated attacks of palpitation of the heart ; and on its completion , in the autumn of 1812 , he sought relaxation , such as it was , in another tour through New England . On his return , he worked so unremittingly and with such disregard of the necessary hours of sleep , in order to hasten the appearance of his sixth and seventh voliimes , that his friends anxiously represented to him the inevitable result of this destructive **25;0;TOOLONG which he used to parry with the rejoinder : " Life is short , and without exertion nothing can be performed . " In April , 1813 , he published the seventh , the last of the volumes he was himself to give to the public . Immediately , he set out with George Ord , his friend and biographer , upon a few weeks ' exploration of the Atlantic coast about Great Egg Harbor , N. J. , in order to complete his data respecting water fowls to which the eighth volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion of the plates were completed , but the author could go no further . Broken down by his excessive toil and by mental anxieties , he succumbed to the effects of a wetting he got in swimming a stream in pursuit of a bird he wished to possess ; his old malady , the dysentery , returned upon him , and was not to be shaken off by his debilitated frame , and , after ten days ' sickness , he died , August 23,1813 . His remains were laid in the grave-yard of the Old Swedes ' Church in Philadelphia , and a monument was raised over them by the lady whom he was to have married . Thus closed a life and a work which , it is no exaggeration to say , are without a parallel . When Wilson 's deprivations are borne in mind ,  --  that his early instruction was scant and contemptible ; that , as a boy , he was put at an uncongenial occupation , which // formed his means of livelihood through nearly half his days ; that his was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indomitable resolution of a man never cheerful or sanguine enabled him to surmount ; that he was thirty years of age when , in a strange land , he effected his own education by becoming the instructor of others ; that he was thirty-three when he began the study of ornithology , with scarcely any resources beyond his own powers of observation , and the practice of drawing without any previously suspected aptitude ; that he was forty years old before an opportunity disclosed itself for the commencement of his work , forty-two when he first accomplished publication , and only forty-seven when his life was closed ,  --  it must be admitted that few careers so brief have been equally productive . His labors were not merely in a field in which he had to open a new path , but where the steps that had been taken were false and misleading , and in which there were but few fellow-travelers . His journeys , largely performed on foot , exceeded ten thousand miles . His work was unappreciated by those to whom he had the clearest right to appeal2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . Nevertheless , though discouraged by neglect , and hampered not merely by poverty , but by the necessity of succoring those in still deeper need than himself he both laid the foundation for the study of natural history on this continent and bequeathed to his successors the outlines for its subsequent development ; and he described the habits of American birds with fidelity to truth , graphic vigor , and a poetical realization of the beauties of nature . The exigencies under which he wrote , and his l ) remature death , left his work fragmentary and disjointed to this extent-that , being compelled to publish as rapidly as he could procure materials , he was forced to picture his birds without regard to scientific classification , to put in juxtaposition the most dissimilar genera , and even to separate the male and female of the same species . But the re-arrangement which he would , if spared , himself have effected , has been made by his friend Ord , who published his materials in posthumous volumes , and by subsequent editions ; and the work was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucien Bonaparte , nephew of Napoleon . The casual imperfections in his great work-almost miraculously slight , if we fairly consider the cause of themin no wise lessen the example of heroic endurance bequeathed to us by Alexander Wilson .
