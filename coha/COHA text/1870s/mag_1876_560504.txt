FRENcH AND GERMAN.1 Mr. Hillebrand is a writer who has perfect command of four languages , German , French , English , and Italian , and he has the rarer faculty of writing nothing in any one of these tongues which is not entertaining as well as linguistically correct . To France , a country which he knows very well , he devoted the first volume of this series ; the second was made up of a variety of miscellaneous papers about other parts of the Continent , notably Italy and Germany , while this volume2 deals entirely with English affairs . It really consists of an agreeable gossiping account of certain Engush sights , with the moralizing upon them that suggests itself to an observer both intelligent and practiced , who draws his com2 Zeiten , VOider und Menschen .

It is for supplying just that want that Mr. Hillehrand is peculiarly fitted . He notices the indifference of the English public to what is going on in Germany in comparison with its keen interest in the condition of France , and he explains this by the well-known intimacy that has long existed between France and England , and the hardly obsolete provincialism of Germany , and be might have added the slowness of the English in receiving new impressions . He says , " In spite of all the translations , how remote Goethe and Schiller are from the Anglo - Saxons , who are yet allied to them by race . The only thing in our literature which they really understand and love is the sentimental , that is to say , our lyrical poetry . This is encouraged by their kinship . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels the melody , nor imagines the feeling , which combine to form a song . An Englishman is very quick to enjoy it . But , on the other hand , everything fantastic , speculative , or mystical in our literature is for him a closed volume . All our idealism is to him a puzzle , because our idealism is metaphysical , while his is practical . " This is not the only acute comparison he makes between the English and the Germans . He even asserts that the two Germanic races are about to interchange their r6les , and that the philosophizing nation is about to turn its attention to politics , while the nation exercised in politics is about to take up philosophy , which , he takes the precaution of adding , in no way means that both the politics and the philosophy will not be very unlike what they have been before . And ebewbere he throws a great deal of ridicule on the general ignorance in England of Kant and his philosophy . This is in a chapter on John Stuart Mill and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thorough approval . Of Mill 's autobiography he gives a clear and interesting account , closing with the statement ( made in 1873 ) that there are signs in England of the heginning reaction in favor of Ctesarean conservatism , and that Mill is more responsible for this than is any other man . He then takes up Mr. Fitzjames Stephen 's Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity , and gives it warm praise . However one may disagree or agree with Mr. Hillebrand 's judgments , it is necessary to credit him with giving in a clear way the core of this book , as it stands opposed to the essence of what Mill teaches . The two books of course represent conflicting elements , and Mill 's theoretical , impracticable system of social philosophy naturally called forth a speedy and truculent reply from the Englishman , who was frightened , as Mr. Hillebrand has shown , into clutching at conservatism to save himself . In English literature he has observed a peculiarity which is only of modern growth , namely , its inclination to fantastic refinement . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curse , a Tale dramatized from the Edda , by Charles Grant , he says that its simplicity is really delightful after the affected parlor and nursery language , the neck - breaking syntax and decorative word - painting , the artificial excess of words and the attempted imitation of Milton , which characterize modern English poetry . It is , he goes on , as if it were going back to the good old fashion of facilitating the comprehension of the thought by means of the rhythm and expression , instead of , like the modern school , making it more difficult , or instead of making good the absence of thoughts by the clatter of sesquipedalian words . " This tendency of European taste in all the arts is not the work of chance alone ; the example of Thdophile Gautier and of Baudelaire has been followed in Germany and Italy as well as in England , in music , painting , and sculpture , as well as in poetry , not from conscious imitation , but from the general demand of the times . Sensuousness and extravagance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulation of material , regard for the form as an end , rule everywhere , and the controlling intelligence , pure and chaste perception , are equally wanting in our popular artists . For in addition to this brilliant coloring which rejoices so much in costume-painting , in addition to the endless amplification of a few thoughts , and the ever-increasing obscurity of expression , and the Bernini-like restlessness of forms , there is also the willful effort to be concrete which marks a period taught to be abstract , as well as a certain morbid inclination to voluptuousness , an un-naive 1876. 117 // paganism , which has as little to do with the simple , frank enjoyment the ancients had in nakedness , as certain oracular , symbolical verse-making has with the granite lines of *schylos , or a certain dazzling extravagance of color has with Paul Veronese 's generous richness . " This long quotation will perhaps show that Mr. Hillebrand does not join in any hue and cry simply because it happens to be popular ; when he proceeds to examine the English , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at other people , and he does not stand in awe of the objects he is studying . Elsewhere in the book he writes with equal intelligence . He treats at some length of Bulwer , who has always had more admirers among cultivated foreigners than he has found among cultivated Englishmen and Americans , who refuse to take him quite as seriously as he took himself or as German critics seem disposed to take him . If we make allowance for what seems to ns the usual exaggeration , no further fault can be found . Dick . ens comes in too for admiration ; and it must be said that Mr. Hillebrand seems to have enjoyed Forster 's life of him more than most of its readers did . Of Morley 's Voltaire , and Rousseau , he speaks with fitting praise , without overlooking the shortcomings of these remarkable books . He corrects Mr. Morley 's denunciation of Frederick the Great , and points out cases in which the biographer errs by too great devotion to views better fitted for the scholar 's closet than to the every-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . These chapters , which apparently are letters about three years old , reprinted , compose all that he has to say about England in its present condition , and although they byno means go over the whole field of active English thought ; they take up many of its interesting sides . Before leaving this part of the book it may be worth while to turn to Hillebrand 's defense of Bulwer , which is certainly interesting reading : " He has always seemed to me to be a good example of the English aristocrat , such as was frequently to be seen in the last century , a combination of Walpole and Chesterfield , with a little German metaphysics added , and a Byronic pose . Bulwer is decidedly an attractive nature , whose- affectation is rendered tolerable by his innate grace . For Bulwer is affected ; not in his old-school , French airs , which are those of the cultivated French nobleman of the century of enlightenment who has come down to our day ; he is affected when he assumes the ways of the fashionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his stores of learning , or sets out to be the earnest , romantic poet of melancholy despair . He can not help it , he must always pretend to be some one else ; but his easy , attractive form is to be seen beneath the artificial , fashionable veil , and it is impossible to be angry with him . Everything about the man is noble ; he has no hidden vein of commonness . All the qualities which one associates with the cavalier are united in him ; one can see in the author how courageous , high-hearted , and knightly he was in his life , and what facility he had in everything , in writing as well as in speaking . Hence it is that for us Germans his somewhat abstract idealism brings him nearer to us than to his practical countrymen and contemporaries . His philosophy is not original , bmit lie has an understanding of philosophy . To a scholar of Waitz or Giesebrecht his study of history may seem insufficient and uncertain , but they are enough for a man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical sequence , and into the community of our European culture . In Bulwer there was no poet , but he was a poetic soul , and he could revel in the enjoyment of poetry and poetic things . " After speaking of his lack of humor and of the heaviness of his satire , Mr. Hillebrand goes on , " One gets to love the author ; one often shares with approval in his views of life ; one likes the thoroughly gcntlemanly society one meets in his books ; one gives him applause when he protests against the wisdom of this work-day world , when he steps forward in defense of the great glories of humanity , for the idols which rude hands would destroy , and in his Quixotic enthusiasm breaks a lance for what Goethe called the ahnungsvoli . " To be sure , this outburst is tempered by a speedy enumeration of Bulwer 's faults , of his lack of skill in drawing real human beings , of the unsoundness of the situations he invents , and of the sluggish movement of the action in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good part of the ground covered by the novelist ; but on the whole he admires Bulwer . It is hard to see how any one can like characters which are unlifelike even if they are gentlemanly , as also to understand how any one can sympathize with Bnlwer 's loudly professed adoration of the ideal . In fact , that novelist was always trifling with the popular taste , 118 July , // Art . and imitating what was good in a palpably insincere fashion . To say that he was not admired in England because he was averse to preaching a practical philosophy seems to be a rather hasty judgment . He was much read and admired , but for the most part only by young people , who were unable to discriminate between what was genuine and what ungenuine . Others could not help being conscious of his deficiencies , of the emptiness of his various pretenses , and of his incessant assumption of all manner of virtues and excellences . Why he has been so much admired by Germans is still a puzzling question . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prey of false sentimentality , unless it be that Schopenhaner 's philosophy exists in Germany only as a sort of bulwark against the softer trait which has so long marked that country . 119 As a sort of postscript to the book , two agreeable chapters are insertc*I , one on Tom Jones , to which Mr. Hillebrand gives fitting praise , and the other on Sterne , of whom he writes entertainingly . On the whole , this volume will be found interesting , bright , and readable . That it gives a complete picture of modern England can not be affirmed . Like the second volume of this series , reviewed last October in The Atlantic , it is somewhat superficial , and hardly comes up to the promise of the title or of the first book , Frankreich und die Franzosen , noticed some three years ago . The author 's position is that of a cosmopolitan , with its advantages in the way of brilliancy and facility of expression ; but there is also a less attractive side , that of superficiality in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is well worth reading . ART . ANY amount of discussion about the progress we are making in the way of popularizing art education in this State has not a feather 's weight in comparison with the eloquent and intelligible language of the last exhibition of the drawings shown in Horticultural Hall , examples of work from the various art schools in the commonwealth . The display was like a great open book , chronicling exactly the extent of the advancement of the students under the system of art instruction which has for some years been in practice here . The specimens shown received from the public deserved , if not altogether judicious praise . The avowed intention of the managers of the school has always been to teach solely industrial art , and not in any way to attempt instruction in the purely txsthetic branches , making a distinct division between industrial and artistic education . Indeed , this intention has been so often declared that it is quite snl ) erfiuous to repeat it here . Without any question the mechanical drawings were the most perfect in execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . Drawings of machinery , nicely finished problems of house and ship architecture , original plans , designs more or less ornamental , - in fact , there was an embarassment of riches in this line . Of the primary steps in the system , which were as far ns possible shown in a progressive series , there is little to say . No one will pretend to deny that the mechanism of drawing , the mental operation of constructing a figure with any material , is essentially the same the world over , and is based on the application of simple forms , easily grasped , to assist in the representation of complex form . By the aid of horizontal and perpendicular lines or simple geometrical figures , placed in imagination in reference to the object before him or drawn lightly on the paper as guides to be erased in the finish , every artist makes bis drawing . This has always been the alphabet of drawing , and the practical service of such aids is axiomatic . Mr. Walter Smith and his assistants teach , if we understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully systematized scale of progression , trying to lead the beginner by the shortest and most reasonable path to a certain degree of proficiency in the illustration of solid objects , and in original design for whatever purpose his course of study // Art . may imply . In the exhibition  --  the first thoroughly representative one - the work of the young scholars always testified to an earnest training in the precise direction laid out by Mr. Smith ; and this gentleman is to be congratulated on the success of his efforts in securing the undivided attention of a large number of scholars and in awaking general interest in the subject of drawing , rather , we think , than felicitated on the proficiency of his pupils . It is true that there are great difficulties in the way of teaching drawing in the public schools ; the benefit of another obligatory course in addition to the now too heavy list of studies is , with reason , doubted . It is also true that this exhibition has had the field all to itself , that the public have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smith 's direction with that performed under other influences . Hence it would be idle to attempt a critical consideration of the examples shown . Not being able to gau*e the capabilities of the scholars of the public schools , we have no way of determining whether they are doing as well in drawing as they might do . We can only say that the examples shown in the exhibition were , in comparison with similar drawings produced in other countries and under parallel conditions of age and previous training , by no means wonderful . Nevertheless it was a gratifying display . Mr. Smith 's method of instruction is popularly called the English system . What his ideas are of the prevailing systems in France and England may be found in the following extract from his report on the art educational section of the Paris Exhibition of 1867 : " Compared with the English school of art system , the French is deficient in breadth and comprehensiveness , and yet it gets more valuable results than the English does . . . . What we want in England is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing , and then we should have absorbed , as it were , the soul of French art education . It is , I am prepared to allow , a very rough-and-ready method , all the more suitable , therefore , for students who begin their studies with taste and power at zero ; but it has , on the other hand , capacity of development to suit the education of the most perfect taste and the maturest power . Some years ago the practice of working light-and-shade drawings with leather and stump as instruments , using chalk or charcoal as a medium , was entirely scouted in English schools of art . July , The examination and reports upon the French art schools ' exhibition by inspectors and masters of the English schools , in 1864 , drew attention to the excellence of the method , and its adoption was very strongly advocated by at least one master . Since then , both in London and the provinces , several masters have partially adopted the system , and it was well represented in this year s national competition in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see whether we can not combine with our English art education the good features by which the French and German educationalists try to develop art feeling among the actual producers of the works . " We have spoken of the declared intentions of the state director of art education and his corps of teachers in regard to their instruction . One item in the declaration we must protest against , namely , the complete separation of the artistic from the industrial . This is no less than tearing the heart from the body . It would lead one to believe that decoration is mechanical , whereas it is only those decorations which possess the artistic element that are valuable . Imitative decoration , Chinese copying of the originals of others , is in no sense testhetic ; but this can not be the limit proposed by Mr. Smith 's course of instruction . In the last paragraph quoted above , Mr. Smith testifies to the value of this same artistic element . In France and Germany , artist and artisan study side by side , and often the latter is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the productions which demand only a modicum of artistic feeling , but insist upon at least something in this way , the artisan fills his position exactly as well as the artist in his branch , and the more of an artist the artisan may be , the higher value will be placed on his productions . The greatest decorators have been the greatest artists . The Ducal Palace , the Campo Santo , and the Sistine Chapel , and in modern times the vestibules of the academies of fine arts in Paris and Antwerp and the walls of many public buildings in Europe , are monuments to the truth of this assertion . The difficulties of introducing any system which should not have immediate practical results of more or less commercial value is well understood . It is possible that the patrons of the schools would object to any instruction that was not pronounced industrial , and since we are to judge altogether by results and only to note intentions for // Art . the sake of comparing them with results , we may safely assert that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove that it has been impossible to separate the industrial from the artistic , and that the advanced course of study was in the way of artistic education more or less wisely directed , notwithstanding repeated announcements to the contrary . In almost every section of the display there were copies of illustrations , photographs , or drawings , not chosen for the perfection of their execution but for their artistic qualities . To be sure , there were also examples of very painstaking point drawing from the solid object , which could have no other purpose than to train the pupil to precision in execut*ing the mechanical part of the work . Among others , in the section of the normal art school there were a great many drawings from casts , copies in color from examples of recognized merit , and stilllife studies , which could only be decorative , and in this sense industrial to the extent that they were artistic . It is the assimilation of the principles governing the works of the great artist-decorators that would give a decorative value to the examples above cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contour , the oil copies were not without considerable merit , but the general fault of all the black and white studies was the very lack of the decorative element which it is the intention of the school to cultivate . Scarcely one among them gave an impression of the material from which it was studied . Drawings from the cast gave no hint of the appearance of plaster . And yet it would seem to be the first aim of a decorative drawing from a plaster cast to render an impression of the character of the object and its value as a spot of color , as an ornament . In form , also , was there the same lack of decorative quality Illusion by skillfully imitated relief is one of the triumphs of the decorator . In scarcely a single example among the drawings or monochrome paintings is there any intention of relief . It is of no use to try to express solidity on a flat surface unless it is felt . All the rules and appliances in the world will not assist the pupil unless he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 121 and thus work it into his drawing . And this sentiment is artistic . It is easy to define exactly where the drawings fell short in their professed purpose . The reason is found , in the majority of cases , in the falsity of the oppositions of tone . The minutest variation in tone will change the apparent form . Most perfect relief is seen in the broad masses of flesh in Titian 's pictures . Analyze the delicate modeling , and it is plain that the refinement of variation in the tone causes the apparent relief . We would not be so exacting as to demand an approach to perfection of relief in the drawings spoken of , but we would have welcomed an echo of a sentiment of this most vital element of the highest branch of industrial art . Any one would have been puzzled to assert what was the color or material of the groups of blocks , the torso from the Vatican , or the mutilated Nike Apteros . He would have been equally at a loss to find the intermediate steps between these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple objects and reached the antiques . To be sure , the Normal Art School is established for the training of teachers , but from the works of the teachers we must prophesy results of like stamp from the pupils they are destined to instruct , for no one can teach more than he knows . In considering this subject of art education , it must not be lost sight of that we have in this country no class of men trained in a way that they may be drawn upon for our art-instructors . But putting a saw in a workman 's hand will not make him a carpenter , and if we are to judge from results before us it would seem to be wiser to trust to a natural growth of men who are proper instructors than to force them injudiciously in an expensive hot-bed . When the Art Museum shall have accomplished one of the best purposes of its establishment , and we see within its walls a body of diligent students all striving to become artists , even if destined to come out artisans , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are scores of American art students at home and abroad , old enough in experience and properly educated to give instruction , who would gladly welcome employment as teachers . // MUSIC . WAGI*EIt 'S Centennial March ' ( of which we have unfortunately seen only a poor piano-forte arrangement ) is perhaps the most foiling composition to criticism that we have yet met with . To any one who is comfortably content to look for the whole musical essence of a work in the character and relationship of its various themes , and their formal working out , this march presents little difficulty . The two contrasted themes it is built upon are neither new nor especially interesting ; they are certainly neither trivial nor very commonplace , they have even a certain stateliness and grandeur , but they do not of themselves produce any marked effect upon either the feelings or the imagination . Their formal treatment , judged by any genuinely musical standard , is so very loose and inorganic that it is wholly uninteresting , and , by itself , monotonous . Sheer persistence and reiteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with a will , and with sustained power , they may at times produce wonderful effects , though of the physical sort ; witness the first movement of Gade*s C-minor Symphony . Judged from the printed notes , then ( always hearing in mind that we are speaking of a very inadequate piano - forte transcription , the merest spectre of the original work ) , this march should he pronounced , by the most time-honored rules of criticism , to be wholly flat , unprofitable , and without foison . Beyond all doubt , Wa , *ner 's superb command over all the resources of the modern orchestra , his wondrous power of contrasting different shades of tone , his gorgeous instrumental coloring , will , in any case , go far towa*1 galvanizing even tbe deadest inorganic massof notes into life . We know that this faculty is held in light esteem by many , and we are often brought up short in our admiration of works that are purely orchestral in their character , and are comparatively uninteresting when heard through the medium of a piano-forte transcription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need its orchestral dress to he beautiful .

Arranged for piano by Tnsoaoas TaoMAS Cincinnati : John Church &amp; Co as the instrumentation of a Beethoven symphony is merely its orchestral dress , can it bear being stripped of it ; it can even better do without it . But in so far as the instrumentation is an organic part of the symphony itself , it is an utterly indispensable part . Music is most assuredly the art of tones . We can not but feel that all those who rejoice in piano-forte arrangements of Beethoven symphonies , and orchestral transcriptions of Bach passacaglias and toccatas , fail to feel some of the veiy essential beauties of those works . It would appear , then , that the critic must look to the orchestra to reveal to him whatever of beauty lies in the Centennial March ; otherwise there seems to be little hope either for the march or for him . So much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing over the march some half a dozen times , we must candidly admit that we greatly enjoy it . We find it neither monotonous nor dry , but full of fire , dignity , and energy . The themes are given out with such convincing authority , the whole thing is carried through with such indomitable , spontaneous power , there is so much fine , effectual heat in the work , such . a total absence of anything small or niggardly in its composition , that it carries us away , in spite of ourselves , perhaps , at first , hut very willingly at last . We will mercifully say nothing about the ever - occurring triplet figure , which the newspapers have quite sufficiently talked of in a more or less distracted state of mind , except that it is , as Hamlet might say , an honest triplet . It is simply the first three notes of the first theme , -  - -  - F-  F  - -  * - -   - -  * - -   -E H 0-I *8 and keeps recnrring throughout the piece ( as fragments of themes have often done before in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of the whole march is , no doubt , mainly physical , but we can not help thinking it an inspiring and wholesome one . - Mr. Dudley Buck 's Centennial Cantata2 is a very favorable example of the com 2 The Ceateanial Meditation of Celambia .

Anything other than a masterly treatment of easily melodious and dramatically pertinent themes , coming from his facile pen , would have surprised us . We must think that Mr. Buck has been unfortunate in the text to which he has written music . The greater part of Mr. Lanier 's poem , apart from all considerations of its intrinsic poetical worth or unworth is suitable to musical treatmen , t in the dramatic , declamatory , Liszt - Wagner style , but is very ill adapted to musical treatment in the lurely musical style in which Mr. Buck is so gracefully at home . Mr. Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never allows the dramatic possibilities of his text to lure him away from a musically self-dependent and consistent form . Mr. Lanier recently wrote a newspaper letter in which he defended at great length his choice of method iu composing this cantata-text . He there lays down three principles ( which , in his view , constitute the a , b , c of the matter ) : ( a ) that every modern musical composer must write for the human voice as a part of the orchestra ; ( b ) that only one general conception is permissible in the text , with some suhordinate ideas very broadly contrasted ; and ( c ) that in the case in point the poem should consist mainly of Saxon words , in order to aid in producing an effect of " big , manly , and yet restrained jubilation . " We have nothing to object to the sincerity of Mr. Lanier 's convictions , and , as we have intimated , we think he produced various phrases and movements well adapted to dramatic musical arrangement ; but we feel bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer be " perfectly clear , smooth , and natural . " There are critics quite as competent as Mr. Lanier who do not believe that the poorness of Wagner 's texts for his own operas is at all essential to their musical splendor . And what does Mr. Lanier say to Sculler 's ode , An die Freude , so magnificently set by Beethoven in his Ninth Symphony 3 We know of no text , either , which might so well inspire a musician of the modern school as Coleridge 's Ancient Mariner ( though this has been very inadequately used by the English composer , Barnett ) , a poem largely made up of clear and precise narrative . But , to take the example which seems to have been most immediate in its influence upon Mr. Lanier , Dr. von Billow 's orchestral rendering of Uhland 's Siluger 's Fluch , we may observe thai ; the simple fact of the composer 's skipping 123 the " connective tissue " of narrative in that poem , and dwelling on the dramatic episodes in it , by no means proves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter quoad music . " Without these portions , the poem would have been comparatively worthless and ineffective , and eduld hardly have inspired any musician to the effort of interpretation . If Uhiand had , without further explanation , given the ejaculative utterances of the king , the queen , and the singer , he would have been unintelligible ; and before his poem could have been translated into tones by Von Billow , explanatory marginal notes would have been required , similar to those which Mr. Lanier wisely took the precaution to send to Mr. Buck ; and possibly a posthumous newspaper letter from Uhland would not have been amiss . Moreover , a conception to be embodied in words and music can not safely he subjected to just the same treatment as that which is given to the inpresdon derived from a clear , concise poem , and about to he translated into orchestral effects . Mr. Lanier 's fundamental error appears in a simile to which be confidently calls our attention , namely , that a poet asked to write a cantata-text is in precisely the predicament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be viewed only hy moonlight . This is as ludicrous as it is loose in its analogy . Mr. Lanier himself points out in one case the power of music to invest unmeaning syllables with great effect ; and this alone shows that music is not an indistinct medium for the transmission of impressions , comparing with the power of non-musical vocal inflections " as moonlight . . . with sunlight . " The syllables " zig , zig , zig " can not possibly he made impressive in non-musical utterance . So that the idea that music , as contrasted with simple elocution , enfeebles and makes vague , falls to the ground . And even granting that it does make things vague , we should say that the poet , instead of adding to the dimness and mysticism of musical expression , ought to throw into his words a compensating clearness . In either case , then , Mr. Lanier is at fault . He has been misled by a simile , and has gone astray by reason of that peculiar and excessive roominess which an uncertain grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His law of the prevailing general idea and of the related subordinate ideas is quite correct , but not at all new ; his choice of Saxon words is highly commendable ; but his rejection of clearness // illusic. and intelligibility is a lamentable error . It is quite possible that fine things may be produced in a mystical and indefinite vein , but no art can ever achieve greatly which sets out with forethought to be mystical and vague . Mr. Lanier says that he saturated his mind with a theory , and then waited for the poem to come . He would have done better to keep his mind more clear from thcones , and to have gone ardently and without prejudice in search of his poem . As it is , in expounding the alphabet of a new poetic-musical art , he has forgotten that it must have a grammar also . And though undoubtedly revolutionary forces have been at work in music , and are now at work in poetry , which the general public may not appreciate , yet the criticisms which the Centennial cantata-text has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is really a hasty and defective attempt to overthrow artistic order . The character of Mr. Buck 's music is almost always in keeping with the spirit of the text ; we may be sure not to find him writing triumphal marches to words like " Cujus animam gementem , " for instance ; but all entering into dramatic details , to the detriment of essentially musical thematic development , seems to be repugnant to his nature . Now many of Mr. Lanier 's verses are of that involved grammatical structure that makes them utterly incomprehensible when read merely prosodically . We must confess that Mr. Buck 's setting often rather increases than lessens this quality in the poetry . Take , for instance , the lines , - Winter cries , Ye freeze : away ! Fever cries , Ye bnrn : away ! Hunger cries , Ye starve : away ! Vengeance cries , Your graves shall stay ! The music to the first line is admirable : the basses thunder out , " Winter cries , Ye freeze ; " upon which the whole chorus shriek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing lines , all that the listener can understand is , " Fever cries , Ye burn away I Hunger cries , Ye starve away I " In the next line the music again makes the text wholly comprehensible and effective . There are one or two other places where the sense of the text is equally obscure to the listencr . Musically considered , the cantata is a most capital piece of writing . Mr. Buck does not write with a very Titanic pen , but his style is so pure and unforced , his effects are so easily and naturally brought about , that we can not but overlook an occasional tendency to the trivial and commonplace . The bass solo , " Long as thine art , " which sets out in a quite sufficiently commonplace and sentimental vein , gains strength as it goes on , and at the words , " Thy fame shall glow , thy fame shall shine , " shows real power and effective brilliancy . The fugued final chorus is a great advance upon the composer 's " The God of Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the choral part from the words , " Mayflower , Mayflower , " to the words , " Toil , give , kiss o er and replight , " is brilliant , and , barring the occasional obscurity we have already mentioned , effective , dramatic even , if you will , but always in a merely general way . - Mr. John K. Paine 's music to Whittier 's Hymn ' shows plainly the master 's hand in its calm , reposeful beauty . It is a very perfect piece of plain choral writing , and we should place it in the foremost rank among the many modern attempts at original composition in this style . We have heard many large adjectives coupled with this music , and many sublime comparisons made with old works of the sort . But the opportunity seems to us hardly to have given room for anything great . An opening hymn for the Centennial Exhibition was required of Mr. Paine , and he has given us one such as we are persuaded few other men in the country could write . qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole , the public-school system is rather in a state of trying to be than of actual being , and therefore in that quarter of our Union it presents as yet no featnre of interest beyond the simple fact that in this , its initial stage , it is making so good a fight for existence as to give hopes of vigorous health and a strong constitution in the future . Some of its guardians and nurses are endowed with intuitions and generalizations of liberal cult- - ure , so that it is quite possible that the mistakes of the North in elaborate text-books and narrow conrses of study may be avoided by this later comer into the publicschool field . All the Southern superintendents are in sympathy with the commonschool education of the negro , not , it must be admitted , so much for his own sake as in order to mitigate and remove the curse of the ignorant ballot , which now afflicts the recent slave communities . But the superintendent of Virginia believes warmly in the " improvability " of the negro himself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the taxes of every description raised by negroes should be devoted to the support of schools for their benefit . This amount could not nearly snpply them with instruction , since even in Kentucky it wonld only reach about $15,000 annually . On the present system , says one report , " one race bears all the burden and the other reaps the benefit ; " and the popularity of the common - school system , and the zeal with which it is supported , are very much affected thereby . In the Southern States public- school funds are raised by state instead of by local taxation , and leading superintendents are anxious that in this regard the laws of their respective States should be changed so as to allow of taxation at will for the support of schools . This is the system at the North , and it has proved successful in Massachusetts , New York , Pennsylvania , and Ohio . The Peabody fund is doing service of such immense value in inaugurating common-school education in the South , that the only wonder is that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not assist colleges , academies , or any private , sectarian , or charity schools , nor does it aid schools whose average attendance is less than eighty-five pupils . As a specimen of the work it is doing we quote from the last report of the superintendent of Virginia , who says , " It may safely be asserted in regard to the majority of our one hundred and fifty-five graded schools that they could not have come into being without aid from this source ; but , having been tried , and their superior advantages exhibited to the people , these schools will be permanent wherever there is sufficient population to maintain them . The aid given to teachers ' institutes was also of great value . It enabled me to send highly-qualified lecturers to instruct the teachers in a number of places . " The Peabody fund aids , too , in the publication of the Virginia Educational Journal . No Southern State has more willingly received the modern doctrine of universal education than Virginia . She is prosecuting the common schooling of her children with vigor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jarticular . The number of teachers has increased two hundred during the past year . Improved furniture and apparatus are coming into use , and the attendance on the public schools has been greater than at any previous time . The primary public schools are rapidly absorbing the lower grades of private schools . There are nearly two hundred academies in the State , from which large classes yearly enter the colleges . The Virginians carry the family idea into the school , and there are " few places where brothers and sisters are sent to different schools . The educational advantages of co-education as to grading , study , and manners are so great that they will prevail over a prejudice which , so far as children are concerned , is left without an argument when the school premises and supervision are what they should be . " There are two excellent colored normal schools in Virginia , but no steps have as yet been taken for the normal training of white teachers . The cities of Richmond and Lynchburg are particularly mentioned as having made the greatest advance toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no report , but from the last national report ( 1874 ) we 1876. // Education . learn that " the results of the free-school work in the State for the last two years are very gratifying , and show a steady and healthy increase in the attendance of pupils at school , as well as greater efficiency in financial and school management . " The State has established a normal school with five branches - an instance of energy and wise foresight in the right direction . At no time in the State of Maryland , since the state school system caine into existence , has there been greater activity iu all departments than during the year 1874 . Although the amount of public-school money received from the State was less than in any previous year , the people of the several counties , by their voluntary contributions , have made up the deficiency nearly threefold . " An important element of educational progress in the State was the establishment , in September , 1874 , of the Maryland School Journal , a monthly paper devoted to the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore as editors . " The schools in Baltimore , as is natural in so old a Roman Catholic city , separate the sexes from the primary schools upward . The public-school system was not inaugurated in Baltimore until 1828 , when three schools were opened and 269 pupils enrolled . In nine years these had only increased to 659 , but in 1837 the city and school authorities established a high school . " Thd opportunities thus afforded for advancement to a hi* her grade of training immediately resulted in enlargement of the lower schools , so that in 1840 , nine schools were in existence , with over 1800 pupils , while in 1874 there were one hundred and twenty-two schools and 39,569 pupils . " This rapid increase , doubtless due in some degree to the great growth of population in the city , was attributed by the late city superintendent mainly to the influence of the central high schoni . " Drawing and music form a part of the publicschool training of Baltimore , and in the girls ' schools the teachers cheerfully undertook the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches to the female pupils of their schools , and set apart one afternoon in each week for this purpose . The experiment was very successful . Secondary education throughout Maryland is reported in a declining condition , though the State was once noted for its numerous and excellent classic schools . In the city of Washington there is no high school excepting a colored one called a preparatory high school . " There is a ' normal school in which , " besides a review of previous studies , the pupils have been instructed in drawing , in methods of instruction , and in all that relates to the general management of schools , " after which course the graduates must answer perfectly to Goethe 's definition , " There is nothing more frightful than a person who knows only so much as he is required to teach . " Drawing and music and a little natural science and physics are taught in the public schools , but apparently no foreign language . The proportion of colored pupils is larger in Washington than in any other city in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send their children to the public schools pay any taxes for them , yet the school - tax in Washington is nearly twice as great as in any other locality . There are as yet seatings enough for only half the children . The school-houses are generally overcrowded and ill - ventilated , though two of them , the Frankfin and the Jefferson schools , for white and colored children respectively , are fine buildings which took very high medals at the Vienna Exposition . There are seventy-eight private schools in Washington , of which three are . kindergartens . The one under Miss Marwedal is very completely organized , having a principal and six assistants and about seventy scholars . In Kentucky the state and county teachers associations are thoroughly organized and united , and the recently conferred right of district taxation will enable local enterprise to develop a common-school system commensurate with the wants of the State . The greatest present want of the State is good school-houses , the complaints respecting them being universal , and the pictures drawn of some of them being disgraceful and repulsive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously , one hundred and forty-one new ones having been built in the past year . In Tennessee not one fifth of the eligible population of the State had any means of education in 1872 . In some of the counties there was not a single school , public or private , in operation . Now over one half of the children are enrolled , and over one quarter are in daily attendance . As the expenditure is only $3.40 per capita , the quality and quantity of the teaching must of course be very elementary . In Kentucky and Virginia it is about $5.08 . There are thirty-three " colleges , academies , and // Education . seminaries " in Tennessee , especially " colleges . " According to the last Arkansas report , the snperintendent could not even provide shelving for the preservation of the educational reports of the other States and of the national government . The schoolteachers were paid in state scrip , which had depreciated to thirty-five cents on the dollar . At present " the political convulsions hy which this State has been shaken appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Public-school matters in our State are now at a stand-still . But now that our political trouhles are over , and this present state government is fully established , I am satisfied that both puhlic-school and other interests will in a short time revive and he carried on with renewed energy . " In Mississippi , owing to the teachers being paid in " warrants , " whose value ranged from nothing up to fifty cents on the dollar , many schools were closed and most were kept open only a small portion of the year . The colleges of Mississippi are for one sex . Education for women appears to he extremely superficial and defective . There are two normal schools , hut only for colored teachers . The city centres are apparently doing nothing for pnhlic-school education . Only half of the children of the State went to school at all . In Louisiana , in 1873 , only one fifth of the children were even enrolled . The revenue was not large enough to cover half the current expenses for half of the children , leaving nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself admits that " official rascality " has destroyed confidence in the puhlic-school system . " In most parishes of the State the need of schoolhouses is the greatest source of embarrassment . Scholars , for want of buildings , have been taught under trees and in buildings that had no doors , windows , or floors . There are no school-buildings worthy the name in the State , with the exception of a few in New Orleans and in one or two of the older towns in the interior . Thdeed , even the best of the New Orleans schoolhouses would not be tolerated in any large town at the North longer than to give time to erect others . " There is a high school at Baton Rouge , and three others in New Orleans are creditably spoken of . The financial condition of the Louisiana State University remains deplorable . In Texas there " is in some counties evidence of a return of public confidence in free 127 education . " But the system is struggling with every conceivable difficulty : schoolhouses rented instead of being owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses ; the one per cent . tax peculated and misapplied ; free schools and private schools blended together ; a multiplicity of school districts ; no provision for the school organization of cities and towns as such , these being under the control of county officers . In Alabama " the provision of the constitution which requires the inviolable devotion of certain revenues and school funds to the purposes of education has been disregarded by each successive legislature . Each year an increasing percentage of the school fund has been diverted from its legitimate use to the defraying of the general expenses of the State . " The indebtedness of the State to the school fund , from this diversion of the revenues , had risen from $187,872 at the end of 1869 , to $1,260,511 at the end of 1873 , in which year , out of $522,810 apportioned for educational purposes , only $68,313 was paid from the state treasury , and that only in teachers ' warrants ! " The result has been an almost entire paralysis of primary education . " In the report for 1874 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the difficulties above referred to have neither been removed nor lessened . On the contrary , new complications have arisen . " Ihere are apparently ten institutions in the State for the training of teachers , eight of these being for the colored race and two for the white . " With the zeal for college training which marks the Southern people , the University of Alabama has been kept in operation hy the State , while the common schools have been suffered to go down . " The superintendent of Florida reports that " half a decade ago there were no schools outside a few of the larger towns and cities . We have now nearly six hundred scattered throughout the State . They are springing up by the highways and by-ways as pledges of future improvement and progress . Out of a total population of two hundred thousand we have twenty thousand children attending school . " Sixteen schools in Florida are beneficiaries of the Peabody fund . Three out of every four of the teachers of Florida are reported as " unfit for their work , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the State , except an " academic department " in the Peabody school at St. Augustine , capable // of making them any better ; no high school or normal school , teacher 's institute or college . Georgia has been called the Empire State of the South , and the Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Meeting of the Georgia Teachers Association give promise of an intellectual life within her borders which will easily enable her to maintain her supremacy . Of the eight papers read at this meeting , six - The Higher Education of Women , Modern Uses of the Ancient Languages , Scientific School Studies , A Plea for Common Sense in Education , Practical Education , and Theories of College Education - would have been considered able in any similar meeting in any part of the country . The venerable Dr. Lyscomb presided , and opened the conference with an appeal to teachers to magnify their office . " There is a Georgia greater than the Georgia we have lost ; a Georgia grander than the old Georgia was . The Georgia in our brains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers , will he the Georgia that will gladden the hearts and homes of our children . " In South Carolina , of an apparent school revenue of over half a million , " not a cent of an appropriation of $300,000 for 1873 ever reached the schools ; " and in 1874 also there was a large deficiency . Great numbers of the schools were closed , and the teachers suffered from " great distress and privation . " In 1873 Grenville County received hut $800 of the $12,252 of school funds which came into the hands of the county treasurer , a man who , being pardoned from serving a term in the state penitentiary , afterward received possession of the school funds from the state treasurer and immediately left the State ! Charleston College , with its fine museum of natural history , is still in operation , and probably has to do duty , as far as the whites are concerned , for both itself and the state university at Columbia . Since 1873 the latter has been principally in the hands of negroes , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school has been added to it under its new rCgime , and also one hundred and twenty-four state scholarships of four years each , and each with an income of $200 ,  --  and this though the number of students in the preparatory school is but one hundred and seventeen , and in the college itself but forty-two . But the practical operation of the measure is far from Education . July . favorable . " The board of trustees has likewise remitted all fees and rent hitherto imposed upon students , thus rendering the university practically free to all . The university buildings are in an unfortunate condition , and unless prompt and efficacious measures be taken to protect them from the further ravages of time and the weather , they will suffer permanent and irreparable damage. ** In North Carolina the State has not yet authorized local taxation for school purposes . It attempts to provide for the schools out of the state taxes , and the result is of course inadequate . Teachers ' wages are low , and there appear to be no county superintendents . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condition of suspension , and had been so for some time . At the state convention of 1874 a young colored man made a speech at the suggestion of the state superintendent , in which he deprecated the excessive multiplication of studies in the schools for colored children . His address met with a very cordial appreciation by the assembly . Three other colored men took part in the discussions and were heard with a friendly and respectful interest . " For ourselves , we look for a great educational impetus to be given to the whole South when the magnificent Johns Hopkins University of Baltimore is fairly organized and in operation . It has admirable material to work upon . No observer can teach Southern schools , whether for poor or rich , without recognizing the abounding talent , as well as the docility and enthusiasm and abandon , of the Southern children . With this number we bring our review of the school reports of all the States and Territories to a close . The present defects of our public-school system may be briefly summed up . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disgraceful neglect of historical studies ; too much elaboration of arithmetic , grammar , and geography , and too little attention to the other elements of knowledac , together with a complete failure to impart any conception of , or taste for , English liter* ture . Yet in all the thousands of pages of these reports which we have toiled through , only one man - a local superintendent in Rhode Island - perceived that this not teaching the masses what to read is in truth the great short-coming of our public-school system .
