txt Subscriptions to religious and benevolent undertakings have given rise to a number of legal decisions . These engagements are in most respects treated as contracts . Thus , there must be a consideration for the promise , else the subscriber is not bound to pay . In the case ofb subscribing to a bank or railroad , one can easily see what is the consideration  --  it is the shares of stock which are to be issued to the subscriber . The case of subscribing to pay off a church-debt , or to build a college , endow a Professorship , or establish a hospital , is not so clear , for hero no pecuniary return to the subscriber is anticipated . Accordingly , sometimes , where the subscription was a mere bald promise by one individual to pay a sum toward a benevolent purpose , the courts have held he might change his mind if he pleased ; he could not be compelled to pay . But if a number of persons unite in a subscription , the engagement of each is supported by the promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the subscription is toward the expenses of something to be done , to build a church , for instance , and the Trustees build it , their trouble and expense become a consideration . And thus , in various ways , subscriptions , as ordinarily made in practice , are regarded by the courts as obligatory contracts , not as mere promises . In one case , the agent of Trustees of a college seeking to raise money promised that if Mr. So and So would give , the college would thereafter " hold its doors open upon all moral subjects , " and this promise was decided to be a sufficient consideration to support a note which Mr. So and So gave toward the fund . The subscription paper ought , like any other contract , to contain the terms of the engagement , clearly expressed , and especially if there are any conditions , they ought to be stated . It is not unlawful to subscribe upon a ' condition that an amount named shall be raised , but where this is the understanding , the paper should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the subscriber where he sought to prove a private understanding or au oral condition . The device of " decoy subscriptions " ? where a man puts down his name for $5,000 or $10 , - 000 , upon a private understanding that he is not to be called upon to pay it , he only signing in the expectation that his example and influence will induce others to do likewise  --  bas several times come up in the courts . Sometimes the canvassers for names forget all about the private understanding , and sue the generous man whose name heads the list , and he defends on the ground that he was only a decoy . The drift of the decisions is that this will not be permitted , for it is a fraud on all subsequent signers . A man is not allowed to falsify his written engagement by proof that he did not intend it in earnest , especially when other persons have believed it and , in consequence , have given their money to the same object . At other times some subscriber who follows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscription because he was enticed to make it by a fictitious one . Cases of this kind tend toward the rule that the defense is a valid one . A person who is led to promise money to an enterprise of which he personally knows little by seeing that a fellow-townsman of good standing and judgment has subscribed liberally , is cheated , if , in fact , the top subscription was a makebelieve one . He may expose the cheat and repudiate the promise it led him to make . In other words , the fictitious signer is bound and the honest ones are released by a decoy subscription . As an example of releasing an honest subscriber , a Missouri case may be mentioned . The subscription was for twenty-five shares of an insurance company which the canvassers were getting up . Mr. GANZHORN was shown a goodly list of names of solid men who had taken shares , which induced him to put down his name ; but when the company was organized and his money was demanded , he found that a number of the subscriptions above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were exhibited for the sole purpose of inducing ? him and others to sign . Lawsuit , and these facts shown in defense . The court held the defense good . Fraud vitiates every obligation , ' then its supposed basis of good faith and fair understanding of facts is found to have been illusory . A subscriber who has been in this manner imposed upon can not be compelled to nay , unless ho has ratified his engagement or co-operated in the affairs of the enterprise after he knew the fac ! s . Upon a question of fictitious subscriptions , it can not be out of order to cite fictitious authorities , and the case of Aludfiint , as reported in Warren 's " Ten Thousand aYear , " may be mentioned as illustrating how a clerical canvasser may fare upon decoy subscriptions , if they are brought into the courts , Rev. Smirk JIludtlint , having been east into jail for seditious or libelous lectures , bethought himself of a subscription among friends of free speech to help to pay his fine . He drew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 , ? 150 , and ? 100 , and then introduced , with the latter 's consent , a decoy subscription from a well-known and wealthy sympathizer of the neighborhood , Sir Rarkaway ROM Wildfire , Bart . Thus started , the pap : ? r was . ? published in the newspapers , and circulated for additional signatures . They gave it a somewhat tadpole appearance , tapering rapidly down through single pounds and shillings to mere pence . and amounting in all to only ? 3 . Brought into the Insolvent Debtors ' Court , and seeking a discharge , the reverend illudfiint was ? pressingly asked tt account for the ? 653 which by the subscription paper he appeared to have received . He explained that ? 3 was the total real subscription ; the others were decoys . Challenged to to prove this , he summoned Sir Harkaway Rotgut Wildfire , whom he confidently asked whether , for all his name appeared in the subscription list , he had ever given one farthing of the ? 50 there mentioned . Sir Rarkaway , having au eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in the habit of allowing his name to appear in such lists without having actually paid the sum named ; then he swore he thought he must have paid it ; then that he had very little doubt on the subject ; then that he had no doubt at all ; and , finally , that he recollected the circumstances distinctly . On this complete corroboration of the roguery of Mudflint , she was reprimanded severely and remanded indefinitely , the whole court believing that ho had appropriated to his own use every farthing of the ? 650.
