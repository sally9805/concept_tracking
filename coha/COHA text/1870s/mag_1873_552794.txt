of . Mr. Greg 's Enigmas of Life is neither a collection of puzzles nor a guide-book to Utopia , but a series of chapters with the following titles : Realizable Ideals , Malthus Notwithstanding , Non-survival of the Fittest , Limits and Directions of Human Development , The Significance of Life , De Profundis , Elsewhere , - vague-sounding names for his discussion of some of the questions which are continually calling for the attention of every thoughtful man . He is far from coming to their consideration from what is the common and somewhat conventional starting-point for the treatment of such questions , namely , one of theological partisanship ; nor , on the other hand , does he stand aloof , regarding them unsympathetically , from the outside . He everywhere , as he is careful to tell us in his Preface , assumes the existence of a Creator , and of a continued life beyond the grave . With regard to this life and the difficulties which beset it , he writes with a temperate optimism , a subdued hope in the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we can all hope may yet be done , when men will do what they know to be best . He looks forward with hope to the time when science will be more systematically directed to the improvement of the condition of men , when its laws will have more weight in controlling human conduct , when the human race will give to itself the attention which it gives to everything else in the world . Not , it is hardly necessary to say , that he expects human beings to be transformed into faultless machines ; but he does expect a slow improvement in the world , with regard to sanitary laws , control of the passions , treatment of others , lawmaking , etc . Nowhere does he give a series of practical directions which shall set the world running in a smooth groove , and teach its inhabitants calmly to sit by and rejoice over their own perfection and happiness : he tuerely indicates what may be done , but with no expectation that life will ever be too easy . His mode of treating other questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best seen by an extract : " Of the dark riddles and incomprehensive anomalies and strange perplexities of which life is full , some , very few , we can unravel ; of others we can discern just enough to guess at the solution . The deepest and the saddest must ever remain to try our faith , and to grieve our hearts . We see enough to make us believe there is a solu tion , and that that solution is such as will accord with the serene perfections of the Godhead The infinite slowness with which man marches to his final goal ; the feebleness and vacillation with which he works out his allotted destiny ; his frequent apparent retrogressions into barbarism and iniquity ; the ebbs and flows df the tide of civilization , - to all these we nay be reconciled by the supposition that perhaps the imperfect conditions of our Being render this progress at once the surest and fastest possible . But there are stranger and gloomier perplexities than these . There are chastisements that do not chasten ; there are trials that do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pains and privations that harden the tender heart , without softening the stubborn will ; there is light that leads astray ' ; there are virtues that dig their own grave . " In this extract he does no more than state the difficulties which are forever presenting themselves to all who are not engrossed with material cares . Perhaps as curious a thing to observe in this book is the way in which everything is treated by the light of the intellect alone , or , rather , more nearly alone than is generally the truth . All that the intellect can do is to state the case ; it can hardly do anything further , any more than the emotions can be of use in science , say , in the study of chemistry . Still , even to state fairly these baffling problems , to look at them dispassionately , is more than most do . It is healthful to the mind , it is a preservative against morbidness , as well as against overweening self-confidence . In conclusion , we would warmly commend the book as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always agitating the human mind , and now and notably by this author discussed with great fairness . He nowhere lifts the veil of mystery that overhangs the universe ; but he does a good deal towards removing the obscurity that enshrouds much of what lies between what man can consciously amend , and what he must leave to time to set right and , possibly , explain . - Everystudent of history , and especially of ancient history , will gladly welcome a volume of Mr. Freeman 's Essays , in which he collects much of his work that has been contributed to various English reviews and journals during the last fifteen years . Before presenting them anew to the reader , he has given them a careful revision , scrupulously correcting former statements by // frequent foot-notes , and omitting much that time has made too familiar or less useful at the present day . As we have said , this volume contains his writings on ancient history , and of , perhaps , the widest interest will be found the essays on Curtius 's History of Greece and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses himself in blind admiration of what he is writing about , and we can not help feeling grateful to him for his good words for Grote , whom he is by no means disposed to lay on the shelf in his devotion to his later German rival . Nor , we take it , is he carping in what he says about Curtius . He says : " It is really wonderful how many histories of Greece may be written , each of them thoroughly good in its own way , and yet none of which allows us to dispense with the others . We believe that the impetuous generation which now presides over education at Oxford has long ago thrown Bishop Thirlwall behind the fire . Yet no rational English student of Grecian history would think that he had mastered his subject , unless he had compared both Thirlwall and Grote with one another , and with the original writers . So now , though we should recommend every such student to read Curtius without fail , we in nowise hold that his readng of Curtius at all lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirlwall also . " And furthermore : " In a subject like Grecian or Roman history , it is specially mischievous to rely on any one modern guide . Each writer , if he is fit for his work , will suggest valuable matter for thought ; but none of them can be entitled to implicit submission . Each will look at things differently , according to his natural turn of mind , according to his place of birth , his political party , and the many other influences which affect a man 's point , of view . One writer will succeed best in one part of his subject , another in another . Thirlwall , Grote , Curtius , others besides , all have their use ; each teaches something which the others do not teach ; each is the strongest in some particular part of their common subject . A careful student will read and weigh them all , but he will decline to pledge himself as the bond-slave of any one among them . " With these words we think our readers will agree , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remember , can call themselves students of Grecian and Roman history ; for it is the historian , after all , it might not be unfair to say , who leaves the impression on the reader 's mind . A few pages , consisting of an article reprinted from the Saturday Review , contain his charges against Mommsen , the reading of whose work is nowadays held to be the crowning piece of a thorough education . He gives him credit for all his good qualities , which do , indeed , deserve praise , but he blames him for his abuse of certain men , such as Pompey , Cato , and , specially , of Cicero . He objects also to his inaccuracy in defining the position of Sulla and C*sar by the terms Regent and King , respectively . The most serious charge is that of his indifference to the notions of right and wrong . " He can not understand , " Mr. Freeman says , " that a small state can have any rights against a great one , or that a patriot in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , Mommsen is a human being with prejudices like all the rest of us . But that fact does not establish his innocence . With all Mr. Freeman 's praise of Mr. Grote , there are long discussions of his treatment of the Athenian democracy , and of Alexander the Great , in which he tempers his approbation with blame . The essay on Mr. Gladstone 's Homer and the Homeric Age was an excellent one at the time , but , from the point of view from which it was written , it reads now like slaughtering the dead , at least as far as the influence of the book in this country is concerned . The essays on The Historians of Athens , Lucius Cornelius Sulla , and the Flavian C*sars , will all be found interesting read . ing . In the first named , specially , the author is at his best , in the discrimination between the three great historians of Greece . The last two are important chapters to any student of Roman history . Everywhere in this volume , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of thoroughness , and an earnest seeking of exactness . There is a certain pugnacity in the manner ; but the writer is very careful to fix himself on facts , to make sure of his ground before hazardin*r rash statements . It will be found to be a very suggestive book . // ART . THE second annual exhibition of drawings from the free industrial-drawing classes and the Boston public schools has amply justified all who have encouraged or believed in the movement from which it results . The public-school drawings indicate the character of work which every pupil in every Boston school is at present engaged with . Six specimens were selected from the every-day work of each class in every municipal school , making a total of some twenty thousand elementary drawings . These , it must be remembered , are the result of the obligatory study of drawing in the common schools , and quite independent of the free industrial classes . They show , however , the sort of education which should precede that now carried on in those classes , in order to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were arranged under the general heads of primary , and the six grades of grammar schools , and finally high and normal schools , and the Latin School . A second subdivission into five classes explains the character of study involved in each drawing . The five exercises adopted by the State director of art education . are : drawing ( i ) from blackboard , ( 2 ) from flat copy , ( 3 ) from dictation , ( 4 ) from memory , and ( 5 ) original designs . It had been intended to introduce a sixth exercise , namely , geometrical drawing ; but the expense of providing instruments has made a postponement necessary . It will be seen , however , that the system at present practised is sufficient to call intcl play a considerable variety of perceptions , the development of which is vitally essential to success in the subsequent study of the art . In drawing from the blackboard , the pupils are required to diminish , and in drawing from the flat copy , on the other hand , to enlarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , serves to impress upon the minds of the very young students , who form so large a proportion in these schools , the definitions of various lines , and to cultivate the sense of their relation one to another . In the drawing from memory , some particular example previously studied is referred to , by number , by the teacher , and the pupil is then obliged to recall or recreate it on paper . This is an admirable provision . Nothing can be more important , in the plastic arts , than to cultivate the ability for remembering form . It is well , therefore , that the educator 's hand should be set to this particul*r part of the wheel , at an early period in the cultivation of the individual artistic faculty . The mode of calling out original design should be noticed . The teacher draws for the pupil the several factors of the proposed design ; giving him , for example , the conventional outline of the ivy-leaf , with a cluster of berries , or , perhaps , two clusters , varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pupil is required to work up his design , in pure outline , filling with it a given space of a fixed shape . The variety and predominant good taste and frequent grace which characterize these designs is extraordinary . We find among them sketches by children from ten to fifteen years old which might well be recommended to some of the professed designers who prepare for us their gaudy discomfort of decoration , not only in railroad cars , but also in much more venerable and permanent structures . A good many specimens of map-drawing were displayed , - a less creditable exercise , and only existing , we believe , on sufferance ; though , to be sure , it offers an opportunity for applying the acquired skill of the eye to the gaining of useful knowledge . At bottom , it is not very discordant with the whole principle of the public-school art instruction , which is empathically this : that drawing should not be recognized as a specialty , but only regarded as a means , until the high school is reached . Up to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto generally neglected , - a quickening of the sight . Shading is not permitted in the primary or grammar schools , the entire effort being concentrated upon outline , and the subjects are all very simple . The high and normal schools displayed some excellent drawings from objects , with all the repose of rounding shade and liquid light which could be expected . Many of the students of this grade , however , have been obliged to confine themselves to subjects on a level with those of the lower schools , for want of proper previous training ; and there are only two instances of an effort to reproduce natural objects , - one a study // from a sprig of budding willow , and another from apple-blossoms , - a scarcity we must regret . But when it is considered that the teachers in the public schools have themselves been obliged to learn , within a short time , what they have imparted to their pupils , it is impossible not to feel a delightful surprise at the already fine fruits of their labors . We next come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were represented this year , several that contributed last year haying , for unknown or insufficient reasons , dropped out , and others'not havingyet made up their minds to enter the ranks of progress . There were also independent contributions from the architectural class of the Institute of Technology , and the Lowell free School of Practical Design ( also connected with the Institute ) ; and , while the former offered an illustration of what might be hoped for in future , ' in the way of instrumental drawing , from the advancing industrial classes , the latter - the School of Practical Design - only illustrated the abortive nature of all instruction expended upon people who have not been developed by some such sufficient system as thatwhich is now in its second year and may be ' expected soon to supply the Lowell school with better material . The number of instrumental drawings in this collection from the industrial schools was about six hundred , and of free-hand about five hundred . The difference in the quality of work from different quarters illustrated very clearly the importance of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display was very strong , owing to the good provision made in that city ; while Newburyport , with doubtless good intentions , was able to do almost nothing , owing to a corresponding lack of provision . From the Boston Evening High School , and the Haverhill Industrial Art-School came an imposing array of mechanical drawings . Particularly noticeable was a set of working designs for a dwellinghouse , by a boy of fourteen , indicating an easy mastery of his subject . The contributions of the South Boston Art-School , too , deserve special notice . Organized only in December , 1872 , it has , within less than five months , reached such a point of practical efficiency as to present to the public , at this exhibition , nearly a hundred drawings , shaded and in outline , free-hand and instrumental . Most of the drawings of - mouldings , etc. , and from the human form , such as would be better if done from plaster , have , we see , been drawn from the copy . The same thing occurs in the beginners ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably only owing to the lack of a sufficient supply of casts . The most interesting among the beginners ' work , in the latter school , was a Theseus of the Pantheon , by a stuccb-worker of twenty . A wonderful progress was visible in the work of the advanced section . The greater number of its drawings are finished in the English style ; but several examples of the French method were also offered , which , with ' its greater Ioldness , - the principle being to learn through an energetic commission and correction of error , - will furnish an excellent complement to the Kensington method . A particularly praiseworthy work of the latter kind was a crayondrawing by W. B. Closson from a cast of Donatello 's St. Cecilia , the very low and delicately varied relief of which make it a difficult subject . The stump , we see , is still freely used , even in this finest work ; and we could wish to see some instances of finish with the unaided crayon or pencil point . Taken all in all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Massachusetts have been thus far highly satisfactory in their results , and warrant the hope of a robust maturity for a scheme still in its infancy . The most pressing immediate want appears to he that of competent teachers ; and before that can be met , a normal school for them is absolutely necessary .. Moreover , there is still a good deal of apathy to be combated , in quarters where it should not exist , as , for instance , in Lowell , a city which should have seen to it that its industrial drawings had been better in the recent exhibition . - When Charles Knight went to his honored rest , a few weeks ago , the world was poorer by the loss of a man who had spent his whole life , and earnestly used all his powers , in the service of popular education . It is for others to relate the various ways in which he worked at his high task ; one of them only concerns us here , - the efforts he made to reproduce , for the instruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in engraving and painting the costliness and rarity of which confine them ' to the custody of public museums or shut them up in the cabinets and portfolios of private collectors . This useful and elevating work was always done in connection with the cheap books he was forever planning and executing . Accurate and interest- // Ar ! . ing information made his illustrations of famous work doubly valuable ; and if the fashion of much that he accomplished in these illustrations is a little strange to our time , and falls far behind in artistic excellence the work done by the London Illustrated News , the London Graphic , or the French publications so little known among us , yet so well deserving to be known , - lie Magazin Pittoresque , lie Tour die Monde ,  - -  we must blame Mr. Knight 's time for this , and not him . He did the best he could ; employed the best artists he could get to work for him ; and few Were the artists of note who would condescend to work for cheap publications in those days . Stothard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but almost all their work was engraved on steel , and for the most part was for books that , by reason either of their price or their subjects , had no circulation among the masses . In the time of Mr. Knight 's greatest activity , wood-engraving was the cheapest process of art-reproduction known , for lithography was then in its infancy . And lithography was really no substitute , for it can not be used in connection with typeprinting , and it is as dependent on the artist as wood-engraving itself . A process was wanted by which copies of drawings and engravings could be made cheaply and quickly , without the intervention of a person to reproduce the originals upon metal , wood , or stone being first necessary . Even the invention of the photograph - still for us in its infancy - came too late for the founders of the Penny Magazine and the Library of Entertaining Knowledge ; and it must be confessed that it is only very lately we have been any b*tter off than they were . The invention of the photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no discovery so great , in its relation to the great problem of desseininating instruction among the people , since the invention of printing . Photolithography , too , was an invention that promised much , more , perhaps , than it has been able to perform ; but it is a troublesome , expensive , and uncertain process , and has not yet done more than prove to us the possibility of doing something . Yet one can fancy the interest with which a quick-witted , ingenious man like Knight , eager to use his wit and his ingenuity for the benevolent purposes that filled his mind , would have watched the development of Daguerre 's great discovery , as , kindling from contact with minds August , akin to that of the ingenious Frenchman , it pushed rapidly on from the daguerreotype to the Talbot-type , the photograph , the photolithograph , the zinc-type , and other variations , until at length it culminated in the popular invention of the heliotype . What , would these great educators have said could they have held in their hands these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be known only to amateurs and collectors - now put before the public at prices merely nominal ? For the heliotype , is , in reality , the first practical solution of this important problem . The well-to-do amateur , if not rich enough to collect the original etchings and engravings of the masters , - and it takes money in these days to indulge the taste even to a moderate extent , - can , at least , come very near to the originals by purchasing the copies furnished by the French processes , Photogravure and Heliogravure ,  --  processes by which have been secured the most perfect fac-similes that have ever been obtained ; so perfect , in fact , as to leave nothing to be desired . The first named of these two processes * has thus far been principally applied to the reproduction of modern work ; though if we rightly understand that the copy of Antonello da Messina 's magnificent portrait of a Condottiere in the Louvre is taken direct from the original painting , there is opened a new and unexpected door of discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copying pictures . The secondnamed process , that of Heliogravure , is only known to us by its results in the important publication , Etchings and Engravings of the Old Masters chosen from the most celebrated Collections ; t but in this * The process Photogravure has not been employed thus far in any serial publication , but a halfdozen plates have been issued in Paris by Goupil &amp; Co . The following are the subjects : E. Detaille , Grenadier di la garde Zmte'ria ? e - Tenue di Cam5agne . This is , we believe , from a water-color drawing , and the copy has all the appearance of a fine drawing in Incha ink . Ingres , Portrait of a Lady , s8r3 . This is from a pencil-drawing , and the effect is well given . Jules Br6ton , Li Re'colle des Pornines-de-lerre . This is probably from the original sketch in crayons of the famous picture .

But these publications , splendid and satisfying as they are , are not for the use of the large number of people who wish to be instructed in regard to the master works of etching and engraving , but whose means are small . The portfolios of M. Amand-Durand and of Goupil &amp; Co. are not intended to meet the wants of the same class that were taught by the Penny Magazine , and the little books on Pompeii , the Elgin marbles and the Townley gallery of the Useful Knowledge Society , the class that to-day depend on the Illustrated News and the IWagazin Pi/toresque . They will welcome , rather , the coming of the heliotype , which gives them a cheap , sufficient guide into the pleasant domain of the engraver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can push the study of it as he has leisure and opportunity . The mechanical processes by which the heliotype prints are produced have been so often explained , and are so simple , that we do not need to repeat them here . The pictures made by heliotypy differ from those made by either of the French processes , " Heliogravure " or " Photogravure , " in that there is nothing like what is implied in th' word gravure , no process of engraving used . They are simply photographs printed in printers ' ink at an ordinary printing-press . They are produced with great rapidity , and independently of light ; they are as permanent as engravings ; they require no mounting , but come from the press with clean margins , finished and ready for binding or framing . We are not concerned here either with the mechanical processes of the heliotype or with its application to the industrial arts , with the cheapness and facility with which it can multiply copies of plans , documents , architects ' and engineers ' designs , etc. , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as an educator in the arts of etching and engraving . This seems to us a work of quite inestimable value ; there mus*t be many people to whom it will come as a real helper and benefactor . And yet , after all , it makes but a modest offer .

Of these great artists it can give us all of certain qualities that go to make their greatness , and it can give us much of the rest ; and even of what we are as yet obliged to resign ourselves to doing without , - there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to give us that too . The defects of many of the most important prints thus far published are owing , not to the process , but to the fact that the originals from which the copies were made were - though the best that could then be procured - far from satisfactory impressions . Of course , the better the impressions , the better the results ; and if the publishers ' offer - not only to take the best possible care of prints intrusted to them for copying , but to insure them to their full value - could be met , as it has been in at least one case , by a generous response , the public would be greatly benefited . For we may say that the wonderful results obtained by the publishers of the French Heliogravure process are largely due to the fact that in every case , or nearly every case , the print copied . has been loaned for the purpose by some one of the famous collectors , either M. Firmin Didot or M. Dutuit , or M. Gallichon , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the qualities and accidents that make the hearts of connoisseurs leap up , these examples may be said to be unique . Now , we have very fine Rembrandts , Diirers , Lucas van Leydens , Marc Anto. nios in this country , in private hands , and if American collectors know how to be as generous as collectors in Europe , we may easily carry the production of the heliotype press to a much higher point than we have yet reached , though that is no despicable point either . As it is , we venture to ask for them a wider circulation , and a circulation in all places where the young can see them , and be taught by them . In the children 's playroom , on the school-room wall , these prints will be at home , and they are so cheap that they may easily be given out as prizes or rewards in schools asTd classes . This , to our thinking , is their chief value ,  --  the ease with ' which they enable the young and the people of small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists of whom a world of writing has been written , but here in America scarcely anything ever seen . // MU SI C. FOR music-lovers in America the great event of the season has been the performance of Mr. Paine 's oratorio , St. Peter , at Portland , June 3 . This event is important , not only as the first appearance of an American oratorio , but also as the first direct proof we have had of the existence of creative musical genius in this country . For Mr. Paine 's Mass in D - a work which was brought out with great success several years ago in Berlin - has , for some reason or other , not particularly to the credit , one would think , of our best known choral associations , never been performed here . And , with the exception of Mr. Paine , we know of no American hitherto who has shown either the genius or the culture requisite for writing music in the grand style , although there is some of the Kapellmeister music , written by our leading organists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such works as Mr. Dudley Buck 's Fortysixth Psalm or Mr. Whiting 's Mass in C minor - admirably performed at Mount Pleasant , Boston Highlands , some two or three years ago - may bear a comparison with the best modern English music by Costa or Bennett , a higher place must be claimed for Mr. Paine . Concerning the rank likely to be assigned by posterity to St. Peter it would be foolish now to speculate ; and it would be unwise to bring it into direct comparison with masterpieces like the Messiah , Elijah , and St. Paul , the greatness of which ' has been so long acknowledged . Longer familiarity with the work is needed before such comparisons , always of somewhat doubtful value , can be profitably , undertaken . But it must at least be said , as the net result of our impressions derived from the performance at Portland , that Mr. Paine 's oratorio has fairly earned for itself the right to be judged by the same high standard which we apply to these noble works of Mendelssohn and H*indel . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general structure of the work . The founding of Christianity , as illustrated in four principal scenes of the life of St. Peter , supplies the material for the dramatic development of the subject . The overture , beginning with an adagio movement in B-flat minor , gives expression to the vague yearnings of that time of doubt and hesitancy when the " Oracles were dumb , " and the dawning of a new era of stronger and diviner faith was matter of presentiment rather than of definite hope or expectation . Though the tonality is at first firmly established , yet as the movement becomes more agitated , the final tendency of the modulations also becomes uncertain , and for a few bars it would seem as if the key of F-sharp minor might be the point of destination . But after a short melody by the wind instruments , accompanied by a rapid upward ' movement of strings , the dominant chord of C major asserts itself , being repeated , with sundry inversions , through a dozen bars , and leading directly into , the triumphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the kingdom of heaven is at hand . " The second subject , introduced by the word " repent " descending through the interval of a diminished seventh and contrasted with the florid counterpoint of the phrase , " and believe the glad tidings of God , " is a masterpiece of contrapuntal. writing , and , if performed by a choir of three hundrecf or four hundred voices , . would produce an overpowering effect . The divine call of Simon Peter and his brethren is next described , in a tenor recitative ; and the acceptance of the glad ti- ' dings is expressed in an aria , " The spirit of the Lord is upon me , " which , by an original but appropriate ' conception , is given to the soprano voice . In the next number , the disciples are dramatically represented by twelve basses and tenors , singmb in four-part harmony , and alternating or combining with the full chorus in description of the aims of the new religion . The proem ends with the choral , " How lovely ' shines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew xvi . 14 - iS , where Peter declares his master to be " the Christ , the Son of tl4e living God , " ' - one of the most impressive scenes , we have always thought , in the gospel history , and here not inadequately treated . The feeling of mysterious and awful grandeur awakened by Peter 's bold exclamation , , " Thou art the Christ , " is powerfully rendered by the entrance of the trombones . // upon the inverted subdominant triad of Csharp minor , and their pause upon the dominant of the same key . Throughout this scene the characteristic contrast between the ardent vigor of Peter and the sweet serenity of Jesus is well delineated in the music . After Peter 's stirring aria , " My heart is glad , " the dramatic climax is reached in the C-major chorus , " The Church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets . " The second scene is carried out to somewhat greater length , corresponding nearly to the last half of the first part o* ' Elijah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prophets of Baal . In the opening passages of mingled recitative and arioso , Peter is forewarned that he shall deny his Master , and his half-indignant remonstrance is sustained , with added emphasis , by the voices of the twelve disciples , pitched a fourth higher . Then Judas comes , with a great multitude , and Jesus is carried before the high-priest . The beautiful F-minor chorus , " We hid our faces from him , " furnishes the musical comment upon the statement that " the disciples all forsook him and fled . " We hardly dare to give full expression to our feelings about this chorus ( which during the past month has been continually singing itself over and over again in our recollection ) , lest it should be supposed that our enthusiasm has got the better of our sober judgment . The second theme , " He was brought as a lamb to the slaughter , yet he opened not his mouth , " is quite Handel-like in the simplicity and massiveness of its ' magnificent harmonic progressions . With the scene of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic movement becomes exceedingly rapid , and the rendering of the events in the high-priest 's hall - Peter 's bass recitative alternating its craven protestations with the clamorous agitato chorus of the servants - is stirring in the extreme . The contralto aria describing the Lord 's turning and looking upon Peter is followed by the orchestra with a lament in B-flat minor , introducing the bass aria of the repentant and remorsestricken disciplt , " 0 God , my God , forsake me not . " As the last strains of the lamentation die away , a choir of angels is heard , of sopranos and contraltos divided , singing , " Remember from whence thou art fallen , " to an accompaniment of harps . The second theme , " He that overcometh shall receive a crown of life , " is introduced in full chorus , in a cheering allegro movement , preparing the way for a climax higher than any yet reached in the course of the work . This climax - delayed for a few moments by an andante aria for a contralto voice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursts upon us with a superb crescendo of strings , and the words , " Awake , thou that sleepest , arise from the dead , and Christ shall give thee light . " This chorus , which for reasons presently to be given was heard at considerable disadvantage at Portland , contains some of the best fugue-writing in the work , and is especially rich and powerful in its instrumentation . The second part of the oratorio begins with the crucifixion and ascension of Jesus . Here we must note especially the deeply pathetic opening chorus , " The Son of Man was delivered into the hands of sinful men , " the joyous allegro , " And on the third day he rose again , " the choral , " Jesus , my Redeemer , lives , " and the quartet , " Feed the flock of God , " commenting upon the , command of Jesus , " Feed my lambs . " This quartet has all the heavenly sweetness of Handel 's " He shall feed his flock , " which it suggests by similarity of subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain quality of inwardness , or religious meditativeness , it reminds one more of Mr. Paine 's favorite master , Bach . The choral , like the one in the first part and the one which follows the scene of Pentecost , is taken from the Lutheran Choral Book , and arranged with original harmony and instrumentation , in accordance with the custom of Bach , Mendelssohn , and other composers , " of introducing into their sacred compositions the old popular choral melodies which are the peculiar , offspring of a religious age . " Thus the noblest choral ever written , the " Sleepers , wake , " in St. Paul , was composed in 1604 by Pr*etorius , the harmonization and accompaniment , only being the work of Mendelssohn . In St. Peter , as in Elijah , the second part , while forming the true musical climax of the oratorio , admits of a briefer description than the first part . The wave of emotion answering to the sensuously dramatic element having partly spent itself , the wave of lyric emotion gathers flesh strength , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaltation , while , nevertheless , there is not so much which one can describe to others who may not // happen to have gone through with the same experience . Something of the same feeling one gets in studying Dante 's Paradiso , after finishing the preceding divisions of his poem : there is less which can be pictured to the eye of sense , or left to be supplied by the concrete imagination . Nevertheless , in the scene of Pentecost , which follows that of the Ascension , there is no lack of dramatic vividness . Indeed , there is nothing in the work more striking than the orchestration of the introductory tenor recitative , the mysterious chorus , * The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire , " or the amazed query which follows , " Behold , are not all these who speak Galileans ? and how is it that we every one hear them in our own tongue wherein we were burn ? " We have heard the opinion expressed that Mr. Paine 's oratorio must be lacking in originality , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this suggestion , it seems to us , is due partly to the similarity of the subjects , independently of any likeness in the modes of treatment , and partly , perhaps , to the fact that Mr. Paine , as well as Mendelssohn , has been a devoted student of Bach , whose characteristics are so strong that they may well have left their mark upon the works of both composers . But especially it would seem that there is some real , though very general , resemblance between this colloquial chorus , " Behold , " etc. , and some choruses in St. Paul , as , for example , Nos. 29 and 36- 38 . In the same way the scene in the high-priest 's hall might distantly suggest either of these passages , or others in Elijah . These resemblances , however , are very superficial , pertaining not to the musical but to the dramatic treatment of situations which are generically similar in so far , and only in so far , as they represent conversational passages between an apostle or prophet and an ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violent excitement . As regards the musical elaboration of these terse and striking alternations of chorus and recitative , its originality can be questioned only after we have decided to refer all originality on such matters to Bach , or , indeed , evenbehind him , into the Middle Ages . After the preaching of Peter , and the sweet contralto aria , " As for man , his days are as grass , the culmination of this scene comes in the D-major chorus , " This is the witness of God . " What follows , beginning with the choral , " Praise to the Fa ther , " is to be regarded as an epilogue or peroration to the whole work . It is in accordance with a sound tradition that the grand sacred drama of an oratorio should conclude with a lyric outburst of thanksgiving , a psalm of praise to the Giver of every good and perfect gift . Thus , after Peter 's labors are ended in the aria , " Now as ye were redeemed , " in which the twelve disciples and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sing unto God , " brings us to the grand final chorus in C major , " Great and marvellous are thy works , Lord God Almighty . " The cadence of this concluding chorus reminds us that one of the noteworthy Points in the oratorio is the character of its cadences . The cadence prepared by the * chord , now become so hackneyed from its perpetual and wearisome repetition in popular church music , seems to be especially disliked by Mr. Paine , as it occurs but once or twice in the course of the work . In the great choruses the cadence is usually reached either by a pedal on the tonic , as in the chorus , " Awake , thou that sleepest , " or by a pedal on the dominant culminating in a chord of the major ninth , as in the final chorus ; or there is a plagal cadence , as in the first chorus of the second part ; or , if the * chord is introduced , as it is in the chorus , " He that overcometh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of the divided sopranos . We do not remember noticing anywhere such a decided use of the * chord as is made , for example , by Mendelssohn , in " Thanks be to God , " or in the final chorus of St. Paul . Perhaps if we were to confess our lingering fondness for the cadence prepared by the * chord , When not too free quently introduced , it might only show that we retain a liking for New England " psalmtunes " ; but it does seem to us that a sense of final repose , of entire cessation of movement , is more effectually secured by this cadence than by any other . Yet while the * cadence niost completely expresses finality and rest , it would seem that the plagal and other cadences above enumerated as preferred by Mr. Paine have a certain sort of superiority by reason of the very incompleteness with which they express finality . There is no sense of finality whatever about the Phrygian cadence ; it leaves the mind occupied with the feeling of a boundless region beyond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason it has , in sacred music , a great value . Something // of the same feeling , too , attaches to those cadences in which an unexpected major third usurps the place of the minor which the ear was expecting , as in the " Incarnatus " of Mozart 's Twelfth Mass . In a less degree , an analogous effect was produced upon us by the cadence with a pedal on the tonic , in the choruses , " The Church is built , " and " Awake , thou that sleepest . " On these considerations it may become intelligible that , to some hearers , Mr. Paine 's cadences have seemed unsatisfactory , their ears have missed the positive categorical assertion of finality which the * cadence alone can give . To go fur . ther into this subject would take us far beyond our limits . We must conclude with a few words as to the manner in which this great composition was first brought before the public . The pleasant little town of Portland has reason to congratulate itself , first , on being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondly , on having been the place where the first great work of America in the domain of music was brought out ; andthirdly , on possessing what is probably the most thoroughly disciplined choral society in this country . More artistic chorus-singing it has never been our lot to hear . Our New York friends , after their recent experiences , will perhaps be slow to believe us when we say that the Portland choir sang this new Work even better than the Handel and Hayden society sing the old and familiar Elijah ; but it is true . In their command of the pianissimo and the gradual crescendo , and in the precision of their attack , the Portland singers can easily teach the Handel and Haydn a quarter 's lessons . And , besides all this , they know how to preserve their equanimity under the gray . est persecutions of the orchestra ; keeping the even tenor of their way where a less disciplined choir , incited by the excessive blare of the trombones and the undue scraping of the second violins , would inevitably lose its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No doubt it is easier to achieve perfect chorus-singing with a choir of one hundred and twenty-five voices than with a choir of six hundred . But this diminutive size , which was an advantage so far as concerned the performance of the Portland choir , was decidedly a disadvantage so far as concerned the proper rendering of the more massive choruses in St. Peter . All the greatest choruses - such as Nos. i , 8 , 19 , 20 , 28 , 35 , and 39 - were seriously impaired in the rendering by the lack of massiveness in the voices . For example , the grand chorus , " Awake , thou that sleepest , " begins with a rapid crescendo of strings , introducing the full chorus on the word " Awake , " upon the dominant triad of D major ; and after a couple of beats the voices are *r*inforced by the trombones , producing the most tremendous effect possible in such a crescendo . To us this effect was very disagreeable ; and it was obviously contrary to the effect intended by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred voices , the effect would be entirely different . Instead of entering upon the scene as intruders , the mighty trombones would only serve to swell and enrich the ponderous chord which opens this noble chorus . Given greater weight only , and the performance of the admirable Portland choir would have left nothing to be desired . We can not speak with so much satisfaction of the performance of the orchestra . The instrumentation of St. Peter is wonderfully excellent . But this instrumentation was rather clumsily rendered by the orchestra , whose doings constituted the least enjoyable part of the performance . There was too much blare of brass , whine of hautboy , and scraping of strings . But in condonation of this serious defect , one must admit that the requisite amount of rehearsal is out of the question when one 's choir is in Portland and one 's orchestra in Boston ; besides which the parts had been inaccurately copied . For a moment , at the beginning of the orchestral lament , there was risk of disaster , the wind instruments failing to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fortunate presence of mind , stopped the players , and the movement was begun over again ,  --  the whole occurring so quickly and quietly as hardly to attract attention . The solo parts were , in the main , admi. rably done . Of Miss Phillips and Messrs . Osgood and Rudolphsen , it is unnecessary to speak . The soprano , Mrs. Weatherbee , of Portland , showed thorough culture and true artistic feeling ; but , urged by too generous an enthusiasm , and trusting in a very powerful and flexible voice , she too frequently took part in the chorus , so that , toward the last , she showed signs of overexertion. // POLITICS . THE announcement made by General Butler that he is to be candidate for the governorship of Massachusetts has already turned public attention upon the approaching canvass in this State . To judge from the newspapers , General Butler 's chances in the East , and the Farmers ' movement in the West , are the two most important political matters now before the people . On the face of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of voters , which has already swept out of existence , so far as one State is concerned , both the parties which have governed the country for the last generation , and bids fair to destroy them altogether , - that such an uprising as this should , in public interest , be almost outweighed by the vulgar struggles for power of a local demagogue , seems at the first blush to argue a universal want of what might be called a sense of political perspective ; But the public are , nevertheless , quite right . The approaching campaign in Massachusetts is as important a campaign as any which has taken place in the country for many a year . It is of consequence , not with reference to the governorship of Massachusetts ,  --  an office which is in itself of small value ,  --  but as an indication of the direction in which the political current is moving . Writing at this distance in time from the Republican Convention , it is impossible to tell what startling changes in public sentiment may be produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they exhibit themselves at the opening of the canvass , one of the most striking things to notice is the evident tendency of people in Massachusetts to look on at the contest as if it were one in which they themselves had no immediate right or opportunity to influence . They have , indeed , some reason for doing so . When the professional politician 's study of politics has arrived at such a pitch of perfection that he is enabled to predict future events with an almost astronomical certainty , it is not surprising the mass of the public should listen to his words with a profound conviction that what he says is likely to happen , though they may know , as a matter of legal theory , that it lies entirely with themselves whether the predictions shall come true or not .. That Butler was to be governor of the State was foretold nearly a year ago , as part of a series of political changes " to arrive " ; all of them , except this last of the list , have already actually happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the newspapers shortly after Grant 's re-election , he ' will find that it was announced by all sorts ' of correspondents entitled to credit for various sorts of inspiration , that certain things ' would sooner or later take place . Mr. Boutwell would resign his office as Secretary of the Treasury , and the Massachusetts Legislature would proceed shortly thereafter to ballot for a United States senator in place of Mr. Wilson , and their balloting would result in the election of Mr. Boutwell . At the same time , Mr. William . A. Richardson , Mr. Boutwell 's assistant and double , would be appointed Secretary , vice ' Mr. Boutwell , resigned . In the third place General Butler would enter the field for the governorship of Massachusetts . In the fourth place the regular Republican Convention would nominate him , and the people would elect him . It was also simultaneously announced that these predictions were each and all utterly unwarranted ; that no one had any authority to say what would be done by Mr. Boutwell , General Butler , Mr. Richardson , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or who would resign . Whether these denials were made for the purpose of giving the predictions more weight , it is , of course , impossible to say ; but that was certainly their effect . The public , instead of troubling itself with doubts as to its duty in the matter , began to take a sort of spectacular interest in the verification of the prophecy . They looked on at the conjuring , on which the curtain soon rose , with amusement ; and as the magical transformations began to take place , wonder at the strange skill possessed by the conductors of the entertainment gradually took the place of all other emotions . All the feats have now been performed , except the one last on the bill ; and as the short intermission between the jousts has given the performers an opportunity for a careful examination and preparation of their flies , traps , and wires , the spectators feel that they are // Politics . pretty sure to see the whole bill successfully performed . To those in whose eyes politics is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there seems to be reason for a darker and more fatalistic view of politics than this . They know the reason why it is possible to make predictions in politics , and what are the hidden forces the knowledge - of which enables a few men to gain the apparent control of the very will and mind of the public . Having succeeded , though with great difficulty , in defeating General Butler in his attempt to get possession of the governorship of Massachusetts two years ago , they are better able to appreciate the character of the influences which have since then been gradually affecting an improvement in his fortunes , and sometimes now seem too strong to be successfully resisted . When , - two years ago , General Butler announced that he was going to offer himself as candidate , he had not secured the active support of the administration , and of the reformed civil service ; he had not , as he has since , become an organic part of the administration machinery itself . How powerful that machinery is we know . The administration , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices , is today the strongest of the many corporations , private and public , which in reality divide among them the power supposed in the eye of the law to belong to the people of the United States . In whatever way we look at the political body which for the past twelve years has been governing the country , we can not doubt that the machinery is admirably adapted to its object . Like the force which moves the wheels of a huge factory , it makes itself felt in the remotest corner of the structure . The force which - seems to be isolated and local comes in reality from the centre of the whole , and is as irresistible at one point as at another . The internal-revenue offices , the customhouses , the district-attorneyships , " All are but parts of one stupendous whole . " The administration is the figure-head . It is this machinery which , in Massachusetts , General Butler directs ; and it is the irresistible force keeping this machinery in - motion that renders many people hopeless of successfully opposing him . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler 's triumph would certainly be evidence that this fatalistic feeling was right . It would show that , no matter how 253 grave objections there are to a man , he can with ease get whatever power he wishes , not surreptitiously but openly , heralding his intentions months beforehand , if he only has behind him the influence of the party in power . Looking at it from another point of view , the prevalence of the disposition to regard the events of politics as governed by forces over which we have no control , would indicate that the time was approaching , and , indeed , was not far distant , in which the relations existing between this people and their government were to be fundamentally altered . The government being theoretically in the people 's hands , it is obvious that as soon as people in large numbers cease to believe practically that it is in their hands , and to act upon their want of faith , the theory will be violated by the facts ; the government will no longer be what it purports to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the first step . But the first step is soon taken . This stage does not last long . Sham governments have no great vitality in them . They are inevitably succeeded by real governments , but not the same real government which preceded them . In France , government by universal suffrage became a sham long ago , and has been succeeded by what is practically a government of force . In New York , also , selfgovernment was a sham long ago , it was succeeded by a real government forcibly maintained for several years by fraud ; that again was succeeded by a sort of revolution , the issue of which we have still to see . The election of General Butler would go far to show that the people of Massachusetts have come to the conclusion that they have lost the art of self-government , and that their government must be done for them from outside . Of course , there are a number of people who would be glad to undertake the task . The result . of the election will thus throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in America bears to the actual facts of its social condition . Ex uno disce omnes is a maxim peculiarly applicable to the social condition of a confederacy of political bodies so like one another as are the United States . We may infer from Massachusetts a great many useful lessons with regard to the current politics and morality in a dozen other States . It has been common for those who , in Massachusetts and elsewh*re , have criticised the career of General Butler to demonstrate the impossibility // of his success - it is difficult to say whether * priori or to posteriori- by proofs drawn from the historic character of the population . It is impossible , the common argument has been , for a corrupt demagogue to rise into power by the votes of the descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers , by a race of men trained in a rigid and even austere system of morality from their cradles . This argument was very much in vogue at the time of General Butler 's campaign against Mr. Dana in the Fifth Congressional District . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound dinner-table harangues on the subject ! ) " is no other than Essex County , old Essex , - the place of all in the world where the most pureblooded Americans were to be found ; the county which contained Salem , Marblehead , and Ipswich , a county rich with memories of devotion to duty , to country , and to religion . " The fact is , however , that neither Essex County nor Massachusetts is any longer what , according to history and tradition , they should be . The population of the whole State has , within the past fifty years , completely changed its character , and no more resembles the population of a generation since than the people who now live in New York resemble in character , traditions , or aspiration the primitive Dutchmen who founded the town two centuries since . Fifty years ago Massachusetts was an agricultural and commercial community , governed by a pure democracy , through the machinery of townmeetings , - this machinery , however , being directed and regulated by powerful external forces lodged in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church , and a number of old families , which had long enjoyed prescriptive political rights , directed the energies of Massachusetts through the agency of an intelligent , conscientious , and , if not God-fearing , at least deacon-fearing people . To-day almost all trace of this society has passed away . Massachusetts has become a completely modern community . Through a protective tariff ; enormous manufacturing industry has been built up , which has completely swamped her agriculture : These manufactories , carried on at first by natives , are now maintained by the labor of large gangs of ignorant foreigners , superintended by a few skilled agents , employed in their turn* by capitalists at a distance . This system has of course drawn vast masses of the l ) opulation from the country into the towns and cities , while at the same time the introduction of railroads , and the substitution of steam for all other kinds of transportation , has given to this movement an increased impetus . The railroad system of the State , too , resembles the factory system so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of private individuals , who perform the function of transportation by leaving the management of the roads in the hands . of a few experts , and their operation in the hands of many thousand hired laborers , contenting themselves for the most part with drawing , in the form of dividends , the " transportation tax . " Meanwhile the bar has lost its influence , and almost ceased . to be a political school ; the Church has been supplanted by a multitude of rival churches , the competition among which is so fierce that it almost forbids the exercise of the old duty of a supervision of the lives . and morals of the people ; the town-meeting has become a meeting of factory hands , readily guided in any direction by scheming politicians ; the old families have , in the multiplication of modern interests , found a thousand puisuits quite as attractive to their ambition and pleasing to their tastes as politics . In short , the Massachusetts of to-day ( including even Essex County ) has become the home of a genuine prolitariat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these latter not endowed with any great sense of responsibility either for the welfare of their " hands , " or for that of the general public . A great deal of surprise was expressed some months ago at the enthusiastic demonstrations of feeling by the citixens of North Easton on the return to the town of Oakes Ames , just censured by Congress for corruption . It seemed to most people unintelligible that any body of men , however ignorant , could have the audacity to flout decency and morality in this way . The explanation , however , was extremely simple . The so-called town of North Easton was nothing but a collection of mills , established by the capital of the Ames family , and worked by men dependent on* this family for subsistence . It must not be forgotten , however , that there are considerations which would render the election of General Butler a little L less significant of a general moral degradation throughout the State than the Ames reception was significant of the abject condition of North Easton . If General Butler receives the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination always gives in Massachusetts , of seeming to confer upon the nominee a certificate of moral worth . The Massachusetts Republican voter has been for so many years taught to consider the Republican cause identical with the cause of morality , - the Democratic party representing in his mind incarnate sin , - and the morality again has for so many years meant in his mind the adoption of certain legislative or constitutional or military measures which have actually been adopted by the Republican party and throughout opposed by the Democrats , - that he may be unable to discriminate between what is expedient on party grounds and what is expedient on moral grounds . He may be unable to remember that all parties are merely the complex results of the intelligence and characters of the men who compose and lead them . He may not be able to perceive that the adoption of General Butler at this dayby the Republican party makes it really his representative . There has been a sad want of candor on these subjects till very lately . How very small has been the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Butler 's career ! Even in the contest between himself and Mr. Dana in the Fifth District , where every one knew that the real issue between the parties - the thing which had made a split in the Republican ranks - was the shameful scheme of repudiation advocated by him , how few there were who treated the question aa one of popular honesty ! Appeals to voters to preserve the harmony of the party ,  --  not to allow insubordination , but " to march on shoulder to shoulder , one , undivided , triumphant to the end , " - . these appeals were common enough . The objection to them was that they did not bring forward the real objection to the candidate , and that , as General Butler had already secured the regular nomination , they would be used with quite as great success on one side as on the other . Indeed , they almost always can . Will it be possible to defeat General Butler ,  --  to defeat him , that is , if he secures the Republican nomination ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , and that is by a unioi against him of the conservative forces throughout the State . We do not mean the Democrats , though , under ordinary circumstances , they would be ready enough to oppose him ; but a union of the capital , the intelligence , the morality , and 255 what is left of the religion of the State . Nc* wire-pulling or intrigue will be of the slightest avail . The usual political measures have been tried already in the contest for the district attorneyship , and signally failed . At wire-pulling and intrigue General Butler will always beat his enemies . But he can no more successfully struggle against a union of the conservative forces to which we have just referred , than Tweed could in New York . The moment it became evident in New York that Tweed and his confederates were no mere harmless demagogues , but real highwaymen making use of the machinery of the law as a " stand and deliver " to the public , their fate was sealed . They had , to be sure , the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could carry off ; but had they remained , and made , as they threatened , a struggle for the retention of power , . no one who recollects the excited state of public feeling at the time can doubt that some of them would have met a violent end . We have endeavored here to make it plain that there are sufficient reasons for believing in General Butler 's star ; but it must be confessed that , when we reflect on his past career , his pretensions now reach a height of audacity which , if we were not already familiar with it , would be fairly incredible . Beginning as a lawyer of low reputation , he worked his way up to the position of a strenuous partisan ; and then converting his reputation for party fidelity into capital , he placed it at the disposal of the party to which he was the sworn foe . Then enlisting in the war , and distinguishing himself for his administration of a captured city , he made use of this reputation td gain for himself the command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every operation of war . At the return , of peace , he got himself elected a member of Congress , and has since then advocated every scheme of plunder which his or any one 's ingenuity ha* been able to devise ; his latest performance has been the passage of an act securing for these services the increase of his own salary . He is neither a fine orator nor a skilful legistator . None of his political schemes have as yet come to anything of importance ; but with each new failure his power has increased , while his wealth already places him beyond all reach of disaster . He has always displayed the utmost contempt even for the appearance // of decency , and has avowed himself almost in one breath a reformer and a cynical sceptic as to any attempts at reform . During all this he has steadily gained in influence , not only with the politicians , but with the people of his district , and now , on the strength of this curious career , offers himself as candidate for the governorship of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts public look on at General Butler 's attempt with divided feelings . There are a good many people , who ought by this time to have been made more sensible by events which they have witnessed , who are unable to believe that so bad a man as Butler can ever become governor of so good a State as Massachusetts . There are others who regard the candidate as a smart man , and wish him well . There is the class to which we have already referred , who look upon his election as a fate impending over them which they can not avert , if they would . There are people who habitually take little interest in politics , and who regard the candidate with curiosity rather than any stronger feeling . There are a number of deluded persons , chiefly prohibitionists , labor-reformers , suffrage-reformers , who think that if General Butler would pledge himself to a furtherance of their designs , his fitness for the governorship in other respects would be a matter of little consequence . There is a number of elderly politicians who thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat him ; there are a number of young politicians , hangers-on either of General Butler or of the administration , who will go through thick and thin to secure him any office he may wish . In this confusion there is as yet no line drawn between what may be called the conservative party and the party of disorder . There must be such a line , if General Butler is to be defeated . Sooner *r later it must come to this : that those who are opposed to the introduction of the confusion and anarchy that inevitably come of licen*ed corruption must range themselves under some leader and let the people of the State know that , if they any longer desire to see the rights of property respected , or a semblance of decency maintained in the government of a State once so confident of the strength of its title to esteem as Massachusetts , they must declare themselves against General Butler ; and that if they do not , they lay themselves open to the suspicion of being enemies of everything held by mankind as sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can consider his person or his possessions safe . It is ridiculous to talk of Massachusetts as if she was exempt from the ordinary evils which afflict States . She has hitherto been more fortunate than many of her rivals in having kept her judiciary pure at a time when theirs was attacked by that terrible dry-rot the final effect of which we have witnessed in New York ; but even an appointed judiciary may lose its virtue in time . We have seen how much it may be degraded ( even without any actual corruption ) in the history of the Supreme Court of the United States , - a court which was once the mostpower. ful tribunal in the world , and has now become timid and time-serving simply through a series of appointments dictated by political rather that judicial considerations . ' There has not been wanting " politics " either in some of the later judicial appointments in Massachusetts . What Butler 's judicial appointments would be it is not difficult to imagine . With a constantly deteriorating and easily managed legislature , a threatened judiciary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant wagesearning population as the ultimate repository of political power , it certainly would be easy for the executive to make himself master of the situation , and make absolutely sure of his next move , whatever it might be .
