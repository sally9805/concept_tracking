THERE are few divisions in the Treasury department of the United States at Washington less known to the public , and more interesting to visitors , than that over the entrance to which is displayed the legend " National Bank Redemption Agency . " It is a matter of the most common knowledge throughout the country , that the various forms of national currency and securities are by some process , popularly esteemed more or less miraculous , printed at the Treasury , and that greenbacks are by some method , presumably more within the laws of nature , redeemed there . The ordinary money-holder , who has in his pocket his tens or hundreds of legal tenders , is passably familiar with the history , past and to come , of each note . But to his national bank notes the average financier is more of a stranger . Each note , if he can read as well as reckon cash , tells him whence it cometh , but ten to one be has only the vaguest notion of whither it goeth . Hence it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centennial summer and autumn , through the wire gate opposite to the second assortment teller 's desk , at the agency , so many were of a nature tending to make that industrious clerk smile with amusement or stare in amazement . The throngs of centennial visitors who daily passed through the halls of the Treasury saw various things at the agency to attract their notice . They saw their entrance barred by the gate above alluded to , put there for the double purpose of securing ventilation and excluding " the great unwashed " ; they saw a small-sized room converted into a perfect labyrinth by means of wirework partitions ; they saw in each of the apartments so set off hundreds of thousands , and even millions of dollars , in the various processes of handling in bulk , piled upon counters and tables , constructed evidently with a view to use rather than ornament ; and they saw through the entranee to an adjoining room national bank notes of all denominations , passing with wonderful rapidity under the deft fingers of counters of both sexes . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two massive safes , reaching from the floor to the ceiling . In the interests of truth , let a revelation be made to a public too prone to believe their eyes . Those safes , for at least the upper third of their ponderous height , are of inch pine boards . The crowded condition of the Treasury building renders space very valuable . A place of storage was needed for the various forms of stationery in use at the agency . The floor was already covered with de*ks , tables , and counters , the intricate passages between which would have defied the attempts of the Minotaur to escape ; but there were at least a hundred cubic feet of space above each of the iron safes , absolutely going to waste . The genius of the officials and the skill of the departmental cabinet makers triumphed over the difficulties of the situation . As for the inconvenient height , is it not annihilated by a ladder ? By act of Congress , the Treasurer of the United States is constituted the agent of the national banks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 18Th , is one of the divisions in his office . Regular provision is made by Congress in the appropriation bills for the salaries of the force of this division . Careful accounts are kept of every item of expense incurred during the year , and at the end of the twelvemonth the sum disbursed is apportioned among the banks according to the number of the notes of each that have been handled , and assessments // are made for the several amounts . The circulation of national banks being redeemable in greenbacks , each bank is required by law to keep on deposit with the Treasurer legal tenders to the amount of five per cent . of its outstanding issue as a fund for the redemption of its notes . The present law provides for ninetyeight clerks in the agency , ranging in grade from the messenger to the superintendent . Of this number , those employed in handling money are divided into two forces , under the direc tion , respectively , of the receiving teller and the assorting teller . The business of the former force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sub-treasuries for redemption , count the money , and report the amounts for return remittances ; that of the latter force is to assort the notes and prepare them for delivery to the Comptroller of the Currency for destruction or to the banks for reissue . This double process may seem at first sight very simple and easy ; but in fact it is extremely complex and difficult ; and the division in which it is carried on may fairly be counted among the most thoroughly organized and systematically conducted parts of all the machinery devised by the Government for the transaction of the manifold public business . And no wonder , when it is recollected that there are now in circulation nine denominations of national bank notes , the issue of twenty-three hundred and forty individual institutions , amounting in the aggregate to three hundred and twenty millions of dollars ; and that every one of these notes , and every dollar of this total , must ultimately , by those ninety-eight clerks and their successors , be separated from the mass , and assigned , under the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which that particular unit of this vast volume was emitted and must be redeemed . The bulk of the currency sent in for redemption comes through the Adams Express Company , who have a contract for making all shipments of money for the Government , and who for convenience have an office in the basement of the Treasury . The agency occupies four rooms on the main floor along the west wall , and one on the opposite side of the passage ; Early visitors to that part of the building may have noticed a wooden box , much resembling a carpenter 's tool chest , trundled along upon a cart by a porter , and followed by a man with a book under his arm . The box contains the day 's delivery of national bank currency for redemption , ranging ordinarily from half a million to a million and a half of dollars , and the book contains a receipt for the amount , to be signed by the receiving clerk of the agency . The money comes in perhaps a hundred or as high as two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . On being opened these packages display a miscellaneous aggregation , of which the following items may be mentioned : Thousands of notes of all the denominations and all the banks , perhaps a little soiled , but perfectly sound , and for all the purposes of currency in as good a condition as when they left the printers ' hands ; a somewhat smaller bulk of others in every state of mutilation and uncleanliness ; hundreds , clean , crisp , and unwrinkled , that have not been counted three times outside of the division of issues ; scores torn , cut , ground , burned , charred , boiled , soaked , chewed , and digested , until a skilful eye is required to recognize that they have ever been intended for money ; and scattered singly through this mass , counterfeits , stolen notes , " split " notes , " raised " notes , and now and then a stray greenback . The packages , after an entry of them has been made on the books , are distributed singly among women counters , each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a package , takes it to her desk , breaks the seals , and first takes an inventory of the money to see whether the ag // gregate of the sums called for by the straps around the various parcels of notes corresponds with the amount claimed for the whole . Should she find a discrepancy , she makes a certificate of the difference for return to the sender . Next she proceeds to count the money , carefully keeping the notes and straps of each parcel separate . If she discovers an error of count , she notes upon the strap , over her initials and the date , the sum which she finds the package to be " over " or " short . " Spurious or other notes , for any reason excluded by the rules , are thrown out , pinned to the straps in which they came , and returned . After finishing her count she makes a statement of the amounts of " overs , " " shorts , " counterfeits , and other rejected notes , and of the amount for the credit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . The next duty of the counter is to assort the notes into the two classes of such as are unfit for circulation and such as are fit , and into the various denominations . When a hundred notes of one denomination and class are counted she surrounds them with a white strap , on which she pencils her initials and the date . Straps printed for full packages of a hundred notes of the different denominations are provided . Less than a hundred notes make a package of " odds . " The " odds " arising from a day 's count are delivered to " odd " counters , who mass them into full packages . Each counter , having finished this portion of her work , enters , in duplicate , upon a leaf of the blank book furnished her for this purpose , the various items into which she has divided her cash , and delivers this with the money to the teller . He takes an inventory of the amount by straps , and finding the counter 's statement to be correct , tears off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and signs the original as a receipt . After all the full packages resulting from the day 's count have been delivered in this manner , the teller makes them up into bundles of ten , or one thousand notes , keeping each denomination and class separate , and in this shape , on the evening of the day on which the money was received , they are ready for delivery to the assorting teller 's room* Here the amount is inventoried and receipted for , and the money is locked up for the night in the iron portion of one of those wonder-waking safes . None but the most experienced and skilful counters are employed in this first process , the responsibility both to the Government and the employee being too great to be imposed upon any but experts . It will readily be seen not only that correctness of count is of vital importance , but also that the knowledge and skill necessary to detect irredeemable notes are indispensable . A counter , when she puts her initials upon a package of notes , assumes the responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and any differences , if against her , will be made good at the end of the month out of her salary . The degree of accuracy reached by the present force is surprising considering the bulk of money handled daily . Counterfeits which , like the fives on the Traders ' National Bank of Chicago , the Hampden of Westfield , Massachusetts , and the Merchants ' of New Bedford , Massachusetts , have passed current all over the country , and become so worn that some unsuspecting village banker thinks proper to have them redeemed , are laid aside without a second glance . All the tricks practised by operators in " queer " are discovered instantly . Among the means known to these gentry for expanding illegally the value of genuine currency , that most frequently resorted to is known as " splitting ; " Nine notes , for example , of a single denomination , are taken , and of the first one-tenth is cut off from the upper portion with a sharp knife by a line parallel to the margin . From the second two-tenths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successively lower by tenths of // the width , until from the last note the lower tenth is cut . The upper portion of the first note is then joined , by pasting , to the lower portion of the second , the upper portion of the second to the lower portion of the third , and this plan being carried out with all the others , the result is the production of ten notes , each of which lacks one-tenth of its face , but which will pass with little question , among the inexperienced , at full value . The original notes being , however , very likely of different banks in several States , one effect of this operation , in the cases where the lines of division pass through the titles , is the creation of banks not found on the lists of the Treasury . When a note of this composition is presented for redemption the joined portions are separated , and being genuine are treated as parts of notes , and redeemed accordingly . The rules of the department applying to national bank currency are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . When more than two-fifths are missing the amount allowed for is proportionally reduced . The only exception to this rule is in cases where there is satisfactory evidence that the missing portion has been destroyed and can never be presented for redemption . Another trick of counterfeiters is that of " raising . " The original numerals and letters denoting the value of the note are carefully scraped off with a sharp instrument . By this means the paper is made thin , and over the places are pasted the figures and words of a higher denomination , often so neatly as to defy detection except on critical examination . Fives are in this way often converted into fifties , and ones into hundreds . Of course the alteration will readily be discovered by any one in the habit of handling money . Such notes are redeemed at the original face value . But of all irredeemable notes those which appeal most strongly to the ill feelings of counters are of the description known as " stolen . " Readers of newspapers will doubtless recollect accounts of a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of Northampton , Massachusetts . Among the booty there secured by the burglars were one hundred and forty.five new five-dollar notes , of the issue of that bank , unsigned , which had never been paid over the counter . The cashier had taken the precaution to make a memorandum of the numbers printed on the faces , and was therefore enabled to describe each note as he would his watch taken from his fob by a pickpocket . Notice was given to the department , and though the notes came in shortly after by the dozen , it is safe to say that not one has been charged to the account of the bank . The notes are perfectly genuine , excepting the signatures ; the most skilful expert would hardly discover anything suspicious in their appearance ; the only irregularity connected with them is the way they were put in circulation . The fact of their existence renders necessary to every counter who would secure herself against loss an examination of the numbers printed on every five-dollar note of that bank passing through her hands ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to redeem them . Other banks have currency in circulation upon a similar basis , the number of notes varying in different instances from one upward . Occasionally a straggler of this description makes its way some distance into the agency , but it is sure to be detected sooner or later by some of the many vigilant eyes under which it must pass-eyes perhaps made all the more vigilant by costly experience of the consequences of carelessness . Such notes when discovered to have been redeemed become the property , in exchange for a like amount in greenbacks , of the person last concerned in their redemption . It has been seen that the greater portion of the currency received is fit for circulation . Out of an aggregate // of $176,121,855 , assorted during the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1870 , $97 ,  - -  478,700 was of this description , and was returned to the banks for reissue . Originally it was the expectation that none but worn and mutilated notes would be offered for redemption , and for a long while all redeemed currency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead . But the proportion of sound notes became at length so great that the new plan was adopted as an evident measure of economy , and now no piece of paper money is withdrawn from circulation until worn out , unless at the desire of the bank . Many financial institutions within easy reach of the capital make a custom of forwarding for redemption all their receipts of currency for the day , getting in return new notes just from the printers . This method is pursued as an accommodation to the business public , who prefer clean and crisp notes ; and while a day 's depos. - its of any large bank must include much currency perhaps just out of the Treasury , the whole bulk is often shipped off to avoid the labor of assorting . Besides , remittances for redeemed notes of national banks being made , if desired , in greenbacks , the agency furnishes a convenient means to city banks for keeping up their legal tender reserves . Under the effect of heavy redemptions the condition of the currency of the country is constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received at the agency is gradually increasing . The next process which the redeemed currency undergoes is that of assorting , and is carried on in a large room extending through about onefourth of the length of the building . Along the walls , on both sides of an aisle , are arranged three rows of assorters ' tills , by means of which the labor is carried on . These tills are rectangular in shape , and are divided into fifty-two compartments or " boxes , " in four rows of thirteen each . These boxes are four inches in depth , and a little larger in length and width than the surface of a note . The tills are mounted at an inclined angle u*ou stands , very much like a printer 's case . At one end , attached by a hinged support , is a small table at which the assorter , sea ted upon a stool , does his counting and writing , and which , when not needed for this purpose , is swung underneath the tilL A wovenwire folding screen is fastened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down over the boxes , or thrown back out of the way . Padlocks of improved construction are part of the equipment , no two keys being interchangeable . Below the till is a shelf of the width of the stand , for the convenience to the assorter next in front . Each till is supplied with a blank book in duplicate forms for the assorter 's accounts , an array of different colored printed straps , a box of hank pins , and all the appliances necessary for handling money with ease and rapidity . For convenience in assorting , the twenty-three hundred and forty banks are arranged alphabetically , according to the name of their location , into forty-four groups , . which are distinguished numerically , there being from forty to upward of sixty banks in each group . The operation of assorting notes into these groups is known as the*first assortment ; that of assorting the notes of the groups by individual banks , as the second assortment . The bundles of redeemed currency , having been passed to the assorting room , are delivered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fifteen first assorters , taking receipts . Each of these persons carries his mon ey to his till , and after making an in* ventory by straps , proceeds to count the notes . He unpins a package and lays the strap fiat on the table before him . If the contents of that package are found to be correct , he lays the money upon the strap . The next strap is laid on top of this pile , and so on . By this method the several pack . ages are kept distinct , and if he after . ward finds an irredeemable note in // his money , he may know from whom it comes . All errors discovered , not only in this process , but in all others , are required to be reported immediately . Should a package be found " over , " the assorter makes a memorandum , over his initials and the date , upon the strap , and returns this with the superfluous note to the teller . The note is put in the " cash till " to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Short " packages are returned for verification to the counter , and the deficiency is made good out of the " cash till " and charged to the counter . Spurious and stolen notes are in like manner exchanged for genuine . An account is kept of all the " overs , " " shorts , " etc. , of each person , and on pay day the clerk who has a preponderance against him will find in the envelope enclosing his month 's salary the superintendent 's certificate of the balance " short , " and any counterfeit or stolen notes found in his straps , reckoned as so much legal tender . This system is rigidly enforced not only in the agency , but throughout the department . It seems hard that the penalty of accident or inexperience should be so summary ; but no other means has yet been devised to secure the Treasury from loss . And after all , the rule is the same as that enforced in some manner in the outside world of business , where every one must trust to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first assorter having satisfied himself that his money is correct in amount and passible in character , next proceeds to assort the notes . He rises from his stool , swings his table out of the way , folds back the cover of his till , takes up a package and deposits the notes one by one in the box whose number corresponds to that of the group to which they severally belong . We will say that long practice has made him familiar not only with the scheme of the assortment , so that he need not refer to the printed lists , but also with the face of the notes of every bank in the country , and that the briefest glance is all that he requires to recognize a note and determine where it belongs . The rapidity of some of these assorters is remarkable , being limited only by the rate at which it is possible to move the hand over the rather large area of a till . Much , however , depends on the natural aptitudes of the person . Many who have had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tried for six months or a year , and then dismissed as incompetent . Even those by nature well qualified may hope to attain moderate rapidity only after months of persevering effort . The manipulations of the beginner often cause much merriment among the older employees . He has too many fingers , or too few , to fix a secure grasp upon the " bills . " He seizes a note with one or both hands , and stretching it before him proceeds to read over the face . Then he resolves himself into a committee of the whole on the state of his till , to consider where the note is to be put . He refers from the note to the printed schedule before him , and from the schedule to the note again , hunts from one side of his till to the other for the box he wants , but is now uncertain of the number , and recurs once more to the note and the schedule . At length he cautiously deposits the money in a box . Presently , after going through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been wrong . He institutes search throughout his till to find his note again , and at last this cause of all his perplexity settles in a box not to be again disturbed until that remote hour of the day when he shall be ready to " count out . " In the evening , when he is expected to " turn in " his cash , he finds himself from one to eighty or a hundred notes " over " or " short . " His knuckles are more or less raw from collision with the partitions of his till , his face is flushed , and his hand trembles . In high excitement , seeing himself waited for , he // takes up a package which he put up for a hundred notes , but which in his opinion may possibly contain a hundred aud eleven or only ninety-nine . He counts it through with an attempt at aptness , and as he lays down the last note he whispers " fifty-five . " In the end two or three experts are set to help him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which formed his chaos are reduced to order . In the later experience of the agency , however , instances of this extreme bewilderment are rare . Every consideration is shown the beginner , and the perfect organization of the office enables him to be led up by the slowest and easiest gradations to the more difficult labor . Besides , in appointments , which latterly are of infrequent occurrence , a decided preference is given to bank clerks and others whose previous training serves in some sort as an education . When a clerk has finished assorting his cash , he next proceeds to count out the contents of each box , putting up the notes in packages of even hundreds of dollars , and pinning round them yellow straps , if he has unfit money , and pink if fit . On the strap of each package he writes in pencil the amount , the group number , his initials , and the date . The notes of all the groups in excess of even hundreds of dollars are thrown together and finally counted and put up as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are done up , by means of cardboards and rubber bands , into bundles of a thousand notes each . The aggregate being found to correspond with the sum received in the morning , the assorter enters on his book in duplicate the amount of full packages and of " odds , " and delivers his cash with the book to the first assortment teller . That clerk makes an inventory of the money by straps , and finding it to agree with the book , tears off the duplicate entry to guide him in his own accounts , and puts his initials to the original as a receipt to the assorter . When all the money put in the hands of the assorters has been returned in this manner , the total cash is balanced and locked up until next day . The " odds " arising from the day 's work are kept separate for redistribution among the assorters on the following morning . An expert will handle ten thousand notes between the hours of nine and three , in the manner here describedno light task , for besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice . Persons of both sexes are employed at this work , but the physical endurance required makes it too heavy for women of weak frame . It will be understood that after passing through the first assorters ' hands the notes are in two lots of " fit " and * each lot being in bundles of one thousand notes of one denomination , and each bundle composed of packages of notes of single groups . The next operation is to mass all the packages of all denominations composing the day 's assortment by groups . This is done by the first assortment teller , who distributes the packages on a low table , according to the marks of the assorters , and straps the packages of each group into a bundle on which he marks the number *f the group and the amount . The distinctions of " fit " and " unfit " are still maintained . There are then forty-four bundles of " fit " notes and a like number of " unfit , " each bundle containing all denominations of notes of the banks composing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day following put in the vault of the agency . This receptacle is a room whose massive iron walls would not be likely to tempt burglars even in the most inviting surroundings . It is situated in the basement of the north wing of the Treasury . The ponderous double doors are secured by two combination locks of the most approved construction , one of which is set and can be opened only by the superintendent and the chief bookkeeper , and the other only by the assorting teller and his assistant . There is , besides , on // the outer door a chronometer lock which would defy the efforts of all those officials together , and of all other persons whatsoever until the appointed hour when the vault is to be opened in the ordinary course of business . Along the interior of the walls are compartments in which are stored redeemed notes , those of each group by themselves , until they shall be removed for assortment by individual banks . The vault usually contains about ten millions of dollars . The money which we have followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place , where it is deposited group by group with the rest . It is customary to assort the currency of from one to four groups by banks each day . Let us follow rapidly one of these groups through the remainder of the processes . The money of a group accumulated from day to day in the vault is in the morning transported to the assorting room , where it is delivered to the second assortment teller . By him the bundles are opened , the inventory verified , and the packages separated by denominations , reference being had in this process to the upper note of each package . The packages of each denomination are then strapped together by means of cardboards and rubber bands , and the group number , the denomination , and the amount marked upon each bundle . Next morning the money is delivered in this shape to the second assorters . It will be understood that each of these persons thus receives notes of a single denomination issued by from forty to sixty banks . The second assorter first counts his money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes into his till in the manner already described , putting , however , only the notes of one bank into a box . For his guidance each assorter is provided with a printed list of the banks composing his group , the number of the box assigned to each being set opposite to the title . For convenience of handling about the tills , these lists are mounted upon thick cardboards . The existence of stolen notes or counterfeits on a bank is noted upon these lists , and special directions for assortment are conveyed in the same manner . When a bank is in liquidation or is withdrawing part of its circulation , an " I , " denoting " inactive , ** is set opposite the title . The notes of such banks are thrown together into box 52 , and from this circumstance are known in the nomenclature of the office as " 52 's . " These are counted together and put up in packages by means of orange-colored straps , properly marked for delivery , through a regular channel , to another division of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed and the amount retired from circulation . At present more than half the banks of some groups are on the inactive list , and notwithstanding the clamor from the West for more paper currency , that part of the country is in the lead in the contraction which is rapidly going on . Of the Chicago banks , the notes of all but three have been ordered to be destroyed and withdrawn as they are redeemed , and in St. Louis and St. Paul only a few banks remain on the active list . Of the eastern cities , New York alone is pursuing the same line of policy to any considerable extent , more than half the banks there being either iiquidating or reducing their circulation . The motives which induce this step in the case of solvent and unembarrassed institutions are diverse ; but the effect is always the same . The amount of currency retired in this manner ranges ordinarily from twenty thousand to a hundred thousand dollars a day . The labor of assorting finished , the clerk 's next duty is to count up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each note to be sure that they all bear the same title . In some groups great care is required to ensure correctness in this process . For instance , a clerk will tell you that there are Springfield banks in every State in the Union . He exaggerates a little , ' // but group 88 is nevertheless the b*4te noir of the assorting room . In the second assortment , as in the first , even hundreds of dollars make a full package . Notes of active banks are pinned up , the " fit " in blue straps and the " *fit " in green , each package marked with the group number , the bank number , the amount , the asso*er 's signature , and the date . Notes wrongly grouped are thrown together and put up in white straps , for return next day to the first assorter . " Odds " are enveloped in yellow or pink straps , accordingly as they are " unfit * or " fit , " and are ultimately put in the vault until the group is next brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all been counted out , the assorter 's cash is in the four items of full packages of notes of active banks , " 5* 's , " " errors " of first assortment , and " odds . " The money of each of these items is strapped up in a bundle properly marked , and the amounts entered in the book . iDeliveryis made to the second assortment teller in a manner similar to that already described . Of course , in a room where one or two millions of dollars are handled daily , rigid discipline is required to prevent loss through carelessness or peculation . A clerk on leaving his till must lock up his money . No assorter is allowed to leave the room during business hours except on a pass , to be taken up by the doorkeeper . This is obtained from the superintendent of assorters , who , before issuing it , examines the till of the applicant to see that everything is in shape . Slips of paper , perforated by a punch , are the sops which placate the Cerberus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card on which are printed two sets of numbers , from one to thirty-one , and a certificate that the holder 's cash was properly balanced and his till in order at the close of business on the day of the month last punched . On this card the teller , after examining the assorter 's money , makes one punch , and the su perintendent of assorters another , after a minute inspection of the till and its surroundings . Thus the assorter receives the only passport on which he may leave the office for the day . In the afternoon , when all the money handled has been deposited in the safes , the superintendent of the agency makes a tour of all the rooms . The safes are then closed , andfinallythe Treasurer tries all the locks . The work of the second assortment is by most clerks pretty easily learned , and upon this beginners are usually placed . The mechanical difficulties are , however , the same as those already noticed in connection with the first assortment ; and speed can be ac quired only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions to a clerk , whatever his grade . Currency long in circulation becomes so mutilated as to be difficult to handle . It is soiled and dusty , and often emits the most disgusting smells . One memorable shipment of several millions from San Francisco still lingers in the recollection of the unfortunate clerks , who spit and sneezed over the filthy mass . The notes were begrimed with every soil of the Pacific slope , and made odorous by association with every species of vice and uncleanliness to which human flesh is subject . The labor of the assorter and counter , even at the best , is severe and unpleasant ; while from motives of economy the task is heaped up to the maximum and the pay cut down to the minimum . The next process after assortment is to " make up " all the packages of all denominations into bundles , each containing only notes of a single bank . For this purpose the currency of active banks is delivered from the assorters through the teller to a " inaker.up " who takes an inventory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a till similar to those already described , except that it is laid fiat upon a low counter . Then he takes the contents of a box , ascertains , by examining the upper note of each package , that the // money is all the issue of a single bank , and writes in ink upon a blank label the title of the bank , the amount of each denomination , and the total of all , signs and dates this , and straps it upon the bundle . Having emptied all the boxes of his till in this manner , he prepares a list of the amount of each bank 's money made up , and verifies his work by comparing the footing with the total charged to him on the previous evening . This list is delivered to the bookkeepers , and upon it the accounts of the agency are based . From motives of saving in express charges , when the total of a bank 's currency in the till is less than five hundred dollars , the money is not made up , but thrown aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even thousands of dollars , when such excess is less than five hundred . These " odds " are returned , after account , to the vault . The work of making up employs from two to four persons constantly . Absolute correctness is of high importance , and great painstaking is required . Even a moment 's relaxation of attention is likely to produce an error which , if not discovered , would involve the misplacement of hundreds or thousands of dollars . Fortunately , the system of checks and proofs is so thorough that all errors are discovered unfailingly , and the consequences confined to the agency . The different colored straps noticed in use for packages are but one feature of a general scheme by which currency in the office is made to indicate , at a glance , its description , proper place , and future course . The possibility of error or confusion in large amounts is thus reduced to the last degree . And minute precautions will hardly be deemed superfluous , when it is considered that all the processes described in this article are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counters . On leaving the hands of the makerup , the money is taken to the provingroom . Here the bundles are distributed among a force of women , who recount all the notes for the purpose of verifying the amount , the description , and the assortment . If , amongthe notes of a bank , is found one of another , the estray is exchanged , through the superintendent of assorters , for a note of the proper description . The prover , having ascertained that her money is correct according to the accompanying label , puts her initials to the latter , as well as upon each package of notes , wraps and ties the bundle , and carries it to a table , where , in her presence , the knots are sealed . First , however , the unfit notes are cancelled by removing a triangular piece from each of the lower corners . This is done by means of aknife , whichismovedbyhandwith a lever , which easily cuts through two hundred notes at a time . The sealed packages are then put in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are enveloped in a stout outside wrapper and directed to the various banks whose notes are contained in each . In this shape these parcels are taken to the office of the Adams Express Company for shipment .
