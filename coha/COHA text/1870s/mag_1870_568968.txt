ARTICLE V.-CHRISTIANITY A UNIVERSAL RELIGION . THE religion of the Old Testament had two unlike faces . If you looked at it on the one side , it was narrow , local , exclusive ; if you looked at it on the other side , it was broad , free , intended for mankind . The hedge of national and formal observances , which gave it an uninviting aspect , was designed for the protection of its absolute and universal doctrines , until in the fulness of time , having impressed themselves on the mind of one people , they could pass the more readily over the human race . It was like a blossom of snrpassing beauty , hid in a thorny calyx until the sun bnrst it open and displayed it to the eyes of men . The calyx , having done its work , dropped , but the blossom shone in perpetnal glory . Meanwhile from within the pale of this narrow , national , and ceremonial religion , voices of the noblest and truest men reach us , showing that they beheld in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jehovah , which nothing in the past justified . Let us listen to some of these voices . First , we may notice , scattered through the ancient scriptures , a conviction of the greatness of Jehovah , as the universa* creator and Lord , and of the nothingness of gods worshipped by the heathen . " The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth , and from under these heavens . " Next we perceive the expectation of proselytes coming to worship at Jerusalem , and of whole nations joining themselves to the God of Israel . At the dedication of the temple , Solomon spoke of the stranger who was not of God 's people , but should come out of a far country for his name 's sake . " For they shall hear , " says he , " of thy great name , and of thy strong hand , and of thy stretched out arm , " and he prays that the prayer of the stranger may be heard when he shall come and pray towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) it is said that " Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God , " that is , either in prayer or to offer gifts ; and in the prophets that " Israel shall be the third with Egypt and Assyria , a blessing in the midst of the land , whom the Lord shall bless , saying blessed be Egypt my people , and Assyria the work of my hands , and Israel my inheritance . " In another place the eunuch , whom the law of Moses shut out from the blessings of the congregation , and the sons of the stranger , who complained that they were separated from the Lord 's people , had the promise made to them that they should be joyful in God 's house of prayer , and should be accepted in their burnt offerings and sacrifices , " for my house , " saith God , " shall be called a house of prayer for all people . " Thus out of Zion was the law to go forth , and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be king over all the earth ; in that day there shall be one Lord and his uiame one . " Still more spiritual is the picture which Jeremiah gives of the woiship of the future , where he says that in the coming time , " they shall no more say the ark of the covenant of the Lord , neither shall they remember it , " . . . " but Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the Lord , and all the nations shall be gathered unto it , to the name of the Lord , to Jerusalem ; neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart . " As if the holiness of the penetrale of the temple and of the ceremonial worship should fade and grow pale , before the holiness of Jerusalem , as the gathering place of converted and purified heathens . But especially remarkable are those places in the later chapters of Isaiah , where the servant of Jehovah is spoken of in connexion with a spread of religion over all lands . That servant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visage , shall cause many to be astonished , but afterwards he shall cause many nations to rejoice in himself ,  --  for so what is rendered " he shall sprinkle " ought probably to be translated . " He is mine elect , " saith God , " in whom my soul delighteth ; I have put my spirit U*Ofl him , and he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles , " - " he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth , and the isles ( or coasts ) // shall wait for his law . " And in another place the same servant of the Lord is thus addressed : " It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob , and to restore the j ) reserved of Israel ; I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles , that thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the earth . " We may add that what prophets taught , the very faith of an Israelite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception of God was the pious Jew 's highest treasure . To him Jehovah was God alone ; he held no divided empire with heathen objects of worship . Should riot this idea , which seemed so real to him , triumph over all unreality ? He could not but live in hope of a glorious future , because God was his God and the God of all the earth , though unknown , as yet , to most of his creatures . Still more must this faith have given the promise of triumph , when in the lands of the dispersion he had opportunity to contrast his God and his religion with those of even the most polished heathen . Theirs were the religions of children ; his rested on truths wide as heaven and deep as the earth 's base , which would have made Plato bow in adoration . How could such a faith fail to spread ? He saw proselytes coming to the synagugue : he felt that his nation had a great destiny . The promise to tbe fathers , the declaration of the prophets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its universality . And so there can be no doubt , that about the time of Christ 's coming , every pious Jew , however narrow and national might be his view of the Messiah , did expect the Gentiles to share in the great blessing . As the aged Simeon by faith saw in the infant Jesus the promised Saviour , he called him a light to lighten the Gentiles , as well as the glory of Israel . Our Lord himself encouraged these expectations . Thus he says , " and other sheep I have which are not of this fold ; them also must I bring , and there shall be one fold and one shepherd . " So in speaking of the progress of the gospel in the world , and of its rejection by the Jews , he teaches us that " many shall come from the east and the west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob in the Kingdom of // God , while the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nations , and the declaration that the gospel of the kingdom would be preached to all nations ere the end came , involve this universality of the gospel ,  --  a doctrine into which Paul especially penetrated earliest and most deeply , and to which he was committed with all his heart , from his conversion to his martyrdom . Having thus shown that the ancient scriptures tanght the spread of Jehovah 's religion over the world , that the expectation of this event was fondly cherished by the Jews , and that Christ applied the predictions to his gospel , we propose to enquire next , on what this universality of the gospel depended , what there is in it which fits it to be a religion for mankind , how it cut the cord which bound it to Judaism , and how it has proved itself in the experiment to be the universal religion . I. In the first place , the gospel discarded whatever was local , national , and ceremonial , in the old religion , and retained whatever had a bearing on the whole human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confined to Jerusalem , all that was preparatory to a higher state of religious knowledge , all symbols half concealing and half revealing something glorious in the future . It kept , as it could not help keep , those doctrines of world-wide bearing which lay at the foundation of Judaism , the doctrines , namely , concerning God and concerning the fallen state of man , for the sake of which , Judaism had existed , while it rejected all that separated the Jews from the rest of the world as the peculiar people of God . There were three possible courses for the gospel to take in its practical workings , with reference to the old dispensation . It might , first , form a union with the older system , retaining the whole of the ceremonial law , and simply adding itself as a new element or institution to that which was already established , in which case Jew and Gentile would form one body , with common obligations to obey the law . Or , secondly , it might release Gentile converts from obligations which lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professing a faith in the gospel , but differing most widely in worship and touc of character . // Or , lastly , it might proclaim that Christ had abolished the Jewish system , and so , by releasing the Jew from its obligations , put him on a common ground of freedom with the Gentile . The first of these three courses was probably that which the greater part of the nation anticipated , and to which the drapery of the ancient prophets gave countenance . Yet it would have been self-destruction for the gospel to perpetuate or even long to endure a union of the spiritual with the ceremonial , of the thing signified with the type . The mind , enlightened by it , at once asked why , if Christ procured forgiveness , the blood of bulls and goats was any longer needed . It was , moreover , impossible for the dwellers in remote parts of the world to fulfil the requirements of the ritual , which had an eye towards a narrow land , whose inhabitants could with ease meet together . And the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law by the system of proselytes , who might , in some sort , share the religious blessings of the nation without being incorporated into it . It needed , therefore , no long experience of the manner in which the gospel took hold of the Gentile mind to see that it was more efilcacious , more beneficial without than with Judaism , and that if it allowed the old religion to go with it over the world , there would arise a strife of principles to be terminated by ultimate rejection and overthrow of the one or of the other . The second course , that of giving a dispensation from the law to the Gentile but not to the Jew , was a halfway measure , a method of compromise , by which Jewish national feeling was reconciled to Christianity , and many zealous Jews might be retained in the church who would otherwise have deserted it . On this ground stood the Apostles for a time , and only by degrees gave it up . But in truth it was almost as objectionable as the first course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches have walked hand in hand , the one of which would regard as worse than useless the ceremonies which the other clung to as God 's law to the fathers ? How could Christ have reigned supreme amid the sacrifices kept up from age to age , which had no meaning , imuless they did some good to the worshiper which he could not do ? The Jewish church then , by // a logical necessity , would fall away from Christianity ,  --  a fate that actually overtook a portion of it , which tried to liar . monize the new and the old . On the other hand , the Gentiles might fairly argue that if there had been a progress in religion as there was from Abraham onward , and if a new era had begun , and the religion had put on its universal character , there must be some change in forms and outward institutions to fit it for mankind . Of what possible use could it be to keep up a difference between Jew and Gentile , if the rights of both were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access by Christ to the Father . The third course then , that of doing away with whatever was local and symbolical , was the only logical , the only safe , the only beneficial one . But the steps by which the church among the Jews was led towards it were remarkable , as disclosing to us God 's way of letting light by degrees fall into minds blinded and swayed by national partiahities . First , Christ had uttered a few sayings looking that way , as that glorious one , " the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem , w6rship the Father . " Next it needed special revelations of a very remarkable kind , to show to Peter and the other disciples that there was to be no caste in the church , that a Jew might eat and mingle freely with a Gentile Christian , like Cornelius , as with a brother . Then the church was called upon to decide whether the Gentiles who believed should be bound to observe the law of Moses , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoke . Then the apostle Paul was raised up to show that the law was done away by Christ ,  --  the shadow by the substance ,  --  and his disciples pursued the same line of thought , until it became the triumphant and general view of the Christian body . And finally , the destruction of Jerusahem gave the death blow to a half Jewish half Christian religion ; the temple in ruins , the nation destroyed , the rites neglected or made impossible , who with a Christian mind could longer hold on to that which fanatical Jews had abandoned ? Thus , not by any one revelation directly bearing on the point , but by various hints as it were , did divine wisdom purge and separate the gospel from the old leaven of the Mosaic law . // As th' gospel seized on Jewish minds , it by degrees burst its fetters , it felt its freedom and power at once , it uttered to the world and for the world the noble words " where there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " This was a vital , a momentous advance . We are so far removed from Jewish ways of thinking that it may seem to us as if the Apostle to the Gentiles is wasting energy when he is battling with Jews concerning the law . But in fact he is the truest exponent of the gospel in all this , and by no means exaggerated the importance of the question at issue . But for him , humanly speaking , the religion of Christ could not have reached mankind . File , or some one less fitted by inward experience and acquaintance with the feelings of the Jews , was wanted to settle that question , for on it the destinies of the Gentile world depended . H. The universality of the gospel , we add in the second place , was favored by its clear disclosures concerning a future life . It is remarkable that so soon as the gospel embraced the world as its place of action , it embraced this world and the next s its time of action . Everywhere and forever were its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very explicit doctrine in relation to the last things , although such a doctrine was held , and was , at the time of Christ , widely entertained . The mind was in a condition of childhood ; it lived under an immediate Providence , whose rewards and punishments were not put off until after death , and so while it was a local , it was also , in a sense , an earthly religion , earthly , that is , to all except a few nobler men among the people . But when the gospel came into the world and when it travelled over the world , it was necessary that it should throw light upon a future life and the future destinies of man . We refer not to a logical necessity , to the fact that so great an event as the incarnation of the Son of God would seem destitute of meaning and out of proportion to the wants of man , if its bearings reached only to the end of the present life . Nor do we refer to the demands which the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must and ought // to clear up the mystery of man 's position in the world , which philosophy had vainly attempted to explore . But it was necessary for the success of the gospel , necessary in order to attract and sober and alarm the nations , necessary in order that men should perceive the greatness of the gift which the gospel offers , that it should speak a word of authority on the duration of the soul . It can not be conceived that men would long listen to a story of redemption , broken off in the midst , before it told of a hereafter . But on the other hand , when it brought the world to come before the eyes of men , it satisfied a longing which no mythology , no system of human wisdom , had met . And it put the life beyond the grave into such a connexion with the life this side , that all its teachings became interesting , momentous , iml ) erative . III . More , tar more , than all things else in the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and dying on the cross to procure forgiveness , contains a power over the universal human family . The elements of the old dispensation , which the new carried along with it , the doctrine of God , and of man 's fallen condition , are indeed fundamental truths of a universal nature , as interesting to the Greek as to the Jew , to the barbarian as to the Greek , and without them there could have been no gospel . But our remark now is that what belongs exclusively to the gospel , the manifestation of God to the world by his own Son in a state of humiliation , and above all through his atoning death , contained in itself a power and an attractiveness as wide as mankind . The death of Christ for sin did not draw its strength from those universal docrines of the old religion with which it was in company , so much as by its own strength it lent them a force they had not before . " And I , if I be lifted up , will draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what manner of death he should die . " It was surely a daring word for a Galilean to utter , when about to die a malefactor 's death , he said that such an event would cast Satan from his throne of empire and draw men unto himself . No other human being then living dreamed of such a thing . And almost every one who believed in a Messiah would have called him a dreamer for entertaining such a thought . But the facts of all lands and of all centuries since have proved // that Jesus knew mankind better than all wise men , Jew or pagan-that he knew man ' * heart as well as he knew himself ; and so the double fact of his consciousness of coming from God , and of his k nowledge where the strength of his religion lay . is an evidence , never to be overcome , that he is the Saviour for mankind . At the time when he uttered these words his lowliness was proof to many that he was an impostor . But his lowliness of station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depraved places , where no kingly virtues could penetrate . When he hung on the cross his enemies thought that an end was put to his pretensions and his faction . But what has interested the heart of the world since so much as this great moment ? Let Christian tears , let Christian song and art , let Christian theology in all its shapes , answer the question . Or let the new convert from heathenism in any quarter  --  the llindoo , or Sandwich Islander , or ilottentot , or American Indian-answer ; and he will tell of a strange power coining from the dying Christ . And this , whether he may have had instilled into him a theory of atonement or not . Let him follow the simple narrative and have no dogma-the narrative breaks and subdues him , as it did when told by the artless disciples of the Redeemer . Now , if we may get behind and analyze the feelings of Christian souls , in what consists the great power of the cross - of the cross , we mean , as taken in connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is there which gives their universal sway over men to these distinctive facts of the gospel ? In the first place the influence of the death of Christ on all races and times arises from its being a fact and not a dogma . The strength of heathenism lay in its mythologies , and when these were found to be false , no philosophy could hold them up or take their place . Mankind have ever had a longing to be brought into the presence of the Godhead , to have something authoratative from him ; and the revelation needs to take the shape of history to be powerful and attractive . Doctrine must come out of facts to have any power : it is dead being alone . // Again the cross appeals to the common feelings of our nature , which , whether men fully understand them or not , crave forgiveness and reconciliation with God . A sense of sin , careless as men seem about their conduct , lies in every breast , slumbering perhaps but not extinct . This sense of sin may meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it its lustrations and sacrifices , or would alarmingly enhance the guilt of sin , but the gospel is an enemy which can conquer it an I win it over . There is no other way of appealing to heathens than to dwellers in Christian lands ; both have the same kind , if not degree , of preparation for Christ , in a sense of distance from God and of falling short of the end for which they were made . The heathen needs little or no training before he is ready to receive Christ , and indeed , is better off than one who for years , by sophistries , has shielded himself from the truth . Thirdly , the cross satisfies the rational nature of all . We do not mean that all men or that any man can give a full explanation of Christ , or of his work , nor can we suppose that in a great scheme , involving relations of the deepest kind between God and man , complete explanation and removal of difficulties is possible . Nay more , if this were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not saved by clear understanding of truth , but by the awakening of feelings and purposes that are good , an , d these do not demand a perfectly definite statement . But we mean that however men explain the cross , they are convinced when they receive it that it is the wisdom of God . It is not something clothed in Jewish drapery , which a person of another race needs to strip naked and put into the abstractest form , in order to welcome it ; but it makes an appeal to all classes of minds everywhere , to all who have noticed the part which vicarious action plays in the world , and the good which vicarious suffering brings to thousands , and even to the undeserving . And if there were no adequate solution of the atonement we fall back on this which our whole race can appreciatethat in Christ living and dying there is a union of holiness and love . Holiness alone could not satisfy man , for he stands in dread and distrust aloof from a God of holiness . Love alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without revelation of God 's feeling toward sin , work no transformations . But loving holiness , holy love , can bring God and man together , can make man like God by winning him to God , as God became like man in order to win him . With this deep impression that in Christ 's offer of pardon , holiness and love are united ,  --  an impression which the cross makes on the heart of mankindwe have the outlines of a doctrine which , under various forms , commends itself to all . We may add that the condescension of Christ carries with it a power over mankind . There is no more moving form of love than this , which gives to divine Providence and grace its principal sweetness . This quality shines in all of Christ 's life and actions , for we go back in all to the incarnation of the Son of God . The height of this attractive glory of character reaches us at the lowest point of Christ 's lowliness , at the ignominious cross itself . When we contemplate him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him our love , and the stronger , the lower we feel ourselves to be in sin , and the deeper in our depression . His condescension commends him thus to all , and most to the mass of mankind . Another obvious cord which binds him to all mankind is his brotherly sympathy , which indeed is nothing else but love in his state of humiliation . It is not the sympathy of man , which would have comparatively but little value and power , nor the love of God , but the feeling entertained towards man by the incarnate Saviour , who has made himself their fellow . It unites thus all the power of love divine and human . Nor would the work of Christ as the world 's Saviour be complete , if we were to stop at the cross . His exaltation carries the power of his death into his life in glory , attracts the faith and hope of man towards heaven , shows to his wondering eye the great sc*de and wide extent of the plan of grace , and exhibits him as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death of Christ are the foundation of Christian morality , which is in some of its features unlike all other forms of morality , Jewish or philosophical , and commends itself as a model , to all mankind . Here we see the passive virtues // first raised to a level with or above the active , arid a kind of heroism exhibited in action which the lowest can admire and imitate . Here we see action under the sway of such virtues taking the place of the contemplation of the philosopher , and therefore possible for all . Here we find a new idea of lifethat its purity consists not in religious observances or withdrawal from the world , but in ennobling all the scenes and relations of life , great and small , by a spirit of consecration to God . The divine and human are blended in the life of the Christian , as they are in union in the person of the Saviour . The great characteristics of Christian morality are such as to appear possible for all ; they wear a human garb which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life such as Christ 's , however it rebukes sin , commands the respect and attracts the love of the world . V. We add , fifthly , that the brotherhood of Christians , unplied in Christian privileges and taking form in the church , greatly helps the system to become nniversal . A religion of castes , or one with a priestly class , divides society and degrades its lower Ineml ) ers . A religious philosophy is not fitted for mankind . A national religion puts up a bar against human brotherhood . But as all differences of inca are infinitely small before God , arid as Christ came for the whole race , there was laid up in true religion , especially in its form of redeniption , a fraternal spirit . All are brethren even as Christ is the brother of all . A common redemption involves a community of believers , who are one every where and through all classes . This one Catholic church , in which all share alike , is the only society spreading through the world that has ever been conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a church , or various churches for different ranks , and you will feel that in such a system , if it were possible , the Gospel would defeat itself , and limit its own spread from land to land , and from one stratum of society to another . We have confined our attention to the question , What there is in Christianity itself to gain access for it among men every where and at all stages of culture ? Did not the subject stretch beyond our limits , we might put this quality of the // Gospel to the test of fact and observation . We might draw notice to its power of attraction for all kinds of minds and of sensibilities , for the intellectual and the warm-hearted , for the hopeful and the desponding , for the practical and the contemplative , for the mind of coarser and that of finer mould , the manly and the feminine , the experienced and the inexperienced . We might show its sympathies with art , science , and political liberty . We might gather the testimonies of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinement of a race , neither its inaptness for reflection nor its worn out civilization , nor even its self-conceit can neutralize the force of Christianity . Every where , and in all classes , it shows its restorative , formative , creative power . As " there is neither Jew nor Greek , neither bond nor free , neither male nor female , but all are one in Christ Jesus , " so its aim is to make one family of God , one kingdom of heaven to which all nations am-c to belong , and this the proof of facts shows that it can accomplish . But dismissing these considerations thus briefly , we go on to close our discussion with a few reflections ; the first of which is that this universal character of Christianity is best taught by experience . The man who receives it in its power into his heart knows that it has transformed him not by its sway over civilized men , nor over those who are imbued with Old Testament ideas , but by its sway over him as a man , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common with all mankind . 1f having exalted his conception of the universal Ruler , and deepened his sense ef obligation and of sin , it now speaks to him of the worth of his soul , of his wants , of the Christian redemption , and the Christian life of holiness , he knows that the plea is as applicable to all who bear the human name ; and if it can transform and purify him , it can do the same for men in Africa , or Labrador , or China-it is a religion for the world . Its ti-uths , under the impressive form of facts and of life , he knows to be universal truths , and to be designed for all . He therefore believes in a Catholic church , in the feasibility ot missions , in the future spread of Christianity in every clime . The Christian spirit that is in him makes him hopeful ; he , more than all men besides , believes in the capacity of man to // rise above the present confusion of the world , and to approach nigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes , nor governments , nor the nineteenth century , but the Gospel , this which has made civilization what it is more than all causes besides , and is purifying governments , this which can carry civilization where it goes and make all things new there , while if civilization went alone it would but increase the capacity of savages to do evil . 2 . The Gospel is no republication , and authorized exposition of the religion of nature , as some persons , called Christians , have accounted it . It is something more , or else nothing . It claims to contain a method of recovering man from his ruins through the life and death of the Son of God , which , by its startling nature , proves that it must be some new additional revelation , or some marvelous imposture . The power with which it has acted on man , through what is novel in it and superadded to the old religion , shows that it was no new edition merely of the religion of Adam , Abraham , and Moses , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims to be a religion adapted for the fulness of times , the patriarchal religion and Judaism being but messengers sent to prepare its way ; to be a religion for those who had been trained already under the divine law and the system of the Old Testament ; to be a religion of the latter days , of the last stage of man 's historical progress in this world ,  --  in other words , to be man 's religion until the coming again of Christ for judgment . And if so , it is idle , it is unchristian to try to recommend Christianity by rounding off its corners and sharp points , in order to have as little that is positive about it as possible . TIe can not understand or love the Gospel who makes such an attempt . He can not understand man who does not perceive that there are principles in him and wants every where , through all races , in civilized life and in savage , which Christianity with its dying redeemer , and its future retributions , and its Divine Spirit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civilized country or age should perchance show a spirit alien from the Gospel , the fault would not lie in the Gospel 's want of universality but in the godlessly corrupt character of the age or civilization . How foolish , how cowardly , to bring // it shorn of its peculiarities to the mind of the world , because there are now , as there were at first , many who reject it for those peculiarities . How foolish , we say , is this , when it has won its way , and obtained its triumphs , and set itself up in the hearts and thinking of men as a controlling power , chiefly by what is peculiar to it and characteristic . Take away all this , and if you could still offer salvation to men , you would have cut the cord which binds man to the Gospel , you would have brought about the death of positive revealed religion . 3 . The idea is therefore vain that the Gospel will be superseded in the progress of society by some more abstract religion , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some seem to think that civilization has a power to do good without Christianity . As the master said , in his foresight of the triumph of his religion , " now is the Prince of this world cast out , " so say they , standing on the hilltop of this nineteenth century , " now is the Redeemer of the world cast out . " He represents , they admit , the highest development of humanity , and his views are nearest to the truth . All religions have had some grains of truth in them ; His has the most ; but a time is coming and now is , when the world is become old and knowing enough to get along without revelation by a simple faith in the God of nature . Such is to be the worldreligion of the maturity of mankind . There are two questions that arise before us here ; one whether the Gospel is true or not , the other whether , if it be discarded , any other religion will take its place among menfor that some one religion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of these questions we are here not immediately conceri*ed . If it be false , it must fall ; if true , it will stand its ground , as it has stood its ground hitherto , against the attacks of its foes and the follies of its friends . And the man who rejects it must find it hard to account for its wonderful adaptation to all races and ages . Whence did falsehood get such a hold over mankind* But the other question-what the world could do without the Gospel-what universal religion could take its place , deserves our attention , and indeed claims it for a longer time // than we can now spare . Let us , as it regards this question , briefly consider one or two points . First . Such a new religion must be a philosophy , another revelation being out of the question . Now it is probable , if not certain , that the loss of authority and of vivid irnpressiveness , which would arise from putting human dogmas in the place of the life of a divine teacher , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dust . Who that considers the cravings of man disclosed by all mythology for a connection with heaven , who that understands where the power of the Gospel lies , will doubt that the power of a religion depends on its being believed to state facts concerning God , and that as soon as men make a religion for themselves , it will lose its hold on them ,  --  as soon as they have constructed an automaton pretending to have life , they will get behind the machinery , and laugh at it . Secondly . What will be the conclusions of this new universal religion of man 's devising ? What will it lay down as certain ? Will it teach the immortality of the soul ? But the most advanced philosophy , that of Hegel , is so dark on that great point , that after the founder 's death his school divided into two parts contending with one another-like Michael and the devil about the body of Moses-on this very question , Whether or not he taught the soul 's immortality . Will it teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive philosophy of Comte ignores final causes altogether . The foundations of the religion  --  or universal philosophy as we may call it-it would seem , must shrink to about the proportions of atheism . Thirdly . The ideas of sin , repentance , redemption , immortality , are inwrought into the literature , art , life , and feelings of all Christian lands . They serve , in fact , as resting places for the intellect , sentiments , and hope of myriads . When a vacuum is created by the departure of the Gospel , what tshall fill it ? Or could it ever thrust out the Gospel , unless it brought in something for men to rely upon , to hope from , to love and to fear ? Fourthly . Civilization and progress are words of jugglery , they are general terms of no meaning except as including the // motive forces which lead man on to the standard of perfect manhood . These forces are religion , morals , social life , govern*nent , art , and science . The chief of these motive forces is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them any more than the most nicely furnished locomotive can leave its place , or can go on safely without steam or a road ? Would it not be as absurd to say that civilization consists in that advancement of society which will supersede the family and the state , as in that which will supersede the necessity of religion ? ( Tntil civilization can create some new kind of force to perfect mankind , it must depend in no small degree for its perfection and spread on the moral powers called into being by the Gospel . And , in fact , the highest civilization hitherto reached , contains within itself enormous disorders . Where great masses are crowded together as in large cities , extreme refinement gives to some an elegant sceptical worldliness , while close by them there are godless desperates , savages worse than the Pagans who live under simpler institutions . Will those cultivated men who are throwing religion away surpass Christians in the earnestness of doing good ; and what will doing good mean , if God and immortality and the Gospel ideal of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly intended to make men good ; it does contain very strong motives to virtue and uprightness , and yet its influence is small , and hitherto upon a few . How , when its truths are denied and its motive power is stopped , can there be any better state of things ? They are bound to say , who are busy in hastening on such an era . Until , then , there are signs more than we have now , that some new cause or combination of causes will perfect man and SQciety , we will believe that the renovation of the world is laid in the hands of the Gospel . And we will hope in it , as the grand catholicon , as the tree of life which yields her fruit every month , and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations .
