txt The commission appointed to investigate the Philadelphia Custom-house , in their report to Secretary Sherman , speaking of the system of sampling merchandise and the disposition made of samples in the Appraiser 's Department , say : " The samplers wore permitted to take out the molasses so collected from time to time anti sell it for their own account . The sugar was distributed in packages to those employes who desired it , and bottles of ordinary wines and liquors were given out in the same way . That this should lead in course of time to the samplers ' taking more for examination than was requisite was to ho expected , and the evidence tends to show that in the matter of molasses more particularly this was the case . The impropriety and evil tendency of the practice is so manifest that we can not but regard it as indicative of lax administration , and we can not accept as sufficient the plea of the Appraiser that he was not informed of the existence of the alleged abuses . As head of the department it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to diligently seek , rather than to wait for , information as to the acts of his subordinates . The samples of wines and liquors no t distributed as above stated were , it seems , consumed on the premises . The sample-room was more or less a place of resort for refreshment by officials and their friends , including , as is said , Special Agents and others from Washington . There were various statements as to the extent to which this was carried , but , as we recognize no degrees in such an abuse , we are glad to report that it was altogether stopped by the Collector 's action , and we have heard of no cause for complaint in that respect since . Carelessness of employes in connection with the custody and use of this room , wo are told , once resulted in a fire within it , and that an investigating commission reported it as haying arisen from another than the real cause . " As to whether any goods liable to duty have been permitted to be landed without proper permit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at various times the above mentioned offense has been committed under the following circumstances : Deputy Surveyor Charles Redheffer , while superintending the discharge of steam-ships from foreign ports , has authorized cases of wines and spirituous and fermented liquors to be landed without permit and payment of duty . Deputy Surveyor Hiram P. Goodrich bad done likewise . The articles so landed were sometimes for the benefit of some officer or agent of the steam-ship company , and sometimes for the benefit of the said and other revenue officers and their friends , being usually obtained as gifts or gratuities from the officers or agents of the companies . The said Deputies , together with the Surveyor , E. 0 . Goodrich , have each received some of the articles so landed , knowing , or having reason to know , that the same had been landed without permit and payment of duty . The Naval Officer has received articles so landed on one or two occasions , but states that he did not know from whom they came , nor of their unlawful importation . It appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special Agents , and a report made thereon at the time to the department , accompanied by numerous affidavits of inspectors and others , implicating the said officers of the Surveyor 's Department , but no action was taken thereon , so far as we are informed . We examined the Surveyor and his two Deputies as to the matters charged in the affidavits , and , although they each denied that these violations of law had been as frequent as represented therein , each one admitted his knowledge thereof to a greater or less extent , and his participation in some instances therein by passing or receiving the goods , or both . " Dispatch to the Associated Press . ? WASHINGTON , Sept. ** Charles Platt , Henry D. Welsh , and Thomas Simons , the Commission appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury to examine the conduct of business at the Philadelphia Custom-house , say the general object of the inquiry was declared to be " to ascertain what abuses , if any , exist in the transaction of Custom-house business at Philadelphia , and to secure such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With regard to the Collectors ' Department the cornmisaion specially examined each one of the clerical force as to the nature and extent of his duties , and had opportunities of observing the general conduct of business and the working tone of the force . The conclusion that it can be somewhat reduced without injury to the service is largely based on the conviction that more perfect organization can and should be obtained , al- , though the aid of legislation is perhaps necessary to fully accomplish this result . The suspension of the Assistant Collector at Camden is recommended on the ground that the duties of his office are not sufficient to justify its continuance . One of the nine pointsof inquiry made by the committee in their investigation was " Whether any of the officers now employed have been or are engaged in any other business , and whether they reside at points so remote from Philadelphia as to cause them to be absent from their official business to the injury of the service , or whether from any other cause they have failed to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regulations demand I " They found that certain of the officers have been and are engaged at some other business , as follows : John A. Hiesland . Naval Officer , has been since his appointment , ( May 1 , 1871 , ) editor and proprietor of weekly and daily newspapers , published at Lancaster . Penn. , under the title successively of the Lancaster Examiner and Herald and the Lancaster Examiner and Express , E. 0 . Goodrich , Surveyor . has been since his appointment ( April 3 , 18690 and is proprietor of the Bradford Reporter , a weekly newspaper published at Towanda , Bradford County , Penn. , but states that , though his name has appeared in issues of the paper as editor , he has not since his appointment performed editorial duty , and has had no interest in it except as lessor . E. B. Moore , Local Appraiser , has been since his appointment , ( Feb. 1 , 1870 , ) and is proprietor and editor of the American Republican , formerly a weekly , but now a semi-weekly newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William J. Pollock , General Appraiser , bas been since his appointment and is engaged in the clothing business , both in the Cities of Philadelphia and Now-York . George C. M. Eicholtz , Examiner , has been , since his appointment , proprietor of a drug store at Downington , Penn . Mr. Eicholtz states that he does not carry on the business himself , and that ho is trying to dispose of the store . John B. Boovier , Captain of the night watch , carries on the business of a butcher in Philadelphia . Daniel B. Beitler , daily inspector , keeps a hotel in Philadelphia . It was charged that some others of the inspector force were in private business , but this was denied by them . Upon their inquiry as to how appointments have been made , and whether on political influence , without due regard to efficiency , they answer : The heads of departments have in sonic cases appointed persons of their own selection , but more commonly their nominees have been selected by others , and most frequently by members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems to have been customary for members of Congress particularly to claim the nomination in such cases , as a sort of official privilege or perquisite , and we think there can be no doubt that practically they do control and make a majority of the appointments , though the forms of law are , of course , observed . The heads of departments certainly seem to so understand it , as a sort of record is kept in which certain appointments are set off to.the account of certain persons . The present Collector , who has been in office about a year , and who has within that time made a number of appointments , states that they have been chiefly of his own selection , but that in seine cases the claims of politicians have been regarded . He insists , however , that duo regard to efficiency has always been preserved . The other heads also claim this in their own cases . The commission is not satisfied , however , that any suitable examination into the character and qualifications of political selections has been made before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken to be as stated by the claimants , and that the facts are thus left to be developed by experience after the appointment , in consequence of which changes have sometimes to be made . The committee state that in all the charges brought to their attention , no officer at this port was accused of receiving a bribe , and no evidence of such an offense was received from any witness . With respect to the receipt of gratuities , the affidavits and testimony relating to the transactions of the Surveyor and others of his force prior to January , 1876 , have been already mentioned . The practice appears to have been effectually broken up by the investigation'at that time , but great care should be taken that it be not revived , as the temptation to and opportunities for the commission of the ofmist ) are greater perhaps in this department than elsewhere . So far as the evidence shows , there has been no practice of this kind in other departments . and nothing that can be fairly called an instance of its occurrence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extinguish it , the moral effects with their subordinates will be of the utmost value , but they must , of course , be free front even the appearance of evil themselves . In conclusion , it is proper to say that , while we have freely , criticised , as has been seen , every abuse or tendency thereto , the existence of which we believed to be indicated by the evidence , and also whatever seemed to us objectionable in the characto r or conduct of individuals , and have indicated the general and particular directions in which we think improvement is needed and should be made , we take pleasure in reporting our conviction that on the whole the condition of the service at the present time is reasonably satisfactory ; that it is conducted to the general approbation of the business community ; that corruption is apparently unknown , and that the irregularities which have prevailed have sprung from loose construction of the law and erroneous views of duty ; that the force , as to character and capacity , is of a very fair average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been noted , is efficiently done ; that the service in all branches has been greatly improved within the past year , and that the tendency and tone of its conduct at present is generally healthful and in the right direction . The committee intend to make a supplemental report . The Secretary of the Treasury to day addressed a letter to the members of the commission in which he says : Penult me to return the hearty thanks of tho department for the manifest fullness and thoroughness of the examination you have made , and for the great labor you have bestowed on the performance of a duty that was irksome at best . Your general suggestions meet my approval , and it will be my effort , after a full and detailed examination of your specific recommendations , to curry into effect as rapidly as possible the great body of those that fall within the power of this department . Where the law needs modifying it will be my duty to submit the proposed changes to Congress . I have no doubt the publication of your report , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor abuses pointed out ; but their complete correction must depend largely upon the industry , attention , and fidelity of the lending officers , who will see in your report the nature and danger of the abuses that have occurred in the Philadelphia Custom-house , and I assure you it will be the effort of the department to hold them strictly to this duty . I will await with interest your supplemental report . SAN FRANCISCO , Cal. , Sept. ** a meeting of the Treasury Commission to examine Custom-house affairs last evening , T. W.
