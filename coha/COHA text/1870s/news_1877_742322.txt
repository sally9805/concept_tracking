txt The Democratic Party has certainly done its best to degrade the public service . The bad old system of parceling out offices as the reward of party services is purely of Democratic origin . It was a Democratic leader who invented the vicious saying of " To the victors belong the spoils . " And to the teachings and practice of the party is justly chargeable a groat proportion of the official corruption which has been so common throughout the country . As if this were not enough , the same politicians who have encouraged every species of dishonesty in office , have attempted to degrade the men who serve the Republic in the Navy , Army , and the civil dipartmonts . At the present time , for example , wo have the spectacle before us of the officers of the United States Army skirmishing for their pay , raising money on their vouchers , and resorting to all manner of expedients to get cash enough to meet their current expenses . It is a disgraceful sight , and the men who compose the flower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been proposed to disband the Army outright , it would have been only decent to retire the officers on pensions or half-pay . But here are men " who have given their best days to their country . They have  --  some of them  --  fought well in the field ; and all of them expect to make the military service ) the business of their lives . Without warning , they are suddenly cut oil ' from their legal pay ; and when the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of War try to provide Means for tiding over the difficulty- , so that officers and their families shall not ? be left penniless , Democratic papers howl with derision . Who is responsible for the necessity for these expedients ? Of course , Mr. RANDALL and the men whom he led in the House will say that it is better that the Army should go without pay than that it should be used , as they think , for illegal purposes . That is to lay , tile Dctuociacy will arrogate to itself the right to say what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deprived of their lawful wages . But the saute pretense can not be used ' in the case of the Navy . The scurvy treatment of the officers and men of that branch of the service was part of a conspiracy . The pay-roll of the Navy is precisely like the pay-roll of a commercial house or factory . So many so much money needed . The Secretary sent the payrolls to Congress , asking for the amount of money required . This was $7,600,000 . The Democrats in the House held the imiional purse-strings . They were preparing for the Presidential election by pretending to cut down the expenses of the Government . They appropriated $5,700,000 for pay of officers and men , though they were perfectly well aware that a deficiency would ho created , and that the men , temporarily deprived of their , just dues , would have a claim on the Public Treasury , which must be paid , sooner or later . To be sure , after the election was over , the House grudgingly appropriated $1,000,000 , as if the demagogues who follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put back the money in driblets . But a deficiency exists , and must exist , unless Congress desires to see the naval people recover their pay through the courts , like so many petty creditors . Meantime , officers and mon of the Navy , who are borrowing and otherwise living from hand to mouth , will thank the Democracy for their annoyances and privations . The same reckless dishonesty which prompted this blow at the Army and Navy characterized the Democratic managers ill their conclusions on all appropriations , excepting those which personally concerned themselves . Thus , the members of some of the committees participated in a wild scramble for appropriations for their " deestricks , " while they cut down those for paying soldiers , sailors , and clerks . The same men who were willing to keep up an appearance of economy for party 's sake , wore eagerly snatching the public money to improve creeks and trout brooks in their own localities . The Post Office Department required $135,000 for printing blanks . The House appropriated $105,000 . The request was a reasonable one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency . Not a dollar has been saved by all this contemptible meanness . The men who were guilty of it knew that they wore not saving money . They knew that the time must come when these bills must be paid . The business of the Government , which is the business of the people , must go on , somehow . The failure to provide money to pay the expenses of the Government creates temporary embarrassment and delay , but it saves nothing . The country is now suffering the consequences of the fraud committed by the Democratic H011110 . Not only are deficiencies piled up against some future day of settlement , bat thousands of men in the public service are " shinning " around among lenders trying to got money enough to help them on until relief conies . Government officers are at their wits ' end to meet the expenses which the laws make necessary , but which a dishonest political management has withheld the money needed to pay . For the officers and servants of a great nation to be reduced to such straits is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately conspired to make every man ashamed of the service of his country , they could not leave gone about it mere effectually than they did .
