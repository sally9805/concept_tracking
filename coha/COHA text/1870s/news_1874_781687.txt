txt The New-York World may always be safely trusted to do one of two things at election time  --  either to make its candidates supremelrridieulous or to sell them out altogether . It adopted the latter method in the Presidential canvass of 1868 . Somebody came along with the money-bags , the Sheriff was paid off , and " independent journalism " triumphed . During the present contest this " organ , " at present the private property of Mr. TILDEN , has , probably , sincerely endeavored to help its master ; bat it has , in reality , done him a vast deal of mischief . It has raised up enemies for him iu all directions , has never been satisfied except when it was stirring up strife , and , finally , has set itself to work to caricature the poor man whom it denounced in 1872 as a scheming " railroad politician . " The people are now invited to behold Mr. TILDEN as the modern " Hercules . " A Hercules of this size and pattern is at least unique , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If lie could only have added him to his procession on Saturday it would have rendered that curious affair a still greater success , especially among children and persons from the aural districts . In those " triple sheets " for which Mr. TILDEN is drawing so largely upon his banking account , he is represented as the " Hercules who slew the Tammany hydra . " We only wish that he could be honestly regarded in that light . But the melancholy truth is , as we pointed out yesterday , that the " hydra " is by no means dead . In 1871 the first great blow was dealt at it from the polls , but Mr. TILDEN took no part in that , because he was fresh from presiding over TWEED 'S packed convention . In 1872 HOFFAf &N; and the remnants of Tammany were driven out . A scapegoat was made of TWEED ; for that is really all that TWEED 'S punishment amounts to . Ho was not a , bit worse than SWEENY , or " Slippery Dick , " or GENET , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all escaped . And it is understood that even TWEED is to be let cfr if Mr. TILDEN can get ' himself elected . But the essential fact to remember is that the Tammany Ring was not permanently broken in 1872 ? at was only temporarily thrust aside . It promises to be as powerful as ever in the course of a very few weeks , if the people suffer themselves to be deluded by the respectable figure-head which is now paraded at its front . What was done toward the destruction of the Tweed Ring was done without Mr. TILDtN 'S consent or assistance , as is sufficiently attested by the frequent appeals made to him in these columns between . September , 1869 , and September , 1871 . They clearly show where the " smallest Hercules in the world " stood during that critical period . But afterward , by way of saving himself and the remains of the Democratic Party , Mr. TILDEN helped to prosecute TWEET ) in the courts and dealt some valiant blows at a man already politically dead . But no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thieves , for , unhappily , it is not destroyed even now , and this is a more conclusive answer to TILDEN 'S present pretensions than all the wrangling and argument in the world . While our pocket Hercules is going about the city waving a sword ten times as long as himself , and while the other doughty warrior , whom old Mr. BENNETT used to contemptuously call MANTALINI MARRimy , " is vowing that Tom Thumb slew Tammany , behold ! Tammany is getting ready to spring at the *throat of the City . " I killed it , " cries our Titanic TILDEN , but the worst of it is . that it is not dead at all . We non : of us have killed it , and so we need none of us brag . It is even holding up ' Hercules himself between its finger and thumb . Look at the facts  --  the broad , open facts , not to be explained away by all the newspapers in creation . " JIMMY " HAYES was one of the " old Board of Supervisors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Tammany robberies . This HAYES was himself the means of passing through the board fraudulent warrants to the amount of $ 1,337,928 ? we published a full list of those warrants yesterday , with dates , amounts , signatures , and . everything complete . And yet Jimin-Y HAYES has been nominated by the Tam-many of to-day for the important and responsible office of Register . He is running side by side with Mr. TILDEN  --  SO that one of the most notorious of the Tammany rascals is actually sitting on the back of our Hercules at the very moment when he is bragging of his tremendous victory . Again , JOHN MORRISSEY is to-day the leading man in Democratic counsels . JOHN KELLY is his associate . In every ward in the City the men who are working for TILDEN and HAYES are the very men who used to work for TWEED and SWEENY . Every inhabitant of this City who is familiar with the by-ways of politics knows all this to be the truth . It is not mere election talk . Let the Democrats succeed to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power no less dangerous and disgraceful than the last . It can be restored in a single day ; it may be the work of years to drive it from our midst again . Under these circumstances , what can sensible people do when they see poor Mr. TILDEN flourishing all over the City as the Liliputian Hercules , while the greater number of the old Tammauy thieves are mocking at him ? What eau they do but pity his blindness and laugh at his folly 1 If they vote for the rest gyration of the Tammany Ring , with only a slight change or two among its chiefs , at least they will do it . with their eyes open , and will deserve all that happens to them afterward.
