txt I thank you for the honor you have conferred upon me . I am glad to meet here tonight men who - represent the wealth , the intelligence , the vigor , and the enterprise which have made New-York the im ? Aerial city of this continent , and doubly:glad to greet them as members of that noble party which , in a death  --  struggle , proserved a nation for our inheritance , During four long and weary and wasting years the ' Republican Party of the North . in the Cabinet , in the field , in every department of the Government , stood firm and united under its martyred leader , knowing no North , no South , no East , no West , but , looking forward through the lurid flame and smoke of battle , and over the fresh graves of thousands of loved heroes , it saw in the distance , and as the reward of all sacrifices , a compacted and mighty nation , whose millions were to make their rich heritage blossom like the rose by the labor of free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed during the darkest period of our history , and now this picture , transferred from the canvas of faith and hope , has become a solid reality which treason , can not undermine nor violence destroy . To-day we know there is no limit to our power , no measure of our wealth , no height to which the flag of our Union may ' not justly be advanced , and in the esteem of the Old and of the New World no bounds to the honors deserved by that silent , earnest , and maguifi , cent soldier , to whom so much of this national power and prosperity and glory are due . To-day the hungry millions of Europe are fed from the products of a soil which but a few years since echoed to the tramp of hostile armies , trembled under the roar of artillery , was desolated by fire and sword , and made drunk with the blood of its bravest sons . To . day the gold drawn from tho mines of California and sent abroad to redress the balance which war and extravagance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World , is being returned to us in exchange for bread and meat to feed its swarming people ; and finally we stand on solid ground  --  our tiag everywhere respected , our national credit undoubted and unstained , ovr promises to pay equal to , nay , better , than the gold promised , and our future seoure , if we guard it well , and to do this the authors of these great blessings must , for some years to come , hold them in sacred charge . We are hero to . night in council ; we ? shall meet at the polls on the first Tuesday of November in testimony of our purpose to perforth this great duty . It is said by Democratic orators that in this canvass we should confine ourselves to State issues , and bo silent as the grave upon national questions , ignoring the terrible past , its painful memories'and solemn warnings . Of these the Democratic Party is naturally shy , and would gladly bury them out as sight ; but ghastly faces and skeleton forms wilt rise in its halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soathero prisons will appear and sit at its feasts . They wilt not down at the bidding of chief stewards , and there is po garment so ample as to coneoalthem from sight . it is said that we wave bloody garments , stir up sectional issues , and arouse sectional strife . This is not true . Never has the North presented to the South a sectional issue , and never has the North accepted or embraced one . When the South attempted to destroy the Union , and waged battle for that purpose , the North accepted the issue , and poured out its blood and treasure to preserve the nation from ' destruction . This was a national , not a sectional , Issue . The rebellion was finally crushed . This was a national , not a sectional , achieve . meat . Then came amendments to the Constitution  --  all opposed by those who had been in rebellion , but finally these were adopted . Thee duty to execute these is certainly a national one , ' , which every citizen North and South is bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how has this Malty been regarded ? The complaint of Northern Republicans ever since these amendments were adopted has been , and still is , that throughout the South they have been violated and disregarded , and , especially that the right of suffrage of the colored man has been taken from him by force , artifice , and bloody violence , while the political independence of white Republicans has been constantly outraged and substantially denied . These are grave fringemonts of national rights to which the North will not submit , and when they are sought to be redressed by the awakening of public sentiment , or at the ballot  --  box , Demos crate will gain nothing by the cry . that the North is seeking to raise sectional issues , or to re-awaken sectional strife . When the national wrongs and outrages to which I have briefly referred cease , then . will Republicans cease to call upon the North to uprise and redress them by executingthose constitutitan ; : amendments which are almost'the sole fruitg of the war . These the Republican Party is resolved to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . son and out of season , that duty will be meet ! . Democratic orators have insisted that only State issues should form the topic for speeches during this canvass . They have declared that the two parties do not substantially differ upon State questions , and , therefore , that no reason exists foe . dieplecing the present State Administration . There has lately been some slight " unpleasantness " iu the usually united and harmonious Democratic family . in the course of which certain prominent memberq of it have been exposing some  --  probably not an ? of its dirty linen , and it appears from this oxposurti that certain garments worn by Gov . Robinson him . self have upon them dark spots not altogether con ; sistont with official cleanliness . We all know the old adage  --  When rogues fall out , &e.,;  --  and we need only read the address of the Kelly State Committee , published on the 8th inst. , to learn what was before well under . stood  --  that Gov . Robinson has been but clay ip the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remolded by him , we can easily guess now little of God 's liuedewould thereafter remain . It he s 1 told that a skillful laundress , under Pelton 's direction , could cipher the spots out of the Governor 's garment , and that if a committee were sent hero Tilden would testify that his relation to that officer had been at most but a ' ' futile dalliance ; " but in view of the fact that the official integrity of the Governor may at least be doubted , it is thought best , as the incumbent of that high office should be abovo suspicion , to exchange him in January for Alonzo IL Cornell , an irreproachable man , brave and earnest in the discharge of duty , endowed with solid common sense , in all reswsts thoroughly fit for tho high office he has been called to fill . I need not commend hint for his political faith . That is and long has been known of all men . Nor need I say a word as to his service in the cause ho long sin e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great value to his party , to his State , and to the country . Young gentlemen and boys , calling themselves Republicans , who have been unable to question his capacity , his integrity , or his long and faithful devo ? tion to the Republican cause , have objected to hint because he was nominated by the machine , and , not having a distinct conception of what was meant by the machine , they evidently regard it as some strange monster , which should have no agency in the nomi. nation of a Governor , although they de not semi to object to it as a means of nominating othersupou the State ticket . Now , to quiet the apprehensions of these young persons let - me tell theta that the machino to which they refer is really but the organized Republican Party of the State of New-York , without which nothing valuable in politics can be achieved . To be nominated by It is ; therefore , but nomination by the organized Republican Party of this State ? a nomination by no means to be despised or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion would have triumphed , for without them public opinion could not have been created , compacted , and directed . Indeed , churChes and societies , benevolent purposes , are , in is sense , organized machines for the promotion of religious good works and kindness among men . And so it may bo said of armies  --  that they are organized machines , add their Generals engineers to direct them . With one of those vast and terrible engines Sherman thundered to the ses , and , with others , his groat chief hurled destruction upon the armies of the rebellion until they quailed and dually surrendered . I beg those young gentlemen to dismiss their prejudices until , at least , they better understand the subject , and , if they would preserve their self.reapeet , they should do no scratching ? at least , until after the election . I trust they do not belong to a class of outside tramps , who run with the machine only when they think it Is on the rightliath and is sure of success . There are some who exorcise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will run with the Republican . or With the Democratic machine until they can judge with reasonable certainty which is to outstrip the other in the race . Then they desire to ride upon that which is to succeed , and , naturally enough , would like to be engineers and stokers , to tho exclusion of those who bore the brunt and heat of the contest ; and , quite naturally , the latter object to this , anti insist that if the tramps are to ride at all they shall take an ; outside seat , and leave those who have organized the machine and conducted it thus far to continue to manage it . Jean assure the young gentlemen who are dissatisfied with the nomination of Mr. Cornell that this is not an unjust or an unreasonable view for engineers and firemen to take , and I trust my advice will be adopted  --  to scratch no Republican tickets until after the election . I now have the pleasure of presenting to you a master in the science of finance , who does not bury his treasures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human nature as well , for he knows that men do not hurry to exchange naper for gold when the paper ' is equivalent to the solid metal . Hence , resumption , which the Democratic Party insisted could neither be accomplished nor maintained , has become fixed and irrevocable , with gold flowing into , instead of from , the Treasury . Ho is the formidable enemy of usury , for under his influence interest has shrunk from 6 to 4 per cent. ; and should he much longer mind/lister our finances , bondholders and money-lenders fear it may sink to 3 . Be is not their favorite , but the people respect and honor John Sherman , not of Washington , nor of Ohio merely , but of the United States of America . He will now address the Republicans of the City of New-York.
