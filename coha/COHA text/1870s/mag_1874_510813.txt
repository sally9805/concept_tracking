ONE OF MANY . THE world just now is full of heroes , for the wars of the late decade are resplendent with actions well fulfilling the poet 's prophecy of the period when " Many a darkness into the light shall leap , And shine in the sudden making of splendid names . " But among all the laureled number it has not been our fortune to hear of any whose exploits eclipse in brilliancy and eilan those of one of our young naval officers who entered the lists a stripling , and whom the close of the war found , at the age of twentytwo , with the rank of lieutenant-commander , and with the engrossed thanks of Congress and of the Navy Department in his possession , together with countless testimonials , medals , and acknowledgments from generals of division , Union Leagues , and corporate bodies in all parts of the country : tributes to deeds which bring back to us a remembrance of those of the old heroic days - deeds so great that men became great through the mere recital of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risked life and fame for his country as Lieutenant-Commander William B. Cushing did deserves some other record than the disjointed and fragmentary one hidden away in the archives of the Bureau of State ; and it is a task full of interest to gather one rumor and another , sift their truth , and put official statement by statement , till the story of those five glorious years of his service stands complete . Midshipman Cushing sailed from Boston in the frigate Minnesota , and reached Hampton Roads in May , 1861  --  a lad then scarcely seventeen years old , but fully determined upon playing a great part in the great events to come . The Curnberland , the Quaker City , and the Monticello , men-of-war , all lay in the roads , and the latter of them , which has the honor of having been the first ship under fire in the rebellion , young Cushing subsequently commanded . The fleet had not been at anchor a single day when five schooners , loaded witli tobacco , were captured ; and that night the young midshipman took into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . During the next month he was on duty with the blockading squadron on the Carolina coast ; but in August he was again in Hampton Roads , and was in the first launch with those sent to storm a battery and burn some small vessels ; and in the same month he sailed in the Minnesota to the assault of the Hatteras forts , the squadron consisting of the flagship with six other men-of-war and some steam-transports , and being the largest that had ever sailed together under the American flag . The waters to which Hatteras Inlet gave entrance at that time swarmed with privateers and blockade - runners , and its possession was an object of importance , and was guarded by the two forts , Clark and // Hatteras . As the squadron moved into line , and the first shot fired by the Wabash was answered by the rebel guns instantaneously , and every ship seemed suddenly sheeted in flame , the scene heightened by the contrast of perfect peace otherwise on sea and sky during all the bright summer day , we can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time under the fire of one of those engagements to which his fancy had thrilled a thousand times , and his enjoyment of it may be known by the eagerness with which from that moment he plunged into every thing affording any promise of the same *xcitement and danger . During the following winter Midshipman Cushing did blockading duty on the Cambridge , and saw some hot work with a party cutting out " a schooner up a narrow stream , being attacked by and defeating a large body of infantry and artillery . He was often in this stormy season out in open boats for hours together , with the sea breaking over him , till it was sometimes necessary to hoist him on board , too stiff with ice and sleet to bend a joint . But it was at this time that the great Merrimac fight came off , a part of which he was-a part of the Saturday 's black despondency that saw the Cumberland go down and the white flag flutter from the peak of the Congress , of the Sunday 's superb confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her iron shields , bore down on her grounded antagonist , and never seeming to see an idle mote in the distance till a 200-pounder came from it , crashing through her consort , which turned and fled , a wreck , while shot after shot beat and brayed her own sides till the skies rang with the echoes , and the fate of the old navies , with their anowy billows of canvas , was settled by the victory of the little black iron turret . Of course the young sailor had , as time ' went on , the usual number of the escapades that seem to be the peculiar properties of his class , one , not the least , of which happened after the fight at Malvern Hill , when , **25;262;TOOLONG , andfired , by the account of his valiant brother , with the desire of sharing in an affair that might be similar to the seven days ' battle , he boldly made off in search of adventure , and rode to review the army on President Lincoln 's staff finding himself under arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck of the middy , released from duress . He was destined , however , soon to leave that fortunate and irresponsible condition , and in July , 1862 , was promoted to a lieutenancy , the intermediate grades being overlooked , and was ordered to the sounds of North Carolina ; and , having turned to account the year 's stern schooling , there the career that has rendered his name remarkable really began . And it may be mentioned here that it was not only in the art of the sea-fight that he had accomplished himself : , but in the more difficult art of attaching men to him in such wise that they would hazard life and fortune to follow him , a thing absolutely indispensable to his undertakings . Of this attachment of his companions and subordinates an instance may be cited to the purpose , though so trifling . This occurred once when the lieutenant went to Washington with dispatches , and when , chancing to look over the hotel register , he found the names just above his own were those of the officers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair of the Albemarle , and whom he had supposed to be gone to their long home . He had worn on the coat which he had thrown off that night upon taking to the water a ribbon with a gold chain and locket of some value ; and on springing into the room where were the officers , in the sorry guise of their prison habihiments , after the first greetings were over he saw one take from under the collar of his blouse some of the buttons of that coat , one the locket , one the chain , and another the ribbon , the men having carried these articles , unsuspected and untouched , through all the want and privations of four months in rebel prisons . It having been decided not long subsequently to Lieutenant Cushing 's promotion to make a combined movement of army and navy against the town of Franklin-afterward destroyed by the army-an agreement was entered into for the *rmy to open the attack , and the navy to send three vessels up the Blackwater in order to intercept the retreat of the seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was changed , but the messenger dispatched by the commanding officer with the account of the change did not reach his destination in season ; and presuming that all was to be as arranged , three vessels moved up the Blackwater at the appointed hour , and were presently engaged , with a couple of hundred men and a few cannon , by all the strength of the enemy , in a stream exceedingly narrow , and so crooked that lines had constantly to be taken from the ships and wound about the trees on the shore , to obtain purchase and haul the bows round the bend . At last , on working past a sharp angle of the shore , they came upon an impassable barricade , an abatis formed of the great trees felled from both banks directly across the stream , at a point where the force of the angry current drifted them strongly in toward the left side ; and at the moment every object on the bank became alive , and blazed with a deadly fire , and such a yell burst forth from every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain Flusser instantly ordered all hands into shelter , since it would have been the merest bravado to attempt // fighting his few men on an open deck ; but Lieutenant Cushing , chancing to glance over the side , saw a mass of infantry rushing down under cover of this fire to hoard the vessel that lay in such a cruel ambuscade , and calling for volunteers , he dashed out , cast loose the howitzer , and by the aid of half a dozen men and an officer , wheeled it to the other side of the deck . Before the piece could be leveled the seven men lay dead and dying around him , and , alone on the deck , he sent the death-dealing canister flying into the assailants with a will . It had the effect of magic , making such havoc that the enemy fled in terrorall save the leader , a man of noble appearance , who , unaware of the faltering of his troops , advanced , bran dishing his sword , his long hair streaming behind him , a shining mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were called to the scene , the guns were worked with grape and canister , and the marines , protected by the hammocks , watched the tree-tops for a puff of smoke , and picked off the sharp-shooters , who fell every moment throu5 , h the hreaking hranches with wild cries . After that nothing was left but retreat , and there followed half a day of furious assault and repulse , of fighting for every point , in order to send the lines ashore there , and so to round the curves of the river ; of struggling on the enemy 's part to keep the ships in the toils , of barricades at every bend , of rifle-pits on every bluff . Of course the ship that had been in the rear of the advance now led the retreat , and received the concealed fire of a thousand infantry at every exposed spot , while the Commodore Perry , bringing up the rear at some distance hehind , was in almost every instance unexpected by the rebels , and coming on their flank , threw into them such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly see the bloody havoc that they wrought . At length , completely exhausted , the three hrave vessels were in open water once more , decks wet with hlood and heaped with dead and wounded , and sides fairly riddled with hullets . It was probably owing to the report of this affair , in which Lieutenant Cushing was highly complimented , that he was ordered to his first command , the gun-boat Ellis , a craft of a hundred tons , mounting two guns , and drawing so little water that , in Western parlance , she could float on a heavy dew ; and in her the young officer , aged nineteen , resolved upon noble achievements . After capturing the town of Swanshorough , taking and being obliged to hum the Adelaide , with a cargo worth a hundred thousand dollars , and destroying many important salt-works , Lieutenant Cushing made a dash for the county seat of Onslow Court House , about twenty miles from the mouth of New River , where the wide and deep waters afforded an excellent harbor for Nassau vessels . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior officer , and his demand for an investigation , which was denied him , hecanse , as Mr. Fox said , " We do n't care for the loss of a vessel when fought so gallantly as that . " " U. 5. 5 . HETZUL , ' November 26 , 1862 . " Soa ,  --  I have the honor to report that I entered New River Inlet on the 23d of this month , with the United States steamer Ellis undermy command , succeeded in passing the narrow and shallow place called the Rocks , and started up the river . My object was to sweep the river , capture any vessels there , capture the town of Jacksonville , or Onslow Court House , take the Wilmington mail , and destroy any salt-works that I might find on the banks . I expected to surprise the enemy in going up , and then to fight my way out . Five miles from the month I came in sight of a vessel hound outward , with a load of cotton and turpentine . The enemy fired her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made sure that they could not extinguish the flames , and again steamed up the river . At 1 P.m . I reached the town of Jacksonville , landed , threw out my pickets , and placed guards over the public buildings . This place is the county seat of Onslow County , and quite an important town . It is situated on the right hank of the river going up , and is thirty-five or forty miles from the mouth . I captured twenty-five stand of public arms in the courthouse and post-office , quite a large mail , and two schooners . I also confiscated the negroes of the Confederate postmaster . I forgot to mention that the town is situated upon the main turnpike-road from Wilmington . Several rebel officers escaped as I neared the town , and carried the news to that city . " At 2.3* r.m . I started down the river , and at * r.m. came in sight of a camp on the bank , which I thoroughly shelled . At the point where the schooner captured in the morning was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bet were soon silenced by our guns . I had two pilots on board , both of whom informed me that it would be impossible to take the steamer from the river that night . High water and daylight were two things absolutely essential in order to take her out . I therefore came to anchor about five miles from the outer bar , took my prizes alongside , and made every preparation to repel an attack . All night long the signal-fires of the enemy could be seen upon the banks . At daylight I got under way , and had nearly reached the worst place in the channel , when the enemy opened on us with two pieces of artillery . I placed the vessel in position , at once hoisted the battle-flag at the fore , the crew gave it three cheers , and we went into action . In one hour we had driven the enemy from his guns and from the bluff , and passed within a hundred yards of their position without receiving fire . Up to this time I had been in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident that changed the fortunes of the day , and resulted in the destruction of my vessel . About five hundred yards from the bluffs , the pilots , mistaking the channel , ran the Ellis hard and fast aground . All hands went to work at once to lighten her , and anchors and steam were used to get her afloat , but without success . The headway of the steamer had forced her over a shoal , and into a position where , as the centre of a circle , we had a circumference of shoal all around . When the tide fell I sent a party ashore to take possession of thc artillery abandoned in the morning , but when they reached the field it was discovered that it had been removed while we were at work upon the vessel . If I had secured this , I proposed to construct a shore battery to assist in the defense of my vessel by keeping the rebels from placing their battery in position . At dark I took one of my prize schooners alongside , and proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some ammunition , two tons of coal , and a few small-arms . Steam and anchor again failed to get my vessel afloat . I felt confident that the Confederates // would come on me in overwhelming force , bles , and even supper , were left at the mercy and it now became my duty to save my men . So all of the conquerors , who , enjoying the supper , hands were called to muster , and the crew told that they could go aboard the schooner . I called for six and possessing themselves of every thing volunteers to remain with me on board and fight the portable , soon destroyed the earth-work and remaining gun . Knowing that it was almost certain returned to the little prize schooner in which death , * the men came forward , and two master'smates , they had Valentine and Barton , were among the number . These disguised their approach , an gentlemen subsequently behaved with coolness and which was already rolling in the heavy bravery . I ordered the schooner to drop down the swell of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bluffs , and there to wait angle made with the coast by Cape Fear and for the termination of the impending engagement , Frying-pan Shoals , which jut out into the and if we were destroyed , to proceed to sea . Early in qwq a 12-pound liowitzer , with a crew of one hundred **26;289;TOOLONG command in Hampton Roads , with a good prospect of engagement , to that of the fast blockader Violet and a prospect of many rich prizes . And fighting being what he wanted , he had , one might suppose , a plenty of it , being engaged continuously for three weeks , and never once defeated : taking earth-works and bringing off the guns ; pulling in his gig from ship to ship under the muzzles of the enemy 's guns in full blast ; taking , with ninety sailors and a howitzer , the town of Chuckatuck four hours after it had been occupied by Longstreet 's left wing ; making important reconnaissances , constantly exposed to danger-bullets grazing his skin , and one shearing a lock of hair from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any injury . At the close of this duty he received a letter of congratulation and thanks from the Secretary of the Navy , and being ordered into dock for repairs , he was sent for by the President , who complimented him with enthusiasm in an hour 's interview . After being put in condition again Lieutenant Cushing 's ship proceeded on an expedition up the York River , in which Brigadier-General Lee , the son of General Robert E. Lee , was made prisoner ; and before long he was ordered to the defense of the capital , which the advance of the rebels had endangered . It was while he was stationed at Washington that the battle of Gettysburg took place , where his brother fell fighting in command of a battery of the Fourth United States Artillery , and Lieutenant Cnshing at once proceeded to the field with the double purpose of procuring his brother 's remains and of working his guns , if permitted to do so ; but the army had already moved on , leaving its terrible d&amp;*bris of horses and cannon and caissons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bnrning sky . " As I write this , " says Lieutenant Cushing , some years later - " as I write this , rocked on the long swell of the Pacific , under the warmth of an equatorial sun , my mind goes back in review of the many sad scenes in those bloody years of rebellion , but fails to bring up any picture that is so grand , or solemn , or mournful as that great theatre of death . " In the following August-that of 1863-the lieutenant went on board the Shoboken , which was a ferry-boat with the hull built out fitted for work in all manner of shallow creeks , but eminently unseaworthy . In her he destroyed the blockade-runner Bebe , after a contest with a rebel battery ; and being refused permission to do as much for another vessel in New Topsail Inlet , soon undertook the task without permission . Anchoring the Shobokea near the land late in the afternoon , he led the enemy to suppose that an expedi tion in boats was intended six miles up the river to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun was detached from the rebel battery of six at the mouth of the inlet , carried up to the wharf , and pointed so as to command the deck of the prize , in case the remaining guns had not already annihilated the party attempting entrance ; and a watch having been set , things seemed as safe as strength and vigilance could make them . But the rebels had a foe to deal with of whose strategic powers they made no calculation , and it did not enter their heads to observe that the Shobolcen was anchored four miles up the beach , and to draw any inference from such anchorage . So , with the night , taking ashore two boats ' crews in a single boat , the lieutenant had them shoulder the dingy and carry it across the narrow neck of land , and launch it on the other side , four miles inside the inlet , and entirely out of range of the battery at the mouth . A night surprise is apt to be a successful thing , for it has to aid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which increases the attacking force to infinity , and bewilders the judgment of the assailed with darkness ; but even with knowledge of this the rebels might have been amazed if they had ever learned that they were surprised , charged , and routed in the night by six sailors , their artillery and ten prisoners captured , the vessel burned , and some valuable salt-works destroyed , two sailors acting as pickets , two guarding the prisoners , and two , assisted by the everready plantation hands , burning the vessel and buildings . Of course the teu prisoners would have been entirely too much for the six men if they had only known there were but six , but three of them being stowed in the dingy , while a breat amount of ordering and answering passed between supposititious boats on the stream , the remainder were directed to go some furlongs up the bank and report to an officer there , and not to go too far out unless they wished to be shot by the pickets of their captors ; and that being done , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regained the Shoboken in safety . But not to rest . It was only from one thing to another with this daring spirit . Finding the next day , on regaining the squadron , that it was engaged with a battery on the shore , he threw himself with twenty men into bdats , assaulted the battery , and took two rifled guns , which he got aboard his ship ; and immediately afterward , no other enemy being at hand , entered into a tussle with a northeast gale , which so nearly had the better of him that when he came in sight of the fleet again he learned that all bad supposed him at the bottom of the sea ; but he had , in truth , a curious way of always coming to the surface again , // and of frequently being taken for his own take the spy Dolon and destroy Rhesus in ghost , as was evident , indeed , on the night his tent , and bring off the succeeding the destruction of the Albemarle . " steeds Immediately after this gale he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose Skobokem and ordered to the Jllionti- ThefierY pace exceeds from the winds in swiftness . " cello , the command being given him , said qwq to breakfast with his commander-if not exactly what he had promised , at least the next best thing . There being occasion on the following day to send in a flag of truce , a note was dispatched by it , of which a copy is given below : " My DEAR GENERAL ,  --  I deeply regret that you were not at home when I called . I inclose my card . " Very respectfully , W. B. CusinRe . " Of course , after the first burst of indignation , the matter was taken very good-naturedly by the offended party , but this note was declared to be the very climax of impudence , and Lieutenant Cushing was given very distinctly to understand that his experiment could not be repeated  --  a gage which he had no opportunity to take up until the following June . Having been undergoing repairs at Norfolk , in June Lieutenant Cushing returned to Beaufort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron-clad , the Raleigh , had been defying the fleet after wanton fashion , and , conscious of her strength , had not only convoyed blockade-runners through the intimidated squadron , but had remained out of harbor for several hours , only returning at her leisure after daybreak . Of course the younger officers of the navy were burning with resentment , and Lieutenant Cushing , in the Monticello , accompanied by the Vieksburg , immediately started in pursuit , though unsuccessfully , as she had taken harbor ; and it was not until a letter came from Admiral Lee himself that Lieutenant Cushing was allowed the men and boats that he desired to go upon an expedition inside the bar , and to avenge the insult the navy had received by boarding and taking possession of the Raleigh where she lay . After dark , then , one night late in June , with fifteen men and two officers-Mr . Howorth ahd Mr. Martin-he slipped into the harbor , passing Forts Caswell and Holmes and the other batteries , and pulled up the river with muffled oars , just escaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Smithvillethe scene of his capture of the chief engineer - in safety . His object was to determine the whereabouts of the Ral gh , and then to return and bring back a hundred men to board her . The Raleigh , however , was not to be seen any where either inside the bar or at quarantine , and he accordingly pursued his course up stream , although a strong current made it best for him to hazard pulling on the side where the moon lay . Just as the boat reached Fort Anderson , there came a sentry 's hail , followed by the shouting of a dozen other voices and a quick volley of musketry . Immediately the lieutenant put the boat about and pointed her head down stream , and giving the helm a turn so as to present the least possible surface to the moon*s rays , he cut across into the shadow of the other bank , where he once more made his way up the river , leaving the enemy to pursue an imaginary foe in the opposite direction . When within four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew went ashore , and drawing the boat by means of their united strength into a patch of swamp , they masked her with branches of trees , and disposed of themselves in the growth along the bank . Here during the long summer 's day they saw several steamers going unsuspiciously up and down the river , with the rebel commodore 's flag-ship and many smaller craft , bat there was no sign of the ironclad to be seen . At twilight , however , fancying that an approaching party of fishermen in a couple of boats was a discovery and an attack , Lieutenant Cushing stepped from his hiding-place , hailed them , and boldly ordered them to surrender , which the gentle creatures did upon the spot . From these prisoners he ascertained that there was very good reason for his not finding the Raleigh at her anchorage , nature having taken the matter quite out of the lieutenant 's hands for having run upon a sand-bar some time previously , the iron-clad , with the falling of the tide , had broken in two by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being satisfied that this was really the case , Lieutenant Cushing resolved , before returning , to obtain all the information possible concerning the batteries and obstructions of the place , knowing that a movement upon it was already in contemplation . Having mastered all the facts of the forts and channels , he at last stationed himself with eight men at a junction of the main turnpike with two other roads , hardly two miles from the city and all its swarms of soldiery and lines of fortifications . The first thing done was to capture the army mail-carrier , with his mail of between four and five hundred letters , among which were those containing plans of the rebel defenses , and other important documents ; and the adventurers being by this time rather hungry , and having taken prisoner a wandering store-keeper , Mr. Howorth put on the coat and cap of the mail-carrier , mounted his horse , and started for the town to procure provisions , his pocket being well lined with the Confederate money taken from the mail ; and he presently returned from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round his neck , with a very short shrift-bringing in good refreshments , and having mingled freely with the enemy , for whom he had been obliged to exert his inventive faculties after a manner that would have done justice to the best romancer living . In the mean time the lieutenant and his men had not been idle , and they were now guarding twenty-six prisoners under the most excellent discipline , since // a shout from any one of them would have brought an army about their ears ; and he was now only waiting for the evening courier with the Richmond mail before rejoining the remainder of his party and putting off for sea . He decided , however , to send his prisoners to the boat , and it was just as they were crossing the road that the mail-carrier came in sight , accompanied by a Confederate officer , who , drawing a swift conclusion , turned about to flee . being mounted on the horse of one of the prisoners , the lieutenant instantly gave chase , but to no purpose , as his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting the telegraph wires in two places , he hastened to his boat , which now lay moored in a little creek , put the prisoners into the canoes which had been picked up , and dropped down toward the river , which was reached exactly as the shadows of night darkened it pleasantly . It had been the lieutenant 's intention to leave the greater part of his prisoners on the lighthouse island in the river , having captured them merely for the sake of securing their silence ; but just as he was putting in under the bank for that purpose the steamer Virginia came puffing close upon him . In a breath the order was given for every man to jump overboard and push the boats into the marsh grass , and the prisoners were promised instant death upon the first sign ; and while every head was held under the gunwale for a moment , the steamer plowed by without suspicion . Having eluded this danger , Lieutenant Cushing now removed the oars and sails from the canoes , and set twenty of his prisoners adrift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there till morning , when they would be seen and cared for from shore ; and attaching to a buoy , where it could not fail to be seen and taken off a note , in which he happily recalled to the memory of the authorities their declaration that he would not again enter their harbor , he made all haste for sea , intending to pass through the upper outlet , and having Forts Anderson and Fisher to pass , together with the island and outer batteries . It was a little below Fort Anderson that , encountering a boat-load of soldiers , he captured them without ado , and learned that a guard-boat containing seventy-five men awaited him on the bar . This was not unexpected ; and the fresh prisoners having been menaced with assurance of their due ( leserts if they attempted aid or comfort to the enemy at the critical time , it was resolved by the lieutenant and his officers to pull for the bar , the tide setting down strongly , lay themselves alongside the guard-boat in the bright moonlight , and , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them by the batteries , which , since they could not destroy them without firing on their own men , would be likely to let them pass . It was no great while before glimpses were caught of a boat rocking on the tide below them , and they eagerly made for it , quite confident of their ability to occupy many times their own number of landlubbers until they should be out of range of the batteries , when it would be just as easy to leave their foe behind . But when still some yards distant from the boat , andjust preparing to open a broadside upon it , suddenly four other boats darted out from behind a neighboring point , and five from the opposite island , and formed a line across the bar , completely entrapping the lieutenant and his men , while at the same time , going short round , a large sail-boat was discovered to windward . Misfortune could hardly have seemed more imminent and absolute , and if any thing could be done it must be done on the instant . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round an island , making two channels , one that up which they had passed on the preceding night from Fort Caswell , now lying seven miles below , and which it would have been madness to try , since it would have brought them opposite Smithyule and the forts by broad daylight , even if the southwest gale had not been blowing there , and making breakers in which the boat would have been crushed like a bubble . Of course , then , their only hope was to circumvent the enemy , so that the other and shorter channel might be gained , at whose entrance no such dangerous sea was to be encountered . Quickly giving the word to his men , the lieutenant darted off with his boat as if for Smithville , passing the large sail-boat ; then suddenly sheering , so as to escape the full moonlight ( as in going by Fort Anderson the night before ) , he was for one moment invisible in the swell , and the whole ten boats were after him on the way to Smithville-boats manned by soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaware of the impossibility of exit by that channel . Seizing the opportunity , the lieutenant boldly turned about , and when he came in sight again was making for the sailboat as if he intended to board her . Of course the crew of the sail-boat , unused to such contests , hesitated , and started to tack , but missed stays , and drifted away on the tide before they could recover themselves , while the crew of the lieutenant 's boat , bending all their strength to the oars , darted round in a broad curve astern the line of boats , and were in the desired channel , a hundred yards in advance of all the rest , before their object was fairly understood ; and heading for the breakers on Carolina Shoals , lest on another course the batteries should blow them to atoms-breakers which the boats rowed by soldiers could not dare dream of attempting-they took the great waves safely , and were presently past all pursuit . The results of this expedition // were so important , and the conduct of it so remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again receiving the formal thanks of the Navy Department . Indeed , these official congratulations became apparently quite a matter of course ; and in the following October he was earning them again , together not only with the engrossed thanks of the Congress of the United States , and addresses from chambers of commerce , boards of trade , municipalities , and clubs without number , but with the more substantial reward of a promotion to the grade of lieutenant-commander , at the ageof twenty-one , all in recognition of his destruction of the rebel ram Albemarle , an iron-clad of the same model as the Merrimac , which had done great damage , and met the fire of hundred-pounder Dahigrens and Parrotts at ten yards range without injury . Directly upon his promotion the young hero took command of the flag-ship Mialvern , bearing the broad pennant of the rear-admiral , and in December was part of the force operating against Fort Fisher . Here Commander Cushing performed what , with the exception of the Albemarle affair , was in reality the most dangerous exploit in all his term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being nothing less than the buoying of a channel in an open skiff-a skiff rivaling the famous little boat of the battle of Lake Erie - in the midst of a shower of round shot , shell , and shrapnel , the work continuing for six hours , the skiff frequently half filled with water by the plunging shot , audits companion being sunk . During the brief cessation of more active operations against , the Wilmington forts , Commander Cushing offered battle to the Chickarnauga , a rebel privateer carrying an extra crew ; but the challenge being declined , he drove a large blockade-runner ashore under her nose , and returned to the fleet , which on the 12th of January resumed the attack upon the forts , the ships being sixty in number , comprising iron-clads , frigates , sloops of war , and gun-boats . An assault being ordered after a three days ' bombardment , Commander Cushing , with other officers , accompanied the force of sailors and marines about to storm the sea front of Fort Fisher . Marching to within a few hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down under the slope of the beach , waiting for the signal of attack , the whole fire of the navy passing with a deafening noise just over their heads . Springing to their feet at the word of command , they moved forward steadily over the soft white sand , which the sunshine made dazzling , and the relief of which rendered every officer in his uniform of blue and gold-lace-and , indeed , every man  --  a conspicuous target , the rebels meanwhile pouring forth an unceasing fire that cut down their foes in windrows . Finding himself alone at last , just after reaching the palisades , Commander Cushing turned to rally his men , and was obliged to cross a hundred yards of the bare sand with the bullets pattering about him in such wise that it seems as if he must have b9rne a charmed life Most of the ranking officers were either dead or badly wounded by that time , or else remaining under shelter of the palisades till night-fall-more fortunate than their comrades , who , dropping on the beach , were swept out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command himsulf , and gathering some hundreds of men with great effort , he was again proceeding to the assault , when requested to relleve with them a regiment which went to the assistance of the army on the other side , which was operating to such effect under the gallant General Ames that before midnight the works had surrendered . The first important action of Commander Cushing after the surrender was the seizure of the pilots who had so many times safely steered the blockade-runners into port ; and when his preparations to hang them had thoroughly frightened them into obedience , he agreed to spare their lives on condition of their erecting the customary signal-lights on Oak Island by which the blockade-running steamers came in and out . Accordingly , some four or five days after the capture of the forts , the large blockade-running steamer Charlotte , trusting to the lights , came over the bar and made her private signals to Fort Caswell , and being hailed and told that the signal corps had been withdrawn to Smithville , came confidently up to her anchorage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she carried among her other passengers two officers of the British army coming over to see the Confederate sport , and the owners of her costly cargo of arms and munitions-all of whom , in great glee at the successful termination of their hazardous enterprise , had just sat down to a sumptuous banquet , and were toasting their safe arrival in Champagne . Suddenly the door opened , a light form stepped in , a hand was laid upon the captain 's chair , and every one looked up in amazement to meet the gaze of those dauntless eagle eyes of Commander Cushing , which no one who has once seen him is likely to forget . " Gentlemen , " said he , " you are my prisoners . Allow me the pleasure of joining in your toast . Steward , another bottle of Champagne ! " Of course there was nothing but submission , for his men were already disposed about the deck , and the Charlotte was his prize . There was a moment or two of sullen silence on the part of the discomfited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vis*t-vis , and exclaimed , in noble rage , " I saybeastly luck ! " To which his comrade pres // ently replied , in a voice proceeding from the depths of his disgust , " Unmitigated sell ! " After which disembarrassment a better feeling prevailed , and the banquet was proceeding as gayly as the circumstances allowed , when Commander Cushing was summoned on deck with the announcement that another steamer , the Stag , was coming up the river , upon which he bade adieu to the festive scene , and proceeded to make prize of the second steamer . It would be easy to go on enumerating the days of this young officer by his valiant deeds ; to tell of the capture of small towns , of great store-houses of cotton , corn , and bacon ; of his examining the obstructions before Fort Anderson , and going so close in that one night , exasperated by the speechmaking and carousal there , he sent a bullet whistling through the astonished merrymakers , and in consequence very nearly robbed the navy of one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water about him ; of his constructing a mock-monitor out of an old hat - boat and some painted canvas7 and sending her past the fort on the night tide , so that the commandant , knowing the army to be in his rear , and seeing the gun-boats gaining the stream above , abandoned his fortifications without spiking the guns . But an account has not yet been given of the greatest of his achievements , and it is perhaps enough to close with the story of his destruction of the Albernarle  --  a more daring and spirited act than we can call to mind out of the records of any navy . The Albemarle , as it has been mentioned , was an iron-clad of tremendous strength , which had already defeated the whole Federal fleet , sunk the Southfteld , exploded the boiler of the &amp;r8saczt8 , engaged nine foes at once without danger to herself , forced the surrender of a brigade , and the abandonment of the whole region of the Roanoke by the Federal forces . The government having no iron-clads capable of crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that section were rendered practically usekss by the Albernarle ' 8 presence there , and the expense of the squadron necessary to keep watch upon her movements was something enormous . In this emergency Lieutenant Coshing submitted two plans to Admiral Lee for the ram 's destruction . The admiral approved of one of them , and sent its projector to Washington to lay it before the Seeretaryof the Navy , and the latter , though at first a llttle doubtful of its merit , finally authorized him to procure the means to carry it into execution ; and he immediately purchased in New York two open launches , each about thirty feet long , fitted with a small engine and propelled by a screw , carrying a howitzer , and provided with a loughoom that swung by a hinge , which could be raised or VOL XLIX-No. 290. - iS lowered at will , and which had a torpedo in the groove at its further extremity . These boats were taken down through the canals to the Chesapeake , one of them being lost on the way , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infinitude of toils , hinderances , and roses . Joining the fleet , which lay at the month of the river , the lieutenant disclosed his object to his men , assuring them that they not only must not expect , but they must not hope , to return , for death was almost inevitable , and then called for volunteers . They all stood by him , and six others presently joined them , Assistant-Paymaster Frank Swan and Mr. Howorth , who had often accompanied him on his most reckless adventures , being of the number . The Albernarle lay moored at the Plymouth wharf , eight miles up the river , both banks of which were lined with batteries , and held by several thousand soldiers , while , at some distance up , that portion of the wreck of the Soutkfteld which still lay above water was occupied by a picket-guard , whose duty it was to throw up rockets on the first alarm , for , unknown to the attacking party , rumor of the intended endeavor had in some mysterious way already reached the Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception . However , on the night of the 27th of October , the little launch entered the Roanoke River , her en glue at low pressure , to make the least noise possible , left behind all obstructions , passed within thirty feet of the unsuspicious picket on the Southfteld , and approached the wharf where the ram lay , a vast black mass in the darkness . Greatly emboldened by this success , the lieutenant for a moment resolved to change his plan , and , knowing the town perfectly , to put in shore and trust to the effect of a night surprise , with which he was so well acquainted , overpower those on board , get her into the stream before the forts could be aroused , and fight the batteries with her on her way down . But just as lie was about to carry his sudden plan into execution , a cry from the ram rang out sharply on the night , repeated on every side , followed by the instantaneous booming of the great guns from ship and shore ; and returning no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . At the same moment an immense bonfire of pine-knots and turpentine blazed up on the bank , most fortunately for him , since it revealed directly the untoward fact that a boom of logs extended around the rani in all directions to guard her from torpedoes , which for one second seemed an insurmountable obstacle . Only for one second , though . With the next the lieutenant had given orders to sheer off across the stream , so as to get room for acquiring headway and carrying his launch by the force of its own impetus straight across the boom , though it never could get out again , // he knew . As they turned , a volley of buckshot tore away the whole back of his coat and the sole of his shoe , and the manbyhis side fell lifeless . Before the volley could be repeated the launch had struck the boom , was over , and was forging up under the Albemarle 's quarter , directly beneath the mouth of a rifle-gun , and so close that the morest whisper on board the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear , could be distinctly heard . That must have been a terrifically exciting moment to those on that little launch , with the vast mountain of iron towering above them , the fire-lit mass of foes upon the shore , and triumph and eternity in the next moment . Lieutenant Cushing stood at the bows of thc launch , with several lines before him : one of these lines was attached to the howitzer , one to the ankle of the engineer , one to the officer who was to lower the boom carrying the torpedo , one was that by means of which the torpedo was to be slid under the ram , another was the exploding-line , which should pull away a pin and let a grape-shot drop on the percussioncap beneath . The howitzer had already been discharged . The line attached to the engineer was pulled : the engine stopped . The boom was lowered , the torpedo slid slowly off and nuder , the air-chamber at top bringing it up in position beneath the ram . The last line was pulled , the grape-shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebel ram and the launch blew up together , and columns of water shot up and fell again , heavy with dead and dying . But just as Lieutenant Cushiug pulled the exploding line he had cried out to his men to save themselves , and throwing off arms aud heavygarments , had struck out into the water . The surface was being ripped up with shot , boats were already ont picking up the wounded , and dying men were going down wfth gurgling groans around him ; but he boldly made for the other bank , and was just reaching it , when he heard the voice of one of his own men in a sinking state , and turned to relieve , if possible , one who had shared such peril with him . Finding the man , he supported him with one arm and kept him afloat for several minutes , when all at once he went down , leaving the lieutenant alone on the water , swimming with faint strokes , with what seemed interminable distances before him , but so firmly resolved to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscular motion still continued mechanically , and carried him at last to shore , where he fell , with his feet still in the water , and lay , not mire than half conscious , till morning , when the bright , invigorating sunshine showed him that he had gained a piece of swamp not far from one of the forts , and from whence he could see the angry and excited town , with a curious sense of power in the midst of all his weakness . The sentinel , meanwhile , was walking his round on the parapet , and in order to make any shelter it was necessary to rise and run for it the moment his back was turned . Doing so , he was obliged , at the instant the sentinel turned about again , to drop where he was , between two paths of the tall grass , which *partially sheltered him , since , being covered with mud from head to foot , he was hardly distinguishable from the soil , as he presently found when a party of men came down one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tread on his arm without discovering him . Knowing it would be impossible to remain there safely for any length of time , he lay on his back , planted his elbow and his heel firmly in the ground , and thus hitched himself slowly along till he gained the cypress swamp , a mass of bog and brier , through which , barefooted , bareheaded , and bare-banded , he had to force a path till the blood flowed from his innumerable wounds and bruises . Entering at last a clearing , a fresh danger appeared , in the shape of a group of soldiers , behind whom he had to pass at a distance of twenty yards , creeping through a corn furrow . He was now in the outskirts of a wood , and encountering an old negro , he gave him a piece of money which had chanced to remain about him , and sent him back to town to bring him news of what had happened there overnight ; for he wished to be sure that he had done the work there thoroughly before making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and famished , exhausted , and with every nerve strung to its utmost tension , it seemed to him that if lie had failed he did not care to get back at all . Vibrating , in his suspense , between a fear that the man might betray him and a confidemmee that he would not , he rested there till the messenger came back , bringing him news of the complete destruction of the rebel ram , and he plunged gayly into another swamp , so dense that he could only direct himself by the sun , emerging from its tall reeds and l , rambles , a couple of hours past noon , upon one of the deep and narrow creeks that wind in and out through all those regions , exactly opposite a fresh detachment of sohthiers on the other bank , and who , as fate willed it , had a little skiff made of four or five rough hoards , with the seams pitched with tar , " toggled to the root of an old cypresstree that squirmed like a snake into the inky water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dense greenery and shade till the men went back to their rude meal , he gently slipped between the reeds and slid into the water , swimming softly till he reached the skiff loosened it , pushed it before him round the first curve , when he chambered in and paddled away for dear life : paddled all day , into sunset , into twi // light , into starlight-such starli*ht as sifted down through the great shadows of the swamp and the cypress-lined and moss-hung banks of the creek . At last he was in the Roanoke , at last in the open water of the sound , where a swell would have swamped the frail skiff , but where the night was singularly still and soft-though , as it was , he was obliged to paddle all upon one side to keep his boat on the course which he laid for himself by the stars . When he came , after a weary while , in sight of the picket vessel of the fleet , and , after what seemed a longer and still wearier while , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dropped , gasping , benumbed , and half dead , into the bottom of the boat . But immediately on his hail the vessel had slipped her cable , and had got out her boats to take measures against infernal machines , firmly convinced that the skiff was a piece of retaliation on the part of the rebels , and , in response to his assertion that he was Lieutenant Cushing , loudly assuring him that Lieutenant Cushing was no longer iu existence ; and it was still some time before he found himself on board , refreshed , clothed , and in his right mind , and on the way to the flag-ship , where , in honor of his return , rockets were thrown up and all hands called to cheer ship , even before the success of his expedition was announced . And for once valor had its due acknowledgment and reward .
