txt The law recently enacted amending the Revised Statutes , with the purpose of mhking the legal rate of interest 6 per cent. , and attaching to a violation of the amended act the penalties imposed by the act prior to the amendment of the first section , is likely to give rise to controversies in the courts . The preceding lines doubtless convey the intention of the Legislature , but it is by no means clear that their attempt to express that ' intention in words has been successful . The state of the case seems to be this : Section 1 is ' amended by substituting the word six for seven where the latter occurs in the original act , and adds the proviso , " But nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to in any way affect any contract or obligation made before the passage of this act . " This proviso , however , is mere surplusage , for no one will pretend that the Legislature could impair any obligation in an existing contract . The second section of the new law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provisions of this act , " and the third section provides that " this act shall take effect on the 1st day of January , 1880 . " Thus far it seems that the act is successful in fixing the legal rate of interest in this State , after the 1st of January , at 6 per cent. , and that in the absence of any agreement between parties , that rate must be held to be the lawful rate of interest But here the question arises , may parties agree to pay and receive a rate exceeding 6 per cent. , without subjecting themselves to the penalties now existing restricting the rate of interest to 7 per cent. / There are grave doubts whether the penalties imposed by the original act for charging interest in excess of 7 per cent . will be applicable as against the receipt of more than 6 per cent . after the 1st of January . Section 2 of the original act providesthat no person shall take or receive a higher rate of interest " than is above prescribed . " . Seven per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections the phrases , " than above prescribed , " " than is above allowed , " " than is prescribed in the said title , " occur , and these may all be read as if the words " than 7 per cent . " had been used . Now , section 17 , Article of the amended State Constitution provides that " no act shall be passed which shall provide that any existing law , or any part thereof , shall be made or deemed a part of said act , or which shall enact that any existing law , or any part thereof , shall be applicable , except by inserting it in such act . " The Legislature did not attempt to make the final sections against receiving more than 7 per cent , apply to the receiving of more than 6 per cent. , and had no constitutional power to do so , except by a reenactment of such sections . Penal statutes are to be strictly construed , and it remains to be seen whether penalties enacted against an excess of interest above 7 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to an excess of interest over 6 per cent. , and whether the sections of the old law coming under the repealing section ( 2 ) of the new law  --  being inconsistent therewith , as relating to a different rate of interest  --  can be revived , except by the mode prescribed by ' the Constitution , " by inserting it in such act . " So , it may come to pass that on and after Jan. 1 the inquiry may be made , Have we a Usury law
