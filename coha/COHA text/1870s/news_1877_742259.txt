txt The Democratic campaign in this State is run in a Peculiar way this Spring . A State Committee exists , but it has nothing to say about what shall be or has been ( lone , and its Chairman and members are under the impression that not very much has been done to obtain success . The candidates for Congress have made the campaign their own private affair , and have probably contributed to the fund of the State Committee with sufficient liberality to obtain freedom from impertinent questions . Here , in the First District , the only Democratic candidate who has any confidence in himself is Hon. Frank Jones , awl he is confident that he will be elected by a large majority . He is a happy sort of man in temperament , but in ability is not to be compared , as a candidate for Congress , with Gen. Marston , the Republican nominee , who stands at , the head of the legal profession in the district . Jones began life as a neddier ; afterward got possession of a brewery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth has brought around him a largo number of followers , who know on which side their bread is buttered . He was not heard of as a Congressman by his constituents until he voted for the Electoral Commission . His vote did not please the " Bourbons " of this district , anti Mr. Jones found . that out a week ago , when he came home from Washington to look after his interests . As he can not speak for himself , he immediately cast about for somebody who could speak for him . The . Democrats were almost rabid with rage at Hayes ' inauguration , as their temper would have countenanced a war rather than anything but Tilden . The complaint against Jones reached his ear only last week , and it made him desperate in his resolution to win . Since Monday of last week the Democrats , therefore , have been making use of every moment to beat Marston , and they will keep up their efforts until Tuesday night without cessation . Jones , in his anxiety to obtain a distinguished apologist , sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hero post-haste . Since his arrival be has been speaking in the Republican counties of the district , and has endeavored to subdue in some measure the reeenttnent which Jones ' constituents felt against him for the part he had taken in obtaining the election of Hayes . Ho does not find it an easy thing to do . Last night , at Dover . when Mr. Randall in the coarse of his speech put the question , " Should we have taken Hayes or war ? " voices replied throughout the house , " War . " ' hat was very awkward , for Randall thought it was best to take Hayes , and he was obliged to digress from his somewhat fulsome praise of the Democratic candidate in order to subdue the Democratic tiger . If Mr. Jones is elected , he can only be so by the disaffection or purchase of nearly a thousand voters who last Fall cast their ballots for Hayes . It is given out , and by Democrats , too , that he has openly declared that his election should cost him 550,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , 850,000 is a good deal of money to spend over four counties , He might easily , perhaps , buy 100 votes in Portsmouth , but not even Democrats who are most confident can say where he will get the other 700 or 800 . The Republicans have no money to spend . They are relying upon district canvassers to keep up the voters , mud have had very few meetings . They are confident to-day that Gen. Marston will puil through with a good majority . He has been et work in Rockingham and Strafford Counties , and has made some excellent speeches to large assemblages , and will tomorrow go into Heilman and Carroll . Jones is not at all helped by the candidate of the Democrats for Governor , and has pretty frankly admitted that Marcy will be defeated . But little reference is matte to " old Dan " in the meetings , and it is a foregone conclusion that ho will not go to Concord in an official capacity this ye ar , While no one can yet say where Mr , Jones has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody in Portsmouth finds he is using it . Every night last week special trains left this city for other places in the country , and these trains wore as free as air or water to anybody who chose to use them . All ' the idle and vagabond fellows about this just now rather idle city took the opportunity to have a free ride - and a good time , though , perhaps , not half of those who swelled the meetings in this way were voters . Then there are about 400 men in the employment of Mr. Jones and another Democratic brewer , and when their day 's work is done in the breweries they are each presented with a Tilden uniform , and " invited " to go to Dover , or some other place where a Democratic meeting is to be held . Mr. Jones is a business man , and ho is making this campaign a matter of business . He always makes it to the interest of his employes to do has bidding , although he does not verbally command . Here , as elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats , Tilden and Hendricks , ' rather than the choice . of superior men . The Republicans have put in nomination an educated man , a gentleman by nature and training , and they are relying upon the good sense of the people of the district to send a man better qualified than Jones to represent them in the national councils . I have heard a good deal of boasting here in the Rockingham House ? owned by Jones  --  about the largo number of . Republican voters who will support the Democratic candidate ; but with diligent inquiries today in Portsmouth I have not yet been able to find the first Republican who will admit that he will vote for anybody but Marston . The fact is that if Tilden were here himself and was controlling the canvass it could not be made to imitate more closely than it does in boastfulness and noise the Democratic national campaign of 1S76 . The Democrats claim everything , and intend to do so until the last hour . With the full Republican vote east for ' Marston he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching very closely all of Jones ' agents , and his money will be spent very cautiously if they do not find it out . The general impression hero , among outsiders , those who are not active politicians , is that Jones is overconfident , and that if he should use money it would never reach the voters , but would stop in first hands . The Democratic candidate himself expects a majority of 1,000 , but he would be highly gratified if ho Secured 10 . It is rather funny that Hon , acorn AL Beebe ishese.aikinsrthe voters. ) to condemn the very result achieved by the Electoral Commission for which their candidates voted , while Speaker Randall is apologizing for the vote of Jones as a bitter necessity whose wounds only time will heal . Several amendments to the Constitution are to be voted on at the election next Tuesday . One of these is a proposition to dispense with jury trials in property cases where the amount involved does not exceed 8100 . Another ? of great importance to the people of New-Hampshire , who complain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they now do ? proposes that the Governor and members of the Legislature shall be elected biennially instead of yearly . A further change proposed is that to hold the State election in November instead of March . There is no discussion of the proposed amendments , and neither party pretends to oppose them .. Yet some doubt is felt about their adoption . The Democrats are calculating that the Prohibition vote in this district will be about 500 . That is probably a large enough vote to expect from them in the whole State , and the Democrats will be disappointed . Since reaching this district it has been impossible to learn anything definite about Democratic prospects in the second and third districts , as little attention is given to them here , but as no confidence is expressed in the power of the Democrats to beat either Briggs or Blair , it may be inferred that they do not much expect to elect Sulloway and Kent . Sulloway is very much such a man as Jones : good enough in his way ; self-made ; successful in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; has no education worth mentioning , and has no qualifications for Congress . Kent is called a sorehead , and is distasteful to many Democrats because they never know exactly where to look for him , he has been on both sides of the fence so often .
