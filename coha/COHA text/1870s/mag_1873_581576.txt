MARTIN LEA 'S STORY . IT seemed a mere chance by which I met Anna Marston , yet in every phase of our later life , destiny seems so to have prepared our characters , one for the other , that I remain under the impression of a fatality which still controls me and moulds my nature to hers , even though that process of life which we call death has temporarily separated us . We met in one of the Swiss valleys , where I , a landscape-painter , was pursuing a course of summer study . She was there as a mere pleasure-seeker , and tired of those pleasures which alone society permits to the young , wealthy , and beautiful , when to wealth and beauty is added strong individuality and that mental intensity which abhors commonplaces , and especially common-place deference and adoration . I was returning from a day 's painting , my painting materials on my back , when I saw her vainly endeavoring to climb to an Alpine flower which grew amongst the rocks overhanging the pathway which led from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water-colors lying on the ground , and in the meadow beyond were some of her companions gathering the flowers with which Alpine fields blaze during the brief summer . I of course climbed to the flower and brought it to her , an act which any man would have done-I even looked at her twice and saw that she was very beautiful and spirited , and evidently " a great lady , " as I heard her afterwards called ; so with the briefest disclaimer of her profuse thanks I passed on , not even turning back to get a third look . At the table d'Mte dinner I saw her again with her set , a gay , frivolous company , with that deportment and garb that made her seem like a thrush in a flock of jays-at least such was the simile which came to my outof-door bred fancy . I had always been in the habit at the hotel of dropping my professional guise and coming to the table as other gentlemen do , rather than , as my fellowpainters generally did , of keeping on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , for the most part , well-to-do people look down on an artist as at least suspicious socially , and not to be admitted to friendly intercourse except with a definite show of condescension , which , by coming down , implies an admitted superiority . An artist interests them as a phenomenon -- they trot him out and study him , are friendly and interested , but only when he has proved that he is something beside the artist  --  a good business man-do they admit him to social equality with prosperous people . I merely note the fact , without attempting to explain it . As my own notions of social equality are very radical , I was more careful to avoid than profit by such condescension . Miss Marston greeted me pleasantly at dinner , her companions seeing in me only one of those commonplace additions to their company , a gentleman in black , whom by chance she had met somewhere , and so we talked , and the ) ' opened the fold of their formal courtesies to me . We talked of the glacier and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were new and wanted a guide . So next day I abandoned palette and brushes and led the way to the loveliest view I knew of  --  a close-shut gorge with two plumy cascades plunging from the cliffs into a woody plain through which wound the river . Bare and rugged peaks rose on each side , and between the two ranges was a far-off glimpse of the blue and level Pays-de-Vaud . It was a climb of full three t&gt; *usand feet , and Miss Marston , strong a-foot and self-reliant , went alone . I had my chief occupation in aiding the weakness of two chattering vapidities , mother and daughter , and the service which I was compelled to give in ascending was called for equally in returning , so that the better part of the day was spent in these in- anities , which , however , I hardly regretted , as the day had been given to an unwishedfor service , and so I was all the while siinpl* courteous for courtesy 's sake ; attentive because I liked to do well what I did at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so without momentary consideration of my own convenience . We dined together later than usual , not at table d ' 1u5/e , and all the strangers were as affable as if I were really one of them . I was as reserved as civility allowed , and was monopolized by my charges of the day . Miss Marston was besieged by a chattering pretendant to her regards , whom she treated with a certain contemptuous fi-eedom which l ) leased me more because I had conceived a strong antipathy to him , than because I had any interest in her . In fact , Miss Marston impressed me as one of those children of fortune who are spoiled for all positions in life excepting that which their sad prosperity has moulded them in , and whose characters are made utterly effectless in the world from having none of the trials which widen their sympathies and deepen their // hold on their own natures . As an artist her beauty impressed me , and I saw that her taste was decided and large ; but what surprised me in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no allusion to my profession . As we separated in the evening , my elder 5roMge*e expressed a cheerful hope of enjoying my guidance in many more rambles , etc. , etc. , to which I made no other than an evasive reply . Of course I was up and away at work next morning long before they were awake , and when I came back to the mid-day breakfast they were all on the veranda of the inn , lounging , chatting , or making memoranda of the mountain peaks ; and when I entered on the scene , in working dress , with sketchinb apparatus enough , apparently , to load a porter , a look of blank amazement came over the faces of the whole party except that of Miss Marston , whose mischievous smile and hearty good morning , with the hope that I had had a good day 's work , completed my information of the social complexion of her friends , and of herself as well . Not one of them replied save by a cry distant how , and all did not even give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark hall I heard Mrs. say , loudly enough to show that she did n't care not to be heard " Why , I thought he was a gentleman ! " to which Mi*s Marston replied , evidently wishing the retort to go as far as the cut , " And you were never so near right in your life as when you thought Aim a gentleman ! " More I did not stop to hear , or care to . It was not the first time I had been made to feel the innocuous stings of those animalcular contempts which breed in idle and profitless souls . Her word outweighed theirs , and I was , on the whole , more than paid for the insult . We met at breakfast , and she was more than ever gracious-begged to see my sketches , and with a malice and enjoyment of the annoyance of her friends thoroughly felt , assumed the tone and manner of my maturer friend of the day before , and repeated the encomiums which had been passed on my conduct cbez aix the night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roused to an unwonted enthusiasm , and expatiated on the subjects I had found , on the beauty of the mountains , and on other things which art led to , and when breakfast was over I brought my studi* down to the veranda for her seeing . The others went to their rooms , and we looked at the sketches and talked of the art without formality and in the most iThconstrained manner . I was not much of an artist ( I have given it up now ) , and I knew it , but I had been wetl trained in a French atelier and knew how to draw , and painted carefully and exactly what I saw before me ; my taste had been cultivated by a long study of art , and I remembered the treatment of greater painters without attempting to follow their manner . In this way , without being a genius , one may do good work so long as he knows he is no genius ; but if he forgets this and tries to fly when he can only walk , he shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of my studies , for I saw how far they were from what they ought to be-I was more ready than any one to disparage them , while people who knew less of art than of the dry bones of nature praised them , enjoyed them , and sometimes really bought them . She , however , showed neither enthusiasm nor want of appreciation ; her eye was good , and she acknowledged the correctness of representation of my studies , wondered even , in passages , at their fidelity , but said little about anything more . This rather raised my opinion of her than otherwise , for I always felt a certain interest for people who grew enthusiastic about literal fidelity to nature . When we had looked over the studies she said , in place of conventional and matter-of-fact commendation , " You should paint portraits ; the fidelity you give to a mountain would be more worthily bestowed on humanity , and after all , with all the breadth and depth of nature , there is a meaning and value in any human face which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Denner s manner , than anything in the inanimate world . " " In winter , " I replied , " I paint who will come to me to be painted , but in general I find that people admire as little fidelity of representation of their own faces as they enjoy it much in accessory and commonplace things . I see with more than average cleerness and draw with a tolerable accuracy and great readiness either portrait or landscape , but very few people care to be painted in that way since Holbein , or if they do , the photograph satisfies the sentiment . " " No , " she rejoined , " I think that there is more fashion in it than anything else . People in general like the painters who tell the truth of every one except themselves , but painters of your way of looking at things wo n't take the pains to get popularity by the only means it can be got by nowadays , and so the unconscientious painters are the successful portraitpainters . " " That very exception , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earnest portraiture and of careless , for nowa // days the people who want the truth , or anything else , told about anybody but themselves are very rare , and those who want their own portraits are the general . public who pay . The portraiture of record is now the photograph ; all other , with rare and erratic exception , is the work of vanity . " As she seemed indisposed to push the subject to further discussion , I asked if she would not reciprocate by showing me her sketches . " They are trashy , fragm&amp;ntary things , " she said , " but I will make no affectation of shyness about showing them , because I am not proud of them . " She brought from her room a folio of sketches , studies which certainly surprised me . They were as weak and helter-skelter in style as could be , feeble in drawing , the work of an uncertain and untrained hand , but so vigorous in conception , and so profound in sentiment , with passages of color such as one rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any woman 's before ; full of that instinct and passion of color which make the great painter , and without which all painting is cold and weak or dry and intellectual ; the gift which can not be acquired , and which in any artist condones a thousand shor*comings . " Pardon me , " I said , " but you should have been a painter : if I had such a power as yours , nothing should ever divide my mind with my art . " " So many friends have said , but I amuse myself just as well so , " she replied , " and then I draw so badly that I have no patience with anything that approaches finishing . And when I had drawing-masters they always treated me as a spoiled childor a woman ; for they knew that it never would be to me anything but a distraction , and why should I learn to draw ? I have no need of an occupation , and I am not sure that I shoulil be the happier for it ; artists are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no prejudices in the matter , I have no desire for a professional position . " " But have you no sense of obligation to be all that nature intended you to be , to develop the faculties given you to their full fruition ? Is there no duty to be something more than what you profess to be , a woman who seeks her own pleasure ? " " Ah ! now you talk like a pre-Raphaelite friend I once bad , who was always preaching to me about the duty in art and the mission of artists . I never saw any of either , except that of making as much money as they could , and I always found that those who were the most devoted to the m6ral side of art were the driest and least interesting artists . To me art is like the birds singing or the flowers blossoming , and , anything like an obligation to it only makes it a bore . " " But , " I replied , " the birds and the flowers come complete ; a great songstress or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a new revelation of the beauty of the ideal world . You are like the hu5an creature in your gifts , and the bird that perishes in your will to use them ; " and feeling not a little the sarcasm in her allusion to the preaching painters , and not caring much if I gave her an unpalatable rebuke , I added , " One *sees that this world has been so favorable to you that you have little to hope for from another , so you may as well remain the creature that you are-one to be flattered and admired , and wasted in the end like the ' bird and flower which you make your examples ; you would have been much happier poor , and a hard worker . " She looked at me curiously and keenly , for I felt and showed a little distaste for the morality she advocated , and then rejoined : " Well , perhaps you are right , but you will tell me something more about it some time . " " I am , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Your self-indulgence would find little encouragement from me , and I fear little sympathy . " " But at least , " she said , " you will allow me to come and see you work some day , if it does not annoy you to have any one look ' on while you draw ? " I assented , and in fact had a weakness to let people see how readily and carefully I drew , for I was in that vernal state of human wisdom in which we value most that which costs us the most effort to do , and of which the Nemesis is that those who come after us invert our judgment of ourselves , and esteem us most for that which we did unconsciously and because we could n't help it . Two or three days passed ; we met at table , hut rarely elsewhere ; a word on the balcony after breakfast , or before dinner , on the sunset-commonplace nothings , but Miss Marston did not attract me ; her seif-induigence wounded my puritanical tendencies , and I judged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had for many years no parent 's care , but only the buzz of flattery and congratulation which an heiress bears , and the relaxing influences of the gratification of every wish which money could gratify , she was a wonderful example of how gifted souls may keep their stature and nobility // in spite of every hostile influence . The party was still divided as to me , the majority treating me with the studied contempt due to an inferior whom circumstances have forced into the honor of their society . Miss Marston and a middle-aged lady , who was , I found , her companion and duenna , and whose sense of propriety at first sided against the bohemian , but who , on finding Miss Marston resolute to recognize the humanity in me , dropped her coolness and became amusingly patronizing and critical , made up my party , with the husband of my matronly antipathy. , a Mr. Ascott , who had been in trade , but having made a fortune by various adroit operations , had retired with an estate , and now finding me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed himself the diversion of conversation with me . Mrs. A. was a distant relative of Miss Marston , and so they were in a feeble sense bound together . One day Miss Marston 's suitor disappeared without a word . I afterward found out that he had ventured to accuse her , jokingly it must have been , of a partiality for me , to which she replied in such terms that she was relieved of his presence ; and as she had perhaps warmed herself in defending me , she showed it in her manner to me , and asked if she and her conipamon might not accompany me and take a lesson in drawing . I found no flattery in this attention ; it was clearly the defiance of what she felt to be the snobbery of her friends which made her notice me at all , and any new evidence of her condescension only made me more irritable and captious . I therefore permitted her with less pleasure than I should once have had , to sit and overlook my work while I began a new drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It seems so easy , " she said as we walked homeward , " that I think I could learn . Will you give me lessons while we are here together ? * To this purely professional proposal I had of course no objection which could be urged . 1 came there to make money , and that was as good a way as any . It lasted two weeks ; we drew together , and poor Miss Peterman , who scarcely enjoyed these mountain walks as well as the veranda of the inn , read one by one the few books which circumstances gave her . Then Mrs. Ascott tried a COup d ' *tat and announced to Miss Marston that they must go on to Limmat : they had exhausted our valley and were tired of the inn . Miss M. made no objection or reply , and , when the day of departure came , made no preparation , so that Mrs. Ascott found herself , to her surprise , preparing to go without her Jro/t'gt*e . Of course there were expostulation and sharp words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry , and very determined . We heard no debate , only Mrs. Ascott surrendered and stayed . Our lessons went on and nothing was changed . They evidently believed that an attachment was springing up between us , but as I knew that her manner to me had nothing more than the interest of curiosity and opposition in it , and I recognized no attraction towards her , I gave myself no thought on the matter . Miss Marston devoted herself with all her energy to her drawing , and the interest in it , with perhaps the healthy tonic of my merciless criticism and plainness of manner approaching rudeness , gave her concentration and interest in her work , and in her daily life , which changed the expression of her face and manner utterly . Every day she seemed more and more to submit to my authority ; while on my . part I felt every day an increase of an irritable and domineering tendency which I compressed in an increasing deference and coolness of manner . To me her condescension and greater friendliness were simply evidences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . I almost hated her at times . Nearly a month had passed since I first saw her , when one day Miss Peterman , with the thick-skinned temerity with which blunt and stupid people sometimes provoke the wrath of a volcanic nature , made a remark in my hearing of its being a good job for me that I had fallen in with such a pupil , to which Miss Marston replied in a qui9k anger which startled more than it shocked me , and made the poor dependent retreat into her shell like a snail , and cower till the outburst had gone by , which was but a minute , when , still pale , and with quiet , compressed lips , the young lady walked toward the inn , Miss Peterman following , while I waited , not knowing well how to take it . Here was no conventional condescension , but a resentment for the slight to me , keener and stronger than I had felt , genuine beyond any power of doubt , and generous . It was like the lifting of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant that I had not in the least comprehended her ; that maybe this careless , self-indulgent woman I had believed in was only the mask to a nature which was kept from the butterfly swarms about her . After a time I returned , but that day saw her no more . // The next morning at the usual hour I was in waiting to go out for the lesson , when she appeared alone , and while we waited for her companion she made a hasty apology , with a certain constraint as of one not used to do so , and with an air of humility which was very unlike anything I had seen in her before : when Miss Peterman came down she was as impassive and haughty as ever . But from that day the change in her manner towards me was most marked . She talked less and listened more , and if possible gave moi'e attention to her drawing . She seemed to be seeking for all the occasions in which a woman 's tact and intuitions find out and flatter a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took this to be a studied compensation for what she felt to be . the offensive depreciation in the tone of her friends , and I responded by a still greater courtesy and ceremoniousness and a more magisterial manner , to give her clearly to understand that I did not accept her condescension , and that I was on my side the social paling her equal , and in self-respect as well . In fact I treated her en maitre and she responded by increasing deference . I thought that I was getting to is ike her more and more , but when one day , soon after the last recorded incidents , she said to me- " We shall leave soon for a run in Italy and back to London . I hope I shall see you there next winter , " I found my heart sinking and my interest in my work gone , but replied as coldly as ever , " I hope so , if you wish it . " " If I wish it , " she repeated after me , " and why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you then had reason to believe me a hypocrite , and do I pay idle compliments ? - Ah ! you men are all alike in one respect , uncharitable and bitter to a woman who respects herself , but full of courtesy for weak and silly ones who are ready to say anything to please you , " and she turned and walked away a little , but presently came back and we went on to the end of the lesson . That night I thought much and slept little . I was angry with myself for the discomfort I found in the knowledge of her intended departure . I did not thiNk I loved her , but to find myself in the least dependent on her for the daily interest of my life was vexatious , and I drew her to myself in exaggerated proportions of pride and condescension and railed at the image I had made . But in spite of myself the memory , pitiful and touching , c.ame up of that day after the outbreak with Miss Peterman , and the tender humility which sprang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one thing I could least forget , and which made her utterly lovely in my eyes . I did finally sleep and woke late . That day nothing was said of departure or renewal of acquaintance ; we both worked hard and were very taciturn . In the two or three days which were left me I found out , what I had not appreciated , how much the intellectual intercourse with Miss Marston had grown necessary to me and how blank and uninteresting my life would be after she was gone ; and constantly the lovelier qualities in her character overgrew the traits of the woman of the world . Once turned in this way of thinking , 1 found out many noble things in her , and recalled and explained many incidents in a far different manner from that in which I had accounted for them at first . And the certainly remarkable intellectual correspondences in our minds suggested to me in infinite ways the elective affinities . We loved the same things a&gt;iost without exception , the same pictures , the same music , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was going she was of course occupied in packing , etc. , and the lessons were ended , and I v*Tent out early for a long walk . There was a fever in my blood , for I had lain awake all night . I climbed a peak where I could look off and see the whole range of the Oberland ; but the silent fields of snow , the solemn pine forests , which at other times lulled and harmonized me , had no influence now . I could not be still , and hurried down again to be back in time for breakfast . The day passed miserably . When I saw her 1 looked carefully at her face , to see if she too showed any sign of feeling like mine , and then I mocked myself by the folly of dreaming that she could have any such weakness as 1 could no longer deny the existence of ; that I , with my tastes and habits , grown up in comparative poverty , could be in her eyes anything but a useful friend for a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or I could have comprehended that that would be no objection in the eyes of a woman who had preferences and the wealth to gratify them ,  --  that a woman when she gives herself likes to give much , the more the happier she . She may recall or make it worthless afterward , but in the day of giving she makes no measure of much or little . But being in love I comprehended nothing . I saw her go without a word , without even a question of the eyes ; my very coldness and speechlessness must have betrayed me. but in my own mind my love was a madness and I could not give it breath or hope . As // the carriage drove up I dared help her in , and at that moment she handed me an envelope containing , I well knew , the pay for my lessons . How I hated the money ! An almost irresistible temptation urged me to throw it back into the carriage , but this would have been at once insulting her and betraying myself ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive compensation was the act of a Quixote or a lover ; so I kept it , abhorring it . She drove away with all her smiles , and all my sunshine , and I hastened to read her note which accompanied a check of more than I would have accepted if I had seen it before . If she had given Bank of England notes I should have returned the surplus , but I could not break the check till I went to London , for I had no banker , and no bank connections , so I only determined to repay it when I saw her or send it to her if I never did . Her note thanked me not only for my lessons in drawing " but for something more valuable by far  --  a lessoh in tXe value of plain and upright manhood which had given her a better opinion of her species . " She hoped to see me when I got back to London , and begged me to let her know if I would make her a drawing of the place where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with unknown agitations of hope and surprise . I was thirty-five-not handsome , by any means ; not , that I could judge , possessed of any attraction for women . 1 had accustomed myself to believe that no woman worth loving was likely to love me , and to feel that Miss Marston meant what she said of me lifted me so far from my footing with myself that I lost my head . I did not then even suspect that she loved me , or understand how she could , for I had never been with any woman so severe , and cold , and magisterial . I was always ready to defend myself againsf* her contempt or pity ; but against her esteem I had provided myself with no shield . To *believe that she really liked me more than the men she had known was something that turned my head , and overcame my last reserves . I set at once about the drawing she wished , and finished it to my content . I was happy to rapture , happy simply in loving , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all my will that I would be to her the truest , most disinterested friend woman ever had . In my enthusiasm I thought even that I had conquered love by friendship , and that her nobility had conquered what seemed a selfish passion . I comprehended no more of myself than I had rof her . I received from her a note dated at Florence , saying that she had left some books which she begged that I would read if they interested me , and bring back to England with me , as some had notes which made them of value to her . I got them and read the notes , not the books . In one-C*onsuelo-I found this n6te in a margin : " What fools men are not to know that a true woman wants nothing so much as a true master . " That plunged me into despair , for I wondered what man he must be who was fit to be her master , and all my enthusiastic deep consecration began to grow leaden-she would find her master , and , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallowness of the deceit my own heart was practicing on me . Wretched days followed , and as her note said that she would be for a month at Rome , I sent the drawing on to her there-for she gave me even her address -- my only object being to make an excuse for a letter , but why the letter I could not even explain to myself . Her acknowledgment of the receipt of the drawing was full of praise . " It was so true - so niasterly in handling " - nothing about higher qualities , but I knew now that she paid no idle compliments . Why would I not come to Rome , and paint some of the wonderful pictures made to the artist 's hand there ? ' There were two views especially that she wished I would draw for her as I had our valley . ' I called myself a fool , but I went . She was more beautiful and more gracious than ever , but now we lodged in different quarters . She took me in a carriage to the views she wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively very little , and she had many other friends . I made myself very unhappy . I grew jealous , wretched , and avoided her almost ostentatiously . Then when she met me her great grave eyes asked me questions about it , and seemed hurt , but I said to myself , if she knew all she would only laugh at me , and then would leave me to my folly . - I used to think that that was the depth of misery ; now it seems to me light and happiness compared with what has come to me since . I finished my drawings ,  --  one on the Tiber , with the sun setting and lighting up the Aventine at my left ; and the other the gray crumbling line of aqueduct on the Campagna , the Alban hills in the distance , and the boundless . agro Romano stretching away in the impressiveness of desolation . But the autumn rains had fallen , and the turf was rich in flowers and knee-deep in herbage // before I finished . I wished that I might catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , my feelings came to their utmost tension , and I determined to break with the enchantment , and get back to my lodgings and studio at Kensington . I packed her drawings and left them to be sent the morning after I had left , with a note to explain . But I could not leave her without a sufficient explanation ; her good opinion of me should not suffer by insincerity , so I told her frankly that I had been foolish enough to love her too much for my own quiet , and I was going to leave her , hoping never to see her again , as she never would me if I could help it . Much else I could not say . I left the note and drawings with the keeper of my lodgings and started early the morning after to Civita Vecchia . Once away , and the story told , I felt better , for I had broken with my folly-I hoped broken it . I waited in a kind of stupor for the steamer at Civita , but I felt freer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without raison d ' *tre , as if I had touched bottom and was glad because I could go no lower . A week after my arrival in London I received the following letter " My dear Friend : Your note has affected me more than I can tell you . That I should have given you pain when I hoped to have given you , if not pleasure , at least the satisfaction of having helped one who needs help and frien4s more than those will understand who regard prosperity as a certain avenue to haRpiness , hurts me inexpressibly . I feel pained , humiliated , by the way in which you have turned your back on me . I feel the loss of you as a friend , for I know that you are honest and unselfish in your regard for me , which I have felt of very few men . I can not well think it all out now , but I can not willingly give up your friendship . You will think better of it , will you not , and let me see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man loves a woman as I loved her he is willing , he thinks , to sacrifice even his love to her happiness , and he will perhaps , no more than I did , perceive that a true woman who under such circum*tances writes such a letter to him , invites him to love her as strongly as a woman s reserve will let her . Her letter touched me-kindled again in me the enthusiasm I had on my journey to Rome , and I forgot all the prudential considerations with which I had been intrenching myself against my passion . I flattered myself that the self-demal would exalt my friendship , and that I might become a devoted , calm , profitable friend without any of the perturbations of my ( as I hoped ) past passion . I stimulated my fancy with the images of my enthusiasm , and replied to her that 1 was her knight-errant at all hazards , and that no word of the past or of love should ever again pass my lips . I accepted my place such as she made it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing could have been more irritating or likely to produce a diminution of regard than such a willing relinquishment of an affection desired ; but she had grown weary of men who insisted , and of suitors who would not be denied , and now , looking back through the silence and cold of my later years , and understanding her , I can see that as she understood the genuine , self-denying character of my love , and that it was not weakness but enthusiasm , and a certain moral exaltation above myself , new to her , which determined me to accept renunciation as a solution of my disappointment , so she enhanced in her own mind the value of what she believed me about to withdraw from her . And so a few days before she should have arrived I received another letter in which she said , amongst other things : - " I have been wondering whether it is not dreadfully selfish of me to accept your friendship and devotion , which I prize above everything , and give you in return only mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of a woman as a friend , however much she may need him , and I would rather you never saw my face again than cause you any more pain . Do not think of me as an ideal , but only as a weak woman with a passionate soul always struggling for the light . You must not think me better than I am , but try to make me so . I can not understand how we have become friends so quickly , and I to trust you so utterly , who have always been considered so hard and cold . I feel the truth and singleness of your nature , and knowing you even this short time has been an inestimable benefit to me . ' This , while it augmented my enthusiasm , humiliated me , for I knew how far from the conception she had of me , my narrow , bitter , and proscriptive nature was ; but I took the comfort that I woul*I change and widen with such a friend . I wrote to her a letter , to meet her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I signed myself " more than brother or lover , " and in deceiving myself , supposed I should convince her that all danger to me had passed . It is long to remember heart-beats as I // remember those I felt the morning I knew she was in London . At length came the note-no longer the Platonic proprieties , but what took my breath and left me in a tumult of emotion utterly indescribable . It said : " Cotne ! I am longing for your coming with my whole soul ; come not as my friend , but my master . I shall kneel and kiss your hands , begging you to forgive all the needless pain 1 gave you of feeling I could never love you , and I love you now so intensely that nothing but death shall control my heart from yours . " Of the few days which followed I have neither the wish nor the power to tell . Nothing is so dreary as , sitting in hopeless darkness , to recall a perfect light . I revive the days of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquestioning delight , or those cruel doubts and fears which , still later , left me standing alone outside the gate of my Paradise . To me Anna , proud and imperious as she was to all others , was perfect sweetness and docility . She made me her master indeed , and in the absence of any objection to our marriage , she permitted me to dictate every condition and abbreviate delay to the limit of my own reasoning . Yet even this had not passed when the reaction of a too great and , as it seemed , too easy triumph brought about a revulsion of feeling  --  a miserable , pitiful doubt which opened the door , I now see , to my tempter and enemy . If she had waited like little women to be won by long supplication , and finally only half given me her heart , I should still have implored , and longed , and believed ; but she was of that larger type which overlooks the little wiles that flatter men 's pride , and cast herself in utter faith and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid her by doubting after doubt was too late for anything but misery . Yet a sight of her , a word from her , in an instant dispelled it all and made me perfectly content again . And yet it came back , this doubt , in endless change of form ; exorcised from one it took another , and there was one which , from its nature , I could not utterly drive it out of  --  the feeling that between the habits of her past life and mine there were dissonances which made complete sympathy impossible , and left a way for contempt and derision on her part . I was irritably suspicious of her fashionable friends-she cut them all ; morbidly sensitive to the difference in our fortunes-she put away all her jewels , gave up her carriage , and wore only the simplest dresses . Every concession , while it mocked the present doubt , planted the seed of another . We were married as we appointed , because I could find no pretext in my own mind to base a postponement on , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalling revulsion came over me , and I gave myself up to the conviction that I was doomed to a life of cal ) tivity and dissympathy . But I determined to do my duty , and not only try to make her happy , but convince her that I was happy , as she seemed . And she had no misgivings , no suspicion thatthe strength of will and power of command she leaned on and looked up to were merely the obstinacy and dogmativeness of a narrow and dry intellectual nature , accustomed to maintain its self . respect by giving full rein to its pride and exclusiveness . She made no question that she was the happiest and most beloved bride of the year ; she had no coquetries , no arts , no reserve , but poured her whole soul out on me in a vehemence of passion and entire self-abandon , which , with a larger and nobler man than I , would have banished every shadow from life . That I was jealous only delighted her , yet she never provoked my jealousy for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing sweeter , more angelic than her faith and devotion could have been in human heart . This doubting mood wore away at length , and left me really as happy as I tried to persuade her I was ; happier still not to feign and caress where no will was , and for a few months no ripple broke the surface of our summer life . Anna wanted her old companion Miss Peterman to come and live with us , to which I objected without any other reason than that I did not like her ; she had in our first acquaintance shown too much of the feeling of Mrs. Ascott to please me now , but I only said that I did not wish to be disturbed by superfluous outsiders . But Miss Peterman came , and came often , and being of that indurate nature that never knows when it is de trop , she irritated me more and more . She was the cause of our first differ*nce , as she was of our last . She was sincerely and always attached to Anna , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved , and which should have given me patience under the infliction of her society ; but when , after visitations which grew more and more frequent , I made a complaint against their continuance , and in my blind , unjust way declaimed against her , Anna stood by her friend quietly , but firmly . It was the first time that she had shown any disposition // to question my will , and all the old doubts gathered anew . I knew that her friend was from the beginning opposed to our marriage as an injustice to Anna , and knowing this , Anna 's defense of her made her in my jealous mind an accomplice in all Miss Peterman 's offensiveness . I replied angrily , arrogating to myself an authority no woman of her position could with dignity submit to , and found in a moment that I had drawn the bow too far . I saw the white passiqn rise in her face as I had once before seen it rise in my defense , and with a voice quite unmoved , she said , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You forget yourself , Martin , " and I heard her fo6tsteps on the stairs and in the chamber over-head . I knew th*.t I should have gone after her and begged her j ) ardon on my knees , and I know that she would have forgotten all in an instant , but my devil had fairly got his hold of me , and I obstinately defied my own conscience and declared she should come to me , and so an end . All human justice and manly pity had gone out of me under that malignant passion . I waited half an hour , an hour , and heard no stir above , then threw myself on a sofa to sleep , obstinate till the day . I finally did sleep , and when the dawn was mingling with the red gaslight , I awoke with something clasping my feet , and saw Anna , pale and haggard as if a week 's illness had left its marks on her , kissing my feet and moaning broken excuses for her " wicked temper , " as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in the reaction of her passion , and had lain senseless until then , or she would not have kept me waiting so long , she said . Even I was conquered and made confession-no human heart ever so hard could have resisted that condescension of a divine nature , and for weeks again all was unbrokenly serene in our life ; Anna was even more devoted and more humble . I felt a certain humiliation , however , and putting my misconduct up before my eyes , imagined that she too always saw it , and as my innate suspiciousness and pride slowly resumed their dominion , as is their habit with such men , I felt that she must have lost faith in and affection for me , and that she kept up a show as I had done in the beginning , all the more tender from being the result of duty rather than love . There is no pride so obstinate and bitter as that of a proud poor nian , and now I felt what had always suggested itself at times , that between her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no life possible to me could ever weave their ways into one ; that do what we would , I should always be poor and proud , irritable to condescension and suspicious , while she , the spoiled child of fortune , unable to comprehend these foibles , would maintain her frank , gracious life in spite of all my exactions , and , if necessary , would have descended cheerfully to my poverty with me and accepted its trials with equanimity far greater than mine . Her soul was greater than any possible sacrifice ; mine so small that I could not comprehend a sacrifice without some bitterness . But what was worse was the memory of that wrong I had done her , which humiliated me at all times , and which I could not believe that she had forgotten or forgiven . The charm of our perfect unity had been broken , and I always awaited a new outbreak . So looked for , of course it came . The trivial irritations of daily life found words , and chilled her without inducing an outbreak or explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on her , and , day by day , fell back in morbid distrust on my pride , which built up a wall between us . I should have gone away for a time and cleared my eyes of their false color ; the wrong was in me , not in her , who , in constant pain at my coldness , yet watched the hours of my absence with a love so utter and so forgiving that I mistook it for hypocrisy . The only palliation which I can now shape for my conduct is a theory that I must have been mad  --  a moral insanity had perverted my vision , my reason , even my sense of nianhood . Yet I am punished as if I had been the worst of murderers , and that assures me that I am responsible for my crime . In this state of tension came the critical incident-if it had not been this it would have been something else soon . Miss Peterman called to ask Anna to go for the day somewhere out of London , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy made me determined to break with the situation then and there . To tell the least possible of a wretched tale-I forbade Anna to go , and this in the presence of my enemy . You see I wzs mad . There was no mark of emotion on Anna 's face , but the now understood white calm . She turned to Miss Peterman , as quietly as though she escaped from a disagreeable invitation , and playfully begged her to excuse her for the time-she had important business with her husband . Alone , she addressed herself to me as I had seen her // speak to her man of busjness when he recoinmended something disagreeable to her : " Mr. Lea , " she said , " little irnpertinences and disagreeable exercise of authority one submits to from one 's husband , because they are in the way of the world ; but in ceasing to be a gentleman you have ceased to exercise any authority over me-take your way and I will . take mine-Good morning , sir . " While speaking the word she slipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped it into a vase which stood on the mantel . Her face , lips and hands were bloodless ; hard lines of resolution such as I had never seen the semblance of were about her mouth , and a cold glint was in her eyes ; nothing womanly , but a look such as a beautiful fury might have worn . She swept out of the room and up-stairs . In these long years since then , years whose ending I wait and pray for , that face has been my Tisiphone ; has haunted my gloom-joy I have had none ; has waked me froni my sleep and made my dreams terrible ; has found me in my solitude and driven me out from amongst men . For this as well as for my sin I loathe life . I fek that all was over to me-she was no more even a friend . Frightened and brought to my senses again , I put on my hat and walked out . I wandered aimlessly about all day and dined at the club . Dinner over , I could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Anna had been out for a short time in the afternoon , but had eaten nothing at home , and had passed the day in her room , where she still was . I turned the gas down a little and lay on the sofa , in a state of numbness of heart like what I imagine the approach of death to be . I longed yet dreaded to hear some word from her , and I began by hoping that she would come ; I finally grew angry and frenzied that she did not , and then at length she caine ; she entered the room and I rose . She was pale , haggard , her hair disarranged , and in the dim light looked like a ghost . She looked me in the eyes for some seconds but without a word . I was almost wild to hear some word which would call me to her , but my devil of pride came to my destruction and I did not speak . " It is for her to make the confession , " I said to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stern again , I knew . She waited and watched a little , and then with an expression of unutterable , unendurable woe , which with that one told , and another yet to be told of , alternated in the scourging of my soul , she turned back and passed out again . I knew then that she regretted , I felt my power once more . I was not happier , but less wretched ; but I grew hard again and determined that she should bend  --  to yield now was to lose all . I waited another hour , and went out again to pass the night at a hotel . I can not say I slept-I dozed to wake from frightful dreams-I wished that I had yielded , that last look so haunted me . A terrible dread beset me as I rose with the dawn and walked the streets till the traffic began , and then went back to the house determined to ask . Anna 's pardon for my brutality . Her maid told me that she had been down two or three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if I had come in , but she must be sleeping now . I went to our room , and with profound humiliation prepared to do penance for my wrong . My heart stopped beating almost , as I found on my dressing-table a note in her hand-writing addressed to me . It was as follows " It can not endure longer , my darling . It has happened as I felt it must from long ago-my demoniac temper has lost me what alone made life so dear , without which I do not care to live ,  --  or if by chance I might still win you back it would be for a more complete alienation . I can not live so , and my only hope is that in dying now I may have still left some roots of your love which my death may quicken to life again , and in that future which would be empty without you , I may be able to hold you again . In that life , if there be life there , I shall have learned to conquer this wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be touched with pity and tenderness , knowing that I gave up life and the happiness of seeing you for the chance of keeping you in eternity , if there is eternity , and if not then there is nothing for me . It is cold , dreadful , to go into the darkness so alone , but colder , more dreadful , to live here without you . Three times I have been down to see if you had come in , wishing to ask your forgiveness and kiss you but once more ; but you are cold , uaforgiving , and I must go . Come and see me once more-love me if you can , and remember me , and that I loved you more than life . YOUR ANNA . " I did not wait to read the whole , but flew to her little working room . The gas was . burning brightly , and she lay on the low couch by the window-an empty glass on the floor-dead  --  the beautiful eyes wide open , glassy , lips parted , her left hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast , but cold ; the calnT unrecognizing look , in- // qwq
