AIn'IcJ*E VIL-YALE COLLEGE. - SOME THOUGHTS RE SPECTING ITS FUTURE . THIRD ARTICLE . IN our last Article , we offered some suggestions in regard to that section of the University in which " graduated " students may have the opportunity of pursuing a general and non-professional course of study . For various reasons this section has been , until now , in a comparatively undeveloped state . It has had sufficient life and organization to be of service to a few individuals , who have been in such favorable circumstances as to allow of their remaining in New Haven for a year or two after their graduation in the Academical Department . But its growth toward the large usefulness of which it is capable , or even toward becoming the fully-formed and distinct part of the institution , which it needs to become in order to such usefulness , is a thing almost entirely of the future . It is earnestly to be hoped , that the authorities of the College will not lose sight of this most important interest , as they are laying their plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general subj ect from the point which we have now reached , we are naturally led to consider next the schools for professional education . The founding of such schools , as we have already intimated , and as is well known to all who are familiar with the history of the institution , was the work of the far-seeing men who had charge of the College in the earlier part of the present century . They displayed great wisdom , not only in their appreciation of the demand for such schools , and in their readiness to meet that demand by establishing them in connection with the collegiate school which they had received from their fathers , but , also , in their selection of men of ability and reputation , who should become instructors in them and should secure for them a successful growth . Very soon after the establishment of these new departments young men , graduates of this and other institutions , began to resort here in considerable numbers for the par suit // of higher studies . With somewhat varying fortunes , and yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools went onward , until they became known almost as widely as the Academical Department itself They were honored throughout the country . Graduates went forth from them to adorn the several professions both in the neighborhood of the college and in more distant places . By means of their existence and success , Yale passed out of the company of the institutions with which it had been previously numbered , and took its position in a higher rank  --  a position which it has maintained until now . It was no longer simply a College-even a College of wide extended-fame-but the form of a University was beginning to manifest itself and there was a promise of lai-ger realization for the future . Our object , however , is not to trace out the history of these professional schools . We desire , especially , to sp*ak of the coming time , and to refer to the past only so far as it may show any want of completeness , or may indicate the way of better working hereafter . The great error , as it seems to us , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University , was in leaving them too dependent on the reputation of one or more instructors . It was , indeed , a day of small things fifty years ago , as compared with the present . We are living now almost in a different world from that which our fathers knew . It would have been idle , therefore , to expect of them a foreseeing of all that might be necessary in after years . Especially was theirs a day of small things in respect to the great matter of money . It was only with the utmost difficulty that fands could be raised for the purposes of education . We can scarcely wonder that they shrank from the work of raising them , and endeavored rather to move on , as best they could , in a limited way . It was natural , also , that , as the new schools began to grow in numbers , they should feel that they were going on successfully enough without further aid , and that the professors were accomplishing all that the institution needed . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and fame of these particular instructors , and the schools rested almost entirely upon them . Their very success had an influence to close the eyes of even the most interested // observers to what must afterwards become manifest , and an essential work was left undone . No institution is strong which depends on the life of a single man . It must have an independent life of its own . It must be able to survive in its vigor and energy , no matter what changes may occur in the occupancy of any one of its chairs of instraction . There must be not a mere collection of students attracted by the brilliancy and power of a favorite teacher , but an institution which draws attention to itself by its own fame , and gives to all who come to it the best edacation . Yale College , as a college , has always had this essential element of continued success and growth , but , in the earlier times , we think its guardians neglected this point too much in the other departments . And the consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over at the beginning , became a matter of greater seriousness and difficulty at a later period . New men were obliged to do what their predecessors had failed to do , and to lay foundations , when they ought to have been only building the snperstructure . Another point , in which it seems to us that those who preceded us ( notwithstanding all they accomplished ) made an unfortunate error , was this ; that they did not , at the very first moment when they perceived that any of these departments began to decline in strength , make the most strenuous efforts to repair the original error . They should have made the life of the schools as entirely independent as possiMe of the life of any instructor , so soon as they saw them failing , in any measure , because of the passing away of the life of one instructor . They should have increased the funds  --  the essential means of success-so soon as they perceived the first manifestations of weakness arising from the want of funds . But , unfortunately , they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a manifest fact of the past history , we do not allude to it here with any other intention than to make it helpful or suggestive with regard to the future . The Theological Department of the University , for example , after more than thirty years of its history had elapsed , had only about sixty thousand dollars of avail* able funds  --  a sum as inadequate to the carrying forward of its work as can well be imagined . Years of effort have been expended , since that time , to bring it , in this regard , even to its // present condition , in which it is ready for future and indefinite growth . We do not say that the work could certainly have been done earlier , but no one can doubt that , if it had been done , or if it had been even begun , ten or twenty years before , the result would have been incalculably beneficial . The same thing is true-perhaps in a still greater degree-with regard to some of the other departments . They suffered because they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth was arrested for a time , when it might have been uninterrupted and constant . But , though there may have been unfavorable circumstances or even nufortunate mistakes , the University has never lost any part of its organization and never taken a step backward beyond recall The professional schools have not been abandoned , nor has any such thought been entertained for a moment . On the other hand , the governing powers have been ready to strengthen them and to infuse new life into them whenever the necessity for doing so has become imperative . In the case of some of them , success has been already regained , and enough has been done to show that they may be more vigorous in the future than they have ever been in the past . It becomes a question of great interest , therefore , as we look out upon the coining time , what may be accomplished and what may be hoped for in regard to these schools . If this University can be as prominent and worthy of honor in all its branches , as it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hereafter , a place in the very front rank . If it dies away , in those portions of it where the higher studies are pursued , it must , as we have already pointed out in a former Article , sink into a lower and less influential position . What is the work and what are the thoughts appropriate to the important moment of the College history which is now upon us ? The first feeling , which , as we think , the authorities of the institution , who will have its interests in charge in the period now about to open , ought to fix firmly in their minds , is one of encouragement . Yale College and its governors have never been hopeful enough for the last fifty years . The time for a complete change , in this regard , has now arrived . There is every reason , to-day , for confidence in the future , provided only the // requisite energy comes forward to meet the crisis . The passing and groundless notion , that a large city or some place other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be looked upon as likely to keep possession of the minds of the people . When time has been afforded for the mature consideration of the subject in all its bearings , the wise judgment of mankind will decide that the student can most successfully pursue any branch of study at a seat of universal learning . There he is in the atmosphere of study . There he is surrounded by hundreds of earnest and aspiring men who are fired by the noble impulses of the scholar 's life , and by their enthusiasm he will be incited to greater energy . There , also , he will be protected against the narrowing influences of his own limited field of working , and will be enlarged in his mental culture , as he sees something of the glory of other fields beyond his own . It is idle , as it seems to us , to endeavor to maintain the opposite view . The " modern American idea , " as it is called , that a man needs to know only one thing , lest he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that threefourths of valuable education is in " seeing the world " in a great commercial metropolis , is destined to pass away , like other ideas of the same class , so soon as we become a more cultivated people . The study of men is very good in its place , but it is comparatively worthless for the student when it draws him away from books . Books are what he needs in his course of preparation . Mental culture is the thing to which he should give his almost exclusive attention . The knowledge of mankind belongs far more to a later period of life , and it is far more important that a young man should know something , as he enters upon the active duties of his profession , which he can communicate to his fellow-men or with which he can benefit them , than that he should know them themselves thoroughly at the beginning . And-rapidly as we move in this country-it can not be long before this conviction becomes established everywhere . No doubt , what we say holds good in respect to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , in the case of all alike , they are best pursued where all the circumstances are most favorable to a student 's life . Sound learning is the indispensable condition of real power . It ought // to be , and , as we believe , will be hereafter , essential to real success . The practical element may be added , but the scholarly element must lie at the foundation . Now the University is the home of learning , and the place where the university is located is , thus , the place for students of every class . So soon as this better judgment becomes established , the attention of men will be turned more fully toward these great institutions . They will be built up in numbers and in strength , while the highest education will be centered in them as much as it now is in Germany . Every advance which is made in right ideas will , thus , become a means of growth for our leading universities , and those among them which are ready to move forward with all energy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright one . There is no cause for discouragement or doubt . We add , as a further ground of hopefulness respecting the professional schools of this institution , the good will which is very widely entertained toward them . To the Theological Department we have already referred . By a remakable ordering of Providence , the men who were its earliest officers of instruction continued as fellow-laborers for more than a generation , and then passed off the stage of action almost at the same time . An entirely new organization was , thus , rendered necessary . The funds , however , of the department were so exceed . ingly limited that but little could be accomplished . For two or three years , the chairs of instruction were only very partially filled , and , then , the breaking out of the late war rendered the collection of the necessary endowments , for the time , impossible . But , with all the weakness of the new beginning , and notwithstanding the many sources of discouragement , the work of redstablishing and strengthening the school was pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times alike , the energies of all interested in it have been constantly exerted for the accomplishment of the end in view . The institution has been made stronger , in some respects , than it ever had been in its earlier history . It has become possessed of a more independent life , and is less a mere assemblage of students about a single eminent man . Its funds have been multiplied seven or eight times . A new building has been erected and furnished throughout for the accommodation of // its students- one of the largest and most convenient college buildings in the country . Its chairs of instruction are now filled and its number of students is increasing . To those who look back over the past thirteen years , with an intimate knbwledge of all that has been accomplished during that period , it is evident that the good will of good men toward Yale Cob lege , in any of its departments , may always be depended upon . And , though this particular branch of the University is still in great need of an enlargement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize the hopes of its friends and the possibilities of its useftilness , yet those who have its interests in their keeping have greater confidence  --  and they have reason for greater confidence-that the remaining work can now be done than they have had , heretofore , that any portion of the past results would ever be realized . We allude to this instance only by way of illustration . The remarkable growth and prosperity of the Sci - entific School  --  the success which its officers are meeting , even now , in their work of raising a quarter of a million of dollars for its uses-afford another instance of the same thing . The friends of Yale College , and those who believe in and hope for its success , abound everywhere . They will not be slow to help it , in its onward progress , whenever they shall be made to know its wants . They will help its professional schools as well as its collegiate department , and will rejoice in the growth of the former as truly as in that of the latter . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been reading to the guardians of this university , it has been , first and foremost the lesson of confidence and hopefulness , in every line . But there must be a heroic energy corresponding to the hopefulness , or the end will not be attained . If the hope can be awakened as it should be , indeed , the energy will naturally follow  --  and yet , as our second thought , we desire to call attention to the imperative need of the latter . There are professional schools in this University which , at the present moment , are almost entirely destitute of funds . They have struggled on against this evil , as best they could , for years past , and have accomplished results most honorable to themselves . Indeed , there is nothing in the history of Yale College more remarkable , than the greatness of its work when // 319 compared with the smallness of its means . But the period in the history of the country has now arrived when such things can be no longer anticipated . With the increased wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher educational institutions should have greatly enlarged endowments . Sooner or later , those which are limited , in this regard , must lose efficiency and fall behind in their work . An effort , as it seems to us , must , therefore , at once be made for the supply of this want in the professional schools here , if the end which we have in view is to be accomplished . And this effort must be directed in a wise way and must be of a most persist . ent character . If we consider the condition of the two departments which have been alluded to , when we were speaking of the hopefulness of the future-namely , the Theological and the Scientific  --  a very large increase of the existing funds is demanded , notwithstanding all that has recently been obtained . Not more , we suppose , than one half of the amount , which the officers of the latter set before themselves as the smallest sum at which they should aim , has as yet been secured . But the enterprise and earnestness which these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen months , give promise of their ultimate success , and they present an example , in this regard , which may well be imitated . In the former of these two departments , there remains very much to be done . The means for erecting a large addition to its present building , for giving further aid to those among its students who are in pecuniary need , and for increasing the salaries of its instructors , as well as for other purposes , are still to be raised . We know of no reason why the former of these schools may not have , at an early day , two hundred and fifty students , and the latter one hundred or more , except it be from the want of such larger means . Everything else looks favorable , at the present moment , for their prosperous growth ; and , though we proph. esy nothing , we say , with confidence , that , if the necessary energy in this one line is displayed by the University author . ities , these two schools may be placed very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become so strong , that the whole University shall rise in power and eminence by // means of them . Will the energy and effort that are called for be ready to meet the call ? Will the Trustees of the College and all the officers of these schools be prepared for the crisis and the work ? Surely , if the work can be accomplished , it will be an occasion of rejoicing among all the friends of the College throughout the country . The University will appear to be growing , not in one department only , but in a well-rounded and healthful way . But the results which have already been realized in the Scientific and Theological schools , in the particular regard of which we are now speaking ,  --  incomplete as they have hitherto been ,  --  are not yet reached in the other professional departments . The Law and Medical schools are nearly destitute of funds . They are dependent , almost entirely , on the fees derived from the students connected with them . The resources of the former are not sufficient to command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in the profession , as occupants of the principal chairs of instruction , while , in both alike , every teacher is compelled to obtain a considerable , or even the main , portion of his support from his labors outside of the school . How can institutions , which remain in such a condition in these days , hope to grow ? How can they accomplish for the University that which they need to accomplish , if the University is to be what it ought to be ? We are drawing near , now , to a new era in the history of the institution . One of the most urgent duties of the central authorities at the opening of this era , as it appears to us , is to take hold of this most important matter . The Medical and Law Departments should be placed on firm pecuniary foundations . They should be provided with the necessary means for doing the large work of which they are capable , and for which they are designed . But how is this end to be attained ? Not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial agent Agents for purposes of this sort are sometimes successful , but they are recognized always as persons who make their living by the business and their applications are easily rejected , even by the most generous of men . When we say all of them that can , by any means , be said , they can not speak , in a case like this , with the influence and power which belong to the officers and governors of the whole // University . Nor , again , can the results be secured by resolutions setting forth the importance of the object . The work must be undertaken as a business , which is to occupy much thought and is to be extended over any amount of time that may prove to be required . It must be borne in mind , that , in some respects , the undertaking will be more difficult than those which have been partially successful in the other schools . The religious sentiment of the community is always easily awakcned to interest in the education of ministers , and the beneficial influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing very kindly attention , on the part of large numbers of wealthy men , to the schools of science . But the greater difficulty is to be met by greater determination tp overcome it . There is no field , as we believe , in which patient working will be more certainly rewarded , notwithstanding all delays or discouragements , than that of soliciting from benevolent men the means of carrying forward good and useful enterprises . The end , it must be remembered , is , in this case , a most important one for the whole University . it is one for which , as yet , comparatively little effort has been put forth . It is one which calls for great energy and wisdom . The case , therefore , justifies and demands the special intervention of the governing body , and we can not but feel that the chief officer of the institution at the commencement of the new era should take upon himself the leading part in the work . He can speak with authority and with influence by reason of his very position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every profession and in every part of the state will gladly meet him , and co*iperate with him in any good work for the University . His presence in the enterprise will give unity and efficiency to it , and his encouragement and sympathy will be of the greatest assistance to all who are engaged in carrying it forward . Whatever may be his duty , or may be best for him as the presiding official , in ordinary cases , there is here an ernergency which requires his personal effort . He must be the leader whom others are to follow . The Faculty of these schools must find themselves supported by him and incited to continual earnestness by what they see in him . It is a groundless fear , as we believe , to doubt any longer the possibility of success in // such an undertaking . Such fears may have had some foundation , or at least , some seeming foundation , until now . The period of large giving has but recently begun , while the necessities of the times have suddenly enlarged themselves above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond which there should be no more apprehension , except , indeed , what may be needful for the incitement of constant energy . Moreover , a delay in entering upon the work would be a wasting of time . A considerable delay might be an almost irreparable loss of golden opportunity . We earnestly hope , that , before another collegiate year shall have passed away , a beginning may be made  --  a beginning which shall know no ending but that of complete success . The ending can not be reached in a year-perhaps , not in ten years-but the result is worth all the effort it will cost , and the success will begin early enough to reward and encourage the earnest worker . We have dwelt at some length and , perchance , with some degree of repetition , in this and former Articles , on this subject of the necessity of immediate effort for the increase of the funds of the institution . We shall be compelled to refer to it again hereafter . It is at this point , that one of the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each and all the departments of the University is found . Means of instruction , apparatus , libraries , buildings , even the men themselves who give life and power to the institution , are all secured or lost according to the provision which is made in this regard . At the same time , the work of continually increasing such funds is so laborious , and so unattractive to most men , that they are ever ready to relax their energies . The impelling influences of every new crisis , as it comes , therefore , and the indispensable necessity of accomplishing the end need to be brought forward with all emphasis , if we are to discuss the future of the College at all . But with reference to the professional schools  --  and especially those to which we have made particular allusion-it would scarcely be possible to say anything , unless we were to draw attention to this fundamental point . In our first Article , we suggested that a combined effort should be made for all branches of the institution together . The work of which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater one ; and if the greater one is undertaken , as we hope it may be , these schools , which are most needy , should be allowed not only the results of the more special part of the effort made in their behalf ; but , also , their appropriate share of what may be obtained for the common good . The feeling of the authorities should be that the institution must be strengthened wherever it most needs new strength -- that the less developed portions must be brought up to their full capabilities , and , then , that all the parts must move on together into the future years . The opposite feeling has been the great misfortune of this University in the past . Portions of the institution have almost died away , at times , in consequence of it . If the new era does not make a complete change in this regard , it might as well never have dawned upon us . And one of the first and essential steps to be taken , when the new era begins , is that which will secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their resources , the means of doing their work  --  the foundation in respect to their funds , which will enable them to be , in their appropriate sphere , what the Academical Department already is in its own . If we turn from the consideration of the need of enlarged funds , in regard to which the professional schools are essentially alike , to inquire respecting some of their other wants for the coming time , we shall find it necessary to speak of them more individually . The Law Department is , at present , in a peculiar condition . Its leading professor , who for many years had a principal part , and , recently , almost the whole of the work of instruction under his charge , was called away by death two years ago . As the endowments were very limited , it was found impracticable to make new appointments as fully as could have been desired , and a provisional and temporary arrangement was made , by which the department passed under the care of three members of the bar in New Haven . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the school , that , at no very remote day , their work might , at least , be supplemented by the election of one or more professors . This end , however , has not as yet been accomplished . The reorganization of the school is , therefore , still incomplete , and must be regarded as , in a very special sense , belonging to the new era . In some of the other // departments , the work of the future is only a partial one . The past ten or fifteen years have secured certain results which are axed and permanent . From these they can go forward , as from a starting point for new efforts . But , here , the beginning only has been made . If the old life and vigor are again to be restored , *dmost everything is yet to be done . It may not belong to one who is outside of the range of legal studies , to suggest what course of action should be adopted in this matter . We should certainly feel ourselves to be incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullness . But we may offer one or two thoughts , as we trust without impropriety , which will meet the approval of all who believe , as we do , that the several parts of the University must increase together , hereafter , if the University itself is to have any proper and noble life . At the earliest possible moment ,  --  as soon as the necessary endowments shall have been secured , or even before they are fully secured-one or more of the professorships should be filled with men of years and eminence and attractive power as teachers . The true organization for every institution of learning of the higher class , whether college or professional school , is , doubtless , that which combines the instructions and energies of younger men with those of men who are older . Where such institutions are to be strengthened for a new work , the hopeful . ness and enthusiasm of young men are absolutely essentiaL Men who are drawing near the end of life are , generally , deficient in these qualities . They are , almost always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances . But those who are still comparatively young have the heroism of youth , and hard and uninterrupted labor for a future reward is what they are prepared to meet , and what they even rejoice in . Yet , on the other hand , they alone are not sufficient They are rarely possessed of that wide-spread reputation which is needfnl for the fame of the institution , and of which students at a distance think so much . If the two orders of instructors could be combined here , in the new arrangements of this school , the first great step in the desired progress would be taken . It can not be taken , indeed , unless previous efforts shall have been made for the securing of the endowments of which we have spoken , but we have no evidence , as yet , that those efforts can not be made successfully at an early day . // In the appointments of such new officers , and as it seems to us , in the raising of such funds , the governors of the University should not deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They should call into their counsels gentlemen of wisdom from the graduates who are engaged in this profession in other cities and in other states , and should open before them a large and comprehensive plan , which should be worthy of the University and should be calculated , for this very reason , to interest their minds . There are friends of the College also , outside of the legal profession and outside of the number of the graduates , who would give valuable aid and advice , if asked to do so . These persons might well be consulted . Some of them-even in cases where no one had supposed them likely to be interested in this particular department-might become contributors to its prosperity . Very few of them , as we are persuaded , would fail to give encouragement , and thus , new strength for the prosecution of the work . The governing board are unable to perform this duty of themselves in the wisest manner . It is a case where they peculiarly need assistance from others  --  and while they should originate the plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not attempt the accomplishment of the work or even the full maturing of the plan , except in concert with men to whom , in sorn e respects , the things essential to the end in view are more thoroughly known . We may add , in this connection , another suggestion , which may be regarded as of some importance . This department of the University , during a portion of its past history , has suffered in no inconsiderable degree from the fact , that its instructors have been too busily engaged in the practice of their profession . They have , thus , been divided in their thoughts and labors , and have not been able to devote themselves exclusively to the interests of the school . This condition of things has not , indeed , been altogether a matter of their own choice , but a certain necessity has been laid upon them ; yet of the unfavorable effect of it we have had testimony , in past times , from those who were best capable of judging . Now , in the future , we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If professors should be appointed who should give // their time and energies as entirely to the . work of instruction , as those do who are in the Academical and Scientific departments , the prospects of the school would at once be brightened . In our judgment , the former professors fell into an error in this respect . Not , indeed , that they could entirely have escaped the necessity to which we have just alluded , but if they had broken away from it as much as possible , they would have strengthened the school so far that the necessity itself-which was one arising from insufficient funds-would gradually have diminished in its force . A teacher needs to be wholly a teacher-not half given up to the work of a laborious profession and only half to his own employment A man can not be an active pastor , and a professor of Systematic Theology in a Theological Seminary at the same time . No more should he be an active lawyer and a professor of law . At the least , he should mainly be engaged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all things in his view . If we mistake not , it will be essential to the growth of this department in the future , that , in the new arrangements , provision should be made for such exclusive devotion to its interests and work on the part of those who carry on its instruction . The legal business of these professors must be like the preaching work of their colleagues in the theological schoolnot a work codrdinate with that of their special office , but wholly subordinate to it . That a new building for the purposes of the Law School , which we suppose might be erected for a moderate sum , and a very large increase of the library will be necessary to the highest success of the institution , are so evident to all who are familiar with its present condition as scarcely to need any mention here . The present building is inadequate to the wants of the school so soon as its numbers increase , and does not afford it a proper home . Of the importance of books all must be conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other , perhaps , demands reading within its own field , and the University library is not supplied in this department as well even as it is in theology or natural science . But these wants will be supplied so soon as funds are secured for the purpose , and in urging the increase of funds we have , in reality , urged the impor // tance of securing these immediate and natural results of such in crease . The points , which we have now suggested , will bold good , in a considerable measure , with reference to the Medical Department also , though here there is already provided a building sufficient for its present wants . The Medical School , however , differs widely from the Law School in one important respect . Its chairs of instruction are filled , and its officers constitute a body of men who can encourage and strengthen one another ip their work far better than those can , who are fewer in number and who feel that some of the important places are still vacant . But if the teachers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pressing employments outside of the school , and so have the opportunity of watching more constantly over its interests , it can scarcely be doubted that great advantages would be secured . We think the aim should be to have-at the earliest practicable day-some men in the institution who shall be wholly given to the science , while others mingle with the scientific the practical element , in their daily work , so that the students can derive the full benefit of both . There is one unfavorable circumstance in the size of the city where this University is located , as bearing upon the Law and Medical departments , and especially upon the latter . It is that the opportunities for observing and becoming familiar with the practice of the professions are greater in the great cities of the country . Especially is this true with regard to the work in hospitals . It may be that this fact may always give larger numbers of students to schools established in those cities . And yet it may be questioned whether-even with regard to these schools-it will not prove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful in which the best instruction and the best opportunities of study are given . These , however , are advantages which , as we have already seen , are found in connection with a University , rather than anywhere else . Already , if we are not in error , the plan for medical instruction is a more thorough one in the school here , than has yet been adopted in other places ; and , if it is well carried out , it can not fail to be successful . The day is approaching when the system of cramming // students of this science with six lectures a day , following each other in six successive hours , and , after two courses of this kind of sixteen weeks , tnrning them out upon the world to exercise their art , will meet as universal condemnation as it deserves . But when it does come , those schools will be recognized as worthy of credit and support , where another and more reasonable system has been established , and students will come to them for an education . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rapidly-growing city , and will secure to itself steadily , as it goes forward , the peculiar advantages of larger towns . We believe , therefore , that , with wisdom in the selection of instructors and with proper energy in the carrying forward of the work of the institutions both within and without , these two schools may take and hold a very prominent place in the future , as they , unquestionably , have done in the past . It must be remembered that , in certain important lines , very little determined effort has been put forth in the past . No one can be justified , therefore , in refusing to believe in success , until such effort shall have been made and shall have failed . It never has failed in the history of any part of the University where it has been even half as persistant as it should have been . It will not fail , hereafter , unless all the lessons of experience are worthless . A peculiarity of the Theological Department , which distiiiguishes it from all the others , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its students are limited in their means . Instruction must , therefore , be furnished free of charge , and beneficiary funds must be provided to meet the necessities of the case . The Department needs strengthening at a point , where the other schools can help themselves by reason of fees derived from their pupils . The organization of all our Theological institutions throughout the country has , from the beginning , been arranged with reference to this peculiarity , and we do not see how it can be essentially changed . Indeed , there is a manifest propriety in the present system of things . If the nation educates its military officers at a national academy free of all charge , and supports them while they are in their course of study , and if it does so , not out of charity to them , but because it can not exist without an educated soldiery , surely the Church ought to // do the same thing and for the same reason . A thoroughly educated ministry is a vital necessity to the Christian body . The work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the divinely appointed means of accomplishing the work . It is by preaching that the world is to be saved . The providing of such a ministry , and the securing for them the best possible preparation for their office , should be looked upon , not as a gift of benevolence to the men who are thus educated , so much as a privilege and duty of the Christian Church . The feeling should be just what the feeling of the nation is , and ought to be , toward the school at West Point . Moreover , as the first and highest duty of the followers of Christ is to extend his kingdom , and as those among them who are possessed of abundant means suffer themselves so generally to be drawn away to other and more lucrative employments ,  --  and the direct work of the ministry is , thus , left mainly to those who are poor-there is an obligation of the most sacred character resting upon the richer portion to aid these who take upon themselves the great work . If the wealthier part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this responsibility of preaching the gospel , they should see that those who do assume it for them are provided with all needed means of support . The regarding of this matter as a charity is no proper view of it . It is one of the most important duties of the Church . But if the facts and necessities of the case are thus , every institution for theological education must be greatly dependent for its success on the provision of such funds for the assistance of its students . The institution here needs , at the present time , a special effort for this end . In all these professional schools , as in all departments of the University , the standard of scholarship needs contimi ual advancement . This is a matter of course . It is a work which can never cease , unless the life and power of the University are to die away . Such advancement has characterized the past history , and we believe all those connected with the various schools are earnest in their purpose that it shall , in like manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even more than in the undergraduate departments , it is important , to this end , that the instructors should be men of magnetic and // inspiring character . This most desirable power is a rare one among teachers , as among other men , but it ought to be sought for whenever new appointments are to be made , and every instructor now engaged in his work should cultivate it to the utmost possible extent . We have spoken of it as even peculiarly important in the professional departments , for , in addition to the attractive influence which it gives , it supplies one of the great needs of professional education . The work of the Academical Department is , much more entirely , in the line of drill and mere mental exercise and discipline . It is , also , much more complete within its own limits . But professional education is a thing of a life-time , and the school devoted to it only opens the door to the life-long work . The inspiration of enthusiasm must , therefore , be given to the student at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he comes to be separated from outward helps , a self-propelling force within himself . The instructor who can impart such enthusiasm , inciting the minds of all who come under his teaching to an earnest and unquenchable desire for learning , has accomplished a result which is of greater moment than almost any other that can be thought of . It must not , indeed , be an enthusiasm for the instructor 's own system . The inspiring power loses half its value , or perhaps the whole of it , when this is the end . But it must be an ardent love of learning and truth , in the particular line of study in which he is leading forward his classes . We believe this object can be accomplished more easily in a University than anywhere else , because there the atmosphere of learning is on every side of the student , and the enthusiasms from every department readily concentrate their influences on each individual mind . In regard to that portion of the Scientific School , which may be called " professional , "  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak at the present time ,  --  there are one or two peculiar needs which may be alluded to . This department , from the character of the field which it occupies , requires a much more numerous body of professors than any of the other three which have been mentioned . Provision is , therefore , continually needed for new chairs of instruction , as the subjects of consideration in natural science extend themselves more widely and deeply . The Faculty of Science , if it be full , must , al // most of necessity , be the largest Faculty of the University . At the same time , the wants of this department in the line of apparatus and means of investigation are such as , from the nature of the case , know scarcely any limits . We can not but feel , also , that the Scientific School of this University needs one or more buildings for the accommodation of its students . The question of the desirableness of college buildings , where young men may find their homes during the years of their education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one in regard to which , at present , the advantages of both sides are being tried at Yale College  --  the academical department being provided with such buildings , while the scientific department has , as yet , made no special effort to secure them . Perhaps , this is the wisest course to be followed for a few years to come , until a more perfect and satisfactory trial shall have led to a decision in which all can agree . But the reasons in favor of such buildings , which arise from the friendly associations and the academic esprit de corps which they tend to develop , and , even , from the economy of expense which they occasioii , will , . finally , as it seems to us , overbalance all things which can be urged upon the other side . If a building , or more than one if needed , were now open for the students of the Scientific School , we are assured , from facts which have come to our own knowledge , that numbers of young men , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prevented from entering the s6hool , would find the way of their education made much plainer and smoother . The munificence of one of the liberal and large-minded citizens of New Haven has provided this department with a building well adapted for its public purposes . If others in the city , or the state , should be moved to erect another building , for the purpose which we have indicated , it would be of great advantage to the department , and through it to the whole University . We do not , however , press this point with the same urgency , with which we insist upon the others previously mentioned , because we suppose many of the officers of this school are still , doubtful , respecting its importance . We have not attempted to present all the wants of these various schools . Many of them are thoroughly understood by // those alone who are constantly engaged in their service . Our only design is to set forth some of the more special and leading ones among them . That the opening of the new era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most favorable time for entering upon the work of supplying these wants can scarcely be doubted . Every new crisis in the history of such an institution is a time of peculiar possibilities and peculiar hopefulness . The interest of its friends centres upon it , with a new energy , because it is starting afresh for a further and higher progress . The hour of rich opportunity has come . A work can be done , at such an hour , which might have been beyond the powers of an earlier time , and may even prove to be far more difficult at a future one . If there is delay or haif-heartedness , until it has passed , no one can estimate the measure of the loss . But if heroic earnestness and unselfish devotion seize upon the critical moment , everything will prove helpful to the accomplishment of the end . Such an hour is now dawning upon Yale College . The work which it demands is one which ought not to be deferred . If it is deferred until the hopes and enthusiasm of those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , have died out through disappointment , it may be too late to renew the effort in our generation . There are large numbers of persons , as we believe-persons whose love for Yale College is as warm as could be desired , and whose interest in the College must be one of the chief supports on which it is to rest in the coming years-who desire to see a strong University here . They are graduates of the Academical Department , most of them , and they count it one of the great blessings of their life that they are so . They hope , and trust that this Departmentthe old College , where the four happiest years of youth were spent -- may grow in strength continually and may number , ere long , a thousand students in its classes . But they wish to see the other departments increasing , also , and becoming , in the most complete sense , the coordinate members of one great institution . They believe this change from the College with loosely-attached outside schools into the well rounded and harmoniously developed University to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever favors the accomplishment of this result they hail with satisfaction . Whatever opposes it // they grieve over as a sign of coming evil . It is with the sympathy of all this goodly company , we are sure , that we write , and for the end which in common with them we desire we press the importance of building np , in every way , those departments of the University where the higher and professional studies are provided for . When they have been thus strengthened , their life will react for its highest well-being upon the collegiate department , and the success as well as the fame of the whole institution will be greater than it can be otherwise . The natural development of the plan , with which we entered upon the work of presenting these suggestions respecting the future of Yale College , has brought us , at this time , to speak of these professional schools . The peculiarities in the history of the past , as we stated in our first Article , make it necessary to begin the work of properly developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution , which have had less care and help than others , must now have more than others for a longer or shorter period , until all come upon a common level , and then they must have equal attention and equal privileges for all the future . The importance of no one of the schools , in itself is to be more highly estimated than that of each and all of the rest . They are all of equal significance and equ*dly essential to the securing of the highest education in the country . - But , for the moment , some of them have more necessities than others have , and , therefore , they may claim , for the moment , from wise guardians of the common welfare , a more thoughtful consideration and a more earnest working . We do not believe that any unprejudiced person  --  or any most intelligent and far-seeing friend of the University-will fail to assent to what we say . Since we felt ourselves moved , a few months ago , to commence a discussion of this subject , and to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some small measure , the interests of the institution , an event has occurred which , at that time , was still uncertain . The honored scholar who has presided over the College for the last twenty-five years , has announced his decision to resign his office at the ensuing Commencement . This event has determined the commencement of the new epoch in the College history . With the new administration the future // work must begin . The urgency with which all the necessities of the coming time press themselves upon the attention of the friends and authorities of the College , is greater now than it has been . The characteristic and peculiar works of the preceding administrations , since the opening of the present century , have been quite distinct from one another , but equally essential to the progress of the institution . That of the administration which is now drawing to its close , has been of the very highest importance , and it could not have been more admirably accomplished . But there is still another work remaining to be done , and one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the securing of the great end to which we have referred , and which we are aiming to present in this whole discussion-the developing of all the Departments in such a way as to make the irtstitution a wed-formed University . For this work the next administration will have the largest facilities . To this work it is summoned as its highest duty . The men who direct its measures and the man who stands at its head will have a *rave responsibility devolving upon them , but they will have a possibility opening to their efforts beyond what the past has known . If they fail to undertake the work , they will disappoint all hopes and will be unworthy to stand in the same honored line with their predecessors in the offices of trust . If they undertake it and carry it forward to success , they will see the consummation of what the past has labored and waited for during nearly two hundred years .
