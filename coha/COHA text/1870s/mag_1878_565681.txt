ST . GEORGE 'S COMPANY . FOR seven years past Mr. John Ruskin has published monthly a pamphlet letter addressed to the workmen and laborers of Great Britain . In one of the recent numbers of Fors Clavigera ' - as this series of letters is named - he intimates that during these seven years he has been engaged in setting forth principles which are now to have a more manifest declaration in the work of St. George 's Company , a society ordered mainly by Mr. Ruskin , who holds the post of master in it . A review of the letters , then , may show what St. Georne 's Company is , and what Mr. Ruskin is so earnest and persistent about . It may show this , but to the casual reader the letters , taken separately , seem desultory and hap-hazard , as if the author merely wrote down what happened to be uppermost in his mind at the time , with no method or thought for what should follow , letting chance carry the key for him . At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence , containing letters from friends and others to the author , with rejoinders and cominents , and clippings from current newspapers , all intended to emphasize some point in the Fors in hand , or a previous number ; accounts current of St. George 's Fund or Affairs of the Company , with 1 Mr. Kuskin gives in his second letter a comprehensive interpretatiQn of this title , by which the reader is reminded that Fors is the best part of three English words , force , fortitude , fortune , and that Clavigera may mean either club.bearer , key-bearer , copies of Mr. Ruskin 's own expense account . Occasional photographic frontispieces from works of art easily beguile one into thinking that he is in the neighborhood of Mr. Ruskin the critic in art . A still closer examination would disclose discussions of rent , wages , capital , and interest ; comments on the FrancoGerman war and the Paris Commune ; inquiries whether bishops really oversee ; suggestions as to the proper reading of the Bible ; observations upon modern modes of education ; a receipt for Yorkshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Swiss pastor 's pretty story of The Broom Merchant ; passages from Walter Scott 's life ; comments on scenes and characters in Scott , Dickens , and Thackeray ; with many bits of autobiography , and a wide range of minor topics illustrative of the work in hand . One might be pardoned if he failed to see precisely what Mr. Ruskin 's aim has been ; but Mr. Ruskin would not pardon him , or rather he would waste no concern on the casual reader , for he exacts of his readers the tribute of close attention , and has no wish to tell them anything that they can understand without taking trouble . Meanwhile , he has himself , in two or three passages , summed up the main contents of his letters , and or nail-bearer . Each of these three terms being further illustrated by mythology , a body of meaning collects about the phrase which satisfies the reader that no two English words could possibly have served the purpose of the title . // 40 it is quite possible to get from these summaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped itself . The reason for writing the letters is the reason for forming St. George 's Company : it is despair of England as it is , and hope of what it may be if there is only a return to a few simple principles of honor and honesty which prevailed in an older England . These principles he formulates at the close of his second letter : - To do your own work well , whether it be for life or for death . To keep other people at theirs when you can , an ( l seek to avenge no injury . To be sure you can obey good laws before you seek to alter bad ones . Honesty , Friendliness , Obedience , - these are the three words by which he seeks to reform England ; words easily spoken , we may say , yet wrung bitterly from Carlyle and Ruskin , and frothing a little in Tennyson 's Maud . Let us see what practical measures our philosopher offers to a people who pride themselves on their practicalness . He tells them that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , and earth ; three immaterial things alike essential : Admiration , Hope , and Love . They vitiate pure air with foul chemical exhalations , while the horrible nests called towns are little more than laboratories for the distillation into heaven of venomous smokes and smells , mixed with effluvia from decaying animal matter , and infections miasmata from purulent disease ; they have changed every river of England into a common sewer ; they have turned their science to the invention of explosive and deathful instead of blossoming and lifegiving dust . For the immaterial essential things , instead of admiration they have learned contempt and conceit , instinctively hating the good and destroying it ; and for hope the whole spirit is doubting and timid , with no confidence in the future of England ; while in place of loving their neighbors as themselves they have founded an entire science of political economy on the basis of a desire to defraud one 's neighbor , and have driven woman no longer to ask for love or fellowship , but for justice . So ar July , raigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are there any of you who are tired of all this ? Any of you , Landlords or Tenants , Employers or Workmen ? " Are there any landlords , any masters , who would like better to be served by men than by iron devils ? " Any tenants , any workmen , who can be true to their leaders and to each other ? who can vow to work and to live faithfully , for the sake of the joy of their homes ? " Will any such give the tenth of what they have and of what they earn , not to emigrate with , but to stay in England with , and do what is in their hands and hearts to make her a happy En-gland ? " I am not rich ( as people now estimate riches ) , and great part of what I have is already engaged in maintaining art-workmen , or for other objects more or less of public utility . The tenth of whatever is left to me , estimated as accurately as I can ( you shall see the accounts ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best security that English law can give , on Christmas Day of this year , with engagement to add the tithe of whatever I earn afterwards . Who else will help , with little or much ? the object of such fund being to begin , and gradually - no matter how slowly - to increase , the buying and securing of land in England , which shall not be built upon , but cultivated by Englishmen , with their own hands and such help of force as they can find in wind and wave . " I do not care with how many or how few this thing is begun , nor on what inconsiderable scale , - if it be but in two or three poor men 's gardens . So much , at least , I can buy , myself , and give them . If no help come , I have done and said what I could , and there will be an end . If any help come to me , it is to be on the following conditions : We will try to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fruitful . We will have no steamencrines upon it , and no railroads ; we will have no untended or unthought-of // creatures on it ; none wretched but the sick ; none idle but the dead . We will have no liberty upon it , but instant obedience to known law and appointed persons ; no equality upon it , but recognition of every betterness that we can find , and reprobation of every worseness . When we want to go anywhere , we will go there quietly and safely , not at forty miles an hour , in the risk of our lives ; when we want to carry anytbing anywhere , we will carry it either on the backs of beasts or on our own , or in carts or boats ; we will have plenty of flowers and vegetables in our gardens , plenty of corn and grass in our fields , - and few bricks . We will have some music and poetry ; the children shall learn to dance to it and sing it ; perhaps some of the old people , in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover ; we will at least try if , like the Greeks , we ca n't make some pots . The Greeks used to paint pictures of gods on their pots ; we , probably , can not do as much , but we may put some pictures of insects on them , and reptiles ; butterflies and frogs , if nothing better . There was an excellent old potter in France who used to put frogs and vipers into his dishes , to the admiration of mankind ; we can surely put something nicer than that . Little by little some higher art and imagination may manifest themselves among us , and feeble rays of science may dawn for us : botany , though too dull to dispute the existence of flowers ; and history , though too simple to question the nativity of men ; nay , even perhaps an uncalculating and uncovetous wisdom , as of rude Magi , presenting at such nativity gifts of gold and frankincense . * In three months after writing this he is able to say definitely that St. Geor* , e 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been begun by a gift from himself of one thousand pounds ; and with this announcement he gives further detail of the plan : " I will tell you a little more of what we are to do with this money , as it increases . " First , let whoever gives us any be clear in their minds that it is a Gift . It is not an Investment . It is a frank and simple gift to the British people ; nothing of it is to come back to the giver . " But also nothing , of it is to be lost . This money is not to be spent in feeding Woolwich infants with gunpowder . It is to be spent in dressing the earth and keeping it , in feeding human lips , in clothing human bodies , in kindling human souls . " First of all , I say , in dressing the earth . As soon as the fund reaches any sufficient amount , the Trustees shall buy with it any kind of land offered them at just price in Britain : rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what , so it be British ground and secured to us . " Then we will ascertain the absolute best that can be made o* every acre . We will first examine what flowers and herbs it naturally bears ; every wholesome flower that it will grow shall be sown in its wild places , and every kind of fruit tree that can prosper ; and arable and pasture land extended by every expedient of tillage , with humble and simple cottage dwellings under faultless sanitary regulation . Whatever piece of land we begin work upon we shall treat thoroughly at once , putting unlimited manual labor on it , until we have every foot of it under as strict care as a flower garden : and the laborers shall be paid sufficient , unchanging wages ; and their children educated compulsorily in agricultural schools inland , and naval schools by the sea , the indispensable first condition of such education being that the boys learn either to ride or to sail , the girls to spin , weave , and sew , and at a proper age to cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be disciplined daily in the strictest practice of vocal music ; and for morality , to be taught gentleness to all brute creatures , finished courtesy to each other , to speak truth with rigid care , and to obey orders with the precision of slaves . Then , as they get older , they are to learn the natural history of the place they live in ; to know Latin , boys and girls both , and the history of five cities , - Athens , Rome , Venice , Florence , and London . - - . In the history of the five cities I have named they shall learn , so far as 1878. 41 // they can understand , what has been beautifully and bravely done ; and they shall know the lives of the heroes and heroines in truth and naturalness ; and shall be taught to remember the greatest of them on the days of their birth and death , so that the year shall have its full calendar of reverent memory . And on every day part of their morning service shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and part of their evening service a song . of triumph for the fair death of one whose deathday it is an ( l in their first learning of notes they shall be taught the great purpose of music , which is to say a thing that you mean deeply in the strongest and clearest possible way ; and they shall never be tau*ht to sing what they do n't mean . They shall be able to sing merrily when they are happy , and earnestly when they are sad ; but they shall find no mirth in mockery nor in obscenity ; neither shall they waste and profane their hearts with artificial and lascivious sorrow . " One further quotation is desirable , although , as an expansion and more detailed account , it necessarily repeats somewhat the passages already given . It occurs in the first letter of the fourth year . " The children will be required to attend training-schools for bodily exercise and music , with such other education as I havc already described . Every household will have its library , given it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes , - some constant , the others chosen by each family out of a list of permitted books , from which they afterwards may increase their library if they choose . The formation of this library for choice , by a republication of classical authors in standard forms , has long been a main object with me . No newspapers , nor any books but those named in the annually renewed lists , are to be allowed in any household . In time I hope to get a journal published containing notice of any really important matters taking place in this or other countries , in the closely sifted truth of them . " The first essential point in the edu cation given to the children will be the habit of instant , finely accurate , and totally unreasoning obedience to their fathers , mothers , and tutors ; the same prGcise and unquestioning submission being required from heads of families to the officers set over them . The second essential will be the understanding of the nature of honor , making the obedience solemn and constant ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be regarded as a grave breach of trust , and no less disgraceful than a soldier 's recoiling from his place in a battle . . " That it should be left to me to begin such a work , with only one man in England - Thomas Carlyle - to whom I can look for steady guidance , is alike wonderful and sorrowful to me ; but as the thing is so , I can only do what seems to me necessary , none else coming forward to do it . For my own part , I entirely hate the whole business ; I dislike having either power or responsibility ; am ashamOd to ask for money , and plagued in spending it . I do n't want to talk , nor to write , nor to advise or direct anybody . I am far more provoked at being thought foolish by foolish people than pleased at being thought sensible by sensible people ; and the average proportion of the numbers of each is not to my advantage . If I could find any one able to carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself about it more ; and even now it is only with extreme effort and chastisement of my indolence that I go on ; but , unless I am struck with palsy , I do not seriously doubt my perseverance , until I find somebody able to take up the matter in the same mind and ' with a better heart . " The laws required to be obeyed by the families living on the land will be - with some relaxation and modification , so as to fit them for English people - those of Florence in the fourteenth century . In what additional rules may be adopted I shall follow , for the most part , Bacon or Sir Thomas More , under sanction always of the higher authority which of late the English nation has wholly set its strength to defy , that of the founder // of its religion ; nor without due acceptance of what teaching was given to the children of God by their Father before the day of Christ , of which , for present ending , read and attend to these following quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ninth book of Plato 's Republic . In one of his letters , speaking of the doubtfulness which his readers feel of his plan , from its lack of definiteness , Mr. Ruskin says paradoxically that to define it severely would be to falsify it , and that he is wrong even in speaking of it as a plan or scheme at all . " It is only a method of uniting the force of all good plans and wise schemes ; it is a principle and tendency , like the law of form in a crystal ; not a plan . " Accordingly the idea of the company grows with its palpable proportions . For the orderin* , of it there is to he a master ; members , styled companions , who give money or lands , and are enrolled with due solemnity ; and tenants and laborers , styled retainers . As a part of the general purpose a museum has been formed at Sheffield : the beginning has been made of a collection of classics , including thus far The Economist of Xenophon and Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psalter ; ' and a series of photographs , four thus far ( Madonna by Filippo , the Etruscan Leucothea , Madonna by Titian , and Infanta Mar0aret by Yelasquez ) , have been issued for study and admiration in the homes of companions and retainers . Of the financial operations of St. George 's Company the briefest statement is in this : that a debt is a crime , and store a duty ; the store " to be primarily of food , next of materials for clothing and covert , next of books and works of art , - food , clothes , books , and works of art all being good , and every poisonous condition of any of them destroyed . . . . The most simply measurable part of the store of food and clothing will be the basis of the currency , which will be thus consti1 Other books promised are Gotthelf 's Tune the Farm Servant ; a historical work , enigmatically stated as " relating the chief decision of Atropos respecting the fate of England after the conquest ; " the lives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The standard of value will be a given weight or measure of grain , wine , wool , silk , flax , wood , and marble ; all answered for by the government as of fine and pure quality , variable only within narrow limits . The grain will be either wheat , oats , barley , rice , or maize ; the wine of pure vintage , and not less than ten years old ; the wool , silk , and flax of such standard as can be*secured in constancy ; the wood , seasoned oak and pine , and for fuel in log and fagot , with finest wood and marble for sculpture . The penny 's worth , form 's worth , and hundred ducats ' worth of each of these articles will be a given weight or measure of them , the penny roll of our present breakfast table furnishing some notion of what , practically , the grain standard will become . . . . Of these articks the government will always have in its possession as much as may lneet the entire demand of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has a million in circulation , the million 's worth of solid property must be in its storehouses ; as much more as it can gather , of course , but never less . " Regulations follow as to coinage , markets , dress , and ornament , all inspired by the same purpose to secure entire honesty , public and private ; to renard strictly the natural differences of rank , as indicated by the different gifts to men ; and to make life orderly , decent , and beautiful . Finally , this creed or vow , written and signed by every person received into St. George 's Company , may be taken as the spiritual pledge of the new crusade against corrupt England . I. I trust in the Living God , Father Almighty , Maker of heaven and earth , and of all things and creatures visible and invisible . And I will strive to love Him , and keep His law , and see His work , while I live . II . I trust in the nobleness of human nature , in the majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and St. John the Divine , these last not always being complete works , but representing the purest theological truth hitherto known to the Jews , Greeks , Latins , Italians , and English . 1878. 43 // the fullness of its mercy , and the joy of its love . And I will strive to love my neighbor as myself , and even when I can not will act as if I did . III . I will labor , with such strength and opportunity as God gives me , for my own daily bread , and all that my band finds to do I will do with my might . IV . I ' will not deceive , or cause to be deceived , any human being for my gain or pleasure ; nor hurt , or cause to be hurt , any human being for my , ain or pleasure ; nor rob , or cause to be robbed , any human being for my gain or pleasure .

I will strive to raise my own body and soul daily into higher powers of duty and happiness ; not in rivalship or contention with others , but for the help , delight , and honor of others , and for the joy and peace of my own life . VII . I will obey all the laws of my country faithfully ; and the orders of its monarch , and of all persons appointed to be in authority under its monarch , so far as such laws or commands are consistent with what I suppose to be the law of God ; and when they are not , or seem in any wise to need change , I will oppose them loyally and deliberately , not with malicious , concealed , or disorderly violence . VIII . And with the same faithfulness , and under the limits of the same obedience which I render to the laws of my country and the commands of its rulers , I will obey the laws of the Society called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received , and the orders of its masters , and of all persons appointed to be in authority under its masters , so long as I remain a Companion , called of St. George . The information given in Fors Clavigera of the actual working of the company is slight . In April , 1877 , the statement is made that a few of the Sheffield workingmen , influenced by St. George 's notions , asked permission to rent some ground from the company , whereon to spend what spare hours they had in useful labor . Thirteen acres had accordingly been purchased for this purpose , and let out to the workman at a rental of three per cent . on the cost ; a little piece of England , Mr. Ruskin says , given into the English workman 's hands , and Heaven 's . Then , work having been organized at Abbey Dale , a possession of the company , Mr. Ruskin says , very characteristically , in Fors for November , 1877 , that he had been greatly concerned by the difficulties attending this first venture ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributable to very little and very ridiculous things , which , with all my frankness , I see no good in publishing . The root of all mischief is , of course , that the Master is out of the way , and the men , in his absence , tried at first to get on by vote of the majority ; it is at any rate to be counted as no small success that they have entirely convinced themselves of the impossibility of getting on in that popular manner ; and that they will be glad to see me when I can get there . " Interesting as the history of a single case might be , with its practical difficulties , " attributable to very little and very ridiculous things , " no such history is of course possible when the experiment has only just been placed on trial . But the experiment has had seven years of preliminary discussion and theoretical development , and it can not be said that the plan of the company has been presented in altogether vague outline . Nothing could well be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the vow taken by the companions is , with the exception of the last clause , possible to any right-minded man or woman , it is very evident that St. George 's Company does not intend aUtopia but a Kalotopia . Enough , I think , has been taken from Mr. Ruskin 's words to make clear the meaning*which I read in the whole project . It is a protest against corruption of life , public and private , in England , thrown into visible shape by // the formation of an England within an England . The miniature state , whose order has been outlined , contains , it will be noted , all the functions of a state except what refers to international relations ; and that offered now could only serve to throw an air of insincerity over the whole scheme . ' In this state of St. George there is a fixed standard of exchange among the members , coinage is provided for , the wants of the body and soul are held to be the field for governmental administration , a system of laws including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the life of the citizens is regulated by principles discovered in the history of the wisest states and the writings of the wisest men . Mr. Ruskin sees a decadence in English life since the coming in of the Stuart line , apparently , and looks upon the introduction of steam power , with the accompanying exchange of rural for urban life , as the most powerful impulse upon the downward road . He would restore England piece by piece , by reconstructing within her limits communities which should be visible records of a possible England , - an England where lords and squires recovered the rights and duties indicated by their names , and where a contented peasantry lived honorable lives ; where art might be possible in a land no longer resting under the smoke cloud , of innumerable factories , and where religion should be neither blind idolatry of a book nor sleek conformity to concealed worldliness . That kings and all leaders should prove their title by the service which they do ; that every man should live by the labor of his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in idleness ; that the weak , the poor , and the suffering should be a holy charge upon the strong , the rich , and the healthy , these are cardinal points of his belief . What his own conception of the working of his design is may best be learned from the page with which he concludes the fifty-eighth number of Fors Clavigera , the number containing the fullest exposition : - " The ultimate success or failure of the design will not in the least depend on the terms of our constitution , but on the quantity of hivinghonesty and pity which can be found , to be constituted . If there is not material enough out of which to choose companions , or energy enough in the companions chosen to fill the chainmail of all terms and forms with living power , the scheme will be choked by its first practical difficulties ; and it matters little what becomes of the very small property its promoters are ever likely to handle . If , on the contrary , as I believe , there be yet honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from its narrow source there will soon develop itself a vast policy , of which neither I nor any one else can foresee the issue , far less verbally or legally limit it , but in which , broadly , by the carrying out of the primally accepted laws of obedien**e and economy , the master and marshals will become the ministry of the state , answerable for the employment of its revenues , for its relations with external powers , and for such change of its laws as from time to time may be found needful ; the landlords will be the resident administrators of its lands and immediate directors of all labor , its captains in war and magistrates in peace ; the tenants will constitute its agricultural and military force , having such domestic and acquisitive independence as may be consistent with patriotic and kindly fellowship ; and the artists , schoolmen , tradesmen and inferior laborers will form a body of honorably paid retainers , undisturbed in their duty by any chance or care relating to their means of subsistence . " It would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to cover with laughter the man who propounds it . Most persons will dismiss it with the term quixotic , and those who really know what quixotic means will not much quarrel with the term ; for the whole plan springs from the keenest sense of evil rampant , and the honest desire to break a lance in destruction of it . Is 1 It will be obvious to the reader that in case of its principles , only to bows and arrows , swords and war St. George*s company could have recourse , on javelins 1878. 45 // he , by his own confession , " old , tired , and very ill-natured " ? I answer that no man can make his profound sense of human misery and wrongness lead him to the jeered-at task of feeling with his own hands for the root of it , that he may pluck it up if possible , without thereby proving his earnestness and the reality of his conviction . In the midst of scoffing England , bidding him keep to the fine arts and let political economy alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an eccentric visionary , he holds firmly to his resolve , and at times seems to cling to it to save himself from making shipwreck altogether of hope . A fair comparison might be made between Mr. Ruskin and Mr. W. II . Greg , who takes the attitude of Cassandra in his prophecy of England 's decline . ' In Mr. Greg 's opinion the three national dangers are : I. The political supremacy of the lower classes. * II . The approaching industrial decline of England . III . The divorce of the Intelligence of the country from its Religion . Mr. Ruskin might formulate his conception of England 's fall under three similar heads : I. The abrogation of duties by the upper classes . II . The increasing poverty of the country through the enriching of a few . III . The divorce of faith from works , and the loss of the meaning of religion a summed up in the word obedience . With Mr. Greg the taking of representation out of the hands of the propertied class and putting it into the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of which is not yet , and the only remedy which he sees possible is in gradually transmuting this class into capitalists , summing his philosophy in the sentence , " Political power lies naturally with Intellect and Property , and what God hasjoined man can not put asunder with impunity . " With Mr. Ruskin , the position is taken that in human nature itself is an eternal division into leaders and led , masters and servants ; that when the lords of Great Britain are true to their name , and the ladies are loaf-givers , the present blind I See Rocks Ahead ; or the Warnings of cassandra . By W. U. Greg . attempts to set the pyramid of society on its apex will cease , and he will be found ruling who makes himself a servant of all . Mr. Greg sees in the near approach to the exhaustion of cheap coal the doom of British industry ; and , while he recognizes in the deterioration of skilled labor a moral cause of decline , it is evident that the weight of the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of the world 's market he finds no escape , and looks to emigration as but a partial relief from an overburdening population , since it is the able-bodied who will go , the weak and inefficient who will stay . Mr. Ruskin sees in the whole course of modern trade a gigantic evil , yesulting in a selfishness which makes every one eager to get rich through an injury to his neighbor , and in an economic falsehood which makes a national debt a national blessing instead of a national curse ; he rests the strength of England in the toil of its laborers , and holds that these are robbed of their rightful earning of food , clothing , and shelter . He would find a return to contentment and peace in a return to manual labor , in honesty of living , and in the ignobility of luxury . For the third national danger of England , Mr. Greg finds that skepticism of the national creed is rapidly permeating all classes , and dissolving those bonds of spiritual life which are essential to a nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovers is in the gradual reconstruction , by the intelligence which has thrown down , of a new and more credible faith . His divorce of intelligence from religion is to be followed by a new marriage of intelligence with certain dim aspirations , in the hope that religion will be the offspring . Mr. Ruskin , believing that religion is submission to God and his laws , and is discovered by a life of fruitful obedience , is not much concerned about the skepticism which questions a formal theology , but takes greatly to heart the presence of a show of religion which is divorced from morality , and the submission to the decrees of such false gods as he sees worshiped in London and Manchester , while he knows no way of escape 46 July , // from this but such as an old prophet might declare to a recreant Israel . The difference in position between the two men is the difference between a man who speculates with great sagacity upon the state of England , and finds a certain intellectual satisfaction in the inevitability of his reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality that he is compelled to turn away from the things he most enjoys to some visible lifting of the burden , taking up the task lest he should go mad . There is not , there never can be , a test of sincerity but the plain one of doing ; and Mr. Ruskin , though he has been cryin* passionately that the axe is laid at the root of the tree , seems to turn , almost with scorn at his own ineffectual words , to take up the axe himself , striking a blow with a force which is rather nervous than muscular . The eloquence of this writer , and the almost painful precision of his style , - by which he is constantly trying to make his words carry more freight than they ever bore , - his zeal , and the largeness of his intellectual sympathy , carry the reader over many doubtful stretches of logic , and make the entire scheme of St. George 's Company assume an ideal perfectness of proportion and a grace of being which fill the eye as a poetic structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient and modern , as he gradually conceives the image : he hears the Tyrolese peasant sing like a robin ; he watches the wife of Ischomachus ordering her household ; he listens in turn to two Chelsea magi , separate by three hundred years and more ; he catches a glimpse of Sir John Hawkwood and his white knights ; and the dress and coins make Italy and England melt into one . Charge this picture with a profound moral meaning ; believe in it as the harbinger of a new England , not found by crossing the seas , but by a moral cataclysm of the England of the London Times and Pall Mall Gazette , and it is possible that any embodiment in human kind and environment in English fields would catch some of this light that never was on sea or land . But a disillusioniz ing might take place if one were to look closely at some companion piece , not invested with the charm of literature , or flooded by any historic light . There is a grotesque likeness to St. George 's Company in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found scattered about our New England States , and in some Western places . Here one may see the bare prose into which the loveliest of idyls has been turned . I happened to be spending a summer in the immediate neighborhood of one of these villages , and Fors Clavigera coming to me each month I was not slow to place it in the hands of the leader , nor greatly surprised to find it at once accepted as a grateful statement of many articles of the Shaker faith , and read aloud in the gatherings of the brothers and sisters . The keen analysis of usury which I listened to at the Sunday meeting was as final as in Mr. Ruskin 's pages ; the return to nature as the saviour of humanity was the central doctrine of the Shaker life ; the broad farms were the manifest declaration of that redemption of the soil which forms an article in St. George 's creed . Here was no debt , but only store ; steam played no part , but human labor or the action of wind and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , were idle , but the higher-minded looked at this as a loss and decay of the Shaker mind ; perfectness of work and economy of resources were still regarded as religious duties . That this life had done much to lift the human nature which tried it , and was itself tried by it , the honest observer could not doubt ; but if he measured it by the test of Moses , David , ilesiod , Virgil , Dante , Chaucer , and St. John the Divine , he was compelled to admit that the Shakers had not solved the problem of living , and he even suspected that the spiritual exaltation which found expression in rhythmic procession and rude music could not suffice to deliver the company from the suspicion of being worldly-minded after all , and of looking upon their apple-trees and blackberryvines with not altogether an ancient Hebraic sentiment . There are differences , 1878. 47 // to be sure , as well as likenesses to be noted in the two societies . In the Shaker family , there is the mildest possible form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of pure democracy ; in St. George 's Company , there is the fullest recognition of ranks and orders ; in both , education is jealously guarded , but the Shaker family knows nothing of that choiceness of wisdom and example which the founder of St. George 's Company offers in place of current literature and science . Yet the fatal error attaches to both , that with all their professions of trust in human nature the societies are founded on a practical distrust . Is human nature so poor . a thing that it can be hedged about and its processes predetermined by such inflexible organizations as these ? The assumption in each case is that men are children , and will continue such , and growth must constantly " put out " the well-ordered schemes . An observer of the Shaker families perceives how uneasily the women and elders watch the boys and girls who stand on the brink of conscious manhood and womanhood , and with what frequent pain they see them bid adieu to the family just when they give promise of becoming pillars to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls the institution of slavery in our own country : the ideal excellence of that order was in the careless , child-like condition of the slaves , the protecting , determining government of the masters , with their chivalrous education and generous life . Yet somehow this relation was constantly disproved by the ungrateful disappearance of slaves and the unchivalric conduct of masters . The ideal St. George pins the dragon with his lance , but Mr. Ruskin 's St. George sometimes appears to be armed with a fork , vainly endeavoring to expel , not a dragon , but Nature herself . It must be said , too , that in their organization both of these societies are fragments - and not constituents - of a body politic . The Shakers are witnesses , as they believe , to a future state of single blessedness , and by an irresistible logic they have no part in the family or the state which God created . St. George 's Company is a protest against a corrupt England ; it mimics a greater state , and it has partial foundations in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is not founded in the whole nature of man ; its integrity could only be preserved by isolation , and shut up within itself it would die of exhaustion . By a divine paradox it could only perpetuate itself by destroying itself in the larger life of the nation . Mr. Ruskin is building an ark against the deluge to come , and we are all laughing him to scorn . That is one way of regarding it . But it is quite possible for students of history and of revelatio*i to believe that nations have their holy life , which is unbroken though a prophet may lodge in a cave and complain that he only is left , when altars are thrown down and a covenant forsaken . There is that in Mr. Ruskin 's despair which is heroic ; there is that also which is childish . With an exquisiteness of artistic sense , the power to perceive subtle harmonies of life and the capacity for irritation at ignoble discords go together ; with a tremulous moral nature , inflexibly true in direction , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems racked with the constant trial of cases of conscience . He has no rest from this labor of judgment , and one is puzzled at the d*uble feeling with which one approaches him , - of reverence for his nobility of genius , and of gentle pity for his distraction . He is Hamlet the Englishman . There are few pages in Fors Clavigera , for the reader on this side of the Atlantic , more moving and more lovely in their way than those given to Mr. Ruskin 's autobiographic sketches . I should not wish to touch them in the way even of bringing them together into a connected narrative . Occurring as they do at intervals , they break in upon the discourse with delightful force , and certainly help a stranger to understand something of the author 's training and vicissitudes of life . In one humber there is a touching paragraph called out by a lively , halfirritable letter from a lady who feels the // force of Mr. Ruskin 's pressure upon her conscience sufficiently to lead her to snake excuses . Among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company when Mr. Ruskin himself does . " It seems to me , " she says smartly , " thatthe first duty any one owes to his country is to live in it . I go farther , and maintain that every one is bound to have a home and live in that . Where is your house and your garden ? " Then she reproaches him for wandering away to lovely places in England or on the Continent , while she stays at home a household drudge . To all this Mr. Ruskin replies with the melancholy words : - " She tells me , first , that I have not joined the St. George 's Company , because I have no home . It is too true . But that is because my father and mother and nurse are dead ; because the woman I hoped would have been my wife is dying ; and because the place where I would fain have stayed to remember all of them was rendered physically uninhabitable to me by the violence of my nei* , hbors , - that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and the light I needed to work by . Nevertheless , I have under these conditions done the best thing possible to me , - bought a piece of land on which I could live in peace ; and on that land , wild when I bought it , have already made not only one garden , but two , to match ao-ainst my correspondent 's ; nor that without help from children , who , though not mine , have been cared for as if they were . " In somewhat other terms he lays claim to the name of gentleman . " It is quite possible for the simplest workman or laborer for whom I write to understand what the feelings of a gentleman are , and share them if he will ; but the crisis and horror of this present time are that its desire of money and the fullness of luxury dishonestly attainable by common persons are gradually making churls *if all men , and the nobler passions are not merely disbelieved , but even the conception of them seems ludicrous to the impotent churl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instance of them as my own life - because I have passed it in alms-giving , not in fortune-hunting ; because I have labored always for the honor of others , not my own , and have chosen rather to make men look to Turner and Luini than to form or exhibit the skill of my own hand ; because I have lowered my rents and assured the comfortable lives of my poor tenants , instead of taking from them all I could force for the roofs they needed ; because I love a wood-walk better than a London street , and would rather watch a sea-gull fly than shoot it , and rather hear a thrush sing than eat it ; finally , because I never disobeyed my mother , because I have honored all women with solemn worship , and have been kind even to the unthankful and the evil , therefore the hacks of English art and literature wag their heads at me , and the poor wretch who pawns the dirty linen of his soul daily for a bottle of sour wine and a cigar talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of Fors Clavigera , as I have said , has mainly to do with the ordering of St. George 's Company ; but as that company is not , in Mr. Ruskin 's intention , an arbitrary or wholly isolated guild , having peculiar laws and customs inapplicable to simple people elsewhere , in England or out of it , the explication of the principles at its foundation is broad and variously suggestive . From the wide range of his reading in literature , art , history , and religion , the author has gathered a remarkable store of wisdom and generous example . His running commentary , for example , on Sir Walter Scott 's life , character , and work is full of fine interpretative power ; his readings from Plato , from Sir Philip Sidney , from Marmontel , his inquiry into Biblical meanings , are of quite unusual force , provoking the student to fresh examination of familiar words ; and nothing wiser , respecting the education of girls , has been written in this generation of schoolmasters and school-mistresses than the sixty-fifth and sixty-sixth letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in separate form as J4etter to Young Girls . 1878. 49 // dinary series without finding his mind quickened as to the application of eternal principles to the conditions of present civilization . That he will recoil from some of Mr. Ruskin 's conclusions is inevitabler partly from his own unpreparedness , partly from a mental waywardness characteristic of the writer ; but he will never find concession to falsehood or infidelity to truth . To us on this side of the Atlantic the letters come shorn of some immediate force by reason of the different conditions of life here , but with an added weight by reason of a possibly wider application . That is to say , the conditions of life in England which have wrung the letters and the resolution from Mr. Ruskin are not as yet reproduced here ; we have tendencies toward what he regards as fixed facts in England . The larger breathing space , the truer respect for law , the firmer establishment of a liberty that can not choose evil , the wider charity , and above all the freer hope , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these elements make us look with some wonder upon the picture which he draws of English misery . Nor are the principles laid down in Fors Clavigera so foreign from habits of thought familiar to Americans . The despotism of trade and the selfishness of a cruel competition have not yet degraded the common mind here to so great an extent as in England , and the difference in training which the American and English public mind receives renders the American more receptive of classic and generous ideas . An American traveling , for instance , in England might easily accept Mr. Ruskin 's measure of Englishmen , accounting for what might seem extravagance by the better knowledge which a resident must have , but himself discovering the existence of the same evil in a less portentous form . On his return to his own country he would not be less aware of the incompleteness of the national character , but he would at once acknowledge joyfully that he had come to a land of larger hope and brighter skies . Still , to us who have not the frequent opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ruskin 's strictures upon modern civilization strike with real force by the suggestion they have of evils immediate and visibly present . For my own part I can see processes going on in the neighborhood of our great cities entirely answering to the severest of his denunciations . It is not difficult to discover the beginning of evil which it will be a weary work hereafter to overturn . To take the nearest example , the river Charles , offering small inducements to great commercial enterprises , ought to be the silver thread , shining with its lovely windings , all through a district rapidly growing in population . Efforts are making , against strong currents , to preserve this precious stream . Yet see what one *r two men can do to destroy its beauty ! Not far from the seat of the University , the river makes a turn around a tonc , ue of land , and flows past what was once a lovely piece of river-bank . The ground rose in a little bluff overhan , , ing the marshy rim of the water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest point little clumps of fir-trees . It was bought as a speculation , the trees cut down , the hill leveled , great gashes made in the slopes , and now what might always have been a delight to the eye is a level piece of gravel , with scarcely a sign of vegetation . The gravel , I am told , was sold for more than the land cost , and the owners have been complimented on their prudence and sagacity ; but no arithmetical calculation can estimate the loss which I and many more have suffered who used to cross the bridge at that point , climb over the little knoll , watch the river at our feet , and walk down the grassy slope . Now , as I stroll along the bank , further up , and see the broad meadows which skirt the river , I think that something remains , for these meadows , covered with water at high tide , are as yet unprofitable to the speciAator . But I have the dread of seeing in my paper , some day , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilize the flats by making them the place of amphibious manufactories , belching forth smoke , and // 61 fouling the river with their chemical waste . I doubt not that there are many timid people like myself , who find it hard to look on and see our cities spreading desolation about them . To such I commend these letters of Mr. Ruskin ; at least they speak our thoughts with a consolatory vengean*ce . For weightier reasons , it could be wished that letters so irritating as these to a comfortable nature , so stimulating to all who would measure the thoughts of the time by noble standards , might be more generally known and studied . They have been caught at here and there by foolish people , eager only to find high authority for their own crude notions respecting labor , and the half - concealed truths in them distorted for partisan ends ; they merit wider recognition and more fruitful application . If there are vagaries in them , these will be discovered and lightly dismissed only by those capable of discovering the enduring thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
