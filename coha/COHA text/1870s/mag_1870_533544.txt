Tue Gods of Wo Lee . THE GODS OF WO LEE . W 0 LEE has many gods , and , after a strange fashion , his life is largely a life of worship . Some of his gods are creatures of wrath and hot blood and vindictiveness ; for these he makes great show of respect , and to them he offers much incense and many prayers . Others are noted for their love and mercy and kindness ; with these he gets along easily , and they readily forgive or overlook his worst misdeeds and saddest shortcomings . The good spirits do n't like to harm a man ; and , therefore , if worship is inconvenient or burdensome , one may somewhat omit or neglect his service to them : the bad spirits are looking out for chances against men ; and therefore , and at whatever of cost or hazard , they must be supplicated and kept in good humor by presents and attentions . This , in brief , is about the sum of what one hears in San Francisco as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way , that he spends much time in the ceremonies of worship , that his religion curiously enters into the warp and woof of his daily life , - this is soon seen by every careful observer . I am not certain that the American mind can either apprehend or comprehend Chinese religion or Chinese theology . The more I inquired into their religious system , - if indeed they have a system , - the more I found it full of riddles and intricacies and contradictions . The traveller may write of forms and ceremonies from the outside , but we shall know little of their meaning and significance till some one writes of them fully from the inside . Kwan Tae is the god of war , and his images are numerous in the Chinese Quarter of every city or town on the Pacific slope . One of the puzzles of the Chinaman is , that though peaceable and inoffensive to a remarkable degree , he dearly loves the show and noise and bustle of conflict . The banners and implements of war abound in his temples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a terrific contest in which actors are wounded and slaughtered by wholesale . Looked at in one light , it did not seem strange to find Kwan Tae so popular among Wo Lee and his kinsfolk ; the laws of California do not recognize their rights , and if I were a Chinaman I think I should assiduously cultivate the favor and protection of this mighty god of war . He is the first of the Chinese gods with whom most Eastern visitors to the Golden Gate make personal acquaintance . He is the patron of Ning Yung , one of the Six Companies , and has a temple on Broadway wholly to himself . This is easy of access from any of the hotels , and is the J oss-house to which strangers are generally taken or directed . On one of my visits there I had for company a very intelligent Chinese gentleman , and during the afternoon he told me the story of this divinity . Kwan Tae lived about sixteen hundred years ago . In the early part of his life he was a soldier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in battle . Other men frequently had bad luck , but he mostly had good luck ; other men sometimes suffered defeat , but he generally gained victories . He was a person of great individual prowess , and not " Go ! " but " Come ! " was his usual word of command . He was , withal , kind and merciful , as well as valorous , and overcame enemies by deeds of manly love no less than by deeds of martial might . The wars being over , he resigned his position in the army . The Emperor counted him among his friends and relatives , and offered him some honorable station in the civil service ; but Kwan Tae declined this , 1870. // 470 joined the order of Devoted Brothers , and gave himself to works of religious benevolence . The qualities of mind and heart that had made him so notable a figure in the army soon advanced him to a leader 's place in the charitable Brotherhood , and for many years he was one of the foremost men in the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suffering . But war caine again , and with it a long train of disasters to the reigning soyeri*ign . Kwan Tae kept aloof for many months , but finally , moved alike by duty and desire , offered his services , and was put in command of a large army . His old luck still prevailed , and where he went there also went victory , so that he became everywhere known and respected as a great soldier and chieftain . It was his fortune at length to meet the forces directly under the head of the rebellious movement , and him he routed as he had before routed inferior officers and smaller armies . War once more ended , Kwan Tae retired to his home to resume the badge of the Brotherhood and live out his days in quiet and honor . There came to him one day a man ragged and wounded , and in the last extremity of illness and distress . He did not know the Brother , but was recognized by him as the leader of the late revolt , for whom the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at first minded to seize and surrender him , but chose rather to take him in and feed him , and clothe him , and nurse him , and bind up his wounds , and set him on his feet , and secrete money in his purse , and send him on his way rejoicing . Then he put his house in order , presented himself to the Emperor , told the story of what he had done , adjudged himself guilty of treason , and cheerfully submitted to instant death . And for more than a thousand years he has been the Chinese god of war . Seen at the Broadway temple , he sits on a high dais , under a silken and golden canopy , with scymitar and battle-axe near , and has a red face , great black eyes , high forehead , and long black mustache , - on the whole , not a bad looking god , as Chinese gods average . The gods are numerous as the wants of man . In my inquiries I heard of these : the god of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire ; the god of wealth ; the god of trouble ; the god of rain ; the god of the evil eye ; the god of the earth ; the god of wisdom the god of the forests ; the god of long life ; the god of the bad heart ; the god of medicine ; sixty gods for the sixty years of the grand cycle ; the goddess of child-bearin* the goddess of navigation ; the goddess of mercy , who is also the goddess of children , and sometimes has the form of a man ; the queen of heaven ; and the queen of the underworld , who seems to be one with the god of the bad heart . Probably there are many other gods and goddesses , but this list was quite as large as I could well manage in one tour of investigation . Each of the gods has a history , though I heard of no other one so interesting as that of Kwan Tae . The god of medicine is IKwa Toi : he was a great scholar , two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went about among the poorer classes . On one occasion a sick peasant , to whom he had given the wrong remedy , died of his treatment ; whereupon Kwa Toi , as an act of expiation , and to teach other doctors carefulness , said his prayers and then killed himself . Kwan Yin is the goddess of mercy : she was a nice young woman who ran away from home to avoid a disagreeable marriage , took refuge in the house of a religious sisterhood , was there nursed and protected , and had such efficacy in prayer that everybody escaped when the building was burned by her enraged father . Raised after her death to the dignity of a goddess , she was , when I saw her , a damsel with bare feet , a pensive face , and a babe in her arms . My Chinese friend said that she is carried in processions at the feast of All-souls , and looks after spirits in the other world who are neglected // by friends in this . The earthly lives of several other gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and victories do not appear to be worth repeating . The Chinese in California have no regular day for religious services . Our Sabbath they observe as a general holiclay : then the barbers and the market-men and the opium-dealers and the eating-houses do a driving business ; and if the day be fair , the stranger in the Quarter will have a view of joyous and careless and exuberant life that he can not soon forget . There are festivals for one or another of the gods on nearly a third of the days in the year , but only a few of them require universal observance on the part of the people . The temples are open continually , and can be engaged for the day or the hour by any one wishing service . There are no priests or public teachers , but the bods are severally waited on by a number of attendants . The decorations of the temples are unique and not easy to describe . The image is generally in a niche or recess , on a platform about four feet high . The altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the sacred fire , - a lamp kept forever burning ; on it are tall , Jender candlesticks , with copper vessels in which incense and offerings are burned . On each side of the room is the row of " eight holy emblems , " - staves six or seven feet long , with a fan *nr an axe or a knife at the upper end . In one of the rear corners is a bell or a gong , with which the attention of the god may be attracted . There are numerous tablets fastened to the walls and ceilings , made of wood , four or five feet long by fifteen or twenty inches wide , mostly red or yellow in color , covered with Chinese letters which may be sentences of thanks or praise , or lines from some of the classics . In one temple is a stove , wherein are burned pictures of whatever one would like to send to the dead . Banners of strange device greatly abound . There are rich vases for flowers ; bronze lions or dragons to watch by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers printed on yellow paper ; chandeliers glittering with cut glass ; canopies and curtains of gorgeous silk ; the god 's great seal of authority ; cloths with fantastic birds worked in gold thread ; slabs of bronze , with hundreds of small human figures in bass-relief ; carvings of wood that no white man can understand ; scrolls with notices and injunctions to visitors ; cups in which divining-slips are kept ; bundles of incense-sticks like pipe-stems for size* fra*rant sandal-wood tapers , and b through the room a languid odor of foreign lands . The worshipper brings in his offering of rice or fruits or dressed chicken , places it on the altar , lights the tapers and his incense of some strongly scented mixture , and then drops on his knees and inaudibly recites his prayers while the attendant strikes half a ( lozen blows on the bell or gon* . As he did so at my first visit , I thought of Elijah and the propliets of Baal : " Cry aloud ; either he is talking , or he is on a journey , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee worships in his own way and at his own pleasure such of the *ods as he chooses to adore . If he is in bad luck , he goes to the temple and prays for good luck ; if his business prospers , he goes there and renders thanks ; he asks for guidance in new undertakings ; he makes prayers for the recovery of friends from illness he brings offerings for a safe journey to his old home ; he puts up a tablet of praise when he arrives from shipboard ; he burns incense on the death of his children ; he seeks counsel from the gods when he is in distress ; he presents wine and fruits after escape from calamity ; he bows down and iraplores help against his enemies ; he beats his head on the floor before Kwan Tae when the courts refuse him protection . He ascribes frowns and favors , troubles and blessings , joys and sorrows , to the higher powers ; and his whole round of yearly life is interfused with the forms and dignities and ceremonials of religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hearts , and his pomps frivolous or blasphemous in our eyes ; but in such light as he has he walks , with ready and sincere acknowledgment of human dependence on superhuman aid and mercy . His precepts are moral and kindly precepts ; the adornment of his house is a salutation of good-will ; he respects old age , and keeps green the memory of the wise fathers ; the lessons of his youth taught him to look upward , and in his mature years he does not forget this teaching . Such we shall find him to be when we really begin the work of trying to Christianize him , - a man of great faith in superior intelligence , but almost immovable in devotion to many gods whereto he can give visible form and body ; of high reverence for powers and abilities greater than those of earth , but materialistic in all his conceptions , and blind to our ideas of Christ and the Father . He is a great believer in spirits , particularly in those with an evil disposition . His upper-world is peopled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Numbers of his kinsfolk are professional devil-killers , and their services are often in demand to rid houses of these unwelcome visitors . During my stay in California a dwelling at Sacramento became infested , and thereby ensued a high commotion in the Chinese Quarter . The exorcist or devilkiller was summoned , and four or five hours of hard work slew or drove out the evil spirits . He burned incense before the family or household god , and fervently repeated many and diverse prayers ; he mouthed numerous curses , wrote them with red ink on yellow paper , burned them on a porcelain plate , and stirred the ashes into a cup of water . He filled his mouth with this holy water , took a stout sword in one hand , and in the other held an engraved bit of wood weighty with virtue for the overthrow of demons . Then he stamped up and down the rooms in a vigorous manner , thrusting and brandishing his sword , holding aloft his magic wand , spurting water from his mouth in every direction , commanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howling and cursing and fighting , till the police hustled through the awed and excited crowd , swooped down on the magician , decided straightway that the devils were all in him , and so carried him , panting and exhausted , to the watch-house , there to ) meditate on the ways of the Melican man , and renew himself for further fearful encounters with the evil spirits that vex the good Chin aman 's peace and happiness . My Oriental friend 's religion has a considerable element of superstition . His almanac is filled with lucky and unlucky days . He sees signs and omens in everything . The god sgive him a convenient excuse whenever he wants to break an engagement or evade a disagreeable duty . He has ivory pieces and silver rings and sandalwood blocks for charms . He carries coins and bones in his pockets or tied by a string round his neck as guards against evil influences . He finds token of bad luck or good luck in the most common occurrences of every-day life ; He is frightened at the appearance of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular day and a southerly breeze on another particular day . There is disaster in clouds of a peculiar form and color , and promise of good in the crackling of a fire or the flaming of a lamp . Calamity is hidden on every hand , and the gods or devils must continually be propitiated . Events are forecast by lottery , and decided by divination . In the temple of Kwan Tae one afternoon I was anxious to know my chance for a safe journey homeward over the Pacific Railroad . I took up the cup of spiritual sticks , shook it well , and then drew out one of them ; it was numbered , and the attendant turned to the corresponding number in his big yellow-leaved book of fortune and gave me this answer : " The gods prosper the man of upright ways . " It was impossible to evade my fate , and I came home without accident of any kind . Sun King said I ' // could have my life mapped out for a year by going to one of the fortunetellers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my hair . There was a cellar down in Jackson Street where a fee of five dollars would give me an interview with the shade of Miles Standish or Cotton Mather ; and three doors nearer to Dupont Street was a man who could write me a correct history of my doings ten years backward or twenty years forward , and in commiseration for my inferiority of race would do it for nothing too ! I saw an astrologer of long heard and sinister face , for whom it was vouched that he could compel the stars to tell the date of any coming event ; and my friend said that before deciding on the proposal to go into partnership with me as a dealer in tea and rice , he must consult the gods on three successive days . One of my miscellaneous acquaintances was a doctor , Kim XVoon by name , office in Sacramento Street . He was a neatly built fellow , forty or fortyfive years of age , who looked as if he could , if he would , a tale unfold of hidden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant morning , and the room was so dingy and sombre and sepulchral that all the joy and delight of life at once went out of my heart . It was hard work to keep from being sick on the spot . The den was eight or ten feet square , with a shelf of a dozen books in one corner , a table and two or three stools , a collection of drugs and leaves and grasses on an upturned box , and a faded window-curtain that shut out three fourths of the sweet sunlight . If I were a Chinaman and had come for consultation , he said , he would feel of my several pulses , look at my tongue , retire to his inner room , locate my disease , give me medicine , and regulate my diet . I learned , on further inquiry , that he had a remedy for every possible ailment , that his specialty was diseases of the head , that in many cases he sought advice from the gods , that for the benefit of liberal customers be sometimes made The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the duration of sickness often depended upon the will and power of evil spirits , that he could occasionally conjure away a symptom not to be reached by medicine , and that a man has need to be careful how he offends the gods , be cause diseases are frequently the result of their vengeance . After this statement of the peril in which we ever live , I found it more agreeable to talk with Kim Woon in front of his office on the sidewalk . He and his fellow-doctors do n't know much about medicine as a science . Of anatomy they have little knowledge , and of the circulation of the blood they are wholly ignorant . If one of them . were to treat me for a felon , he would probably give me one thing to act on the swollen finger , and another to drive* the first down through my arm to the - seat of disease . They use many herbs and roots and grasses and metallic preparations , and all in such quantities that one wonders how a man can live* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their remedies are as unique as their methods of practice* . Such things as bugs , snails , worms , . snakes , dog 's blood , crushed bones , ashes of burned teeth , the claws of cats , the hoofs of horses , hair from a. cow 's tail , entrails of various animals , skin from the feet of fowls , parings of* the toe - nails , and a hundred others that could hardly be named here , are in constant demand and thought to be of great virtue . The doctors have a theory that , while some diseases must be driven out , others may better be coaxed out . They curiously mix religion and medicine , talk about good luck and bad luck , speak of the ill-will of the gods and the influence of wicked spirits , and for the most part seemed to me to hold their places by practising on the credulity or superstition of their patients . The intelligent and cultivated class of Chinese discard their own doctors entirely , and in case of serious illness invariably call an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is // 474 at once placed on the ground or floor , so that his several distinct souls may have an opportunity to withdraw and enter upon their new stage of transmigration . It is then covered with a vhite cloth , - white , and not black , being the Chinese color of mourning , and large quantities of provisions are set near for the refreshment of the dead man 's spirit and other spirits supposed to be waiting to conduct it away . The undertaker told me that the cries and howls of the real and hired mourners at this stage of the burial ceremonies are most doleful ; he had been present on many occasions , but even yet felt some nervousness when brought into the mourning-room . One thing a Chinaman must have if possible , - a strong and elegant coffin . Frequently the funerals there is a great beating of gongs and shooting of fire-crackers ; this is to keep off bad spirits , and remind the gods that another soul has departed , and will need attention in the upper-world . Scraps of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road to the cemetery : these are propitiatory offerings to the gods of evil disposition for permission to bury the dead in peace and safety . Clothing of various kinds is put into the coffin , as are also at times cups or small baskets of rice and fruits for the soul 's long journey . At the grave there are further supplies of food and drink , and things which it is supposed the spirit may want are burned in flames kindled with holy fire from the temple . The officers of the Six Companies report that about eleven thousand of their countrymen have died in the United States , and that over six thousand bodies have already been sent back to China for final burial , while many more would be forwarded this winter and spring , prior to the great feast for the dead . Two of us had some talk with an educated Chinaman about this custom of sending home the remains of those who die here . It appears to rest on the belief that spirits constantly need earthly care and attention ; that they love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be forgotten or overlooked if that is left in a strange land , among people not holding the Chinese view of the relation between the dead and the living . The Chinaman wishes , therefore , to be buried among his friends and ancestors , and religion and sentiment alike lead him to make provision for his body after death as well as before death . It is not necessary that the fleshy integument shall mingle with the soil of home , and , as a fact , in most cases only the bones of persons are removed to the ancestral grounds . Many men enter into arrangements with their Company or associates as soon as they arrive here for the return of their bodies , and obligations of this kind are held to be as sacred as any that one can assume . In the earlier days of the immigration , provision for final burial at home was made by everybody ; but a change of doctrine is taking place , and now one finds a considerable number of persons who are content to have their bodies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of removal will go on for years , but the belief in its religious necessity is likely to disappear when our laws and customs permit the Chinaman to establish his permatient home under the stars and stripes . The great religious festival of the Chinese year is that of Feeding the Dead . It is a movable feast , but always occurs in the spring , and generally near the end of our month of March . On that day the whole Chinese population of the Paci*c slope suspends work . Then , as Wo Lee devoutly believes , the gates of the other world are set wide open , so that spirits of every age and condition may revisit the earth and enjoy the society of friends still in the body . Then the incense of thanksgiving is burned , and flowers tenderly and profusely laid upon every grave . Then tapers are lit at the tombs with fire from the temples , prayers of joy and penitence are offered to all the gods , while flame and // smoke pass over to the spirits great quantities of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese Quarter of San Francisco is temporarily transferred to the hills of the suburbs , and all classes go to the cemeteries with baskets and boxes and carts and wagons full of meats and fruits and wines . The observance of the day has its comic side , to be sure , as many other strange customs have ; but Americans capable of looking at the ceremonies in a catholic *pirit speak of them as being extremely touching and beautiful . The social festivals are numerous , but , so far as I learned , not more than four or five of them are universally observed . These are New-Year 's , the harvest moon , All-souls-day , the feast of lanterns , and the winter solstice . New-Year 's is the great festival . It occurs near the end of our month of January , - this year on the 30th , and last year on the ioth of February . Then all business matters are adjusted , all accounts settled , quarrels reconciled , feuds healed ; as far as possible the old must be finished ere the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the temples , offerings of food and drink are presented to the gods , incense is burned before the shrines of the dead , fire-crackers are exploded by the wagon-load , the red of joy is everywhere displayed , and tea and wines and fruits and sweetmeats are set out in profusion for all visitors . The feast of the harvest moon is more generally kept in the country and the villages than in San Francisco ; it lasts two or three days , brings business to the astrologers , much gathering of persons out of doors , many civilities to strangers , thank-offerings to the gods , great slaughter of pigs and chickens , and is in some respects not unlike our Thanksgiving day . The feast of All-souls is for the special benefit of spirits who have no living friends , and were not , therefore , provided for in the grand religious festival of March or April . It usually falls in the month of August . There is a procession in which 475 images of certain gods are carried , and a generous display in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *lothing and such other things as are either left at graves or burned in cemeteries at the annual Feeding of the Dead . On this as well as on all other occasions when meats are offered , what is not eaten by the gods or spirits may he put into the family larder for home consumption . It is useless trying to corner a Chinaman by asking if he believes that the spirits can eat and drink : he answers that there is more in the leg of a fowl than human eyes can see or human palates taste , and that his duty is at least done in cooking and presenting the best of what he has for the support of existence . When Wo Lee comes to dwell with us , we shall have to consider his religious views and his festal customs , but his desire for amusement will hardly give us either trouble or serious inconvenience . After a quaint fashion he greatly enjoys his holidays , but he is altogether too grave a man for anything like national sport . His ear for the concord of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may properly doubt if he has any ear at all . There are singing women in his gambling-sb ops , but he rarely concerns himself with the question whether their warblin* is good or bad . He drops into his theatre occasionally , sits patiently through the long play , and then walks off with the air of one who has killed time rather than found delight . He is a social fellow , and somewhat given to going in crowds , but mostly chooses the mild excitement of a quiet chat over a pot of weak tea , or with a good pipe and plenty of tobacco . If he opens a place of amusement in Boston or New York , we may visit it sometimes to see his neat and curious juggl ery , but if those at San Francisco are to be taken as a model , two or three evenings a year of his regular theatrical performances will be about as much as any of us can endure . He is a tireless and an inveterate gambler ; and when he comes Eastward The Gods of Wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . A white man finds it difficult to get into the San Francisco establishments . One is mucl* like all the others , - a small entry on the street , in which sits the watchman , a door from that into a hall , and another door from the hall into the house . This is a room with bare Boor and low ceiling , a narrow counter at the rear for the manager or book-keeper , and behind him a bit of a platform *vhereon lounge the two or three women who furnish the music of the evening or afternoon . Whenever I stopped at the street door as if about to enter , the guard came forward with forbidding gestures , and " Go way-ee ; you not come-ee here ; go way-ee . " I tried it a dozen times , and always with the same result ; he would not allow me to even look into the hall , fearing , as I afterward discovered , that I might be a spy from police head-quarters . I went where I pleased while in the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by persuading a well - known Chinese gentleman to introduce me and vouch . for my character . Wo Lee bets often , but not high ; he stakes his last piece of money on the chance of doubling it or going supperless ; he often consults the fortune-tellers for luck , and even goes to the temple and tries to find out the winning numbers by aid of the spiritual slips . Chinese gambling has about as much interest for a looker-on as the odd-oreven game of school-boys ; in fact , it is little more than a variation of that famous game of our childhood . The gamblers sit or stand around a table covered with matting or oil-cloth , on which a black square is plainly marked . In one or two houses there was a small sheet of lead or zinc in place of this painted square . The banker sits behind the table , with gold and silver in a drawer , and on the matting a heap of cask , - a brassy coin of small value , in size like our twenty-five cent piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this heap the banker takes a handful , lays it on the square , and partly or wholly covers it with a brass or pewter bowl . The players simply bet whether this pile under the bowl will count out odd or even on fours . One lays his money down on whichever side of the square he chooses , and the dealer , with a pointed stick , eighteen or twenty inches long , rapidly counts the cask , drawing toward himself four coins , then four more , and so on until the last four have been drawn out . If the count is even , each player receives four times the amount of his stakes ; if three coins remain , the one whose money lies on the third side of the square gets three times his bet , and the bank takes what lies on the other three sides ; and if two only remain , the second side wins double and the others lose , - the winner always paying the bank a small percentage of what he has gained by way of commission . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of no other game played by the Chinese in any of the shops . That the Chinese are much given to the smoking of opium everybody well understands . In the stores of the Quarter at San Francisco and elsewhere , jars of opium are displayed as jars of snuff are in the stores of the Southern States . There are smokingdens just as there are gambling-dens and barbers ' shops , though my efforts to get into one were not successful . The Chinese of San Francisco pay duty on near thirty thousand pounds of the drug yearly , and probably manage to smuggle in half as much more without paying the duty . The shrewdness of the custom-house officials is taxed to the utmost to detect the tricks of smugglers , and some of those that have been exposed showed a wonderful knack for disguising the precious commodity . Thus in one case a box of common medicinal roots proved to be worth thousands of dollars ; it was opium , drawn or moulded into roots or fibres , then dried and colored and scented . I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever smoked opium he resented the inquiry as a // 477 well-bred American lad would resent the question whether he was in the habit of getting drunk . He and many other Chinamen told me that opium-smoking was disreputable ; that it was not pleasant to the gods ; and that habitual or intemperate smokers are not admitted into the best circles of their people . Numbers of leading merchants seemed anxious to impress this fact upon my attention , that the custom does not revail among the refined classes , but is deplored and condemned as strongly by them as by Americans . This is something fine to say of a irntion , - every man can read and write his own language . And of the Chinese on our Western shore this can almost be said . Yet they are heathens and we are Christians It will not hurt us to recall this fact , when we feel overmuch inclined to boast of our superior civilization . The Chinese have nearly made education universal : we have not . " Learn , learn , - learn all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech to some Sunday-school children ; " knowledge and virtue go together , and no people can have too much of either . " These are the words of one who appreciates the day and generation in which he lives ; and they speak the sentiment of his people , too . The Chinese children of San Francisco are all instructed in private schools : education is regarded as a solemn religious obligation , for " the gods will not smile upon a people that neglects its children . " Have we anything of doctrine higher than that ? The Chinese Sunday schools are not specially schools of religious instruction . The largest one in San FranCisco has been in operation somethino-S over a year , and has on its books the *names of about one hundred and fifty teachers and six hundred pupils . It could not be kept up a month if the Bible and the catechism were put forward as books for study . The lessons taught are in reading , writing , arithmetic , grammar , geography , and such other branches as are common to ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our religious views , and the children would at once be withdrawn if we declined offering them instruction in anything else . The practical bearing of the Sermon on the Mount they understand and appreciate ; but as for our theology , it is a riddle they do not care to unravel . At one of the schools I heard the familiar song " We 11 gather at the River , " and at another the old hymn , " All hail the power of Jesus ' name . " These schools are doing a good work , undoubtedly , but their Christianizing influence is only of an indirect character . It is idle to fancy that the immigration from China is to result in the immediate conversion of many . The present generation will stick to its own faith , and so will the greater part of the next generation . The Chinese religion was old long ere Christ came , and we have not yet done much to commend his Gospel to this serious , reflective , high-spirited people . They judge us , and have a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taught them ; and it will take many years of patient work to disabuse them of the impressions they have formed in their struggle there . It will be an advantage if we fully comprehend this before they plant their feet on these Eastern shores . And that they are coming here I do not in the least doubt . I can not clearly see , as I have already said , what change in the national mind led to the emigration to California ; but having conquered the right to live there , I am sure that neither the mountains nor the wide plains will stay them from coming hither . They are quiet and patient , but they are also very persistent and remarkably self-poised . The Governor of California may recommend measures to prevent their immigration , and his Legislature may gravely discuss propositions to tax them out of existence , and the inhabitants of that State and its neighbors may treat them never so shamefully : all this is as futile and foolish as an anathema against the wind or the sunshine . They are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will bring their wives and children and household gods and strange customs to the Golden Gate , - there , and through California , and over the Sierras , and across the desert , and along the railway , to our farms and workshops and manufactories . Seem , , this , as every thoughtful man spending two months in California will see it , I have deemed it well to indicate certain of their chief habits and peculiarities wherewith we ourselves shall be called upon to deal at a time not many years distant . The article in this magazine for December , 1869 , sufficiently proved their capacity for varied labor . Three fourths or more of those now in our country are of the so-called peasant class . In many trades requiring delicate and careful workmanship they are superior ; in every branch of what is properly called handicraft they easily take position in the foremost ranks . If they L ck swiftness , they have large perseverance . If they want knowledge , they have aptness in learning . If they show little creative or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imitativeness . Make it clear to them how you want a thing done , and your thing is done in that way till you teach them another . Of the powers and capacities of the refined and educated classes we have not yet had any great means for judging . The few in California are liberal and catholic and upright and public-spirited . They have talent for organization and business enterprise , and the promise of what they have done is one of hopefulness and encouragement . I do not fully share the current notion that Mr. Wo Lee is the Perfect Servant for whose appearance our households have prayed with such fervency . Remembering Bridget 's tyranny and worthlessness , I made many inquiries as to his fitness for to work in any station , and therefore accommodates himself to the service of the kitchen and dining-room . He can radily do almost anything that may be done with an intelligent use of the hand , and in a comparatively short time , under good instruction , make a skilful cook . He is rarely insolent or domineering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is engaged , and applies himself steadily and faithfully to the business of the hour . He is generally neat enough in his person , but not always so in his surroundings , and has an unsavory habit of mixing truth and falsehood . He is attentive to his duties and careful with crockery and furniture , but hi* ideas of vzi ; u ' and I/il/u ? with respect to small things are not quite so clear as they should be in a servant . He is easily seduced from his allegiance by an offer ofhigher *vages , and somewh at subject to sudden and unexpected conclusions that service at the other end of town is preferable . He does not hold high and secret carousal in the basement , but he is a night-bird , and must often go out in the evening to see his friends . He is neither quarrelsome nor prone to anger , but when once inflamed his passion is malicious and destructive . He neither storms nor threatens , but at times his ways are far from being ways of pleasantness . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize the bindino force of a contract . Unless special reasons exist for attachment to the family , there is never any certainty that he will remain till the great party or dinner is over . And when he gets ready to go he goes . The mistress may complain or remonstrate as she will ; he listens in silence , proffers no apology or explanation , and then walks away , serene and immovable , with little regard for his bargain or her convenience . He is much better " help than Bridget ever was , but even he is not the Perfect Servant . This peasant class adapts itself with cheerful facility to our methods of labor ; on that head their presence will bring us no difficulty but such as patience and firmness can overcome . It will work for less wages than we now pay whites , and its expense for food 478 April , // and clothing will be considerably smaller . It has trades ' unions of its own , but has never yet indulged in strikes or combinations against capital . Whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined ; but , as already indicated , it has surpassing tact and skill in every kind of handicraft . The higher class is quite a force in the business circles of San Francisco . The value of goods brought to that port last year from China and Japan was three and a quarter millions of dollars , and the records of the CustomHouse show that at least two thirds of the duties on this importation were paid by Chinese merchants . The rice import was thirty million pounds , and nearly the whole of it was on their orders . The tea import was two million three hundred thousand pounds , and they paid the duties on but little less than half of it . One of the largest business branches of business in the city is that of making cigars ; it is mostly managed and carried on by Chinese , and gives employment to about three thousand persons . The internal revenue officers told me that they have little trouble in collecting taxes from this class ; they are generally honest in making returns and prompt in paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Chinese mercantile houses is as good as that of American houses ; and I was assured , indeed , by a number of authorities , that the commercial honor of the Quarter is really very high . The Quarter , quick to fall in with our ways of work , is slow to accept our beliefs and ways of thought . To our aggression it opposes passiveness like fate in its fixedness . On questions of morality the upper class is with us , even when the lower class is somewhat against us in practice ; but as soon as we leave mere morals and touch religion , the whole body of the people is in the opposition . Coming over here they will bring Joss and his temple , . Kwan Tae , and Kwa Toi , and Kwan Yin* and the other gods and goddesses , and all the religious and se mi-religious festal days . I have purposely given much space to a statement of their peculiar views and customs . We shall have to accept the Chinese , and with them these customs ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strange people will bring us somethin6 , too , that is very good and wholesome . They are tender to the aged and infirm ; they look upon home as a sacred institution ; they inculcate the highest regard for parents ; they are courteous by instinct as well as by teaching ; they venerate the wise and upright among their ancestors ; they respect law and order and authority at all times ; they abstain from intoxicating liquors , and lead lives of quietness and thoughtfulness ; and from their sentiment toward the dead grow sweet flowers in the heart . We are prodigal and wasteful ; they are frugal*and economical . We nurture a genius for quick results , and pay the penalty of many failures ; they have learned to strive for sure results , and success rarely escapes their grasp . We are eager and changeful ; they are steady and well balanced . We continually reach out for the new and strange ; they abide by the old , and are cheerful in routine . We aspire , and are nervous with longings ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . They honor good government ; they believe that integrity alone is worthy of station ; they hold that promotion should rest on capacity and faithfulness ; they have swift methods of dealing with official rascals and peculators ; they are not impatient of the slow processes of the years , but know how to labor in faith and wait in contentment ; if they are not progressive , they have at least conquered the secret of national and individual steadfastness . 479*
