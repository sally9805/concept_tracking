txt If there is no such word as eityfy , there should be ; although it might be set down by Dr. BARTLETT as an Americanism with more reason than it would seem that he has in the case of a large proportion of the words which go to make up his enormous dictionary . For , to further develop our word , cityfication is a Process which frequently takes place , and which , therefore , should be capable of expression in language ; but the process is almost , if not entirely , confined to this country . A rare instance of an attempt at cityfication which did not succeed was that at Rod Bank , in NewJersey , the other day . Certain inhabitants of that pleasant township , chiefly known for peaches , asparagus , and oysters , not content with the name by which their dwellingplace has been known for some generations , and fired with local ambition , were for changing its name to Shrewsbury City ; and a meeting was called to promote this aspiring purpose . But when the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minority , and the old name is to remain unchanged , for a while at least . Th4 people of Red Bank are to be congratulated upon this result . The proposed change is in no respect desirable , is in every respect undesirable and , indeed , ridiculous . For Red Bank is a good name in itself . It is short , easily remembered , easily spoken ; it is pleasant in sound . characteristic , and peculiar ; and these qualities do not pertain to a large number of the names of towns and villages in the United States . Our local names are open to very serious criticism in many respects ; very few of them have any proper or fitting application to the places by which they are borne ; and a , very great number of them are absurdly pretentious and far-fetched . The name Red Bank has the prime good quality of describing the place by which it is borne . It was given to the place because the bank of the creek there is red . Indeed , it is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which spring casually from descriptive speech . Now , these names stand highest in rank of all the designations of places ; and of this sort are almost all the famous names of the world . They were originally descriptive ; and it is only by the changes in language , by the migration of peoples , and by abbreviation and corruption that they have ceased being to all men mere descriptions of the places to which they were first given . That " comfortable word " Mesopotamia means merely between the rivers , and describes the country to which it was given ; the Mediterranean is the sea in the midst of land ; Gibraltar ( Gebel-al-tarik ) is the mountain of Tarik , so called from the landing there of the chieftain TA.RIK ; Paris is merely the city of the Parisii , an old tribe of the Gauls ; Carthage means new town , and Carthagena , new Carthage , being a corruption of Carthago nova ; Norfolk , Suffolk , Essex , Sussex , and Middlesex merely tell , as every student of English history knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the East Saxons , the . South Saxons , and the middle Saxons ; the Avon is merely the river ; Stratford , the ford by which the street or Roman road passed over it ; and the extreme of descriptiveness is attained in Akeman-street , ( Ache-man-street , ) the name of the Roman road by which sick men went from London to Bath in Anglo-Saxon times . Our examplea are , taken very promiscuously and haphazard , for to be systematic In the matter would be to go over the history of the world ; but they illustrate the point in view . That Is , that if possible , a name should be descriptive , for only thus can it really belong to the place by which it is borne . For example , to call a place which is not a river 's bank Stratford is simply absurd ; while the application of proper names , patronymics like Seneca or Pliny , to spots of ground where people live is in the highest degree ridiculous . The use of a proper name with the suffix " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Williamstown , Kingston , is a very proper mode of name-giving , the signification in that case being the town of James , of William , or of the King . But to drop the " town " or ? ton , " and to call the place merely James or William or Elizabeth , is to make the greatest possible blunder in nomenclature . The occasion of our remarks is a characteristic example of the bad style of place-naming which is becoming common in this country . The proposers were not content to change the name of their town or village , but they must call it a city  --  Shrewsbury City . Thus we have all over the country little collections of feeblybuilt houses , some of them in the midst of a wilderness , from which they can hardly be distinguished ; some of them on the sands of the seashore , others expiring rural villages that some enterprising people would galvanize into life , which are called cities . Charters are even obtained for such forlorn little places . and they have a Mayor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what not . This is very needless , to say the least , and it is to be deplored because of the petty ambition in which it has its origin . For the inhabitants of these " cities " take it much in snuff if their place of residence is called a town , still more if the opprobrious epithet " village " is applied to it . It would seem that to live in a city , and to be " city folks " is often the actuating motive in these cases , and , therefore , the name of the little place is to be changed , and " city " is tacked on to it , and by this simple and effectual process they who before lived in a village become inhabitants of a city . This use of the word city indicates an entire misapprehension of its meaning . A city is not necessarily a large place , or a wealthy one , or a seat of luxury and refinement . Many of the cities of England are much smaller than those places which are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Birmingham is a town ; a city being in England the seat of a bishopric , where there is a cathedral . The word " town , " indeed , implies much more of wealth , and of elegance and refinement than " city " does . All through our literature we read of the pleasures of the town , the splendors of the town , the elegance of town society . The Town of London includes Mayfair and Belgravia ; the City of London is given over to commerce . The old sense of the word city , in which it was used by the Romans , has long since passed away for all practical purposes ; and it is to be wished that ambitious people who live in pretty rural places or in now " diggings , " would be content , in the first place , with modest and appropriate names , and in the next to live like reasonable beings , in towns or even in villages .                  @ @ @
