txt Public gardens in New-York are in a fair way of becoming a success . The perseverance of Mr. THEODORE THOMAS , and the quiet eample of our German population , have helped much to produce this result . Music , as good as can be heard in the best halls of Europe may now be enjoyed nightly at the Central Park Garden . To be sure , there is some difference of opinion as to smoking in the concert hall  --  as a rule , it is pronounced a nuisance , and no wonder  --  and a few more flowers and shrubs would give to the eye the refreshment and pleasure now so well provided for the car ; but the experiment is comparatively a new one , and by and by it will be carried out under more favorable circumstances . Mr. THEODORE THOMAS ought to forbid smoking in the ball , and confine it to the garden . Then the hats and dresses of his lady visitors would not be utterly ruined . What we should like to see , and hope before long we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where every provision for popular recreation should be as complete and admirable as , in its way , the orchestra of Mr. THOMAS now is . Our long and intensely hot Summer renders such a place of amusement highly desirable ; and our vast and increasing population would be sure to make it profitable . The number of people who can afford to go out of town bears , after all , a slender proportion to the whole ; and the large European fraction among our working classes are especially fond of out-door amusements . Even the best ventilated theatres get hot with the mercury in the nineties ; and children , who need . relaxation quite as much as their elders , are surely better off among flowers and shrubberies , listening to SCHUBERT and . STRAUSS , than among the gas fumes and carbonic acid of even the best regulated theatre . The garden , however , as we have hinted , should be a garden . There should be trees , and winding walks , and parterres of flowers , with statuary helm and there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for afternoon ae well as evening . There should be wholesome refreshments of all kinds and at reasonable prices . Afternoon entertainments should be given through the season  --  they might consist , at first , simply of orchestral music , performed at intervals , as at the Crystal Palace at Sydenham  --  and on holidays balloon ascents by day and fire-works at night , might add profitable variety to the attractions . That such an enterprise would pay , we do not doubt . Long ago it was said that our population was too busy and commercial to make any lyric or dramatic entertainments remunerative in the day time . Yet it was found out in New-York , long before the discovery was made in capitals over sea , that the " matin &; " could be turned into a great source of profit , and no leading theatre here would now dream of relinquishing it . It should be remembered , in considering the subject of Summer relaxation , that NewYork City is already , in point of fact , a watering-place . What other capital in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , the same thing can bo claimed Venice , perhaps , but no other . We have only to compare the sluggish Thames or Seine with our North and East Rivers  --  to contrast the salt whiffs of the sea that come up to us through the Narrows or Hellgate , with the muddy vapors that rise from . the European streams  --  to sec NewYork 's advantage in this respect over Paris and London . On the banks of either of our broad rivers there are situations for popular recreation in the way of public gardens not to be . approached . elsewhere ; and , if the space there is thought too costly , there are available spots on the shores of New-Jersey , and of Staten Island , admirably adapted to such purposes , and always capable of being made readily accessible . We hope soon to see this idea carried out on a scale worthy of the great city New-York is and is to be . What is needed is not an imitation of Cremome or the Chateau des Pleura , but a combination of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what is bad , and . the addition of those " modern improvements " which , in New-York , are always to be had without difficulty .
