OUR ELECTION LAWS . A GOVERNMENT based upon popular suffrage can be successful in the best sense only to the extent that the popular voice is freely expressed , fairly and honestly ascertained , and fully obeyed . It is therefore of the greatest consequence that the purity and sanctity of the ballot should be guarded by the wisest and best legislation that statesmanship can devise . It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of this subject in a government such as ours , where the supreme power is vested only in the people , to be exercised by means of the ballot . Fairness and honesty in the conduct of elections will alone keep pure the sources of power in this Government , and thus promote peace and good order , and give stability to our institutions . Our election laws ought to be framed and executed with a view to securing these great ends , but truth compels the statement that our statutes are exceedingly imperfect in themselves , and , what is worse , are too often administered in the interest , not of purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be denied that many of the wisest and best of our citizens consider that our institutions are in peril from the fact that popular elections are so frequently controlled by fraud and violence . Wise and prudent citizens may well say that , if we lose faith in the machinery provided for the expression of the popular will , we must also eventually lose faith in // our form of free government , since it can be valuable only in proportion as it is in fact , as well as in theory , a government by the people . As our population increases and our great cities multiply , the problem of how to secure and preserve freedom and fairness in elections grows annually more grave and difficult . It is to-day a question of how to secure and record a fair and honest expression from nearly nine millions of voters . Within the lifetime of some of the present generation it will become a question of dealing with at least thirty millions of voters . To be assured that this problem has been solved is to know that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be willing to contribute something toward its solution . These considerations have induced me to undertake the task of submitting , for the consideration of the readers of " The North American Review , " a statement of some defects in our election laws , and of suggesting the remedies . Let me premise that the ends to be aimed at by legislation upon this subject are ( 1 ) , to secure to all legal voters equal and ample opportunity to vote , and to exclude all others ; and ( 2 ) , to secure a fair canvass and an honest declaration of the result of every election . No difference of opinion can exist among honest men as to the propriety , nay , the necessity of securing these ends , which all will admit constitute the foundation upon which the fabric of free government rests . To render them secure , is to perpetuate our institutions and transmit them pure and strong to future generations . It would seem that no State should hesitate to provide the legislation necessary to secure ends so manifestly just , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and y*et great frauds are annually perpetrated . Many of the laws upon this subject were originally enacted for the government of a largely rural and agricultural population , who needed few if any restraints , and they have been copied and applied to communities very differently situated from such a population , and , as a whole , by no means so well disposed toward law and order . Assuming that the ends to be sought are freedom and equality among voters , and honesty and perfect fairness in the count , and that these great ends are not always secured under existing laws , let us inquire how we may remedy existing evils by legislation . I maintain that plain , simple , and ample remedies are within our reach , the adoption of which would injure none , while , as nearly as human laws can do so , they would protect the rights of all . First in importance as a means of securing freedom in elections , // are such statutory provisions as will prevent the crowding of the polling-places by large numbers of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire county may vote at the county seat , and in all the large cities and in many of the smaller ones the crowds that assemble at the polls are large and often disorderly and turbulent . The evils that result from overcrowding the polling-places are apparent enough : 1 . It delays the process of voting so that each voter waiting for his turn may be detained for hours . Many business men , who value time more highly than the right of suffrage , are deterred from voting by this consideration alone . 2 . It makes it a difficult and disagreeable task for quiet , orderly people , and especially for the sick , lame , and infirm , to press their way through the throng , and many of these are thereby deterred from voting . 3 . It makes it impossible to consider with deliberation and decide intelligently questions arising at the polls as to the qualifications of persons whose votes are challenged , and this leads to erroneous rulings . But , what is worse , it affords evil-minded persons the opportunity , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings as to consume the day and exclude large numbers of legal voters , who by these interruptions are prevented from reaching the polls within the time required . 4 . The practice of crowding the polls by the members of one party , who open the way for their friends and put all possible obstacles in the way of their opponents , is frequently resorted to as a means of defeating a full and fair vote . All these mischiefs can be remedied by requiring a 3iliultiplieation of Voting Precincts , to such an extent that only a limited number of voters-say , not over five hundred-shall be residents of and voters in any one precinct . This , with a further provision requiring every voter to register and vote in his own precinct and in no other , would , if adopted in all the States , work a reform of vast importance and consequence . This very important subject of legislation is by no means the most difficult one with which our law-makers have to deal . The task of providing against the most crying evils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction that the people can well afford to be put to some pains and expense in order to protect the purity of the ballot , and , if thus approached , the problem will be // found very easy of solution . The multiplication of voting precincts will prove an effectual remedy for all the evils which result from overcrowding the polling-places , some of which are specified above . A properly guarded statute upon this subject would secure , as a rule , sufficient time and opportunity at each poll for the orderly , deliberate , and satisfactory transaction of the business of receiving and depositing the ballots of all legal voters , and for the examination and decision of disputed questions arising at the election . Let us suppose that a population containing five hundred voters be the basis upon which election precincts are to be organized , who does not see that , with only that number of votes to be received in the course of the day , the election could be conducted decently and in order ? Contrast such an election with the attempt in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters , and pass upon hundreds of challenges ! In connection with the increase of the number and reduction of the size of precincts there should be provided a Complete Registration , and by this I mean an enumeration of the legal voters of each precinct , made with the utmost possible care . By requiring that each precinct shall be small in the sense of containing only a limited number of voters , and by appointing a board of registration for each precinct , it will be practicable and easy to enroll every voter . This process is especially necessary in the city precincts , and its application only to them would probably be entirely sufficient . If the precinct is not too large in the country , the judge of the election or the bystanders will be able to recognize the voters , with rare exceptions . But in the cities , where the registry must be relied on , provisions should be made to render it accurate , and none but registered voters should be allowed to vote . The persons preparing the list should be required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by all reasonable means to make sure that no legal voter is omitted , and the voters themselves should be made to know that they must register if they wish to enjoy the franchise . Whoever neglects to enroll himself as a voter , can not complain that he is not allowed to vote . The registry list should be printed or written , and posted up at the most public places in the precinct at least ten days prior to the day of election , and corrections and additions should be made up to the day before the election . With these two requirements , namely , small precincts and complete registration , how easy becomes the // task of receiving and depositing in the box the ballots of all who are entitled to vote ! There can be no objection to these provisions , except that they propose a multiplication of election officers , and some additional labor and expense . To this objection I reply that the end is so important that , in comparison with it , the trouble and expenses made necessary to secure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the cost must be considered , it may be suggested that by having fewer elections a corresponding saving would be made . Let our officials be chosen for longer terms . This would save much in the way of expense , and at the same time benefit the people by relieving them from the continual excitement and agitation caused by the struggle of parties for office and power . Another great advantage would result from the adoption of small precincts . The voters would be very generally known to each other , and in no single precinct would it be possible for any considerable number of non-residents , or otherwise disqualified persons , to cast fraudulent votes without detection . Nor would it be possible for fraudulent voters to personate absent or deceased persons . In a precinct composed of only a small number of voters , generally known to each other , such frauds would be impossible . It may be said that some of the worst frauds are committed with the assistance or connivance of the officers of election , and that therefore fraud in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reduction of the size of precincts . This is very true , and the suggestion brings me to the next essential of an efficient election law , which is such provision as will prevent the selection of purely Partisan Election Boards . All parties in interest should be represented in each board of election officers , and by witnesses to be present . The officers of the election should be required to perform all their official duties in the presence of each other and in the presence of a limited number of witnesses representing the several parties to the contest . No considerable fraud can be committed by an election officer without the knowledge of all the members of the board ; and therefore great security is to be found in a statute requiring all sides to be represented upon such boards . Add to this a provision requiring the admission to the room where the ballots are received , deposited , and counted , of at least one witness on behalf of each party interested , and great frauds with the knowledge or connivance of the board will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with authority to interfere ( otherwise than as any citizen might through the proper judicial proceedings ) with the action of the officers , but should be permitted to witness every step in the progress of the election and the count , and to verify the correctness of the same . Officers of the law who propose to do their duty , and nothing more nor less , can not reasonably object to the presence of witnesses representing the parties most interested , and officers who are capable of a violation of duty should not be permitted to object . It is a safe and sound principle , and one which ought to be applied in the preparation of election laws , that men are not apt to commit crime in the presence of witnesses . Let the law be so framed that every step , from the opening of the polls to the completion of the count and the announcement of the result , shall be taken in the presence of at least two intelligent witnesses representing opposing candidates , and the chances of successful fraud will be reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands attention , and should be guarded against by legislation , and that is by Tampering with the Ballots after they are cast and before they are counted . This is generally done after the polls are closed . If the law permits* the board is apt to adjourn and its members to separate , for a time , during which a strict and honest watch over the ballot-box is not always kept . The only remedy is to require the votes to be counted immediately after the closing of the polls , and to strictly forbid the separation or adjournment of the board until the count is completed and the return signed . It is of the utmost importance that the statutes of every State should impi*ratively require an Immediate Canvass by officers and before witnesses representing both sides . What would the people of this country say to a proposition that Congress and our State Legislatures should sit with closed doors , cxcluding all witnesses from their presence , or that courts and juries should try causes in secret ? The suggestion would , of course , meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . With equal , if not greater reason , may the people demand the utmost publicity in the proceedings of a popular election , whereby Congresses and Legislatures are made and unmade . // Legislation upon this subject should not be based upon the theory that officers of election will always do right . If that were the fact , no penal election laws would be necessary . On the contrary , the law should , if possible , be so framed that an election officer shall not , if he would , defraud the electors without exposure and punishment . In this connection is further seen the importance of the firstnamed essential of an efficient election law , namely , small voting precincts ; for , if the number of ballots to be counted does not exceed five hundred , the time required for the canvass will not be great , and the work can be conveniently done without an adjournment or separation of the board . It is scarcely necessary to say that no statute regulating elections can be complete without containing ample provision for the prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , the exhibition of force , threats , or other means . In a well-ordered community this crime will be rarely committed , and in every such community public opinion will demand its prompt and severe punishment . The law should be so framed as to guard with scrupulous care the perfect freedom of the ballot , and every attempt to rob even the poorest and weakest elector of his free choice should be regarded as a high crime , since the rights of all are involved in the question of the protection of the rights of each . Another mode of cheating at elections is that known as the Tissue-I*allot Fraud and other kindred contrivances , by means of which one person may deposit in the box a number of ballots . For this a plain , simple , and effectual remedy will be found in the enactment of a law prohibiting altogether the employment of such ballots , and forbidding the election board to count them if cast . This can be accomplished either by fixing the size of the tickets to be used , or by requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else , and hand it thus to the officer authorized to receive it . From what has now been said it will be seen that , in my judgment , every efficient election law must among other things provide : 1 . For small voting p , reciucts. 2 . That an elector shall vote only in the precinct of his residence . // 3 . For complete registration , especially in cities , and only persons registered to be allowed to vote . 4 . For representation of all parties on boards of election and registration . 5 . For the presence with the officers of election , at all stages of the proceedings , of witnesses representing the parties in interest . 6 . For a canvass of the vote immediately upon the close of the polls , and without an adjournment or separation of the board . 7 . For the punishment of violence and intimidation . 8 . For the prohibition of the use of tissue ballots and kindred fraudulent contrivances . Thesc , in addition to the ordinary directory provisions , are essentiaL Experience will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I conclude this article with a reference to and a few reflections upon existing election laws , State and national , in order to show how far they are deficient if judged by these requirements . In most of the States the statutory provisions regulating the formation and fixing the extent of election precincts are exceedingly imperfect . In probably a majority of cases the subject is committed absolutely to certain county officers-as , for example , in Alabama , Colorado , Florida , and Nebraska , to the county conimissioners ; in Arkansas and California , to the county supervisors ; in North Carolina , to the board of justices of the peace ; and in Tennessee , Texas , and West Virginia , to the county court . In at least twenty-four States neither the number nor size of precincts is fixed by law . In several States , towns or townships in the country and wards in the cities are constituted election precincts , which is a very excellent arrangement so far as the rural districts are concerned , but often works very badly in cities where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election precincts . In two States only ( New York and Oregon ) do we find such legislation on this point as seems to be required . In Oregon it is provided that election precincts shall not contain more than three hundred voters , and in New York the maximum in cities is eight hundred voters . In those States where the matter is confided to local officers ( and they include a great majority of the States ) there is great temptation to partiality and injustice in the designation of precincts and of voting-places . Purely partisan considerations too often control the action of the local authorities . In some instances it would seem that polling-places have been // arranged with a view to render it very inconvenient if not impossible for large numbers of electors to t*ast their votes . All the States , except Indiana , Georgia , Kansas , Oregon , Tennessee , and West Virginia , have registry laws . Very few of them , however , contain provisions limiting the right of voting to registered electors , and for making the registry perfect and complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have seen , are very necessary provisions . Any statute that leaves open the question of the right of non-registered persons to vote , and devolves the duty of deciding in each case upon the election board , on election day , will prove a frail barrier against fraud . Let the registry list be prepared with the most pains-taking care by a board of registration composed of persons belonging to the different political parties , and let all per sons not registered be excluded from the privilege of voting . As to the place of voting , some of the States still continue the vicious practice of permitting an elector to vote anywhere in the county of his residence . Such seems to be the law in Arkansas , California , Georgia , Kentucky , and Oregon . It is , however , gratifying to be able to state that the tendency of legislation is very strongly toward the sound and salutary doctrine that each elector should be required to vote in the neighborhood of his residence , and where he is likely to be known to election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of providing for the presence with the election officers of witnesses representing the parties to the contest  --  a most important step in the right direction , and one which every State should adopt . For example , the law of Alabama provides for the presence of five of each party ; that of Florida provides for the presence of one representative of each political party that has nominated candidates ; that of Illinois , for the presence of two legal voters of each party to the contest ; those of Kansas and Oregon permit the presence of the candidates in person , or of not exceeding three of their friends . Similar statutes are also to be found in Pennsylvania and Virginia . The very important requirement that the board of election officers should be composed of members of different political parties is omitted from the statutes of twenty-two States . Comment upon this fact is quite unnecessary . The still more necessary requirement that there shall be a count of the votes immediately upon the close of the polls is , I am glad to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . A few , Thowever , have omitted it . Thus , in Mississippi , if the canvass is not // finished by 12 r. ii. , it may be completed the next day . And in South Carolina it is provided that the board of managers may have three days in which to deliver to the commissioners of election the poll-list and the boxes containing the ballots , and that the commissioners of election shall meet at the county seat on the Tuesday next after the election and proceed to count the votes of the county . In this State there is no law providing for the count of the precinct vote at the place of voting , but both boxes and ballots are to be carried to the county seat and there canvassed by a board of commissioners nearly a week after the close of the polls . This statute reads as if it might have been framed with a view to provide ample opportunity for tampering with the ballots between the day of election and the day of counting . The form and size of the ballot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In twenty-two States no law is found upon the subject . In several others it is provided that all ballots shall be printed or written on plain white paper . In California they are required to be four inches in width and twelve inches in length , and there is a similar statute in Nevada . Except in these two States there is no law to forbid the use of a ballot printed in the finest possible type , and on the smallest possible piece of paper . It is well known that the absence of this regulation has given rise to some very gross frauds in recent years . Congressional Legislation . This article would not be complete without some remarks upon the jurisdiction of the State and National Governments respectively over the general subject of elections , and a brief reference to Congressional legislation with reference thereto . The Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States prohibits any abridgment by the United States , or by any State , of the right of citizens to vote , on account of race , color , or previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce this provision by appropriate legislation . Subject to this limitation , the States respectively possess the exclusive power to prescribe the times , places , and manner of holding all elections , except those for Representatives in Congress , which latter they may also regulate , subject to the paramount authority of Congress . That the power of Congress over the manner of electing its own members is absolute and plenary , will be seen by reference to the provisions of Article I. , section 4 , of the Constitution , which provides as follows : // The times , places , and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof ; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations , except as to the places of choosing Senators . Under this very comprehensive provision Congress , if satisfied with existing State regulations , may abstain from exercising its authority ; but , if Congress shall deem the State laws upon the subject insufficient , it may at pleasure " alter " them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations and " make " new and complete rules of its own to govern Congressional elections . The power given to Congress is to make regulations concerning the manner of holding such elections  --  a very broad and comprehensive power . It clearly includes authority to provide all the necessary machinery for conducting the election as well as to provide suitable laws for the punishment of frauds against the freedom and purity thereof . Acting upon this doctrine , Congress has from time to time dealt with the subject , and the principal part of its legislation upon it is embodied in sections 2,011 to 2,031 , inclusive , of the Revised Statutes of the United States . The most material features of this legislation are the following : 1 . Upon petition of citizens stating that they desire to have the registration or election in a particular place " guarded and scrutinized , " the United States Circuit Court appoints two resident citizens " who shall be of different political parties , and able to read and write the English language , and who shall be known and designated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized and required to attend at the registration or election , with power to challenge any person offering to register or vote . They have the right to examine the registry list , and to make a copy of it . They have the right to be present during the voting , and also during the counting of the votes , and to be wherever the ballot-boxes are kept , from the opening of the polls until the count is completed and the returns made and certified . 3 . The supervisors are also authorized to personally scrutinize , count , and canvass the votes cast for Representatives or delegates in Congress , and to make a certificate or return of the same to the chief supervisor . // fact to the chief supervisor , who is to make a thorough investigation , examining witnesses under oath , and report all the facts to the House of Representatives . 5 . In cities of twenty thousand inhabitants , or more , the United States marshal is authorized , upon application , to appoint special deputy marshals to aid and assist the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to keep the peace , and support and protect the supervisors in the discharge of their duties . They are also to prevent fraudulent registration and fraudulent voting , and may arrest , with or without process , and either before or after voting , any person who commits or attempts to commit any of the offenses prohibited by the act , or any offense against the laws of the United States ; but no person shall be arrested without process except for an offense committed in the presence of the marshal or some one of his deputies , or a supervisor of election ; and any person arrested is to have a hearing forthwith . 6 . One chief supervisor for each judicial district is to be appointed by the circuit judge from among the Circuit Court commissioners . He is to furnish all necessary books , forms , and blanks for the use of the supervisors , and have a general supervision over them . 7 . Supervisors of election , appointed in counties or parishes outside of cities of more than twenty thousand inhabitants , have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the immediate presence of the officers holding the election , and to witness all their proceedings , including the counting of the votes and the making of a return thereof . These embrace in brief the substance of the national election law . That legislation by Congress upon the subject was both proper and necessary is shown , not only by the history of Congressional elections , but also by reference to the manifest defects in State legislation already pointed out . Until it can be made to appear that the States have provided all necessary guards for the protection of the purity of Congressional elections , it will remain the imperative duty of the United States Government to supply the omission . The framers of the Constitution understood perfectly well that to contribute by fraud or other unlawful means to the defeat of the will of the majority of legal voters at a Congressional election is a wrong against every citizen of the Union , and a crime against the whole nation , and hence the power in question was reserved to the // National Legislature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice and wisdom . The national statutes upon this subject should be perfectly just , fair , and non-partisan , but they should also be made thoroughly efficient . The true friends and advocates of honesty and purity in elections will endorse and applaud an effort to so amend these laws as to improve them and increase their efficiency , but all attempts to weaken or destroy them will meet with emphatic condemnation .
