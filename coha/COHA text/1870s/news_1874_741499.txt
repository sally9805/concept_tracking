txt As a general rule , our corporations seem to be entirely beyond the law . A good illustration of the free and easy way in which we accept this state of things is found in the relations of the Board of Health toward the street-car companies . Bylaw , the Board of Health is charged with the sanitary regulations specially affecting the welfare of the people of this City . By law it is provided with the means of enforcing its regulations ; and those who transgress may be summarily dealt with . It is safe to say that a personal transgressor is not often left long unpunished . Somehow it seems more difficult to reach a wealthy corporation , with its property widely extended over the City . The Board of Health , discovering that the stuffed cushions and linings of the street-cars were propagating vermin , spreading disease , and contaminating the public health , passed an ordinance forbidding their use . Some of the companies complied with this order , substituting varnished benches for the abominable staffing upon which hundreds of thousands of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more than a year ago . The other day the Secretary of the Board of Health presented a report on the subject , from which it appears that several of the companies have complied with the ordinance , five promise to take out their cushions when they are worn out , and two make neitherreport nor promise . That is to say , some of the companies observe the law , some say they will when they get ready , and others take no notice of the warning sent them . If this is not a free and easy way of doing things , we should like to know what is . The fact of the case is that the street-car companies have become such powerful interests that they can afford to set pubdie opinion and Municipal regulations at defiance . Most of their employes , with their reckless driving , brutality , and impertinence , seem to understand this very we . The numerous corporations , with their large capital , army of employed men , . and net-work of rails covering the City , comprise a large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and formidable that we are forced to put up with the venerable nuisance of street-car traveling . We should have had the rapid and cheap means of transit , enjoyed by other civilized nations long ago a it had not been possible for the existing companies to obstruct legislation and buy off the projectors of new enterprises . Because these corporations , with their iron , cars , horses , and men , find it profitable to drag people about in the present obsolete fashion , we can have no substitute for the slow , vexatious , and uncomfortable means of street-travel which they supply . Another genera ion will read with amazement of the patience and stolidity with which this great City long endured the costly inconvenience of the street-car . It is undeniable that this is better than nothing , but it is far behind the age . We ought to have something better ; and it is alarming to see that the growing importance of this vast vested interest promises to indefinitely postpone the day of our deliverance from its grasp .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
