txt The sudden and unexpected death of Mr. WILSON will be received with sincere sorrow by many thousands of the people of the United States . His services to the country were , in their time , very great , and were rendered in a niunner which made him intimately known and much respected over all portions of the North , while , of late years , his reputation has gained sensibly in the South as well . Mr. WILSON , was nearly the last of the greater polit-ical leaders of the movement against slavery . LINCOLN , - 4SWARD , CHASE , SUMNER , GREELEY have died within a comparatively short time . EK-Senator WADE still lives , who , at one period of the struggle , bore a prominent part in it , but . he is now in retirement , and Mr. CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS is the only public man whose name is conspicuously connected with tho Anti-alas-cry time who still occupies the public attention in any considerable degree . Mr. WitsoN died at au ago which ought to seem young . Ile was but sixty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part a dozen years more . But his naturally strong constitution was broken by the great labor he performed during the war , and it is not too much to say that he sacrificed his life to the cause of his country . It seems hackneyed to describe him fig a wself-made man ; " yet no other phrase conveys more td:early an impression of the conditions under which his career was worked out and his character formed . Ho was of obscure birth  --  indeed he renounced , on coining of age , his family name  --  and his youth was passed in almost abject poverty . Of schooling he may be said to have had none , and his mind was educated by desultory , though extended , reading , and by the circumstances of a citizen 's lite in a New-England community . As a public man he was wholly without the training or the associations to which Mr. CHASE , Mr. SUMNER , and Mr. SEWARD owed a great deal of their strength ; yet he was in many respects their equal and in some their superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed was narrow , but it embraced those with which he had directly to deal , and his capacity for enlisting the sympathies and convincing the judgment of those he addressed , whether in the Senate or in popular discussion , was much greater than that of men of higher culture and greater general ability . Mr. WiLsos was a very faithful representative of a large and valuable class of American citizens . His position with reference to slavery is a fair illustration of this fact . It was based as much on sentiment as on reason ; he felt that the institution was unjust and cruel ; he was indignant at the arrogance of its supporters ; there was a sense of insult in the resentment of the pretentions of the slave power which he constantly betrayed  --  insult offered to himself , his class , his section  --  and while his moral nature revolted at the wickedness of slavery , there was a deep substratum of not unselfish animosity toward the advocates and apologists of slavery . This feeling entered largely into the contest . Nearly the whole Anti-Slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only intensity and bitterness but profound determination . The equality for which the great body of the people of the North /blight was their own equality , which was tacitly or openly denied by the pretensions and assumptions of the slave power . Entering public life with this sentiment firmly ingrafted on his mind , Mr. WILSON studied the arts of political influence not from above , but on the:level of those who were to be influenced . He did not observe public feeling ; he shared it . From the town meeting to the Senate , be constantly " mingled with the people , " not so much from any conscious purpose to advance his aims , but because his associations were all with them . He could not be said to have " risen from the masses ; " he rose among them . He was an astute manager and an adroit and persistent politician , but he was so naturally , and was in thorough sympathy with popular sentiment , to which he made his appeals . Many critics have thought Mr. WILSON a demagogue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly just . He used freely all the advantages that party machinery offered , but never betrayed his professed Convictions . On the contrary , lie maintained them at a time when it required courage and firmness and unselfish devotion to do so . His piety was unquestionably conspicuous , mid it is hard for many men of refinement to think that it was sincere , be . cause they could not themselves have adopted a similar course without an ulterior purpose . But Mr. WiLsorr never discredited his professions , and preserved a spotless name during a long period when a nature.with any real taint of falsehood in it must have yielded to the groat temptations that constantly presented themselves . It is hardly worth while to carp at the eccentricities of a characterwhich produced such essentially sound and solid results . As we have said , Mr. WILSON 'S death will be sincerely regretted by large numbers of his follow-citizens . He deserved well of his country . Ile was a laborious and efficient worker in fields of the highest importance . He was ambitious to occupy high station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always tried to do his duty in it , and few men can point to greater or more enduring services .
