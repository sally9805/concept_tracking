txt The Democratic journals and orators have recently been talking a good deal of nonsense about the terrible dangers with which the country is threatened from the abuse of military power . Their alarm is not now . It may be said to be habitual , and even systematic , and it dates from about the time that tho Southern States began to make known their plans for the dismemberment of the Union . Previous to that period , and especially when President BuCHANAN was eager to force the . fraudulent liecompton Constitution on the people of Kansas by the abuse of Federal bayonets , the Democrats were by no means so jealous of the military arm . But as soon as the constitutional control of the military passed into Republican hands , and there was a certainty that it would be used to maintain the Union and to compel obedience to the laws in the South , the leaders of the Democracy discovered ' that their party had always been the special guardians of the integrity of the civil , as opposed to the military , branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vigilantly criticise the employment of any force greater than that of a Marshal 's unarmed posse in the suppression of the rebellion . They became suddenly convinced that the soldiers whom Mr. BUCHANAN could rightfully use to prop a slaveholders ' usurpation in a free Territory would become the minions of despotism if used to put down resistance to the United States laws in the South . A like inconsistency marks their present course . They pretend to see in the fact that the President , in the exercise of his lawful powers and in discharge of a constitutional duty , has sent a few hundred troops to protect the legal Government of South Carolina against domestic violence , evidence that the will of " the people " is to be overridden by force . They are blind to the existence of any other people than the white Democrats , or of any other force than that employed by the Federal commanders . For several months it has been perfectly plain that a formidable plot was on foot to deprive the majority of the voters of South Carolina of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , belongs to them . This plot was to be carried out by the use of force , and of force at the hands of a military organization very nearly complete in all its parts . The other day , when Republican speakers were expected at Edgefield , in the district where the Hamburg massacre occurred , two thousand men mounted , armed , disciplined , under regularly graded commanders , and proceeding in military form , assembled on a published order , for the purpose of preventing the Republicans from holding their meeting in such peaceful way as should suit them , and as they would have been protected in holding it iu any place in the North . When the Republican speakers arrived , the colored people were huddled along the streets , afraid to get together while the Democratic raiders were gathered . At this moment a small force of United States troops  --  less than one-tenth of the number of the raiders -- entered the town and were marched quietly to a retired spot and drawn up under arms , but out of sight . The Republican meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interrupted its speakers with derisive shouts , these had no effect , and did not scatter the audience , as they would have done had not ' the Federal troops been in the place . Now , to the mind of the Democratic leaders the spectacle of that gathering of armed whites , under military discipline , in number equaling that of an ordinary brigade in active service , with the avowed purpose of preventing by violence the enjoyment of free speech and peaceful assembly by their opponents , contains nothing shocking or alarming . They can see in it no danger for free institutions , no violation of the rights of the people under a representative government , nothing in the nature of tyranny or the rule of force over law . ** the other hand , in the little band of United States soldiers , acting in strict accordance to the law , held in reserve solely to protect peaceful citizens from the assaults of armed violators of the law , they can only see the evidence of an overshadowing despotism . Doubtless , if the affair should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not dead to the duty of the Government in this State to put down lawless violence by lawful force . When the United States troops marched into this City to aid in suppressing the bloody riots of 1863 , no decent Democrat regarded the act as other than the proper exercise of a necessary and beneficent power . Yet uo candid man who will stop a moment to consider the facts , can fail to see that the violence which vexes South Carolina is far more dangerous to the community in which it exists , and more injurious to the country at large , than the sudden outburst of turbulence which took place in New-York on the enforcement of the draft in 1863 . The latter was for the most part unpremeditated , and was the rash and unreasoning revolt of a mass of ignorant people to whom the Government appeared for the moment in the exercise of its harshest power , namely , in compelling military service . But in South Carolina there is a combination to defeat by arms the enforcement of the laws that protect the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's of all free government , is controlled by the most intelligent and prominent men in the State , and is at once an insurrection and a usurpation . If it is not put down , and a free and full vote insured next mouth , very serious consequences may ensue . It may be that the election of the President and Vice President shall turn on the vote of the State of South Carolina , and the result in South Carolina depend on the vote of the districts in which the armed " cavalrv " of the Hampton party are engaged in determining the election by force . It must be a very prejudiced partisan who fails to see that to prevent such a state of things by the firm use of all the Federal power which la authorized and necessary , is but the simplest possible duty . The Government would be utterly unworthy of itself , and entirely false to the trust imposed on it by the people , if it failed in such a plain and important obligation .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
