OLD WOMAN 'S GOSSIP . XV ' . DUBLIN , August , 1830 . M* DEAR H- : I should have answered your letter sooner had I before been able to give you any certain intelli*ence of our theatrical proceedings next week , but I was so afraid of some change taking place in the list of the plays that I resolved not to write until alteration was impossible . The plays for next week are on Monday , Venice Preserved ; on Wednesday , The Grecian Daughter ; Thursday , The Merchant of Venice . I wish your people may be able to come up , the latter end of the week ; I think Romeo and Juliet , and The Merchant of Venice , are nice plays for them to see . But you have , I know , an invitation from Mrs. J- to come into town on Monday . I do not know whether my wishes have at all influenced her in this , but she has my very best thanks for it , and I know that they will have some weight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dearest H , come if you can . I shall certainly not be able to return to Ardgillan , and so my only chance of seeing you depends upon your coming into Dublin . I wish I had been with you , when you sat in the sun and listened to the wind singing over the sea . I have a great admiration for the wind , not so much for its purifying influences only , as for its invisible power , strength , the quality above all others without which there is neither moral nor mental greatness possible . Natural objects endowed with this invisible power please me best , as human beings who possess it attract me most ; and my preference for it over other elements of character is because I think it communicates itself , and that while in contact with it one feels as if it were catching ; and whether by the shore , when the tide is coming up fast and irresistible , or in the books or intercourse of other minds , it seems to rouse corresponding activity and energy in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that one is strong . I am sure I have felt taller by three inches , as well as three times more vigorous in body and mind , than I really am , when running by the sea . It seemed as if that great mass of waters , as it rushed and roared by my side , was communicating power directly to my mind as well as my bodily frame , by its companionship . I wish I was on the shore now with you . It is surprising ( talking of E- ) how instantaneously , and by what subtle , indescribable means , certain qualities of individual natures make themselves felt , - refinement , imagination , poetical sensibility . People 's voices , looks , and gestures betray these so unconsciously ; and I think more by the manner , a great deal , than the matter of their speech . Refinement , particularly , is a wonderfully subtle , penetrating element ; nothing is so positive in its effect , and nothing so completely escapes analysis and defies description . I am glad dear little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world of discrimination in that sentence of his ; and to have made a conquest of Hercules , with my love of and admiration for power , is no mean triumph . To your charge that I should cultivate my judgment in preference to my imagination , 1 can only answer , I am ready and willing to do so ; " but it is nevertheless not altogether easy for me to do it . My life in London leaves me neither time nor opportunity for any self-culture , and it seems to me as if my best faculties were lying fallow , while a comparatively unimportant talent , and my physical powers , were being taxed to the uttermost . The profession I have ciabraced is supposed to stimulate powerfully the imagination . I do riot find it so ; it appeals to mine in a slight degree compared with other pursuits ; it is too definite in its object and too confined in its scope to excite my imagination strongly ; and , moreover , it carries with it the // 1876. antidote of its own excitement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to act with one 's mind alone , the case might be different ; but the body is so indispensable , unluckily , to the execution of one 's most poetical conceptions on the stage , that the imaginative powers are under very severe though imperceptible restraint . Acting seems to me rather like dancing hornpipes in fetters . And by no means the least difficult part of the business is to preserve one 's own feelings warm , and one 's imagination excited , whilst one is aiming entirely at producing effects upon others ; surrounded , moreover , as one is , by objects which , while they heighten the illusion to the distant spectator , all but destroy it to us of the dramatis personce . None of this , however , lessens the value and importance of your advice , or my own conviction that " mental bracing " is good for me . Mrs. Kand I have exchanged visits and missed one another ; she has sent me a delightful book of yours , Sir llumphry Davy 's Consolations in Travel , with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you ; so come and listen to what I have to say , and bring me word how the hay-cuttin* prospers . My reception on Monday was quite overpowering , and I was escorted back to the hotel , after the play , by a body-guard of about two hundred men , shouting and hurrahing like mad ; strange to say , they were people of perfectly respectable appearance . My father was not with us , and they opened the carriage-door and let down the steps , when we got home , and helped us out , clopping , and showering the most fervent expressions of good - will upon me and aunt Dall , whom they took for my mother . One young man exclaimed pathetically , " Oh , I hope ye re not too much fatigued , Miss Kemble , by your exertions ! " They formed a line on each side of me , and several of them dropped on their knees to look under my bonnet , as I ran laughing , with my head down , from the carriage to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as amused and gratified , by their cordial demonstration . 603 The Mrs. J- whom I have mentioned in this letter was sister of Miss S s dearest friend , Miss W- , and wife of that amiable and eminent man , Chief Baron J- . The humors of a Dublin audience , much as I had heard of them before going to Ireland , surprised and diverted me very much . The second night of our actin0 there , as we were leaving the theatre by the private entrance , we found the carriage surrounded by a crowd eagerly waiting for our coming out . As soon as my father appeared , there was a shout of " Three cheers for Misther Char-les ! " then came Dali , and " Three cheers for IMlisthriss Char-les I " then I , and " Three cheers for Miss Fanny ! " " Bedad , she looks well by gas-light ! " exclaimed one of my admirers . " Och , and bedad , she looks well by daylight too ! " retOrte ( l another , though what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my good looks had been , I can not imagine . What further remarks passed upon us I do not know , as we drove off laughing , and left our friends still vociferously cheering . My father told us one day of his being followed up Sackville Street by two beggar-women , between whom the followin' dialo*ue passed , evidently with a view to his edification . " Och , but he s an iligant man , is Misther Char-les Keinbie ! " An ' deed , so was his brudher Misther John , thin , a moighty foine man ! and to see his demarmour , puttin ' his hand in his pocket and givin ' me sixpence , bate all the worrld ! " Lord C- , whose tall , lathy figure and prominent teeth were well known to the pauper population of Dublin , having told a resoume old female beggar , who was pursuing him , to o along , " received the agreeable rejoinder , " Ah ! go long wid your own self ; ye re like an old comb : all back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scene where her husband complains of her late hours and she insolently retorts , " I wo n't come home till four , to-morrow morning , " and receives the startling reply with which Lord Townley leaves her , " Then , madam , you shall never come home again , " // I was apt to stand for a moment aghast at this threat ; and one night during this pause of breathless dismay , one of my *allery auditors , thinking , I suppose , that I was wanting in proper spirit not to make some rejoinder , exclaimed , " Now thin , Fanny ! " which very nearly upset the gravity produced by my father 's impressive exit , both in me and in the audience . DuRLIE , FRIDAY , August 6 , 1830 . Mv DEAREST H I fear I caused you a disappointment by not writing to you yesterday afternoon , but as it was not until bctween five and six o'clock that I learned we were not going to Cork , when I thought of writing you to that effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope still that Dali and I may be able to come to Ardgillan again , but . we can not leave my father alone here , and his departure for Liverpool is at present quite uncertain . I have been trying to reason myself into patience , notwithstanding a very childish inclination to cry about it , which I think I will indulge because I shall he able to be so much more reasonable without this stupid lump in my throat . I hope I may see you again , dear H- . You are wrong when you say you can not be of service to me ; I can judge better of the value of your intercourse to me than you can , and I wish I could have the advantage of more of it before I plunge back into " toil and trouble . " I have two very opposite feelings about my present avocation : utter dislike to it and everything connected with it , and an upbraiding sense of ingratitude when I reflect how prosperous and smooth my entrance upon my career has been . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitually what only occasionally occurs to me now , as a comfort and support , that since it was right for me to embrace this profession , it is incumbent upon me to banish all selfish re* , rets about the surrender of my personal tastes and feelings , which must be sacrificed to real and useful results for myself and others . You see , I write as 1 talk , still about myself ; and I am sometimes afraid that my very desire to improve keeps me occupied too much about myself and will make a little moral egotist of me . Will it be inconvenient to you , sister , if I bring my maid with us ? I hope not , as when we go to you we shall have done with Dublin . Perhaps Dali and I could occupy the big room together , and M the one I had before , if both are empty . I am going to bid good-by to Miss W this morninc ; I should like her to like me ; I believe I should value her friendship as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grow on a steep ascent : while we toil up and our eyes are fixed on the summit , we unconsciously grasp and lean upon them for support and assistance on our way . God bless you , dear H . I hope to be with you soon , but can not say at present bow soon that may he . F. A. K. A very delightful short visit to my friend at Ardgillan preceded my resuming my theatrical work at Liverpool , whence I wrote her the following letter : LIvERPOOL , August 19 , 1830 . D All H- : I received your letter about an hour ago , at rehearsal , and though I read it with rather dim eyes , I managed to swallow my tears and go on with Mrs. Beverley . The depth and solemnity of your feelings , my dear H- , on those important subjects of which we have so often spoken together , almost make me fear , sometimes , that I am not so much impressed as I ought to he with their awfulness . I humbly hope I fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to love than to fear , that my nature instinctively fastens on those aspects of relioion which inspire confidence and impart support , rather than those which impress with dread . I was thinking the other day how constantly in all our prayers the loftiest titles of might are added to that name of names , " Our Father , " and yet his power is always less present to my mind than his mnercy and love . You tell me I do not know you , and that may very well be , for one really knows // no one ; and when I reflect upon and attempt to analyze the various processes of my own rather shallow mind , and find them incomprehensible , I am only surprised that there should be so much mutual affection in a world where mutual knowledge and understanding are really impossible . For your sake I wish my brains were more on a par with yours ; though to myself my infcriority is gratifyin* , rather than otherwise , for it is pleasant to feel weaker and less gifted than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look up to and rely upon them . This is no mock humility , dear H- , you know , nor am I at all disposed to quarrel with my own peculiar gifts ; but I think my small plot of cultivable ground better fitted to produce flowers , or even fruit ( gooseberries , for instance ) , than the bread which is the staff of life . My side-ache was much better yesterday . I believe it was caused by the pain of leaving you and Ardgillan ; any stroug emotion causes it , and I remember when I last left Edinbur*h having an attack of it that brought on erysipelas . You say you wish to know how Juliet does . Why , very well , poor thing . She had a very fine first house indeed , and her success has been as great as you could wish it ; out of our ten nights ' engagement , Romeo and Juliet is to be given four times ; it has already been acted three successive nights to very great houses . To-night it is The Gamester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchester , and on Monday here again . You will hardly imagine how irksome it was to me to be once more in my stage-trappings , and in the glare of the theatre instead of the blessed sunshine in the country , and to hear the murmur of congregated human beings instead of that sound of many waters , that wonderful sea-song , that is to me like the voice of a dear friend . I made a great effort to conquer this feeling of repugnance to my work , and thought of my dear Mrs. Harry , whom I have seen , with a heart and mind torn with anxiety , leave poor Lizzy on vdiat seemed almost a death-bed , to go and do her duty at the theatre . That was something like a trial . There was a poor old lady , of more than seventy years of ace , who acted as my nurse , who helped also to rouse me from my selfish morbidness - ac , e and infirmity laboring in the same path with rather more cause for weariness and disgust than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for herself , while I am the means of helping my own dear people , and many others ; she toils on , unnoticed and neglected , while my exertions are stimulated and rewarded by success and the approval of every one about me , and yet my task is sadly distasteful to me ; it seems such useless work that but for its very useful pecuniary results I think I would rather make shoes . You tell me of the comfort you derive , under moral depression , from picking stones and weeds out of your 0arden . I am afraid that antidote would prove insufficient for me ; the weeds would very soon lie in heaps in my lap , and the stones accumulate in little mountains all round me , while my mind was sinking into contemplations of the nature of slow quicksands . Violent bodily exercise , riding , or climbing up steep and rugged pathways are my best remedies for the blue devils . My father has received a pressing invitation from Lord and Lady W- to go to their place , Heaton , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall only go there ( if at all ) for a day or two , as we can hardly avoid ( loin* so altogether , for they are pressing for the fulfillment of a promise which it seems my father made some time ago , without much expecting that it would be insisted upon . You say to me in your last letter that you could not live at the rate I do ; but my life is very different now from what it was while with you . I am silent and quiet and oppressed with irksome duties , and altogether a different creature from your late companion by the sea-shore . It is true that that was my natural condition , but if you were here with me now , in the midst of all these unnatural sights and sounds , I do not think I should 1876. 605 // weary you with my overflowing life and spirits , as 1 fear I did at Ardgillan . I was as happy there as the birds that fly in the clear sky above the sea , and much happier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which mere existence is in such scenes . I am glad Lily made and wore the wreath of lilac blossoms ; I was sure it would become her . Give her my love and thanks for ha.vinc* done as I asked her . Remember me to Mrs. K- ; I am glad she approvcd of Bayard 's cerebral development . Bayard was a favorite horse . I was won by the expression of his face . I am sorry now you did not put me upon him for a few minutes on the lawn . I should have sat very passively on his hack , and he is too noble-natured to have taken advantage of my want of power over him ; I have great faith in his fooks , and will ride him the next time I am with you . Oh , do not wish Ardgillan fifteen miles from London ! Even for the sake of seeing you , I would not bring you near the smoke and dirt and comparative confinement of such a situation ; I would not take you from your sea and sky and trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly it is the natural evil of the human mind , and not the supernatural agency in the story of its development , that makes Macbeth so terrible ; it is the hideousness of a wicked soul , into which enter more foul ingredients than are held in the witches ' caldrou of abominations , that makes the play so tremendous . I wish we had read that great work together . How it contrasts with what we did read , The Tempest , that brightest creation of a wholesome genius in its hour of happiest inspiration ! I am so sorry for the loss of Mr. H s election and his sister 's disappointment . She must have felt it sadly . I believe some people think it presumptuous to pray for any one but themselves ; but it seems to me strange to share every feeling with those we love and not associate them with our best and holiest aspirations ; to remember them everywhere but there where it is of the utmost importance to us all to be remem Old Woman 's Gossip . November , bered ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implore in their behalf the Giver of all good . I think I pray even more fervently for those I love than for myself . Pray for me , my dear H and God bless you and give you strength and peace . Your affectionate F. A. K. I have not seen the railroad yet ; if you do not write soon to me , we shall be gone to Manchester . My objection to the dramatic profession on the score of its uselessness , in this letter , reminds me of what my mother used to tell me of Miss Brunton , who afterwards became Lady Craven ; a very eccentric as well as attractive and charmin * woman , who contrived , too , to be a very charming actress , in spite of a prosaical dislike to her business , which used to take the peculiar and rather alarmin* turn of suddenly , in the midst of a scene , saying aside to her fellow-actors , " What nonsense all this is ! Suppose we do n't go on with it . " This singular expostulation my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden exit of her lively companion , in the middle of her part . Miss Brunton , however , had self-command enough to go on acting till she became Countess of Craven , and left off the nonsense of the stage for the earnestness of high life . A very serious cause for depression had added itself to the weariness of spirit with which my ( listaste for my profession often affected me . While at Liverpool , I received a letter from my brother John which filled me with surprise and vexation . After his return from Germany lie had expressed his determination to go into the church ; and we all s pposed him to be in the country , zealously engaged in the necessary preparatory studies . Infinite , therefore , was my astonishment to receive from him a letter dated from Algeciraz , in Spain , telling me that he and several of his college companions , Sterling , Barton , French , and Boyd among others , had determined to lend the aid of their enthusiastic sympathy to the cause of liberty in Spain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by the rash and ill-fated rising of General Torridos against the Spanish government , that protean nightmare which in one form or another of bigotry and oppression has ridden that unfortunate country up to a very recent time , when civil war has again interfered with apparently little prospect of any better result . My distress at receiving such unexpected news from my brother was aggravate ( I by his forbidding me to write to him or speak of his plans and proceedings to any one . Tbis concealment , which would have been both difficult and repugnant to me , was rendered impossible by the circumstances under which his letter reaciie ( 1 me , and we all bore toge ther , as well as we could , this severe disappointment and the cruel anxiety of receiving no further intelligence from John for a considerable time . I was bitterly grieved by this letter , which clearly indicated that the sacred profession for which my brother had begun to prepare himself , and in which we had hoped to see him erelong honorably and usefully laboring , was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal career which he had renounced for it . Richard Trench brought home a knowledge of the Spanish tongue which has given to his own some beautiful translations of Calderon 's masterpieces ; and his early crusade for the enfranchisement of Spain has not militated against the well-deserved distinction he has achieved in the high calling to which lie devoted himself . With my brother , however , the case was different . This romantic expedition canceled all his purposes and prospects of entering the church , and Alfred Tennyson 's fine sonnet addressed to him when he first ( letermined to dedicate himself to the service of the temple is all that bears witness to that short-lived consecration : it was poetry , but not prophecy . MANcuEsTER , September 3 , 1830 . M* DEAREST H- : I received your letter aud the pretty Balbriggan stockings , for which I thank you very much , quite safely . I have not been able to 607 put pen to paper till now , and even now do not know whether I can do more than just tell you that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his letter to me he said that he would write home whenever he could do so safely , but that no letter of ours would reach him ; and indeed I do not now know where he may be . From the first moment of hearing this intelligence , which has amazed us all so much , I have felt less miserable than I could have thought possible under the circumstances ; my mind , I think , has hardly taken hold of the truth of what has come so unexpectedly upon me . The very impossibility of relieving one 's suspense , I suppose , compels one not to give way to its worst suggestions , which may , after all , be unfounded . I can not communicate with him , and must wait patiently till he can write again ; he is in God 's hand , and I hope and pray that he may be guided and protected . My great anxiety is to keep all knowledge of his having even gone abroad , if possible , from my niother . She is not in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impossibility of ascertaining anything about him at present , which helps me to remain tolerably collected , would almost drive her distracted . She believes him , as we all did till lately , on a visit to Mr. Donne , in Norfolk ; and until my father is with her to prepare and support her for the intelligance , I shall be most anxious it should be kept from her . The news of the revolt in the Netherlands , together with the fact that one of our dear ones is away from us in scenes of peril and disturbance , has , I think , shaken my father 's purpose of sending Henry to Heidelberg . It is a bad thin to leave a boy of eighteen so far from home control and influences , and he is of a sweet , affectionate , gentle disposition , that makes him liable to be easily led and persuaded by the examples and counsels of others . Moreover , he is at the age when boys are always in some love - scrape or other , and if he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at such a distance from us all , I should not be surprised to hear Old Woman 's aoss*p. // that he had constituted himself the lord and master of some blue-eyed frdulein with whom he could not exchange a dozen words in her own vernacular , and had become a dis-respectable paler familias at nineteen . In the midst of all the worry and anxiety which these considerations occasion , we are living here a most unsettled , flurried life of divided work and pleasure . We have gone out to Heaton every morning after rehearsal , and come in with the W s in the evening , to act . I think to-night we shall sleep there after the play , and come in with the W s after dinner to-morrow . They had expected us to spend some days with them , and perhaps after our Birmingham engagement we may be able to do so . ileaton is a charming specimen of a fine countryhouse , and Lady NV- a charming specimen of a fine lady ; she is handsome , stately , and gentle . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever , or rather accomplished , and refined . They are both of them very kind to me , and most pressing in their entreaties that we should return and stay as long as we can with them . To-morrow is my last night here ; on Monday we act at Birmingham , and my father thinks we shall be able to avail ourselves of the invitation of our Liverpool friends , and witness the opening of the railroad . This would be a memorable pleasure , the opportunity of which should certainly not be neglected . I have been gratified and interested this morning and yesterday by going over one of the largest manufactories of this place , where i have seen a number of astonishing processes , from the fusing of iron in its roughest state to the construction of the most complicated machinery and the work that it performs . I have been examining and watching and admiring power-looms , and spinningjennies , and every species of work accomplished by machinery . But what pleased me most of all was the process of casting iron . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in powerful engines were many of them cast in molds of sand ? - inconstant , shifting , restless sand ! The strongest iron of all , though , gets its strength beaten into it . BIRMINGHAM , September 7 , 1830 . You see , my dearest H- , how my conversations are liable to be cut short in the midst ; just at the point where I broke off , Lord and Lady NV came to fetch us out to Heaton , and until this moment , when I am quietly seated in Birmingham , I have not been able to resume the thread of my discourse . I once was told of a man who had been weather-bound at some port , whence he was starting for the West Indies ; he was standing on the wharf , telling a long story to a friend , when a fair wind sprang up and he had to hurry on board ; two years after , returning thence , the first person he met on landing was his friend , whom he accosted with , " Oh , well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I can not do that , for my mind has dwelt on new objects of interest since I began this letter , and my visit to ileaton has swept sand and iron and engines all back into the great warehouse at Manchester , for a time , whence I may draw them at some future day for your edification . Lady NV possesses , to a great degree , beauty , that " tangible good " which you admire so much ; she has a bright , serene countenance , and very sweet and noble eyes and forehead . Her manner is peculiarly winning and simple , and to me it was cordially kind , and even affectionate . During the two days which were all we could spare for Heaton , I walked and rode and sang and talked , and was so well amused and pleased that I hope after our week 's work is over here we may return there for a short time . I must tell you of a curious little bit of ancientry which I saw at Heaton , which greatly delighted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year , generally the beginning of autumn , it was formerly the wont in some parts of Lancashire to go round with sundry rustic mummeries to all the churches , and strew them with rushes . The religious intention of the custom has passed away , // but a pretty rural procession , which I witnessed , still keeps up the memory of it hereabouts . I was sittingat my window , looking out over the lawn , which slopes charmingly on every side down to the house , when the still summer air was suddenly filled with the sound of distant shouts and music , and presently the quaint pageant drew in sight . First came an immense wagon piled with rushes in a stack-like form , on the top of which sat two men holding two huge nosegays . This was drawn by a team of Lord W-* s finest farm-horses , all covered with scarlet cloths and decked with ribbons and bells and flowers . After this came twelve country lads and lasses , dancing the real old morris - dance , with their handkerchiefs flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could command for the occasion . After them followed a very good village baad , and then a species of flowery canopy , under which walked a man and woman covered with finery , who , Lord W- told me , represented Adam and Eve . The procession closed with a fool fantastically dressed out , and carrying the classical bladder at the end of his stick . They drew up before the house and danced their morris - dance for us . The scraps of old poetry which came into my head , the contrast between this pretty picture of a bygone time and the modern but by no means unpicturesque group assembled under the portico , filled my mind with the pleasantest ideas , and I was quite sorry when the rural pageant wound up the woody heights again , and the last shout and peal of music came back across the sunny lawn . I am very glad I saw it . I have visited , too , Hopwood Hall , an enchanting old house in the neighborhood of Heaton , some parts of which are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy but comfortable oak rooms , the beautiful and curious carving of which might afford one days of entertaining study , the low , latticed windows and intricate , winding , up - and - down passages , contrasted and combined with all the elegant adornments of modern luxury , and the pretty country in which the house is situated , all delighted me . I must leave off writing to you now ; I have to dress , and dine at three , which I am sorry for . Thank you for Mrs. Hemans 's beautiful lines , which made me cry very heartily . I have not been altogether well for the last few days , and am feelin : , tired and out of spirits ; if I can get a few days ' quiet enjoyment of the country at Heaton , I shall feel fitter for my winter work than I do now . MANcHEsTER , September 20 , 1830 . M* DEAREST H I did not answer your letter which I received at Heaton , because the latter part of my stay there was much engrossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing , and being exceedingly busy all day long about nothing . I have just left it for this place , where we stop to-night on our way to Stafford ; Heaton was looking lovely in all the beauty of its autumnal foliage , lighted by bright autumnal skies , and I am rather glad I did not answer you before , as it is a consolatory occupation to do so now . I am going with my mother to stay a day at Stafford with my godmother , an old and attached friend of hers , after which we proceed into Buckinghamshire to join my aunt Dall and Henry and my sister , who are staying there ; and we shall all return to London together for the opening of the theatre , which I think will take place on the first of next month . I could have wished to be going immediately to my work ; I should have preferred screwing my courage to my professional tasks at once , instead of loitering by way of pleasure on the road . Besides that , in my visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very agreeable to me . My mother , however , made a great sacrifice in giving up her fishing , which she was enjoying very much , to come and chaperon me at Heaton , where there is no fishing so good as at Aston Clinton , so that I am bound to submit cheerfully to her wishes in the present instance . But I do not like Lady D and I do not like that rollicking parson , her son , and I do not like fishing , for 1876. 609 // a combination of reasons that , I am sure , will make you laugh . I do not think it right to destroy life merely for amusement , and *f I did , the wretches do n't come to be killed fast enough to please me . You probably have by this time heard and read accounts of the opening of the railroad , and the fearful accident which occurred at it , for the papers are full of nothing else . The accident you mention did occur , but though the unfortunate man who was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . I will tell you something of the events on the 15th , as , though you may be acquainted with the circumstances of poor Mr. Iluskisson 's death , none but an eye-witness of the whole scene can form a conception of it . I told you that we had had places given to us , andit was the main purpose of our returnino ' from Birmingham to Manchester to be present at what promised to be one of the most striking events in the scientific annals of our country . We started on Wednesday last , to the number of about eight hundred people , in carriages constructed as I before described to you . The most intense curiosity and excitement prevailed , and , though the weather was uncertain , enormous masses of densely packed people lined the road , shoutin0 and waving hats and handkerchiefs as we flew by them . What with the sight and sound of these cheering multitudes and the tremendous velocity with which we were home past them , my spirits rose to the true champagne height , and I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . I had been unluckily separated from my mother in the first distribution of places , but by an exchange of seats which she was enabled to make she rejoined me when I was at the height of my ecstasy , which was considerably damped by finding that she was frightened to death , and intent upon nothing but devising means of escaping from a situation which appeared to her to threaten with instant annihilation herself and all her travelingcompanions . While I was chewing the cud of this disappointment , which was rather bitter , as I had expected her to be as delighted as myself with our excursion , a man flew by us , calling out through a speaking-trumpet to stop the engine , for that somebody in the directtors ' carriage had sustained an injury . We were all stopped accordingly , and presently a hundred voices were heard exclaiming that Mr. Huskisson was killed ; the confusion that ensued is indescribable : the calling out from carriage to carriage to ascertain the truth , the contrary reports which were sent back to us , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ur* , ent demands for surgical assistance , created a sudden turmoil that was quite sickening . At last we distinctly ascertained that the unfortunate man 's thigh was broken . From Lady W , who was in the duke 's carriage and within three yards of the sl ) ot where the accident happened , I had the following details the horror of witnessing which we were spared through our situation behind the great carriage . The engine had stopped to take in a supply of water , and several of the gentlemen in the directors ' carriage had jumped out to look about them . Lord W , Count Batthyany , Count Matuscenitz , and Mr. Huskisson among the rest were standing talking in the middle of the road , when an engine on the other line , which was parading up and down merely to show its speed , was seen coming down upon them like lightning . The most active of those in peril sprang back into their seats ; Lord W saved his life only by rushing behind the duke 's carriage , and Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine all but touching his heels as he did so ; while poor Mr. Huskisson , less active from the effects of age and ill health , bewildered too by the frantic cries of " Stop the engine ! Clear the track ! " that resounded on all sides , completely lost his head , looked helplessly to the right and left , and was instantaneously prostrated by the fatal machine , which dashed down like a thunderbolt upon him , and passed over his leg , smashing and mangling it in the most horrible way . ( Lady Wsaid // she distinctly heard the crushing of the bone . ) So terrible was the effect of the appalling accident that , except that *hastly " crushing " and poor Mrs. Huskisson 's piercing shriek , not a sound was heard or a word uttered among the immediate spectators of the catastrophe . Lord W was the first to raise the poor sufferer , and calling to aid his surgical skill , which is considerable , he tied up the severed artery , and for a time , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then placed in a carriage with his wife and Lord W , and the engine having been detached from the director 's carria , , e conveyed them to Manchester . So great was the shock produced upon the whole party by this event that the Duke of Wellin*ton declared his intention not to proceed , but to return immediately to Liverpool . However , upon its being represented to him that the whole population of Manchester had turned out to witness the procession , and that a disappointment might give rise to riots and disturbances , he consented to go on , and gloomily enough the rest of the journey was accomplished . We had intended returning to Liverpool by the railroad , but Lady W- , who seized upon me in the midst of the crowd , persuaded us to accompany her home , which we *ladly did . Lord W did not return till past ten o'clock , at which hour he brought the intelligence of Mr. Huskisson 's death . I need not tell you of the sort of whispering awe which this event threw over our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror excited by it , I could not help feeling how evanescent the effect of it was , after all . The shuddering terror of seeing our fellow-creature thus struck down by our side , and the breathless thankfulness for our own preservation , rendered the first evening of our party at Heaton almost solemn ; but the next day the occurrence became a subject of earnest , it is true , but free discussion ; and after that was alluded to with almost as little apparent feeling as if it had not passed under our eyes , and within the space of a few hours . I have heard nothing of my brother ; my mother distresses me by talking of him , ignorant as she is of what would give her so much more anxiety about him . I feel , while I listen to her , almost guilty of deceit ; and yet I am sure we were right in doing for her what she can not do for herself , keeping her mind as long as possible in comparative tranquillity about him . Our Sunday at Heaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening prayers to the whole family , visitors , and servants assembled ; a ceremony which , combined and contrasted with so much of the pomps and vanities of the world , gave me a pleasant feeling towards these people , who live in the midst of them without forgetting better things . I mean to make studying German and drawing ( and endeavoring to abate my self-esteem ) my principal occupations this winter . I have met at Heaton Lord Francis Leveson Gower , the translator of Faust . I like him very much ; he is a young man of a great deal of talent , with a charming , gentle manner , and a very handsome , sweet face . Good-by , dear H Write to me soon , and direct to No. 79 Great Russell Street , Bloomsbury . I should like to find a letter from you there , waiting for me . Our arrangement for driving in to the theatre from Heaton compelled me once or twice to sit down to dinner in my theatrical costume , a device for saving time in dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the persons I was surrounded by were all sin* , ularly kind and amiable to me , and my appearing among them in these picturesque fancy-dresses was rather a source of amusement to us all . Many yeoxs after , a lady who was not staying in the house but was invited from the neighborhood to dine at Heaton one evening , told me how amazed she had been on the sudden wide openin' , of the drawingroom doors to see me enter , in full medim*eval costume of black satin and velvet , cut Titan fashion , and with a long , sweeping train , for which apparition she had not been previously prepared . Of 1876. 611 // Lord W- I have already spoken , and have only to add that in spite of his character of a mere dissipated man of fashion he had an unusual taste for and knowled : , e of music , and had composed some that is not destitute of merit ; he played well on the organ , and delighted in that noble instrument , a fine specimen of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he possessed an accomplishment of a very different order , a remarkable proficiency in anatomy , which he had studied very thoroughly . He had made himself enough of a practical surgeon to be able , on the occasion of the fatal accident which befell Mr. Huskisson on the day of the opening of the railroad , to save the unfortunate gentleman from bleeding to death on the spot , by tying up the femoral artery , which had been severed . His fine ridin in the huntin* ,  --  field and on the race - course was a less peculiar talent among his special associates . Lady W was strikingly handsome in person and extremely attractive in her manners . She was tall an ( l graceful , the upper part of her face , eyes , brow , and forehead were radiant and sweet , and , though the rest of her features were not regularly beautiful , her countenance was noble and her smile had a peculiar charm of expression at once winning and mischievous . My father said she was very like her fascinating mother , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , petting me almost like a spoiled child , dressing me in her own exquisite riding-habit and mounting me on her own favorite horse , which was all very delightful to me . My father and mother probably thought the acquaintance of these distinguished members of the highest English society advantageous to me in some respects , as calculated to keep up the fashion of enthusiasm about me ; they may have thought it in other ways likely to advance my worldly interests , and I have no doubt they felt both pride and pleasure in the notice bestowed upon me hy persons so much my superiors in rank , and had a natural sympathy in my enjoyment of all the gay grandeur Old JYoman ' 8 Gossip . November , and kindly indulgence by which I was surrounded at Heaton . I now take the freedom to doubt how far they were judicious in allowing me to be so taken out of my own proper social sphere . It encouraged my taste for the luxurious refinement and elegant magnificence of a mode of life never likely to be mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of my professional duties behind the scenes , and the sham splendors of the stage . The guests at Heaton of whom I have a distinct remembrance were Mr. and Lady Harriet Baring , afterwards Lord and Lady Ashburton . I knew them both in after-life , and liked them very much ; Mr. Baring was highly cultivated and extremely amiable ; his wife was much cleverer than he , and in many respects a remarkable woman . The beautiful sisters , Anne and Isabella Forrester , with their brother Cecil , were at Heaton at this time . They were celebrated beauties : the elder , afterwards Countess of Chesterfield , was a brunette ; the younger , who married Colonel Anson , the most renowned lady - killer of his day , was a blonde ; and they were both of them exquisitely pretty , and used to remind me of the French quatrain , - " Vous *tee belle , et votre eceur est belle ; Entre vous deux , tout choix serait bien doux . LAmour dtalt blond , comme vous , Mais ii aimait une @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as faces , and dressed peculiarly and so as to display them to the greatest advantage . Long and very full skirts gathered or plaited all round a pointed waist were then the fashion ; these lovely ladies , with a righteous scorn of all disfigurement of their beauty , wore extremely short skirts , which showed their thoroughbred feet and ankles , and were perfectly plain round their waists and over their hips ; with bodies so low on the shoulders and hosom that there was certainly as little as possible of the perfections of their beautiful persons concealed . I remember wishing it were consistent with her comfort and the general decorum of modern manners that Isabella Forrester 's gown could only slip entirely off her exquisite bust . I suppose I felt as // poor Gibson , the sculptor , who , lookin , , at his friend and pupil 's , Miss Hosmer ' s , statue of Beatrice Cenci , the back of which was copied from that of Lady A- T , exclaimed in his slow , measured , deliberate manner , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my seeing that beautiful back ! " Count and Countess Batthyany ( she the former widow of the celebrated Austrian general , Bubna , a most distin , , uished and charmin , woman ) were visitors at Heaton at this time , as was also Henry Greville , with whom I then first became acquainted , and who from that time until his death was my kind and constant friend . He was for several years attached to the embassy in Paris , and afterwards had some small nominal post in the household of the Duchess of Cambrid , e , and was Gentleman Gold-Stick in waiting at court . He was not in any way intellectually remarkable ; he had a passion for music and was one of the best society singers of his day , being ( that , to me , incomprehensible thin , , ) a mUomaae for one kind of music only . Passionately fond of Italian operatic music , he did not understand and therefore cordially detested German music , - Beethoven , its preeminent genius , preiiiminently . He was absolutely without affectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was obliged to believe that he really had but one ear to his head . I do not think that he would have gone even the length of admitting with Costa that Beethoven 's Leonora was " gran bella cosa , " even with the great Italian leader 's addition , " 6 gran seccatura. * ' He had a passion for the stage ; but though he . delighted in acting he did not particularly excel in it . He had a taste for everything elegant and refined , and his small house in May-Fair was a perfect casket full of gems . He was a natural exquisite , and perfectly simple and unaffected , a great authority in all matters of fashion both in Paris and in London , and a universal favorite , especially with the women , in the highest society of both capitals . Every one of the various beautiful chairs in his drawing-rooms had been wrought by a different pair of fair hands especially for him , and his , eat and fine lady friends filled them with exquisite flowers and their own radiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or musical parties . His social position , friendly intimacy with several of the most celebrated musical and dramatic artists of his day , passion for political and private gossip , easy and pleasant style of letter-writing , and general rather supercilious fastidiousness used sometimes to i*mind me of Horace Walpole . He had a singularly kind heart and amiable nature , for a life of mere frivolous pleasure had not impaired the one or the other . His serviceableness to his friends was unwearied , and his generous liberality towards all whom he could help either with his interest , his trouble , or his purse was unfailing . I have spoken in my last letter to Miss S of seeing a rush-bearing , and an exceedingly pretty sight it was . All the information I could obtain with regard to this picturesque mummery was that it had been observed from time immemorial in that part of Lancashire under the name of the rush-bearing , and had originated in the practice of strewing the church with rushes , which obtained in earlier times , when that species of carpet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the banquet and ball rooms of palaces and at the greatest court and civic festivities . The whole gay party assembled at Heaton , my mother and myself included , went to Liverpool for the opening of the railroad . The throng of money ; and glad and thankful were we to put up with and be put up in a tiny garret by our old friend , Mr. Radley , of the Adelphi , which many would have given twice what we paid to obtain . The day opened gloriously , and never was an innumerable concourse of sight-seers in better humor than the surging , swaying crowd that lined the railroad with living faces . How dreadfully that brilliant opening was over1876. 613 // cast I have described in the letter given above . After this disastrous event the day became overcast , and as we neared Manchester the sky grew cloudy and dark , and it began to rain . The vast concourse of people who had assembled to witness the triumphant arrival of the successful travelers was of the lowest order of mechanics and artisans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontent with the government at that time prevailed . Groans and hisses greeted the carriage , full of influential personages , in which the Duke of Wellin* , ton sat . High above the grim and grimy crowd of scowling faces , a loom had been erected , at which sat a tattered , starved-looking weaver , evidently set there as a representative man , to protest against this triumph of machinery , and the gain and glory which the wealthy Liverpool and Manchester men were likely to derive from it . The contrast between our departure from Liverpool and our arrival at Manchester was one of the most striking things I ever witnessed . The news of Mr. Huskisson 's fatal accident spread immediately , and his death , which did not occur till the evening , was anticipated by rumor . A terrible cloud covered this great national achievement , and its success , which in every respect was complete , was atoned for to the Nemesis of good fortune by the sacrifice of the first financial statesman of the country . Frances Anne Kemble .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
