TIlE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN ENGLAND . Jr is generally felt that the history of the British Constitution has arrived at a crisis interesting to political observers : and the interest appears in effect to lie in this , that the British nation , with whatever of political capacity and aptitude it may possess , is now , or will very soon be , brought fairly face to face with the elective principle of government , and compelled to found upon that principle the institutions of the future . Though the term British Constitution is so familiar , and though it was to the British government that the term Constitutional was first applied , England has , properly speaking , no Constitution . She has no instrumeut like the Constitution of the United States , or those recently framed by most of the European nations , setting forth her polity and defining the powers and fanctions of its members . She has a series of political documents of great importance and renown , embodying the limitations imposed by the Parliament from 1*me to time on the power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Habeas Corpus Act , the Bill of Right , the Acts of Parliament securing the independence of the Judiciary . The Great Charter has been called a Constitution . *t is a document of the highest import*nce not only in English but in univertal history , being the first compact between King and People , the first formal submission of royal authority to the supremacy of law . But it does not set forth a polity ; it only restricts the royal power . The absence of a written constitution has , in fact , been the condition of English development . Ilad the Great Charter been a constitution it would , while curbing John 's tyranny , have left the king prerogatives , legislative and judicial as well as executive , which would now be deemed almost despotic ; and these pre rogatives , being secured by a written compact , could have been reduced only by a revolutionary struggle , from which the nation would have shrunk , and in which , if it 1*ad taken place , the king , having the written law upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , England has had room to grow , and . the leaders of progress , while they were really retrenching prerogative and extending liberty , have always been able to think and say that the Constitution was in their favor . The constitutional past to which Pym and Ilampden appealed was partly mythical ; and being so , it served its purpose better than it would have done if it had been wholly real . They could find in it support for any thing which they needed ; they could find support-for the doctrine that the command of the national army did not belong to the king , though the Barons who extorted the Great Charter wonid have pronounced without hesitation that the command of the national army did belong to the king , and would certainly have secured it to him if they had framed a constitution . The British constitution is in fact the distribution of power between the kin6 , the nobility , and the commons . And this distribution , though formally unchanged and treated by writers on constitutional law as something peculiarly fixed and stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitutional History of England maybe described as the gradual transfer of power from the king to Parliament and from - the Lords to the Commons ; in other words , as a gradual transition , masked by monarcliical and aristocratic forms , from hereditary to elective government . Even after the Great Charter , the king retained the exclusive initiative ii ? legislation , and it would be difficult to maintain that he did not possess any lebisla // tive power of a more direct kind . He retained the entire executive power , and exercised it either in his own person , or through ministers freely chosen by himself . He also retained the entire judicial power , deciding all cases either personally , as in the language of our law , which speaks of trials as held " before the king himself at Westminster , " he is still supposed to do ; or through judges appointed by himself and removable at his pleasure ; so that for the people , if not for the Barons , he could make tile law pretty much what he pleased . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three ordinary aids , all extraordinary aids requiring the assent of the Great Council : but he had still his own domains and his lucrative prerogatives as feudal suzerain , with some less regular sources of revenue or profit , such as purveyance and the Jews : and these were sufficient , with prudence and abstention from foreign wars , to render him fiscally independent . He had the command of the feudal militia , and the power of calling it out at his pleasure , for the prescribed term . The real limitation of his authority was not so much the law as tile military strength of the Barons . When , by the destruction of the feudal nobility in the Wars of the Roses , that pressure was removed , the Crown , without any tangible act of usurpation , started at once into almost despotic power , which it retained till the combined growth of Puritanism and the middle class again turned the political scale . The real question letween the nation dnd the Stuarts was whether the king or the Parliament should rule . That question was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolutiog of 1688 . William the Third , in assenting to the Declaration of Right , resigned the dispensing power , for which the Stuarts had desperately contended , thereby admitting that the monarchy was entirely subject to the law made by Parliament . The same reign was marked by the last important exercise of the legislative veto which , with the alleged dispensing power , was the only remnant of legislative antliority left in the king . William the Third administered in his own person the executive department of Foreign Affairs , acting in that department without the advice and sometimes without the knowledge of his ministers ; an assumption of authority favored in his case by his personal position as the head not only of England as of a great European confederation , formed to resist the aggrandizement of France . But since William 's time , this , with all other functions of tile executive , has passed entirely into the hands of the king 's constitutional advisers , as they are called ; that is , of ministers imposed on huh by the Parliament without reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they do . By the final change of the tenure of the judges from one during the king 's pleasure to one during life and good behavior , with the power of removal virtually vested in Parliament , the Crown lIas in like manner been stripped of the last remnant of judicial authority ; and that authority has been completely transferred to the Parliament . An attempt was made by George III . to revive monarchical government in his own person ; and the attempt was favored during the earlier pait of his reign by the unpopul*trity of the Whig oligarchy , and during the latter part by the reaction against the excesses of the French Revolution . But tllis was rather a clandestine intrigue than an open resumlltion of power ; and it could not be carried on without the aid of a party in the house of Coi*mons called the king 's friends , and acting in corrupt subserviency to the Crown . The king 's attempt to uphold Bute as Prime *linister by his personal authority signally broke down ; and though he made Pitt minister in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lIe could uiot have kept him minister if the mqjority had remained adverse . us personal influence availed to dissuade Pitt from bringing forward *atliolic Emancipation ; hut had Pitt persisted , and had the bill passed Parliament , the king would not have dared to veto . The King of England is now politically // a mere figure-head. lie must accept the ministers tendered him by Parliament , that is , the leaders of the Parliamentary majority , and he must dismiss them and receive others in their place whenever Parliament may summon him to do so . He must be entirely guided by these advisers , or rather he must allow them to act for themselves , in all matters legislative and executive . When a ministry resigns , its chief names to the king the person for whom he is to send to form a new administration ; and , by the rule of public life , the person named must be the leader of the party by which the government was turned out . The prerogative of calling and dissolving Parliament , like all other prerogatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom it is exercised under the established limitation that a minister must not more than once appeal to the country by a dissolution of Parliament , but must resign , as Sir Robert Peel did in 1834 , if he is defeated in a Parliament of his own calling . The Prime Minister makes all the appointments , subject only to the opinion of Parliament , or rather to that of his own party . Sir Robert Peel , the most loyal of ministers , whose great boast it was that he had served four sovereigns , would not allow the Queen to appoint her own ladies of the bedchamber . The king is not present , nor would the ministers allow him to be present , at the meetings of the cabinet . It has been said that his exclusion originated in George the First 's ignorance of the English language , but it was obviously connected with the general alteration in the character of the government . The Commander-in-chief of the army is still appointed by the sovereign , and is un.parliamentary , not going out of office with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has at times caused some uneasiness . But in the first place not a soldier can be paid without a vote of money by the House of Commons ; in the second place the Mutiny Act , upon which the existence of the army depends , is passed only for a year at a timef so that it requires annual renewal ; and i.i the third place recent reforms have transferred , or are transferring , the military administration almost entirely from the office of the Commander-in-chief to that of a Parliamentary Minister of War . The prerogative of war and peace remains in the Crown , the assent of Parliamerit not being necessary to a treaty on a declaration of war ; but the Foreign Minister who exercises the prerogative is , like his colleagues , responsible to Parliament . This is , how ever , perhaps the most substantial relic of the monarchical system . It is the source of some awkwardness in diplomacy , the power of makIng treaties being in the Crown alone , while Parliament alone can practically give tl*ein effect , as appeared in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obliged to own that the engagement into which , in exercise of his constitutional authority , he had entered on behalf of the nation , would be practically of no value unless Parliament chose to vote the forces for the maintenance of the guarantee . Socially , the sovereign , as the head of English society , may still exercise great influence for good or evil . George IV . exercised great influence for evil ; the present Queen has exercised great influence for good ; and it is pleasant to think how her domestic virttie has continued to shine , a quiet but unextinguished light of peace and good-will amidst all the storms which have disturbed the friendly relations between the two branches of her race . But , politically , the monarchy is now nothing but *a figure-head . The kings do not know this ; the people hardly know it . The kings read papers , canvass appointments , and fancy that measures emanate from themselves ; so complete is the veil of constitutional illusion which conceals from them their real position . The people pray to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that their kings may have grace to rule them well , talk about the character of the heir to the throne as though the salvation of the country depended on it , and really feel a warm sentiment of loyalty towards a governor whom they would not permit to do any act of government . // But in fact public documents might almost as well be signed by a stamp , which would cost nothing , and would never cause the nation anxiety by falling into the excesses of youth . Uninterrupted experience in the forms of business may gIve the king , if he is a man of any ability , some slight influence over his ministers , who are always changing ; but in great affairs there can be no doubt that the policy of the nation both at home and abroad , during the last half century , has been the opposite of that which would have been dictated by the personal wishes of the kings . As the king has become a figure-head in England , the governors of colonies who represent the king there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political experience , they exercise some personal influence ; and probably their intervention frequently mitigates the somewhat rough conflicts of colonial politicians . But they are bound to be guided entirely by their con stitutional advisers , the ministers imposed on them by the Colonial Parliament . One of them was recalled the other day for declaring that he would not accept as his ministers a particular set of statesmen , it being his constitutional duty to accept the leaders of the majority , whoever they might be . So that if any body is disposed to risk his life in invading Canada because it is British , he will do well to reflcct , before he leaves home , that Canada is politically British only in having a British figure-head . Through the transfer of power from the king to parliamentary ministers the executive has evidently been absorbed by the legislature . By Montesquieu and the political philosophers of his age , it was held that the separation of these two powers was essential to the existence of free government , and that the immediate consequence of their union in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet at that very time the fatal event had really taken place ; for the first two Hanoverian kings were completely in the hands of the Whig ministers who had set them on the throne , and who themselves depended on a majority in Parliament . Foreign observers might well be pardoned for not seeing what the English themselves did not see , and what a good many of them do not see now . But questions are hereby suggested as ta the soundness of political theories based on the assumption of a real division of power among the different members of a constitution . Will not one member or the other ultimately draw supreme power to itself ? Does not the legislative authority , wherever it resides , virtually comprehend the rest ? We are led to inquire also how far the framers of the American Constitution may have been influenced by the current notions respecting the British Constitution , when they took such pains to separate the executive from the legislative that the two can not be brought into harmony , in case of a divergence of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the British Constitution , the harmony between the executive and the legislative can not be interrupted , because the moment they disagree , the ministry falls . The introduction of the members of the American Cabinet into Congress obviously would not mend the matter ; it would only breed fresh con fusion , unless the President were reduced , like the British king , to a figure-head , At present he has personal power , and America is an . elective and terminable monarchy , while Great Britain is a crowned republic . Constitutional fiction has played , in the political development of England , a part analogous to that played by legal fiction in the development of Roman law . It has reconciled consecrated tradition with ratiGnal innovation , and covered the march of progress . But by mistaking our constitutional fictions for realities , and adopting them as actual modes of government , some of our continental neighbors have been led into strange paths . " To reign without governing " is a ticklish operation , requiring peculiar aptitudes and much practice both on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The constitutional king for whose instruction M. Thiers made the aphorism , found it so ; and , in spite of his personal ability , or rather in c-pnsequence of his personal ability , had at // last to get into his fiacre . English constitutional monarchy , however , seems on the whole to have been useful to Europe as a model of a transition polity , combining the royal name and personality to which the multitudes still cling , without which the multitudes in the Old World have scarcely learnt to reverence government , with the popular assemblies whose action is to mould the democracy of the future . The instrument by which Parliament drew to itself the power once vested in the king , was the power of the purse . This instrument , of course , became more powerful when a national debt had been contracted , and the annual vote of Parliament had become necessary to save the government from bankruptcy . Yet it would scarcely have sufficed to effect a radical change in the government had it not been working in accordance with the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to pass gradually from hereditary to elective institutions . The second of the two changes which form the substance of British constitutional history is the transfer of power from the House of Lords to the house of Commons . In theory , and in the pages of writers on constitutional law , the House of Lords is a branch of the legislature , collateral and * ) perfectly equal in authority to the house of Commons , saving that all grants of money must originate with the lower house . In the feudal age , it is needless to say , the House of Lords was by far the more powerful of the two . After the ruin of the old nobility in the Wars of the Roses , the importance of the Commons increased , though both houses were reduced to a state of extreme servility under the imperial sway of the Tudors . In the time of Charles I. the House of Lords was coerced by the Revolutionary party which ruled in the House of Commons , and it was at last abolished , together with the monarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fully recovered its former position , and showed that its power was at least equal to that of the Commons by throwing out the bill excluding the Roman Catholic Duke of York , afterwards James II. , from the throne , when the bill had passed the Commons by a large majority on the wings of a great electoral victory gained by the Whig party . Through the revolution of 1688 , the reign of William , and the earlier part of the reign of Anne , the House of Lords retained the same important position , and during this period it was the organ of the Whig , or what we should now call the Liberal party , which put William III . on the throne , and exercised through him the power of nominating peers , while the prospect of a Catholic reign was still alarming to the great houses which held the Church property distributed among the courtiers by Henry VIII . The House of Commons at this time was rather the organ of the Tory party , to which all the country squires and country parsons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now the great defenders of the House of Peers , that the power and dignity of that House first received a deadly blow . Twelve peers were created at once by the Tory ministers at the end of the reign of Anne , to swamp the Whig majority in the House of Lords , and carry the disgraceful treaty of Utrecht . This expedient , to which Toryism lighted the way , is now recognized as the ratio ultirnato which the opponents of Toryism may resort in case the Tory majority in the House of Lords should persist in obstructing on any vital question the progress of the nation . Formerly the importance of the House of Lords was indicated by the presence there of the heads of the government . harley and Bolingbroke both raised themselves to the peerage , though Bolingbroke was the most popular orator of the day ; and the management of the house of Commons was left to subordinate hands . But Sir Robert Walpole , the great minister of George I. and George IT . remained on system in the Commons . His example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his real power ; though his l ) opular name , " The Great Commoner , " marks that it was still a rarity to see the first man in the kingdom not a peer . It Was followed by the younger Pitt , by Canning , Peel , Palmerston , and Lord John Russell . Since Pitt 's // time , there have been several prime ministers in the House of Lords , but it is felt to be a great disadvantage to a government . No statesman of mark would now leave the house of Commons if he could help it , and Lord Salisbury manifcstly fumes in the exalted limbo to which the misfortune of his birth has consigned him . Still the house of Lords retained a good deal of power , so long as the House of Commons remained a glaringly inadequate representation of the people , which it did down to the Parliamentary Reform of 1832 . But since that measure the coequality of the two Houses has visibly ceased . In the passage of the Reform Bill of 1832 the house of Peers received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was coerced into passing it by the threat of a swamping creation of peers , the royal consent to which had been extorted by the Whig ministers . It was again virtually coerced by the Commons the other day , in the ease of the Irish Church Bill , which it passed under intimidation after having distinctly taken up an attitude of resistance . No legislation of importance is now originated in the House of Lords . The attendance is scandalously thin , and no exhortations will avail to improve it while the discussions are devoid of interest . When Lord John Russell was made a peer , Punch represented Lord Brougham as a Scottish door-keeper , greeting the new-corner with " Ye 'll find it unco dull here , Johnny . " Long since divested of the semi-liberal ebaracter which it wore in 1688 , the house of Lords has completely yielded to the natural bias of a privileged class , and its existence during the last century may be described as a perpetual struggle to arrest progress of every kind . The abolition of the slave-trade , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lords , as well as the Parliamentary Reform and the Disestablishment of the Irish Church . The House is totally unsuited for the impartial revision of legislation , being , as it is , not a fair representation of all interests , much less of the mature wisdom of the community , but merely a represen'tation of the narrow class of great landowners , w*so are swayed by a bias of the most noxious kind ; while nothing can be less conservative , in the true sense of the term , than an institution which renders it necessary for the nation , whenever vital reforms are to be carried , to lash itself up to the point of threatening with violence a branch of its legislature . The other constitutional nionarchies of Europe , in imitation of England , have adopted a second chamber , which is now regarded as indispensable ; though experience seems to suggest a doubt whether the weakening of the sense of responsibility in the popular house of the legislature does not . more than countervail the controlling influence of tho senate ; while if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be attained , without the complex machinery of tu*o chambers , by giving minorities a power of suspensive veto . In the senates of Europe , however , but a slight tincture remains of the hereditary element , and this only in one or two cases , the bulk of the senates being purely nominative or elective . The hereditary upper house of England is the last leaf on the tree ; and its lingering existence is a curious instance of the tendency of nations , which have for a time outstripped their fellows , to rest satisfied with their own progress , and ultimately to fall behind in the race . Aristocracy is dead . Like monarchy , it had its place in history , but its place knows it no more . Its moral energy in the feudal age was sustained by military and political duty , enforced by the stern exigencies of an iron time . Nothing is now left to it but privilege , which invariably saps the vigor , moral and even physical , of the privileged class . Even its manners are gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scandals of aristocratic profligacy in social life , are the marks of an incurable decay . The age of chivalry has not departed , and never will depart ; but the age of aristocratic chivalry departed long ago . In no intelligent community can such a shadow of the past long be allowed to retain a veto on the progress of a nation . // PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . It is probable that the English aristocracy will speedily be assailed in a vital part by the extension of the movement against the feudal land-laws from Ireland to England . The retention of the land in a few hands , by means of prhnogeniture and entail , or rather settlement , is essential to the existence of a landed aristocracy : but the social and economical evils of the system , which are felt with daily increasing force , have now clearly marked it for abolition . Meantime , the House of Commons has itself become , what till recently it scarcely was , a popular assembly . Down to 1832 the franchise was so restricted , and the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the government , was so large , that the House could hardly be called elective . Down to 1867 the suffrage was still confined to one seventh of the people . But the Reform Act of 1867 has established household snifrage in the cities and housahold su ( l'rage for all above the peasantry in the counties . The era of the elective principle seems now , therefore , to have fairly arrived . To the revolutionists of the last century it seemed sufficient to enthrone the elective principle and sweep away all barriers against its full operation-to establish , in fact , a despotism of the popular will . Nothing else , in their opinion , was needed in order to inaugurate a reign of perfect wisdom and happiness . They had not studied hkstory , the fonudation of political science , rationally ; history had not then been rationally written . They were a good deal misled by the false analogy of the ancient republics , which were in fact slave-owning oligarchies , where slavery solved all the questions of the Proletariat . lathe philosophy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast scene of wrong : the people , always capable of self-government , had been always ousted from it by kings who were invariably tyrants , aided by priests who were invariably impostors , and you had only to " strangle the last king with the entrails of the last priest , " that the millennium might begin . They ab solutely repndiated the past , and called the first year of their republic the Yeat One . These dreams have vanished now . Since the American and French Revolutions a century has passed , more fruitful , perhaps , than all the centurics that went before it , of discovery in the historical and political as well as in the scientific sphere . We know that inonarchy , and perhaps aristocracy , was natural and necessary to man in the early stages of his development ; that with the advance of intelligence and civilization , monarchy and aristocracy wore out , and the day of elective government arrived . The Jacobins could not have prevented the advent of elective government , and they did very little to hasten it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malignant and hypocritical passions , and with a dogma of the divinity of the sovereign people almost as false and as noxious as the old dogma of the divinity of kings . We know , too , by sad experience , that elective government , so far from being the magic cure of all political ills , is itself liable to distempers , which we have hitherto done but little to cure . As the great distemper of monarchy was tyranny , the great distempers of elective government are faction , demnagogism , and corruption . So far from having solved for us all political problems , and left us nothing to do but to preserve and admire a perfect work , the framers of constitutions in the last century did not see , nor was it possible that they should see , in what directions some of the chief political problems lay . Our political condition may be , and doubtless is , an improvement on the condition of the generations which went before us , but it is no more perfect or final than theirs . The inauguration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a manifestation , on the one hand , of the virtues of the principle , its energy , and its progressive character ; and , on the other hand , of its distempers , especially of faction and corruption . William the Third tries to combine in his government men of ability , without distinction of party , and to induce them 220 // to act together for the salvation of their imperilled country : he finds it hopeless , and is forced to form a government first of one party , thea of the other . The malignity of faction bursts forth with the utmost fury , and with perfect recklessness of the national interest and honor . A leading Whig is indicted for murder , without a shadow of foundation for the charge , by the animosity of the opposite party . The Privy Council , the old council of the realm , and still the only one known t*the law , is superseded by the Cabinet Council , an unconstitutional organ of party . In the following reign the Tory leader Bolingbroke , a sceptic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government by appealing to the persecuiing fanaticism of the Tory clergy , and sacrifices not only the interest and glory but the good faith and honor of the nation to party objects , in the disgraceful Treaty of Utrecht . On the next revolution of fortune , at the death of Anne , the Whigs in their turn proscribe the Tories . The Tories conspire against the country and twice involve it in civil war . Walpole , out of office , harasses the government , whose principles he professes : in office , he is himself harassed , thwarted in his best measures , and at last driven into a criminal war with Spain , by an opposition heterogeneous in its principles , and which , notwithstanding the torrent of its patriotic eloquence , has no object in view but to oust the minister and clamber into his place . It is a fact of melancholy significance that Chatham , so pure and patriotic by nature , is found deeply implicated in the worst of these transactions . Meantime , the councils of the nation resound with mutual slander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factions , fills all hearts with malignity and falsehood . It is singular that writers on the British Constitution-not only formal writers like Blackstone , but those who try to pierce to the real facts-should have failed to appreciate the cardinal fact that government in England is a government of party . The constitution is the organ through which the dominant party rules : and so it has been and is under all elective governments Everywhere you find two parties more or less defined , the struggle between which for the offices of state makes up the political history of the country . Everywhere you have a party morality and a party allegiance conflicting with the claims of humanity and the nation . In England the set of established rules for tile party game has superseded the constitutional law as expounded by Blackstone . Party government is implied in the very shape and arrangement of the House of Commons , where the party in power sits on the Speaker 's right hand , the party in opposition on his left . In a constitution framed for the *Dominioa of Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the members of the new senate , for the first term , should be chosen fairly from both parties . But whether formally recognized or not , party government is the all-important fact . What is the government of England at present ? Not King , Lords , and Commons , nor any of them , but the Liberal party . What is the government of the United States ? Not the President , Senate , and House of Representatives , but the Republican party . What is the real legislature of the United States ? The Republican caucus . What is the political history of the United States ? A long struggle between two parties , culminating in a civil war . Burke , in his Thoughts on the Gause of the Present Diseontents , has a defence , or rather an encolnium , of party . " Party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavors the national interest , upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed . For my part , I find it impossible to conceive that any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of any weight , who refuses to adopt the means of having them reduced into practice . It is the business of the speculative philosopher to mark the proper ends of government . It is the business of the politician , who is the philosopher in action , to find cut proper means towards // qwq in a very restricted form , and other connections have a good deal traversed the lines of party , and interfered with its ascendancy . Parliamentary elections come at long intervals , and , from the frequent exercise of the prerogative of dissolution , are uncertain in their recurrence ; and municipal elections in England being comparatively devoid of interest , there is scarcely enough to keep a regular party organization on foot . The English system of election also , which is unrestricted with regard to the candidate 's place of residence , renders it more difficult for local managers to keep nominations . in their hands . But when party organization is complete , the elector , compelled to vote at the dictation of the managers , may , like the constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through the forms and gestures of sovereignty ; but , like the constitutional king , he is in reality a puppet . With electoral liberty , general freedom of opinion and independence of political find social character are in danger of being lost . It is not in any open preaching of imperialist doctrir*es , so much as in the encroachments of party despotism on the liberty of voting , that we should look for the signs of the decay of liberty in a free state . Corruption , like faction , beset elective government in England from the first . Before we are half through the reign of William the Deliverer , on the morrow of the Glorious Revolution , we find govern:nent systematically bribing members of the House of Commons . The name of Walpole is infamous , perhaps more infamous than it deserves , in the annals of corruption . Not only the secret service-money and the vast amount of sinecure patronage , political and ecclesiastical , with peerages and other honors then in the hands of government , but the public service and even the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative abuses were thus engendered under a free government little less flagrant than those which had disgraced the tyranny of Charles II . In England they have now pretty well worked off the grosser forms of Parliamentary corruption . In this they have been aided by that which has been an evil in other respects , the plutocratic character of the House of Commons , most of the members of which are too rich to care for a bribe . They have also been aided by that which is in all respects an unspeakable blessing , the almost entire removal of the civil service and the judiciary from the category of party spoils , rotation in office being totally discarded , and even the patronage of the first appointments greatly reduced through the introduction of competitive examination . At the time of the Railroad Mania , there were strong suspicions of direct bribery of members of the House of Commons ; certainly there was a good deal of dishonest and even corrupt voting , and the experience of that period strongly suggested that the sort of legislation in which the lobbies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political assembly , but committed to professional authorities whose integrity may be fortified by professional interest and honor , who may themselves be responsible , in case of misconduct , to the supreme government . The principal bribes now are peerages and other honors which have a special value for rich men aspiring to social position . In England however , generally speaking , it is not among the members but in the constituencies that corruption prevails . Parliament legislates rigorously against it , but legislate as we may , while politics are a struggle for office , corruption in some form will continue to exist . The growth of Pemagogism , again , has been somewhat suspended in England by the limitation of the suffrage and by the ascendancy of a political class . Party lenders have made unscrupulous . appeals to the passions of the people as well as to the passions of assemblies , which , like larger masses of men , are capable of becoming mere mobs . But there have been comparatively few instances of men leaving the paths of industry to make politics a trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *emagogues may close the ears of a na // tion against truth as effectually as courtiers by their flattery close the ears of the most besotted despot . The weak point of the elective system seems to lie not so much in the choice of members as in the choice of candidates ; in the nomination , in a word , rather than in the election . Once place the right man before the electors , and if they are of average intelligence and honesty they will probably elect him . The difficulty is to get the right man placed before them . He will not , as a general rule , come forward of himself , for generally speaking men of much depth of character and largeness of mind are rather too averse from these competitions and contentions : they are rather too much disposed , as an ancient philosopher says , to stand aside under the shelter of the wall and let the dust whirl by . When there is not a political class designated by its birth for public life , the solution has been found practically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible that the best men should be selected to rule the state . This is a canker at the very root of the system , and one for which a remedy has not yet been suggested or perhaps even sought . A really free and spontaneous exercise of their power of choice by the whole body of electors seems to require not only a general intelligence but a general activity and interest in politics which we can hardly expect to find in the mass of men . All political philosophy is summed up in the words of Pym : " The best form of government is that which doth actuate and dispose every part and member of a state to the common good . " Universal suffrage expressing the free and rational allegiance of the whole people is the only just and stable basis on which institutions can hereafter rest ; and no community which is governed either for or by a class can be considered a community indeed . Elective government has coincided with the higher civilization ; it demands far greater moral effort and brings forth proportionately nobler fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not regulate itself , and , for want of regulation , it has in not a few instances wrought its own destruction . Even in the countries where the success of the elective system has been greatest , if you subtract the other elements of well-being , such as religion , intelligence , and industry , and against the good done by political agencies set the evil done by faction , demagogism , and corruption , how large will be the balance of good which will remain ? The answer to this question is the test of a political system , not mere declamations about freedom . Faction , demagogism , and corruption , not only interfere with good government ; they deprave the moral life of men which it is the object of all government to protect ; and if they are not cured or mitigated , the time will come when Humanity , feeling that its higher interests are being sacrificed to its lower , will arouse itself to throw elf an intolerable evil , at whatever expense to cherished ideas and institutions . England moves slowly ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be compelled to take up organic questions . The House of Commons as at present constituted is not fit to be the government . Consisting of 650 members , it is too large for deliberation . The evil organization of party is almost indispensable to make it work at all . But in other and more fundamental respects it bears the traces of its original character as a representation of the counties and boroughs summoned occasionally and for a short time , not to govern , or even to legislate , but to grant the king money and at the same time advise him as to the needs of the people . It is summoned and dismissed at the will of the ministers of the Crown , the only security for its annual convocation being an indirect one , the necessity of obtaining from it supplies to defray the expenses of government and pay the annual interest on the debt . It is in abeyance during a great part of the year , and in the interval between a dissolution and a fresh election ceases altogether to exist . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // members of the legislature at once and as giving an undue and pernicious influence to the question or cry of the hour : it opens the floodgates of popular passion , instead of equably registering the progress of public opinion . Milton was quite in the right when he counselled the Long Parliament , which had then made itself the government , to do away with dissolutions and general elections , to declare itself permanent , and fill up vacancies in its body as they arose . Even the hours of session , which are not the business hours of the day , but those of the night , when business is worst done , denote the assembly 's imperfect recognition of its present fonctions . I have said that England has no written constitution . At one period of her history , and for a short time , she had a written constitution , a remarkable document , and the work of no ordinary hands : I mean the Instrument of Government framed by Cromwell and his associates after the execution of Charles I. , and the abolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution embodied in the Instrument of Government consisted of an elective Protector , a Parliament , and a Council of State . The Protector is elected for life ; the members of the Council of State also hold their offices for life ; and when a vacancy occurs the Parliament is to send up six names , out of which the Council select two , and of these two the Protector chooses one ; so that the Council would be kept pretty well in harmony with the Parliament and the Protector . The powers of legislation and taxation were vested entirely in the Parliamcnt , the Protector having a suspensive veto on legislation for twenty days only . The Council of State was completely associated with the Protector in the conduct of the executive . As to the elective Protector , there may be a doubt whether it is necessary to have any single head of the state ; whether the supposed necessity is not a superstition derived from long familiarity with monarchy ; and whether we should n@t be better without any great prize of this kind to stimulate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we are to have an elective head , there are some reasons for preferring one elected for life to one elected for a term of years : because the regular recurrence of the competition for this prize at stated intervals keeps on foot party organizations , infismes faction , and tends to bring dangerous questions , which might otherwise work themselves out slowly and quietly , to a sudden and violent issue . That , however , which most claims attention in the system embodied in the Instrument of Government is that it is not a party system , the members of the Council of State being elected under conditions which seem to render it impossible that the Council should become a cabinet or cabal . It would not be surprising if the minds of English statesmen should one day revert to Crornwell 's constitution , which , though premature in its day and altered almost as soon as it was made , may not be so unsuitable to the present age . It is curious to see how , with the rising ascendancy of the political principles of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Protector has come forth from the cloud of infamy behind which it was long hidden and received again the homage of the national heart . Tie attempt to found the institutions of the future will be made in England under soma critical conditions , partly common to her with other nations , partly peculiar to herself . Peculiar to her , in. degree at least , are the contrast between the extremes of wealth and poverty , and the presence of masses of want , ignoran ce , and criminal propensity close to the streets of luxurious palaces . The proletariat is beginning to appear in the great American cities and to raise the formidable problems connected with its existence ; and this is one of the most important elements in the change which has passed over American society since it was observed by IDe Tocqueville . But in Encland the danger is at its height , and though the explosive forces of a Faubourg St. Antoine slumber long , in a day of revolutionary excitement they may awake . There is a peculiarity also in the political aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with their political aspect in this country . In England the suffrage was so long withheld from the artisans that they have formed polity an industrial , with objects , laws , and a government of its own outside the polity of the nation . Such a power can hardly fail , in this industrial age , in some way to affect the course of political progress . On the other hand , a feature of the situation , common to England , with all the leading nations , is the critical position , which it is impossible to ignore , of the religious faith which has hitherto formed the foundation of the political as well as the social morality of the world . It may be true that the doctrine of future rewards and punishments has not operated with all the force which theologians have assumed ; but assuredly the motives which have hitherto led the mass of men to keep their selfish passions in subordination to the common good , and thereby to render government other than that of mere force possible , will be found , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atheism and imperialism is most marked perhaps in Hobbes , but it is visible through the whole history of political philosophy . Rationalism has not yet develped a positive side , and between the decay of the old support and the growth of the new , there may be an interval perilous to humanity . On the other hand , the influence of science is beginning to tell beneficially on politics , by substituting observation for assumption and calm investigation for party passion . The rational study of history is also a new and beneficial influence in the case of all public men who have received a good political education . There are , unhappily , great masses of ignorance among the people in England ; and even the new possessors of wealth are a bad political class , being too commonly uneducated , not only in the first but in the second generation . But on the other hand there is a good deal of highly-trained political intellect . To this the system of class government , in other respects so injurious , has itself been conducive , by dedicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seats in Parliament has contributed to the same result . Something is also due perhaps to the system of College Fellowships , which gives young men of ability the opportunity of carrying their self-culture beyond the limits of an ordinary university education . There is , moreover , a good deal of independence and force of political character ; independence and force which are often perverse and reactionary , but still independence and force . To these advantages may be added an *nmease political experience and the national habits of mind which it has formed . England will probably grapple vigorously with the tremendous problems which are forced upon her , and there is good reason for hoping that she will work out something of value , not for herself only , but for the world .
