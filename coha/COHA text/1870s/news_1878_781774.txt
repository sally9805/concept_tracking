txt The death of Mr. James Goodman , for many years a prominent resident of Clinton , has naturally awakened among those who knew him many reminiscences of his long and beneficent career . He came to the town thirty years ago , when ho was yet in the prime of early manhood , and the pigs ran about the streets , He lived to he a venerable old man , and to see his aclQ ) ted town lighted with gas , and furnished with a daily newspaper and a public pig and cattle pound . No man was ever more respected and beloved by his fellow-townsmen , aid it can be safely said that he fully merited the estimation in which he was held . It was as an inventor of ingenious remedies for public abuses that this great and good man will be chiefly remembered . One of his earliest inventions was his successful device for the discouragement of agents ? including book , insurance , and lightning-rod agents . The device was equally applicable to peddlers and solicitors for subscriptions to charitable enterprises ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the pernicious classes for which it was designed , it secured for the town of Clinton a period of undisturbed quiet , which greatly contributed to the growth of that now thriving place . The invention was modeled upon the trap-doors in use on the theatrical stage . The front door of Mr. Goodman 's house was approached by a board walk , convenient and seductive in appearance , but perforated by a concealed trapdoor leading to a vault eight feet deep and six feet in circumference . The trap was operated by a lever , the handle of which was placed in the second story front hall loom of the house , which the inventor used as his study . By the window in this room he was accustomed to sit and wait for the appnach of his prey . As soon as the agent ent cred the front gate and reached the trap-door the lever was pressed , the trap opened , and the vault received its victim . In those , ilays ? this was in the Spring of 1S47 ? the West was devastated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ' On pleasant , sunshiny days Mr. Goodin ; frequently captured from eight to twelve victims , and it is said that on more than one occasion his vault , which was constructed to hold nineteen average-sized agents if closely packed in two tiers , was filled to its utmost capacity . It . is generally believed that few of the agents thus captured were seriously injured , and that they were released after twenty-four hours ' imprisonment and permitted to depart . The rumor that Mr. Goodman had an interest in a bone-boiling establishment in Chicago , nor the other rumor that . he received large sums of money from medical colleges throughout the ? Union , does not appear to rest upon any good foundation . His trap had not been in operation more than six months before Clinton was wholly deserted by agents , and the gratitude of the community took the substantial form of the presentation of a richly-bound copy of the Bible to the beneficent inventor . Time would fail were a list to be given of Mr. Goodman 's public-spirited acts and ine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely nipped in the bud the introduction into Clinton of the repulsive practice of . surprise parties deserves especial mention .. In the Winter of 1369 certain depraved Clintonites , who had re-. cently visited Chicago , undertook to pollute their hitherto reputable village with a surprise party , and , with the natural hatred which tile wicked feel toward the conspicue ously good , selected Mr. Goodman as their victim . That excellent man . had long previously foreseen that sooner or later a surprise party would be perpetrated in Clinton. , and had made his arrazigements . ' This time , also , it was from the theatre that hetook his modal . He had seen in a ; pantomime an astonishing pair of stairs , which , when approached by the clown , - turned suddenly into a cellar-door . With this in mind , he substituted for the dozen wooden steps leading to his front-door a light-iron the steps of which , by means of a lever , could be turned at any moment so a s to convert the whole affair into a perfectly smooth inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the front piazza in spite of the disappear- , nee of the stairs , ha . placed a trap-door , modeled precisely after his device for discouraging agents , in the floor of the piazza , directly in front of the hall door . When these preparations were completed , he ordered half a dozen cheap boys from the Chicago Orphan Asylum , and , by their aid , satisfied himself that both the convertible stair and the trap-tic or would ' work with smoothness and certainty . It was on Wednesday eve ling , the 2 5th of November , 1869-1 date which the cabston undertakers still remember with joy and gratitude  --  that the surprise party , consisting of eight ladies and twelve men , inelud ing Judge Sluyter and Dr. Wilcox . who weighed respectively . 220 and 264 pounds , approached Mr. Goodman 's house . Odd as it may seem , that noble man had actually fallen asleep with his hand on the lever that worked the front steps , and did not awake until the marauders had rung the door bell . Starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that while the male marauders were gathered on the piazza'at the head of the stairs , the ladies were - closely packed on the treacherous iron steps . Without a moment 's delay he first pulled the lever that converted the steps into a slippery plane , and then opened the trap door . The eight men that fell into the vault made no - noise , but the shrieks of the ladies as they slid rapidly down the inclined plane , followeg by Judge Sluyter and Dr. Wlicose , were terr , fie . The shrieks were to a great extent hushed when those two ponderous citizens Struck the confused and struggling-heap of . ladies . Perhaps it is as well to draw a veil over this part of the affair . Suffice it to say that though the Judge and the Doctor escaped unhurt , there were six funerals on the next day but one , and Clinton has never since been stained by a surprise party . ' Mr. Goodman is dead , hut his noble life will never cease to influence for good the community in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its grief , weeps over his grave and wonders whom his widow will marry .
