Q PPOSITE my windows is a fashionable church , and it is a wonderful ; sight on a sunny Sunday to see the congregation streaming out . Of course the majority of the worshippers are women , and they come fluttering forth in the brightest of silks all glittering and glowing in radiant colors . The pavement shimmers with crimson and violet and blue and emerald ; there are white feathers , azure feathers , scarlet feathers , feathers shooting forth as many tints as " the pegcock 's spotted train-bright Argus ' golden eye ; " there are chains and necklaces and bracelets and brooches and earrings ; the street is positively ablaze with color and lustre . There are ladies in that procession who display , from their flashing feathers to their dainty shining boots of bronze , every gaudy color which could show itself in a kaleidoscope . Looking down on that radiant , quickglancing stream of colors , one almost fancies he is gazing upon a field covered with dazzling tropical insects , or the flight of a colony of gorgeous birds . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such sheeny silks are kept there for the drawing-room or the afternoon drive in Hyde Park or the Bois de Bou. logne ; such wealth of daziling colors is never displayed on the*form of European womanhood at all . And at church-even the uttermost devotees of fashion in S Europe do keep up something like a semblance of demureness and gravity , if not of sombreness and penitence , in their church-going garb . I do not suppose there is any clear religious principle involved in the matter anyhow , although the supposed contrast between the purpose of a church service and the gorgeous dressing of the fair devotees is the subject of a good deal of comment now and then in New York journals . At feast , I am not casuist enough to say how far it is becoming and lawful to bedizen the person when about to attend a church service , and where adornment begins to be objectionable and profane . But , loving all that brightens the outer aspects of life , which after all must at best have a good deal of dulness and sombreness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of womanhood which arrays itself in all the colors of the rainbow or the pigeon 's neck , and makes so lustrous a pageant under my windows . I feel like the philosophic Oriental in some story or other , who stopped a great lady and thanked her for the gems she wore , feeling bound , as the ornaments gave him s* much pleasure to look at , and must have been put on to gladden his eyes as well as those of others , to express his gratitude for the joy given him by the exhibition . Those gleaming silks and glittering gewg aws are put on , that prodigality of coloring is displayed , to brighten for a moment the street on which I look for that purpose as much as for any other  --  and I feel grateful for the pretty , gleaming , evanescent pageant , which costs the performers so much and the spectator nothing at all . Now , this is a sight you can not see in the street life of Europe ; or , indeed , in the street life of any American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to take this fearless love of gorgeous coloring and costly dressing as the general peculiarity of American woman , but only to make it for the moment a sort of illustration or symbol of one point of difference between American women and the women of England . I think there is almost everywhere more vividness and variety of tone in the character of the former than of the latter . The latter may symbolize Law , the former Liberty . Take the finest , noblest , most beautiful // English woman you can see , and the impression she leaves on your mind is that of a living statue of Repose . A beautiful American woman , on the other hand , seems to me to symbolize the idea of . Movement ; of Progress if you will ; certainly of Motion of some kind . In certain peculiarities of appearance and manner , the American woman is much more like a French than an English woman ; although I may remark that I never could understand why so much is said about the little , tetite , symmetrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of every six French women are redundant in their development , and anything whatever rather than sylph-like . But in dress , gesture , tone of voice , fluency of conversation , animation of movement , an American woman much resembles a French woman . I mean , of course , a French married woman . No foreigner ever knew anything about a French file ; the daughter of his host and intimate friend is to him hardly ever anything more than a silent shadow . An English lady living in Paris found herself in a high dilemma some two years ago , during the progress of some public festivities . She had with her as visitors at the same time a French girl from one of the provioces , and an American girl , from New York , I think ; and she confided to my wife and mysel who happened to be in Paris then , her intense perplexity and distress with the French girl , who might not do anything or go anyx*here , and the American girl , who might and would do anything and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , and the conditions will probably be reversed . Both the ladies will have married ; and then the American woman will feel that she has acquired new responsibilities to which she willingly sacrifices many inclinations , while the French woman will find herself mistress of an almost absolute freedom , endowed with a liberty which she may render indistinguishable from license should she feel so inclined . It seems almost superfluous to speak of the beauty of American women . Even the most prejudiced and illiberal of European observers have done willing justice to this ; and indeed one should have no eyes at all if he failed to notice the extraordinary number of pretty faces which pass him in the stream that floats down Broadway any fine afternoon . But the peculiarity which first impressed me in the American woman was her fluency and self-reliance in speech . Perfectly astonishing to me at least was , and still is , the command of words and sentences which almost every American girl one meets always seems to have . I do not know how I can better express my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an American woman appears to me always capable of managing a parenthesis anywhere with perfect accuracy , dropping the parenthetical passage and taking up the original thread of the sentence exactly at the right word . New York society seems to abound with pretty little petticoated Gladstones . An English woman of even more than average culture , when engaged in ordinary conversation , does not give herself much trouble about the finishing of a sentence . When she has gone deeply enough into it to enable , her listener to get the idea she means to convey , she is only too ready to drop that sentence there midway , and begin another . This is the kind of way in which all Thackeray 's heroines talk , and all Charles Reade 's and Anthony Trollope 's ; and it is perfectly right that they should be made to talk so , for so English women talk in real life . But any one who should write a novel in which there appeared some American women , and make them talk in the same kind of stammering , incoherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were to make a Devonshire lass speak vKth the accent of Highland Mary . Most American women whom I have met talk habitually with an accuracy which would bear of literal reporting , the lan- // 187o . AMERICAN WOMEN AND ENGLISH WOMEN . guage reading like a page copied out of a book ; while at the same time there is a fluency which never pauses for a word , and never seems to know the slightest difficulty in expressing an idea . Nor is this merely an empty fluency , a shining , shallow river ; nor is it a pretty chatter , pleasant and marvellous , like that of an average Parisienne . A French woman who is not exceptionally educated is generally an ignorant creature ; an American girl has almost always a considerable stock of knowledge . American girls especially differ from English girls in their superior acquaintance with politics and political life . Nothing surprised me more in this country than the good general knowledge of ; and general interest in , the politics of at least her own country which the young American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more especially in London , a considerable number of women who take a lively interest in politics , and understand every political question as well as men can do . But these are almost invariably women who are brought into something like direct connection with political life , the wives and daughters of peers , members of Parliament , journalists , and others to whom Westminster Palace , where Parliament meets , is the Alcyone or central sun of th' social system . The average English woman who does not belong to any of the groups I have indicated , seldom knows or cares anything about the politics of her , our , or any other country . It would be quite possible to dine every day at some table where there might be half a dozen English women of good social position , and supposed to be educated , not one of whom had the faintest idea of what the English system of government is , or had ever thought about the matter at all . I wonder where you could find half a dozen American women of decent education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not the power of making any laws he pleases . Not merely is the average English woman ignorant of politics , but she does not even know enough to know how ignorant she is ; she has probably never given one moment 's consideration to a subject which she assumes to be utterly beside her sphere and beyond her comprehension . Here in the United States girls who do not seem to have long passed the age of pantalettes , commonly amaze the unaccustomed foreigner by plunging at once into some complicated political question , and talking of it with perfect fluency and with a knowledge that seems to be genuine . Nor is this true of political subjects merely . These young American women seem to have the faculty of grappling readily with the most difficult topics . I have heard American girls talk about Herbert Spencer in a manner which not only convinced me that they had read him , but even satisfied me that they had actually understood him as well . I have never heard better appreciation of some of our greatest living English authors than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluent young American women , who if they were English would hardly talk in company at all , or if they did talk would scarcely venture beyond the commonplaces and small change of conversation . All this , too , is without any appearance of the old-fashioned blue-stocking peculiarities on the part of the American ladies ; it seems quite fresh , natural , and womanly . The knowledge of literature possessed by American girls does not , however , seem to me relatively so great by any means as their knowledge of politics . My impression is that a well-educated En , , lish woman has generally a wider acquaintance with literature than her American sister . I do not find , for example , that the great classic masters of our language , in prose or poetry , are very familiar to the tripping tongue of the bright American girl who can talk politics with a professional journalist , and knows Victor Hugo , and George Sand , and Robert Browning , and Tennyson , and Carlyle , and perhaps even Goethe and Heine , as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to know a great deal about Milton , or Edmund Spenser , or Fielding , or even Shakespeare himself ; except from the acquaintanceship formed through the medium of Edwin Booth . But it is certain that whatever she knows , and whatever she sees , the American woman can talk about . She can even describe-describe places she has seen so that she makes you think you are seeing them too ; describe them in long , flowing , pictorial sentences which , although running on as if the speaker took no time even to think about their arrangerne nt , yet come out clear and accurate to the very end , each part of the sentence dovetailing properly with the other , and the verb invariably agreeing with its nominative case in number and person . I have sat and listened , a wonder-wounded hearer , while an American lady poured out , quite extemporaneously and on the spur of some chance suggestion , a description of Western mountain scenery which reminded me of nothing in the world so much as of certain long , eloquent , glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps of some of Bulwer-Lytton 's heroines in a vein of special eloquence . But then , Christopher North in the " Noctes " or the heroine of Bul*ver 's novel had the thing elaborately prepared and written out for him or her by the author , who doubtless went over it many times in manuscript , and made various emendations in proof ; before he allowed the outburst of unstudied eloquence to flow forth ; while these American ladies of whom I speak had absolutely no idea , one moment before , that the conversation was to be started which would give their power of extemporaneous description a chance of displaying itself . Of course , the independence of the American woman-especially of the unmarried woman-always astonishes the European . An American girl may do , I suppose , anything which it is not absolutely wrong to do . All the conventionalities founded on notions of moral propriety which hedge in an English girl , have apparently no existence for young women in these United States . I can say with perfect sincerity that I have not seen or heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstanding or misconstruction , arising out of this fearless , generous liberty . If I may express any opinion tending the other way on so delicate a subject , I would say that the class of American women who are most in the habit of visiting Europe , and " go in , " to use a vulgar expression , for European ways , seem to draw down far more of disparaging criticism upon them than the frankest and least timid of their more thoroughly American sisters . But , in any case , I can not help saying that the freedom of which I speak does not extend to all departments of mere conventionality . The English girl is compelled to refrain from doing many things admitted to be perfectly innocent in themselves , on the ground that the freedom to do them might possibly suggest to evil-disposed persons that there existed an inclination , or at least a liability , to impropriety : the rule by which the American girl is guided seems , in most matters , to be literally that of Honi soil gui maZy tense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to me to be even more under the sway of the conventionalities of mere social etiquette than English girls are . I think American womanhood pays more attention and attaches more importance to the little formalities of calls and visits , of cards and letters , of fashions and dress , than English womanhood does . The fear of an English girl always seems to be lest she may be supposed to be doing anything that is not proper ; that of an American girl , lest she should be doing anything that is not quite genteel . It is surprising to find how the woman who talked so brilliantly , and , more than that , so solidly and justly , upon some political or other grave and important question , // and who so calmly and gracefully asserts for herself a freedom of individual action which no English woman would dare to claim , would dream of claiming-it is surprising to find how this same woman can prove herself to be more absolutely the bond-servant of the merest trifles of etiquette in the fashionable code than the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that I think the average English woman , with all her cold propriety , her rigid undemonstrative ways , her repugnance to any advanced opinion , or indeed to speculative opinions of any kind , is a far less servile devotee of dress and fashion than one of these brilliant American women , who are afraid to enter no field of human thought , and whohave a pure and generous disregard for all the terrors of what I may call constructive impropriety . Not long since an English lady of high rank and of great intelligence , a lady whose intellect , acquirements , and earnestness of character would render her remarkable anywhere , travelled through several of these States . I protest that I heard more remarks made by American ladies about this English woman 's simplicity and plainness of dress , about her thick boots and her wQollen skirts , and so forth , than about any of the qualities of personal beauty , or clear intellect , or noble earnestness , which yet all who met her in this country are quite willing , when questioned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be that she dressed plainly and carelessly ( I never heard any one in London make a single remark on the subject ) , but her appearance could hardly have created more criticism and commentary here if she had come to the United States attired in a garb like that of Mary Walker . Now , I am not inclined to find much fault with the love of bright and attractive dressing in woman , and I do not think careless and dowdy ways in dress do of themselves constitute anything like a virtue . I said in the opening of this article that I can see no particular reason why women should not be dressed handsomely even at church . But I do entirely object to making the clothes a test of the woman ; and I do think it a pity that American women , who claim and exercise so liberal and honorable a practice of independent individuality in most things , should be in this one matter of subserviency to the code of fashion in dress behind rather than before all the rest of the womanhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights , the most vehement opponents of the Tyrant Man , in this country , appear never to be done with their efforts to convince the public that they are as faithful to fashion as the prettiest imbecile of Fifth Avenue . " We are rebels , " they seem to say , " against the time-honored traditions and prejudices of all the earth ; but , do believe us , dear Public , we are honest and devoted slaves to fashion . " So much as regards freedom in dress . One other not unimportant attribute of greater freedom I think English women possess , as compared with Americansthe freedom which calls a spade a spade . Having already borne so willing a tribute to the incomparable superiority of American women as talkers , I may be allowed to say that I think English ladies , for the little they can talk , use a simpler and purer Saxon English than flows from the lips of American ladies . Englishmen , and after them English women , have lately grown very much into the use of a clear , plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all magniloquence , which does not appear to me to be much cultivated in this country . In England now it is assuredly a mark and proof of culture to adopt this simplicity of style ; in this country I think people , especially women , try hard to cuhivate a fine , euphuistic jargon . Here , for example , it appears to be thought a rude and coarse sort of thing to speak of a woman of education and position as a woman ; you must speak of her always as a " lady . " Mrs. Brown is a charming // lady ; Miss Black is a beautiful lady , and so on . In England this sort of phraseology is usually abandoned to the lady's-maid and the footman . Educated and wellbred English people will always say : Mrs. Black is a charming woman ; Miss Black is a beautiful woman . I own I think there is a great advantage in the general adoption of this system of simple phraseology . Odious to me are all the forms of euphuistic periphrasis by which people strive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rather hear an English woman break into a little word of forcible slang , as such women will do occasionally , than hear her sp6il our pure and noble Saxon speech , so sweet and homelike in its simple , natural strength , by over-refinement of language and the spurious graces of a superficial gentility . Listening , as I have often done with wonder and admiration , to the fluent and brilliant talk of the American woman , I have thought at the same time that , if such fluency and such brilliancy could only find expression in the simple Saxon which is now happily the vernacular of educated people in England , the charming talker would have just the one thing needed to place her completely supreme among the conversationalists of the modern world . But nobody can monopolize all the gifts and graces , and I am glad whenever during this article I can record something to the special advantage of the womanhood of the old country . All American women , in cities at least , and nearly all that I have met in country places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an irrefutable proposition . And then what a vast number of American women can write well ! Ranging in memory over a tolerably large circle of acquaintances , it is amazing to me to remember how many of the women I have met are skilful and accomplished writers . I am not speaking now of the women of literary distinction , the women whose names are " in the play-bills , " the professional authoresses . Of this class we have probably a larger number at home . I speak of women who do not pretend to be professional writers , but who can , when occasion requires , sit down and write off quite a brilliant little essay , or story , or poem ; and of women who are professional writers , but who belong merely to the rank and file of letters , and do not think of attaining a position of leadership . Of this latter class we have in England hardly any specimens at all . Speaking with all but literal accuracy , I may say that we have in England no professional journalists of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , a vast number of female novelists ; but of these only a very small proportion can be called professional writers-or , I had almost said , writers at all . Most of my readers could probably name as readily as I could all the English women who may properly be called novelists . But every season sends out a whole shoal of novels written by aspiring and foolish young women-written sometimes for mere recreation and to enliven the monotony of a fashionable existence-which no more deserve the name of literature than the vapid and harmless parlor-charade deserves the name of high dramatic art . The fair amateur romancist covers the proper number of pages with writing of some sort ; her kindly husband or father consents to make good to the publisher any loss that may attend the printing of the work-indeed , owing to our circulating library system in England , and the constant demand for new novels merely because they are new , anything issued by certain publishing houses will pay its expenses  --  and the thing is done , and the dear creature ha5 the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her immediate circle of friends . I know myself one lady who has writte'n and published more than twenty novels , none of which ever obtained a line of notice in any journal , and none of which ever paid or was expected to pay a solitary sixpence // to the indefatigable authoress . Now , I do n't call this sort of thing literature . There is no manner of reason why my little daughter , aged ten , might not , with due revision of her work , become an authoress after this fashion . I regard a man or woman as a writer when he or she has written something that an editor or publisher will pay foy , and which somebody will read without being urged thereto by the claims of personal friendship . In England , then , we have really very few female writers , after the half dozen or so of professional authoresses whose names are known to us all ; and the English woman hardly ever becomes a journalist or writes regularly for the newspapers . Here in the United States women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism . If* woman of education wants to make her living in one of these cities , she seems now to think , first of all , of writing for the newspapers and magazines , just as an Englfsh girl 's first idea would he to become a governess . And it must be owned that , when an American girl thinks she can write , she is not easily persuaded to the contrary , or discouraged from persevering in her efforts . I know something of the inner life of a certain New York weekly journal , and have been in the habit of spending some time more or less of every working day there ; and I venture to affirm that of the amateur contributors who penetrated , wholly uninvited , into the editorial rooms , and presented there a bundle of manuscript , at least two out of every three were women , and a considerable proportion of these were girls under twenty . This journal had many female pens contributing regularly to its columns , the pens of ladies who wrote essays , " editorials , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence , etc. , and did their work as well as any penman engaged in the literature of journalism . Two or three at least of these accomplished women write with a force , a freedom , a clearness of thought , a mastery of terse , nervous , and eloquent expression , which would do honor to any masculine journalist and to any publication . I presume that the same thing may be said of many other-I know it can be said of some other - New York journals , weekly and daily . But , in the instance of which I speak , the fact that so many female pens were professionally and regularly employed in the columns of the journal naturally left little opportunity or chance for the prosfered services of amateurs , and therefore most of the ladies who presented themselves with their bundles of manuscript were allowed to depart without their workmanship having been accepted . How many times have I listened with profound interest to the debate which would take place between one of the editors of the journal and one of the fair amateurs ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expatiate on the peculiar attractions of her essay , poem , or story ; how gracefully she would wave away , not without a dash of gentle scorn in hertone , the mild and elementary objections of the editor  --  the objection , for instance , that he had already had seven successive articles on the same subject , of which the last was published that very day ; or that the views expressed in the proffered essay were diametrically opposed to those of himself and the journal ; or that his literary columns were filled up already for six months in advance ; or that he never did or could accept long romances , and this seemed to be a preternaturally long romance . The lady , probably eighteen years of age , had meanwhile calmly taken a chair , arranged her skirts , and sat down to argue the question ; and how eloquently , vivaciously , eagerly she did argue it ! How her eyes sparkled and her tongue rattled ! And when at last it became evident that the thing could not be accepted , the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman took her defeat with the most perfect good-humor , and , dismissing the subje*of the rejected manuscript altogether , started an ani // mated talk on things in general before bidding good-by to the inexorable editor and setting forth to try her fortune with some one else . May she be successful ! Nay , I know that she will be successful in the end , and that she will be the literary star of some small or large circle , and will be known by some initial or nom de *Zurne as the distinguished authoress of this or that novel , work on the Woman Question , poem , or series of letters from foreign parts . Happy was it for the journal I spoke of that I was not its editor-that I had not the power of accepting contributions ! I never could have held out against such arguments ; nay , I should infallibly have yielded at the first blush of battle ; I should have accepted all the contributions of all the ladies , young and old ; and what a fine circulation I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked of my own soul , as I thus listened to the eloquent , vivacious , pertinacious pleading of the maiden of blushing sixteen , or , as the case might be , of the widow of fiftyoften have I asked of my own soul , " Could you thus plead the cause of one of your productions ? Could you , to save yourself from literary extinction and your family from pauperism , thus argue with a reluctant editor , thus insist on his seeing the beauty of your style , the appropriateness of your reflections ? " Alas , no And I never knew any man who could , or indeed any woman save here in the United States ; and I am quite certain that , if by possibility an English man or woman could thus be brought to plead and argue for acceptance , neither he nor she would be found to bear defeat with such ready and sparkling good-humor . To a stranger , American women are naturally the most agreeable acquaintances he can find in the sex . The ready friendliness of manner which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nearly all the slow preliminaries of acquaintanceship , with nearly all the formal interchange of conversational sign and countersign-all these peculiarities make the society of American women especially delightful and attractive to a visitor and a foreigner , who , having no time for the slow and gradual formation of friendships , finds himself in this respect more fortunate here than in any country in the world . I can not adequately describe how strange and delightful I found this genial and unrestrained good-nature . I do not know why it is that , where so many men are habitually silent , all the women should be so exuberant in conversational power ; but my experience certainly is , that in most American circles , whether of town or country , the frais of the conversation will be left to the wife , the sisters , or the daughters . Woman is much more of a recognized power , she " amounts to ' * far more , in this country than across the Atlantic . She is recognized as having a legitimate right to hold her own opinion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to merge her existence into her husband 's , as an English woman is at least supposed to do . She shines with her own light , not with that reflected from her husband ; she is a sun , and not a satellite . Even in old-fashioned and almost puritanical households , where assuredly modern doctrines of woman 's rights and freedom of marriage relations have not penetrated , the woman seems to me to have her equality much more clearly recognized than in England . I do not mean to say that English women are less potent in their households or have less influence over their husbands ; but that the power and influence are not openly accorded to them , and recognized as legitimate . Indeed , I am inclined to think that the English woman has commonly a greater share of mere family supremacy than the American woman . I doubt whether there is not much more of petticoat government in England than here . Most - Englishmen , indeed , are controlled by their wives , and I question whether most Americans are . In England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soyereign : // he is allowed to reign on condition that he shall not attempt to govern . In America , so far as I have been able to observe , the republicar* principle prevails even in the family circle : woman is equal to man at home , and free to exercise what influence she can and thinks right abroad . Paris has been called the paradise of women ; but he , whosoever he was , that first used the phrase , had assuredly never been in New York or Boston . For in these cities woman , even unmarried woman , is recognized as having a right to all the liberty and all the independence and all the influence which in no European country can be acquired except by defiance of the social code and at the possible risk of social outlawrj . In the United States is now on trial an experiment as interesting and important as any ever tested by society , and one which never has been so tried before  --  the experiment of allowing to woman her full , unfettered social independence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to have a vote seems insignificant and unimportant when compared with this other question which is actually being put to the proof in America , and here alone at this moment  --  the question whether woman may be trusted to follow her own impulses , obey her own principles , walk her own way in the social world . I can see no possible reason to doubt the answer that time and facts and American women will give . There is hardly an American girl in any city of the Union who does not every day do things which society in England , to say nothing of France or Germany , would not allow her to attempt without holding up the hands and eyes of wonder and dismay . Which code is likely to prevail in the endthat of freedom of individuality or that of Mrs. Grundy ? For myself ; I have great faith in liberty and in human nature ; and I think American women have used their freedom so wisely and well , that their far-off sisters are likely to become more and more captivated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremes . Under absolute despotisms grow up the fiercest Red Republicans ; priestly rule brings out the most extravagant infidels ; and in the United States I have conversed with some of the most unreasonable reactionaries in the form of woman it has ever been my fortune to encounter . Almost everywhere one meets some specimens of this remarkable class - American women who earnestly and pertinaciously protest that republican principles are a failure , and frankly avow that they sigh for a restoration of castes and titles . I am not speaking of Southern women , but of Northern women , the wives and daughters of staunch Republicans ; and very odd it seems to hear such ladies placidly , and sometimes not very placidly , declare that things will never be well in this country until you have Marquises and Countesses here , and distinctions of classes , and the lower orders kept in their proper place . I do not know whether ladies having such sentiments form anything like a considerable proportion ; but I have met almost everywhere some fair advocates of reaction , and their number is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . New York seems to be the city of the Union which produces the type of womanhood the least like the English type . In Richmoxid , of all American cities I have seen , the women seemed to me most like English women . Boston girls are much more unlike the girls of England than I had been led to expect . But indeed there is a difference of manner , appearance , accent , and mental tone , between American women generally and English women generally , so great that one is puzzled to understand how such disparity ever , grew up between two classes of beings speaking the same language , and brought up on the same broad principles of education . Of course , the liberty which an American woman // enjoys , and the scope it gives to the tendencies of individual character , can not be had except at the risk of some extravagance ; and it may perhaps be admitted that one meets with more examples of eccentricity , of *rononcis manners and fantastic deportment , among American than among English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genuine living English woman of the educated class , except by merely burlesquing her physical peculiarities , and exhibiting something like one of the Meess Nancies of French comic literature , with - their goggle eyes and corkscrew curls of red . The quiet , severely-proper composure which belongs especially to that very class of English women whom satire would most delight to ridicule , would quite mar her-success as a dramatic figure ; place her , in her habit as she lives , on the boards of a New York theatre , and she would amuse nobody . But I think I have seen American ladies who might be warranted to make a fortune not only in a London theatre , but even on New York boards , if they could-if they only could-speak and move and gesticulate on the stage precisely as they do in real life , and had some part written for them which would give them as good a chance as Mr. Owens has in " Solon Shingle. ** If they would but dispense with acting altogether , they would fairly rival all that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-studied art . Assuredly , these instances are rare ; but they could hardly exist at all , except in a country where an individual liberty prevailed such as older systems do not yet acknowledge . I never saw in real life the caricaturist 's typical English woman or French woman . I think I have seen , two or three times at least , in living form , the caricaturist 's typical American woman . I am speaking now simply of appearance , accent , and movement . Of course , I need hardly say that I have never met the American woman of " Punch " who says , " I guess I 'm pretty crowded already , " when she is offered a little more of some dish at dinner , and who harpoons you with her parasol if you do n't at once rise and give her your seat in a street car . I have not found that educated ladies in America make any greater difficulty than English ladies would do about alluding , if occasion needed , to their legs ; and ladies in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when occasion does require . Likewise , I have not yet metshall I ever meet ?  --  the American girl who begins every sentence with " Do tell ! " In English literature , " Do tell " is as much the accepted sign and password of the American girl as Pax vobiscurn is of the pretended monk in " Ivanhoe . " I can not remember having ever heard an American lady use the phrase ; and I do not know how we in England came to think that all American women use it . But , seeing that it has long been an article of faith in England that all American men wear black dress coats in the streets and at their work , one has no occasion to feel surprised over any manifestation of ignorance and perverse credulity which may prevail among Britons on the subject of American ways and peculiarities . Perhaps it is because so many years , or even generations , have passed away since an English pig , to adopt Sydney Smith 's illustration , was killed by a foreign weapon on English soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anything like the patriotic sentiment one hears so commonly expressed by American Certainly , English women hardly ever show , if they feel it , any of that warm , effusive love of country which I have heard American women so often express . I doubt whether English women commonly think much over the matter at all . England 's national honor , unity , and strength have never been in the slightest danger during the memory of any living creature ; and there has , therefore , been nothing to call into emotional activity the patriotic sentiment . // But it must be great excitement indeed which could extr*ct from an average English woman any ebullition of such a nature . I saw an American lady in a London drawing-room linger behind all the rest of the company for the purpose of taking up a tiny silken copy of the flao* of the Stars and Stripes left on a table by a child ; and I saw her , when I am convinced she thought no eye was on her , press this little flag again and again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty acting , but a genuine and irresistible expression of emotion . Now , I can not picture to myself an English girl in New York lingering behind to kiss the Union Jack . Not that the English woman is less sincerely a lover of her country than is her American sister ; but because the English woman hardly ever has a subjective or a sentimental nature , while she is taught by every precept , principle , and influence around her , from her infancy upwards , that well-bred women must not give free way to their feelings . The stateliest Oriental , fhe most stoical Red Indian , could hardly be a more impassive creature than an average well-bred English woman . Such a thing as sentiment is hardly known to such a being . In all the novels of Dickens , Thackeray , Trollope , Charles Reade , I can remember no heroine who ever once talks sentiment-except Becky Sharp , who was half a French woman , and was , moreover , only shamming when she turned up her green eyes and said pretty things about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeon , that , in outward appearance , is the New York girl to the English girl . What Rousseau is to Jeremy Bentham , or Jean Paul Richter to Lessing , that the mental character of educated American womanhood is to the mental *haracter of educated English womanhood . When some American female or male , endowed with the true genius of the novelist , shall rise above the horizon of letters , and shall describe an intellectual , impassioned , genuine American girl , as Charlotte Bront* has pictured Jane Eyre , or George Eliot has portrayed Maggie Tulliver , a new form will have been added to literature , and Europe will for the first time begin to understand f*Jly the real character , the aspirations , and the possibilities of America . I have not been engaged in contrasting American and English women , or making a comparison of them , in order that it might seem disadvantageous to either . I have only been endeavoring to illustrate the points of difference between the two which most deeply impress the mind of one who has seen enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first raw sensations of mere novelty and curiosity . Let me say that I think both races of women are at present rather hardly used by novelists and satirists , Sunday preachers and weekday preachers of every kind . When I left England the public opinion of the country was literally saturated with the views of British wom*inhodd which were sent out by the author of the " Girl of the Period* ' essays in the " Saturday Review , " and that author 's numberless imitators . A stranger then visiting England for the first time might have found himself warranted in believing Messalina a fair type of the average English matron . The first time I attended a place of public worship in New York , I heard a sermon preached by one of the most eminent of American divines which painted so fearful a picture of the wickedness of woman in this city , that I might well have fancied I saw a Faustina gazing from every bonnet around me . But I had never believed that sort of thing about English women , and was not likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of " The Girl of the Period , " and of the few other articles really written by the same pen , was quite sincere ; I am sure the New York preacher was quite sincere . But both drew absurdly broad conclusions from very narrow premises and were extravagantly wrong . Virtue has her panics , and panic is always in // discriminating and pitiless ; but I think Virtue is perhaps beginning to recover herself a little of late , and we hear less of the wickedness of fashionable women on this or that side of the Atlantic . For myself , I feel convinced that the vast majority even of the fashionable women of America and of England are pure girls and faithful wives ; and I am little distressed or alarmed by denunciations of female degeneracy , founded upon arguments and illustrations precisely the same as those which Dante employed to show how the fair Florentines of his day had fallen away from the modesty and virtue of their grandmothers . But there is this one great difference between American and English society , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States the experiment is being tried for the first time of allowing woman to walk through life without the supervision of a duenna or black Mesrour ; of trusting woman 's virtue to woman 's own care and her own moral responsibility . This is the Emancipation of Woman which I see going on here , the emancipation which is illustrated to my mind every time I hear a frank and fearless American girl speak to a man as if he were a friend , an equal , and , indeed , in the good old sense , a brother . In this emancipation I fully believe , and I wish it a complete success and universal recognition . JUSTIN MCCARTHY . @
