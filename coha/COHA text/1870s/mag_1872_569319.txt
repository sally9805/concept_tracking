ARTICLE li-OUR NATIONAL BANKS . THE success of our National Bank system , from its establishment to the present time , has been great , and , for the most part , we think , unexpected . It was put in operation under circumstances which , though perhaps almost necessary to its success , were still extremely adverse to its popularity . The country was involved in a revolution which threatened its existence . Public credit , on which the whole scheme was based , was well nigh destroye&amp; The managers of existing financial institutions were either positively hostile to the new plan or regarded it with doubt and suspicion . It came in the guise of an adventurer , avowedly hostile to established usage and to vested rights . The banks then existing had done much for the government , and at a time too when doing for the government at all was regarded by many men as a matter of questionable prudence ; and therefore they felt that they had a strong claim to consideration , and it might well seem that a scheme not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their existence , would arouse their opposition and alienate their support . Radical defects were believed to exist in the proposed plan . Old prejudices against a government bank and a government currency were aroused , and the similarity of the project to the so-called " Free Bank system , " which , except in a few localities , was not a favorite , by no means assisted in producing a favorable impression . We have no space here , nor would it answer any good purpose , to recapitulate the arguments , the complaints , the prognostications , the expostulations , the warnings , the entreaties , which were everywhere directed against this new scheme ; but any one who will turn to a file of newspapers or pamphlets of that time will find in correspondence , editorials , doings of conventions , and reports of committees , a mass of hostile literature of which he has for the most part probably forgotten the existence . // fudeed , perhaps the opposition to the measure , or , at least , the want of all popular sympathy for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the government had become committed to the plan , and the change from the State to the National form had been made as easy as possible , the State banks had then to be forced into the new system by " unfriendly legislation , " and that of no very mild type . Yet notwithstanding all these unfavorable circumstances , in spite of open opposition , silent distrust , and evil prophecies , the working of the scheme , it can not be denied , if indeed at this time any one is disposed to deny it , has been thus far singularly , triumphantly successful Since the establishment of the government , hardly an equal period of time can be selected , when , in all matters relating to banking and currency , affairs have gone on as satisfactorily as during the last eight years . There have been no losses to bill-holders , very few to depositors ; differences of inland exchange have become almost unknown , and funds are transmitted or drafts collected at the most distant points at an expense of a very small fraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic , " a " crisis , " a " suspension , " a run , " or any serious disturbance of any kind in our currency during all this period ; yet judging d priori , we should certainly have looked upon it as a period peculiarly liable to every species of financial irregularity and disturbance . But granting now that the condition of affairs has been in many respects peculiar during this period , and that while some of these peculiarities have been adverse to a settled condition of the currency , others may have been favorable to an exhibition of the good points of our new system , and , therefore , avoiding as far as is needful any conclusion based simply on a comparison of one portion of time with another , it still remains a very interesting subject of inquiry-To what extent , if to any , is the smooth working of our financial affairs for the last eight years fairly to be attributed to our National Bank system ? We are a people of short memories , and the present system has been in operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us look a little then at the condition of things prior to the establishment of the National Banks . // There were in the United States in 1860 , according to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury for that year , fifteejii hundred and seventy ( 1570 ) banks , distributed in thirty-one ( 31 ) States and Territories as follows Maine 68 New Hampshire , 52 Vermont , - - - - - - 46 Massachusetts , *174 Rhode Island , * . 91 Connecticut , **** 74 New York , 303 New Jersey 49 Pennsylvania , - - - 90 Delaware , 12 Maryland , 31 Virginia , - North Carolina , - South Carolina , - Georgia , - - Florida , Alabama , -  --  - Louisiana , Mississippi , Tennessee , Kentucky , Missouri , 30 Indiana , 20 Ohio , 29 Michigan , 2 Wisconsin , - - - - 108 8 Minnesota , 13 Iowa , . 2 Kansas ,  - -   - -   -  --  - 34 Nebraska , - - - - - - 45 38 Total , * .. 1570 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Territories in which they were located , there were , of course , thirty-one different kinds of banks . But in several cases there was more than one kind in the same State . Moreover , in many of the States where the general system was pretty uniform , each bank had an independent or individual charter , and these , having been granted at long intervals of time , and nuder widely varying circumstances , differed much , and often materially , from each other ; so that , instead of thirty-one , there were certainly severaL hundred different kinds in alL There was a famous phrase , now seldom heard , but which in those days jinet the eye everywhere . It was in all the Presidents ' messages and in every Secretary 's report ; no financial essay could be without it , and congressional speeches bristled with it-those made " for Buncome " - most of all . It was " A Uniform Currency . " No wonder , for each one of these fifteen hundred and seventy banks had , and , to some extent greater or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . And what a currency was that ? There was " red-dog " and " red-back , " " wild-cat " and " hard-shell , " " safety-fund " and " guaranteed " " real-estate , " " stock-secured " and " Brandon , " and other kinds more numerous than we can remember or record , and with qualities as numerous as kinds . Surely it must be good for us to call to mind those things occa 74 37 52 4 ( ! ) 2 12 1 4 // sionally , and to be thankful that they exist no longer . " A un ? forrn currency , " indeed ! like Falstaff 's regiment , * or those more recent domestic troops known as " Invincibles . " Usually , to be sure , in the older States there was some ( frequently much ) restrictive general legislation . Public sentiment there also required that corporators , officers , and managers should be men of known prudence and tried integrity of character . Indeed fifty years ago the position of a bank-director was a place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since that time ; and men have held the latter place that could not , in the times we speak og have obtained the former . Charters were granted sparingly and with great caution . A case of public necessity must be made out , and reasonable evidence shown that the capital would be furnished , and that the business would be successful . Beyond these wise precautions , no security for the public was demanded , and usually too , it is but just to say , though not always , they proved sufficient . But in later times such safeguards as these availed little against the chicanery of modern lobbyists and political managers . Still the honest legislators struggled manfully against the incoming tide of corruption . For instance , a legis. lature of one of the smaller and more conservative of the Eastern States repealed , at one time , thirteen charters granted by a previous legislature for banks at points where no public necessity required them , and where they would be likely to be useful only for purposes of speculation or fraud . As more democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the chartered banks were called , grew unpopular , and the demagogues asserted that the right of one man to have a bank was as good as another 's ; the right of every man to have a bank was a corollary from this which could not be denied . It did seem advisable , however , to try to find some partial substitute for capacity , character , and integrity ; and so , in the State of New York , and in some of the other States , what was called the " Free Bank " system was inaugurated . Under this system every man was free to have a bank , to receive deposits , and to issue currency ; but while depositors were supposed to be able to look out for themselves , it was doubtful whether the democratic right to have a bank carried // with it the ability and integrity necessary to manage one , and it did seem better on the whole under this new state of things that the bill-holder should have some security . In theory , therefore , all bill-holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds or some other prescribed security ; but then these prescribed securities were made to cover the whole range of property fi-om United States bonds to mortgages on outlying farms , or wild lands taken at the appraisement of local committees ; and so notorious was the want of care in the selection of these securities that the name " Safety Fund , " by which a certain class of these institutions was designated , became an appellation of reproach . In those States where this Free Bank system prevailed , the power to create currency was absolutely unlimited . Any persons having the requisite amount of prescribed securities could organize a bank and commence at once to issue notes . In establishing a bank of this sort the object was to get out as many bills and redeem as few as possible . It was therefore desirable to avoid traveled routes , frequented places , and all conveniences of locomotion . If it were off the lines of express , railroad , telegraph and even mail communication , all the better , for then protest could not be sent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption agencies were eschewed . Thus it came about that banks were " located " where there was neith*er a demand for the conveniences nor facilities for transacting the business of such institutions . Thus it happened that if on the sea coast of New Jersey there was some little islet or rocky surf-beaten point more entirely inaccessible than all others , it was marked at once as a choice " location " for one of these institutions of finance . Then , if finally they were ferreted out and called upon to pay , if brazen impudence did not suffice , there was generally an ignominious failure , followed by a wonderful shrinking of securities and general disappearance of assets . A characterizing anecdote of this time relates that when the officer of one of these institutions was called upon to redeem some of its bills , he declined on the ground that the law required him to " keep " ten per cent . of his circulation in specie , and if he redeemed the bills he would not have that amount // left , and would thereby violate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive . As after the lapse of a few* years we look back upon those times , the wonder grows how confidence and credit ever survived such a state of things . The truth is , they did live a wretched , struggling , precarious existence . Almost every year , generally following upon the temporary demand for currency for removing crops which occurs in the autumn of each year , there was what was called a " crisis " in the money market . The bills of these various banks having all sorts of securities , and no person or bank being under any obligation to receive them , in the manner provided in case of our national currency , they assumed all sorts of values , usually rapidly diminishing as the distance increased from their place of issue , but sometimes unfortunately quite the reverse , they being valued most where they were least known . These differ . ences of currency value , passing under the dignified name of exchange , were truly startling . Seven to ten per cent . between New York and Philadelphia , Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even five per cent . for crossing the Hudson river into New Jersey we think will be recollected by readers whose hair is not yet grey ; while the more distant points of Chicago and New Orleans represented the greater differences of from fifteen to twenty-five per cent . The writer hereof once left New York provided with specie for a journey into Virginia . He bought Pennsylvania bills in New York and Virginia bills in Baltimore , and reached his destination , after paying his expenses , with about the same nominal amount that he had when he started . Gradually and slowly this state of things , though not radically changed , was much ameliorated . The institutions of the Southern and Western States , where this loose style of banking mainly prevailed , so far lost credit , that it was no longer an object to establish banks at those points , and in many cases , as was natural , a chronic distrust of all banks , even an intense hatred of the name of bank , grew out of this unfortunate experience , and culminated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furnishing of currency to the country was at length mainly left to the old and well known institutions of the Northern and Eastern States . // But nothwithstandiug these meliorations in its practical working , the most pernicious features of the system still remained , viz. : under the " Free Bank or New York system the power of the banks to expand the currency to an unlimited extent by the creation of new institutions and the issue of new bills , and under the New England or Charter system the power , though very much more limited , to still add very materially to the currency , liable always to a forced and sudden contraction , which liability was greatly enhanced by what was known as the " Suffolk sqstein of Redemptions . " This took its name from the Suffolk Bank of Boston , though whose agency it was conducted . Its method of operation was as follows . Each bank in New England sent all bills of New England banks , received by it in the course of its business , to the Suffolk bank . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily , the smaller country banks only once or twice in a week . These bills were " sorted " by the Suffolk bank , and returned to the bank that issued them . No direct charge was made by the Suffolk bank for doing this business , but each bank was expected at all times to keep a sufficiently large deposit with the Suffolk bank to meet all its own bills received by the Suffolk . If the bills of other banks sent by any one bank to the Suffolk did not furnish sufficient funds to meet its own bills received by the Suffolk , then its account must be kept good by other means ; usually the means used for this purpose were drafts on some bank in New York , through which the country bank made its collections , and where it kept its surplus funds . If any New England bank failed to keep the Suffolk bank supplied with funds for this purpose , then the bills of the bank so failing were " thrown out " by the Suffolk bank , that is , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice of this was immediately given by the Suffolk bank to all its correspondents , who at once refused to take the bills of the banks thus " thrown out . " The circulatiou of a bank thus thrown out was by that means at once stopped , and the bank was virtually suspended . Its bills no longer had currency : they were bought up at a discount by brokers , and sent home to be redeemed in specie , or drafts , as the interest of the holder might dictate . This throwing out was a great injury to a bank , and // of course there was a great fear of it . It was usually the last thing which a bank would permit to happen , for even though the bank might be sound and able to go on with its business the next day , ill news with its proverbial rapidity would by that time have spread the story of its short-coming far and wide , and it would require weeks and perhaps months to efface the impression from the public mind , and bring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , with some modifications , was adopted in the State of New York through the Metropolitan bank , and perhaps to some extent in other parts of the country . It was in several respects an excellent arrangement . It was an economical method of effecting exchanges among the various banks . It had a strong tendency to check large issues of circulation ; it immediately detected any serious weakness in a bank , and advised the whole country of it . It impressed continually upon banks the necessity of having assets which could be depended upon for prompt payment or ready conversion . It enforced the constant keeping of a cash balance , equal in amount at the least to the weekly redemptions , which usually averaged about one-tenth of the circulation . In short , in all matters pertaining to the soundness of the banks themselves the immediate and direct effect of the arrangement was excellent , and under that system of banking came to be looked upon as a necessity . But , on the other hand , for the interest of the mercantile community , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community generally , and so reflexively for the interests of the banks themselves , this system was in some respects very bad . It destroyed all flexibility in bank management , and all power to extend assistance to worthy dealers in times of necessity . It was so devised as always to aggravate any slight derangement of the money market , and to intensify it to the utmost degree , culminating every few years and usually oftener in a panic , a crisis , the temporary destruction of values , the permanent destruction of many hard earned private fortunes , and , for the time being , a total derangement of all monetary affairs ; producing always a stoppage of industrial employments with its attendant train of sufferings , and bringing to many innocent individuals utter ruin . And all this for no physical cause , // but from moral causes of excitement , fear , and distrust , aggravated and augmented by this unfortunate machinery . It prq*-moted a strong antagonism of interests between the bank and its customers at all times , and in times of trouble an internecine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money easier , that is , cheaper and more plentiful , in times of ease , and not only harder , that is , scarcer and higher , when any cause produced closeness , but beyond certain limits it was sure to . be absolutely unattainable , no matter with what credit or security , as the history of every one of those repeated *crises so fully attests . Now the banks individually and singly were utterly powerless in this matter . They had no control over it , and any general combination among the banks beyond the limits of a single city or State  --  or any attempt at combined action , even for temporary purposes , was , under the circumstances of the case which have been already set forth , utterly impossible . What could the individual banks do toward stemming the torrent ? If they failed to redeem their bills they were at once discredited , if not legally enjoined , and their power to do anything for their customers was of course at an end . But to sustain their credit it became necessary to compel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none : where then were the customers to get their money to pay ? It could not be had . The immense and sudden withdrawal of currency , and the utter impossibility of obtaining money with any amount of securities , or at any rate of interest , has been a marked and perfectly well known feature of these currency crises . Time after time we have seen the experiment tried , and always with the same result . First , a somewhat stringent money market , from any accidental cause ; then a scramble among the banks , each striving to outdo the other in their efforts to extort money from *ach other and from their debtors . And for what ? To get their own currency securely within their vaults , where their debtors could not get it to pay these very claims for which they were pressing them , getting all they could and letting nothing go in return . Yet the struggle for the banks was a vital one - they were compelled , as it seemed , to commit suicide in order to save their lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessening of the currency , a ruinous depreciation of values , then a crash among the merchants in the great cities , then a stoppage of mills and other enterprises , throughout the country , workmen discharged , fortunes lost , property sacrificed , then at last a suspension of the banks , sometimes produced by a concert of action among depositors , but generally by a wild scramble for specie called a " run , " impelled partly by a fear ofultirnate loss , and partly by a vague desire of punishing the banks to whom the trouble was usually attributed . Then , after the suspension , when it was known that all the banks were acting alike , that they were no longer drawing on each other , that they were no longer compelled to ruin their customers in order to save themselves , then business would again resume its usual course ; banks made their customary loans ; people brought back the specie , which they had not really wanted , and had only drawn through fright ; and if it had temporarily risen to a premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , things went on as before . But in the meantime a great many good men ,  --  and always in such times those who were most prompt and honorable suffered most ,  --  had been ruined , industry temporarily paralyzed , confidence of men in each other destroyed , workmen thrown out of employment , poor people suffering for bread , and all through the workings of a deliberately adopted system of currency which none were found wise enough to remedy . The most sudden , severe , disastrous , and apparently unnecessary of these panics or crises was that of 1857 . The fright was commenced on the 22d of August by the failure of the Ohio Life and Trust Company , and culminated in the suspension of specie payments by the New York banks on the 17th of October . The cause of this panic seems to have been pure fright , as the volume of business transacted by the Trust Co. was not large enough , nor its transactions of sufficiently wide extent , for its stoppage to produce any necessary serious disturbance in the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the failure of any well-known merchant of high standing would not have had precisely the same effect But when the fright had once commenced , the machinery already described was ample to develop from this slight cause the train of disasters which ensued . // We can enter into none of the details of that panic in this place . Its history has been written , but its disastrous results and the quick return to a normal condition of things , followed by a plethora of specie in the great money centers , all showing fully the causelessness of the panic so far as the currency was concerned , afford incontestible evidence of the viciousness of the system under which it took place . Travelers relate how in the passes of the Alps the pathway is overhung by immense avalanches , which the careless shout of some reckless passer-by may bring down to overwhelm all who are below ; but in these places prudent men do not willingly linger-silently , swiftly , and anxiously they pass the dangerous ground . And yet with great pains we built up an avalanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years - only somewhat stunned and confounded when it came down , crushing our neighbors and half covering ourselves . The final catastrophe of 1857 was brought about by a " run upon the banks of New York city for specie on the 17th of October ; and this run , so far as an intelligent purpose could be traced in it , was the result of a settled conviction in the minds of the mercantile community , that as soon as the banks were compelled to suspend specie payment , and were thus all brought to one level ( of nominal bankruptcy ) , their internecine warfare must cease , and that with this the trouble would end . The result showed that they were right . The Kilkenny cats saved their tails , and a suspension of specie payments , instead of being regarded with horror , came to be looked upon as a legitimate means of affording necessary relief as it has grown to be in England under Sir Robert Peel 's act , and as it always must be in a system founded on such a palpable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars of paper with one dollar of coin . Thus it happened that , in the fall of 1860 , when we were again threatened with a similar state of things , the banks of the city of New York , profiting by the experience of 11857 , and acting in unity through the association at the clearing-house , wisely and courageously prevented a most ruinous impending crisis , by promptly suspending specie payment , and thus restoring confidence ( ? ) without waiting for the disease to run its usual // course . This measure of theirs was utterly illegal and in defiance of law , but it was so beneficial and benevolent so wise and prudent , that the officers of the law , sustained by public opinion , withheld all legal action against them . Now in the month of November , 1867 , we had all the material for , and all the indications og as serious a panic as that of 1857 . We had the close money market , the dull trade , more suspicion and distrust of certain important classes of merchants , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crops , &amp;c. , &amp;c . And yet we had no panic , and why ? Mainly , it was because the banks throughout the country no longer feared each other , and they did not fear each other because the machinery no longer existed which made them mortal enemies . By the terms of the National Bank act any National Bank bills pay any debt to any National Bank . There is therefore no longer any need of forcing bills home to be redeemed , and no need of each bank cutting off all facilities from their customers in order that they may have funds to meet their own redemptions , and get their bills into their vaults out of the reach of their neighbors . Now , recurring once more to the panic of 1857 , it seems probable that it was in reality the turning point in our financial history ; for although the precise nature of the evils under which we labored did not seem to be clearly understood , it had become so apparent that the want of homogeneity and of some general system was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to Congress , in December , 1857 , was induced to hold the following semi-apologetic language . It will be noted in reading what he says , how , at least in a negative way , he sketched the outlines of our present system ; for which , perhaps , he has never yet received due credit . He has just spoken of the crisis through which the ebuntry had passed , and from the effects of which it had not yet recovered , and then says : " These revulsions must continue to occur at successive intervals , so long as the amount of the paper currency and bank loans and discounts of the country shall be left to the discretion of fourteen hundred irresponsible banking institutions . which , from the very law of their nature , will consult the interests of the stockholders rather than the public welfare . // " The framers of the Constitution , when they gave to Congress the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof* ' and prohibited the States fro , * coining money , emitting bills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin a tender in payment of debts , supposed they had protected the people against the evils of an excessive and irredeemable paper currency . They are not responsible for the existing anomaly that a government endowed with the sovereign attribute of coining money and regulating the value thereof , should have no power to prevent others from driving this coin out of the country , and filling up the channels of circulation with paper which does not represent gold and silver . " It is one of the highest and most responsible duties of government to insure to the people a sound circulating medium , the amount of which ought to be adapted with the utmost possible wisdom and skill to the wants of internal trade and foreign exchanges . If this be either greatly above or greatly below the proper standard , the marketable value of every mati 's property is increased or diminished in the same proportion , and injustice to individuals , as well as incalculable evils to the community , are the consequence . " Unfortunately , under the construction of the Federal Constitution , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and delicate duty has been dissevered from the coining power and virtually transferred to more than fourteen hundred State banks , acting in dependently of each other , and regulating their paper issues almost exclusively by a regard to the present interest of their stockholders. . * * * * " As a collateral and eventual security it is doubtless wise , and ought in all cases to be required , that banks shall hold an amount of United States or State securities equal to their notes in circulation and pledged for their redemption . This , however , furnishes no adequate security he should have said no security , that not being at all the object of it against over issues . On the contrary , it may be perverted to inflate the currency . Indeed , it is possible by this means to convert all the debts of the United States and State governments into bank notes . " In connection with the above , we have various remarks indicating the President 's view of the cause of the trouble and of its remedy ; among them we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks owe to the public is to keep in. their vaults a sufficient amount of gold and silver to insure the convertibility of their notes into coin at all times and under all circumstances . " This would of course require an amount of coin equal to the whole amount of circulation and deposits to be kept constantly on hand , and as he proposes in addition to this , as quoted above , that the United States bonds should be deposited as col -- lateral for the circulation , it is clear that his views of banking* were eminently conservative , though somewhat impracticable* we fear , viewed from a stockholder 's stand-point . He elsewhere seems to assume that one-third of the amount // of circulation held in coin , combined with stringent legislation , would answer the purpose ; but in that case , if depositors called first , the bill-holders would stand but a meager chance . So that it seems probable on the whole that he has rather overstated his own views of the necessity of convertibility in the paragraph quoted above . But we shall have occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw was greatly needed , but pro . nounced forever unattainable , and that not without good apparent reason , the late Secretary of the Treasury did , nevertheless , accomplish . Availing himself of the exigencies of revolution and the necessities of war , " plucking the flower Safety* from the nettle Danger , " ' and an uncommonly ugly nettle too , he so controled his adverse fate as to minister to the relief of an exhausted exchequer , and to rid the country of the thraldom of a wretched system of currency . It is one of the emancipations , and by no means the least , for which we have to thank our revolution . This brief outline of the condition of things , which existed prior to the establishment of our present system , and which led to its adoption , has been intended to answer , in some sort , the question with which we commenced it , to wit : To what extent , *f to any , is the smooth working of our financial affairs , for the last eight years , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not dons so , it has failed of its object . But to enumerate more specifically some of the advantages derived from the change , they are these : 1st . It furnishes a currency umform in value in every part of the country , and which no financial disturbances can render otherwise . This fact is due in part to all bills having a uniform security , but mainly to that provision of the act which requires every bank to receive the bills of every other bank , and also makes them a legal tender in all transactions to which the Government is a party , customs duties excepted . The value of this quality in a currency , simply in an economic point of view , is almost beyond computation . The losses involved in the socalled exchanges of other days , and the risks of collection and transm*s*1on which grew out of this want of uniformity in *value , are swept away at a blow . // 2d. ft gives us a currency perfectly secured . The public debt forms , perhaps , the best practicable security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the guaranty of all the resources of the State to each of its citizens . 3d . This security is urnform  --  the same kind and amount of security for every bill of every bank . The moral value and influence of this feature of the system is very great . It is not that all are well secured , but that all are equally well secured , and in exactly the same manner . State obligation , or others , which might be considered perfectly safe and desirable as a private investment , or as a private security , would nevertheless be subject to relative fluctuations of value as between each other . And this would necessitate watchfulness and care , and an intimate knowledge on the part of the public of the concerns of each bank , and thus become a prolific source of anxiety , suspicion , and distrust . 4th . The currency thus furnished to the country is of a fixed amount , subject only to be changed by act of Congress , as the necessities of the country may demand . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency is a most delicate and dangerous one to wield . It involves the value of all property and labor . It is the balance that weighs all material objects of human desire . But under this act , perhaps , this power is as carefully limited as the nature of our government permits . It can 6nly be exercised openly , in the sight of all the people , after deliberation , discussion , and criticism ; whereas , heretofore , it has been left to the interests or caprices , or , as Mr. Buchanan has said , " to the discretion of fourteen hundred irresponsible banking institutions , which , from the very law of their nature , will consult the interests of the stockholders rather than the public welfare . " 5th . The banks of the country all being regulated by one bureau , and under the same laws and rules , are thereby brought into relations of harmony with each other . This has a great tendency to produce uniformity in their methods of doing business , and the tendency of this uniformity will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the combined wisdom of all engaged in it , will be the result . Thus sound principles of banking will be developed , and when // developed their adoption will be but a question of time . Mistakes and irregularities will be less likely to occur , band wilful misconduct more promptly detected and punished . 6th . The evils and prejudices connected with a centralized money power like the old United States banks , or with a simple government currency like our present legal tenders ( which , though necessary to meet the exigencies of our condition , can not be safely continued when that exigency shall cease ) , are obviated and avoided . 7th . That feature of the act which permits a portion of the " legal reserve " of the country banks to be kept with their city correspondents , is a wise one . It recognizes the existing course of business , and places the funds where they are wanted for use , instead of locking them up in the vaults of the banks . 8th . Whatever may be our opinion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the " free " clause in the National Bank act , that is , the right of everybody to establish such a bank on the same terms , is calculated to , and does , avoid prejudice and conciliate popular favor . It is regarded as being in harmony with the spirit of our free institutions . And since the clause limiting the total circulation of the country , and the requirement in all cases of United States bonds as security therefor , avoids two of the greatest dangers of the old system , there can be no serious objection to this feature of the bill ; while everything in it which conciliates popular favor tends to increase its usefulness and stability . If we could return to the old ideas of the honor attached to the position and duties of a bank officer , and of the high character required to fill such a post , it would undoubtedly be a great gain ; but for the present , at least , any such hopes are futile , and we must look to other means of protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may well be doubted whether any plan which involved the granting by Congress of special charters would not be liable to abuses and evils far greater than the advantages which could be reasonably hoped to accrue from it . 9th . There is one great and perhaps fatal fallacy which underlies all our systems of paper money . Whether that fallacy is necessary to constitute a " sound system " . is not now // the question . The fallacy is this , and we can not state it more clearly than again to quote the language of President Buchanan * " The first duty which these banks owe to the public is to keep in their vaults a sufficient amount of gold and silver , to insure the convertibility of their notes into coin* at all times and under all circumstances . " That is , that , everywhere and always , each dollar of paper money represents an actual dollar of coin lying ready for exchange , whenever it may be demanded . Now , there are a few things about this matter that we do positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true ; and the second is , that everybody knows that it is not true ; and the third is , that all of us each know that the other knows it is not true ; and the fourth is , that nobody ever expects , or did expect , or requires , or did require , that it should be true ; and the fifth is , that if it were true , we should have no paper money ; and the sixth is , that if it were true , we should want no paper money ; and the seventh is , that there is never gold enough in the country at any one time to make it true ; and the eighth is , that our legitimate needs do not require it , and that we all know that they do not ; but that , through fear and loss of confidence , the truth of it occasionally comes to be practically tested , and always , of course , with the same negative results , which tests are both dangerous and disastrous to property and morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to be based on this fallacy , it is of the last importance that we have a currency which will command public confidence thoroughly , and will be least liable to such fluctuations in amount or value as will be likely to induce any such demand for specie , and to precipitate upon us the evils connected therewith . 10th . Under this system a plan of general redemption , Suffolk or otherwise , has so far been , and we believe safely may be , dispensed with , thereby avoiding one prolific source of panic , and of sudden and unnecessary contraction , and all the evils that follow in its train . For it can not be too much dwel# upon that what we want above all things , in a paper currency like ours , is a system which shall , if possible , contain neither the temptation nor the power to produce contraction in times of stringency , nor inflation in times of abundance . That such was the result of the old redemption system , important and // valuable as it doubtless was in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already clearly shown ; bu.t , whether we have succeeded in making it clear or not , the fact is so . Our object in this Article has been to draw a contrast between our present system of currency , as at present administered , and that which preceded it , endeavoring to point out what we have gained by the change ; and , having done this , we might perhaps properly stop here . But , being aware of the fact that our view of the non-necessity of a system of general redemptions will be regarded by some persons with great horror , and by others with a considerable degree of modest doubt , we feel it incumbent upon us to add a few words directly upon that point . And , in the first place , we note the very obvious fact , and one which we can not help regarding as substantially conclusive , that we have had no such system in operation during the last eight years ,  --  the marked feature of which time has been a lack of those very disturbances in our currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than hinted that the smooth working of our financial affairs during this period has been owing in no small degree to the absence of this redemption system ; and we shall at least hold , until the contrary is clearly shown , that any claim for the absolute necessity of such a system must , in the light of experience , be given up . But , granting that it is not a necessity , advantages may still be claimed for it which should not be disregarded . Now , as all our notions and prejudices in favor of this scheme have come from our experience under our old system , let us inquire what , under that system , was the value of this plan of redemption . It was this : first , that it tended to prevent , but by no means prevented , undue expansion ; this is now forever and at once prevented by a limit set to the whole volume of currency . Second , that it tended to prevent , but by no means prevented , the issuing of bills without sufficient security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its very operation , it not unfrequently destroyed the value of the assets on which reliance for this ultimate redemption had been placed ; but ultimate payment is now fully secured by United States bonds . Third . It can hardly be seriously claimed that this system of constant redemption had anything to do with getting specie for // daily legitimate use by customers , except so far as it exercised an influence upon the general soundness of the banks . On th' contrary , it was what continually stood in the way of getting specie whenever any considerable extra amount might be wanted , and the scheme usually had to be temporarily got rid of before the amount could be had . Witness the panic of 1857 , when specie became abundant so soon as confidence was restored by the suspension of the banks ; which was really a suspension of constant compulsory general redemption , and nothing more . What , then , is this process of redemption from which so much is expected ? The banks of the country , instead of paying out ( as now ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will put them up in packages and send them to their correspondents in New York . And do they pay gold for them ? No , they are passed to the credit of the bank sending them . Then this New York bank counts them over again , and sends them to the redeeming agency . And do they pay gold for them ? No , they pass them to the credit of the bank which brought them , and give them in return a package of bills of the same bank which sent the original bundle ; these the New York bank takes and sends back to the original country bank . And now , surely , the gold will be forthcoming . No , not at all , but this bank has now another package ready , either of bills or checks on some city bank , which it sends back to pay for the package received , and so on . This is the whole transaction . It calls for no gold from anybody . It is a simple swapping of each other 's bills , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is all A late official paper , advocating a system of general redemptions , admits that the notes are all equally well secured , and their ultimate redemption established beyond a question , but says , " when this , " that is , the redemption scheme , " is accomplished , the amount of notes in circulation will be regulated strictly by the demand . When the volume is greater than is necessary to do the business of the country , the banks will be called upon to redeem the surplus , and it will be returned . When trade is active , and more currency is required , the banks will expand their issues , and redemptions will not be demanded until the season of activity is over . " // Now does not experience teach us that almost precisely the reverse of this is true . Which way does the curre*ncy tend , which way has it always tended , under our old system , in times of pressure and alarm  --  to contraction or expansion ? Where do the bills go ? - out of the vaults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All the tables tell the story . And is it not also on record how once the Bank of England boldly and forcibly reversed this natural and acknowledged tendency , and thereby checked a panic and saved a crisis . But , without this system , the funds which the banks do not loan they will certainly have on hand , whether in their own bills or those of others , and when there is a demand for them they will be loaned . And there is a positive and great advan , and , so far as we can see , no disadvantage , in making our paper currency , either in the hands of banks or the people , those that issue it or those that take it , as near like actual gold and silver , in all its monetary functions , as is possible to make it . Besides this , a system of redemptions would at once withdraw a large part of the currency , probably about one-fifth , from active , useful circulation ; this portion being about the amount in trart8itu and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various banks , waiting to be forwarded . This loss falls on the banks , and through them on the public , and is equal , with our present paper circulation , to a loss of $120,000,000 of the circulating medium . There are other attendant expenses equal to , perhaps greater than this . The express companies , who are really the only parties interested in the redemption system , will , under this scheme , be paid for transporting the whole currency from eight to ten times in the course of the year . Then , one extra clerk for each $500,000 circulation will not be a large estimate for the extra labor demanded by this scheme ; and unless some substantial advantage is to be gained all this expense is thrown away . At this point we hear the awful question sounded in our ears , " IDo you advocate an irredeemable currency ? " To which solemn inquiry we reply , " Not in the least . " Neither do we see the necessity of testing its redeemability every few minutes or every few days , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful gardeners who dig up their seeds two or three times a day to see if they have sprouted . And it is just thi* sort of redeemability which heretofore has been always being attempted and has always failed , and which a system of redemptions most inevitably leads to . Let , then , every bank be required to redeem its bills at its own counter , or , better still , let this requirement be so guarded as not to be abused , and at the same time it will be much more certain of furnishing all legitimately required specie at all times . The true use and necessity of specie in a currency of a mixed character , and the effects of the return to specie payments upon our new system , though so elosely connected with the subject , can not be entered upon here , but still are to be considered in any full estimate of its value . The object of this article is rather to bring the comparison up to the present time . History rather than speculation . It may be asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panics impossible . We certainly do not . Banks and the currency are but a part of the machinery by means of which the operations of commerce and finance are carried on , and through which , so to speak , the results of these operations become visible . But no system of finance has yet been discovered , nor is it likely that there can be any , which will prevent fluctuations in the value of money and occasional serious disturbances in commercial affairs . It is mostly through the banks , at such times , that these troubles become visible , or are immediately felt ; and the unphilosophic mind , mistaking this connection for cause and effect , naturally enough suspects the banks of being at the bottom of all the trouble . Hence the violent abuse of these institutions always indulged in on such occasions ; hence , also , the frequent attempts to mitigate these evils by remedies applied to what are themselves but involuntary instruments worked by a superior force . Again , the regulation of the currency under our National system , if unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can not be very sanguine as to the unerring wisdom of this body in conducting our financial affairs . A large popular body is , in many respects , peculiarly unfitted for the discharge of so delicate a trust . Its members // are not selected or elected on any principle or in accordance with any practice which tends to beget confidence in tb*tt regard , and we never see them approach this class of subjects without serious apprehension of the results . These remarks are not intended in any unfriendly spirit , but would be a4ccepted by the members of that body whose opinions are best worth having . They are made simply because they are true , and because they indicate one of the serious dangers to oar financial success . Nevertheless , our present system is so far superior to anything we have ever had before that we can afford to run some risk ; and the more clearly we understand what are its dangers , and what its advantages , the more likely we shall be to avoid the one and secure the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
