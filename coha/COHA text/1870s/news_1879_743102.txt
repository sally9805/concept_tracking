txt When the Erie Railway was being constructed , the engineers encountered a vast morass in the Town of Chester , four miles east of this village . It covered.noarly. 500 acres , and was filled with treacherous quagmirc5 and springs that were almost bottomless . To construct a foundation for the road-bed of the railway across this great swamp required the driving of Piles to the depth of 100 feet , and the use of hundreds of thousands of loads of stones and dirt . The building . of the mile of road necessary cross ? the swamp called for a greater outlay of motley than any five miles of the road between Piermont and Jersey City . The tract of swamp was not considered worth the nominal tax collected from its owners , and for 20 years after the road was built remained in its noisome condition , the home of malaria and deadly fevers . Twenty years ago a farmer conceived the idea of draining a portion of the tract and making it tillable soil . By ditching , be reclaimed 60 acres . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found that the draining left as a soil the finest of black muck , composed almost entirely of vegetable mold , the price advanced to $17 an acre . After the 60 acres were reclaimed , the price still further increased , until to-day as high as $1,000 has been paid for the reclaimed land . The ruling price is $500 an acre . The great value of the land is owing to its extraordinary adaptability to the culture of onions . A crop of 800 bushels of onions to the acre is not uncommon , and the Greycourt onion meadows are celebrated throughout the Country . About 300 acres are under cultivation this year , and the success of the onion business in the maidows has led to the reclaiming of similar lands in other parts of the county , untilit is believed that , the onion crop of Orange County will amount to 500 , - 000 bushels this year . The average price received by onion-raisers is $1 a bushel . The average yield is 300 bushels to the acre . The crop is almost invariably sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as it matures early in the season . the farmer is allowed abundant time to keep his laud in the condition necessary to its productiVeness . There are 17,000 acres of swamp-land in the Wallkill Va.ley which will eventually be converted into this muck soil , which is the best in the world for vegetable raising . The land , after draining , is tilled with tho slightest labor . Onion-seed is sown by a hand-drill ; and the greatest labor is in keeping down the weeds after the plant begins to grow . This work is done by boys and girls . Hundreds of these may be seen in the growing season on their hands and knees between the onion rows , pulling up the weeds that the rich Soil calla rapidly into existence . The weeding requires skill and care , as the soil is so loose that there is constant danger of tearing tip the young and tender plants by their roots or removing their covering of earth . The red onion is the variety grown most successfully , as the dark muck gives the , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
