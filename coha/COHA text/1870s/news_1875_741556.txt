txt The most exciting scene that has occurred in the House for many years took place to-day . After it had been agreed to take up the Civil Rights bill , and while Gen. Butler was explaining the purpose and necessity tor its enactment , a colloquy took place between him and Mr. Niblack touching that portion of the bill which gives United States Courts cognizance of violations of the bill . This colloquy was conducted with perfect good feeling , and with strict propriety , the point of difference being as to the policy of employing United States instead of State courts to bring action for violations of the proposed law . Mr. Butler said the negro could not obtain justice in the State courts in some sections of the country , and it was therefore proposed in the bill to refer him to the United States courts . Congress had given the negro all the rights of citizenship , and it was the duty of Congress to furnish him the means to enforce those rights . Mr. Niblack said the force of that declaration was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not be better to abolish State Governments , and declare selfgovernment a failure . Mr. Butler replied if the banditti , horse thieves , and murderers who went about at night unmolested , committing depredations. were in the majority . the government was bad . Mr. , of Texas . asked Butler whether he stigmatized a majority of the Southern people as murderers , to which Butler replied : " By no manner of means . I say there are as good men South as anywhere . and as bad men there as are on the face of the globe . " Butler then resumed his seat and muttered , with a profane oath , You are the only murderer on this floor ; you killed a man at New-Orleans . " Mr. Lynch , of Mississippi . - was on the floor , Butler having yielded for a speech on the bill , but before he commenced Mr. Butler arose and stated that it had been reported to him that Mr. used the language above quoted . He said be had not heard the remarks but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjustifiable , and ruffianly . This produced great excitement and commotion , the members flocking around Butler and who were standing opposite each other at either side of the space in front of the Clerk 's desk . insisted that Butler had stigmatized a majority of the Southern people , and several members on the Democratic side shouted over , " You did say majority . " At this time the entire House were standing , and the aisles and space in front of the Clerk 's desk were crowded - with excited men , half of whom were talking and gesticulating . This , with the hammering of the Speaker 's gavel , made up a scene of confusion not witnessed in the House since before the war . Mr. De Witt , of New-York , crossed over to Mr. Butler ; talking in an excited manner , and shaking his finger at the object of his wrath . Mr. Butler stood unmoved , and sneeringly inquired , " What does Mr. De Witt , of New-York , with the quarrel of Mr. , of Texas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witt what he was " poking around here about , ' ! when De Witt retired . Mr. Hancock , of Texas . stood in front of 's desk , which is in the front row , and prevented him from rising , while Mr. Lamar , of Mississippi , who sits two seats in rear of , leaned over and informed that gentleman that his language was unjustifiable . " That is no behavior for this House , " said Lamar . Finally the Speaker succeeded in quieting the angry storm , when Mr. anise and inquired whether Butler did say a majority of the Southern people were murderers . If he did not , retracted what he had said . Mr. ' Butler replied that he did not , and could not think it possible that any man could understand him as saying the Southern people were murderers . Some excited members on the Democratic side insisted that Butler did use the offensive words , and demanded that the words used be written out by the reporter . The Speaker directed the zeporters to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. , and suspended all business until this was done , which occupied about thirty minutes . When the Clerk had read the remarks , the Speaker said had used undignified and unparliamentary language , and had they been heard by the Speaker , would have been called to order . Quiet was restored , and Mr. Lynch , of Mississippi , a colored man , I was about commencing his speech on the Civil Rights bill , when Mr. Brown , of Kentucky . arose and desired Mr. Butler to yield him the floor for a few minutes . Mr. Brown is a man of strong prejudices and would scorn to make acknowledgment that a negro was his equal . As Butler had already yielded to Lynch , Brown would be Tequired to ask the privilege of the floor from " the gentleman from Mississippi . " Some of the Republicans , knowing the strength of Brown 's prejudices , said to Butler , " Make him ask Lynch . " Butler referred Brown to Lynch , but he deolined to ask the privilege from the colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded a few minutes with his remarks , Mr. Lamar , who had spoken to Lynch , addressed the Speaker . and said : " Through the courtesy of my colleague from Mississippi , I desire to make a parliamentary inquiry . " He then asked whether it was parliamentary for a member to speak of language on the floor as ungentlemanly and ruffianly . He made the inquiry only in the interest of decorum and good order . The Speaker said it was not . Even under provocation a member was not justified in the use of such language , but under great provocation a member of Congress would not be human if he did not transgress strict parliamentary rule . Mr. said if he misunderstood the language of Mr. Butler . he retracted what he said ; but if he did not misunderstand him ho would reiterate it . Butler said - what thought was a reproach he regarded as an honor . He had hanged a man at New-Orleans , and would always regret he had not hanged more , of his class in that city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the galleries . Mr. was held down in his seat by his iiends , but was heard to mutter , " I am ready for him , or for his son , if he has a son , to take it up for him . " Order was speedily restored , and Mr. Lynch resumed his remarks without ) further interruption . Mr. 's conduct is very generally condemned by the Democratic members , and it is probable they will require him to apologize to the House to-morrow for his exhibition of bad manners . THE DEBATE ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL . The Rock Island and Hennepin Canal bill having been assigned as a. special order for to-day , it would have held the floor against any motion to take up the Civil Rights bill , but Mr. Hawley , of Illinois , who has charge of it , consented to its postponement . It will come up immediately after the Civil Rights bill is disposed of . The action of Mr. Hawley made it possible to bring the Civil Rights bill before the House a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole day has been spent in discussing it , and an evening session to-night is held for the same purpose . Except the exciting incidents growing out of the quarrel between Gen. Butler and , the debate was comparatively dull . The speeches were , for the most part , merely a rehash of all the old arguments upon the Civil Rights question . It is expected that the previous question will be called some time to-morrow afternoon , and that the bill , with various amendments , will then be voted upon , though it is possible the Democrats may use the little power that is left them for filibustering and delay action for a few hours . Various attempts will be made to modify the bill before the House by amendments , and no one can predict in advance what shape the bill may assume before it is finally voted upon . REPUBLICAN CAUCUS ON AFFAIRS IN THE SOUTH A joint committee of the Republican caucus of the House and Senate was held to-night for the purpose of considering affairs in the Southern States . Representatives from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Arkansas were present by invitation , and presented the result of their observations and experiences in the South , making such recommendations as they deemed warranted by the testimony which they received . A subcommittee was appointed to consider the views and recommendations presented , with discretionary power to prepare a bill and report at a future meeting of the joint caucus committee . During the discussion , the subject of making an appropriation for the army for the next two fiscal years , in accordance with the demands of the Southern Republicans , was brought forward , and . the opinion was unanimously expressed that the Republican Representatives and the people of the North would not indorse so tmusual a proposition . RING KALARAUA 'S EXPENSES BILL PASSED . The House bill appropriating $25,000 to defray the expenses of entertaining King Kalakaua during his recent visit to this city was called up in the Senate to-day by Mr. Cameron , and passed without objection .

The next committee in order to be called is the Committee on Claims . which has already reported a large number of bills . Mr. Scott , the Chairman , gave notice that when his committee was called to-morrow he would ask an extension of time beyond the morning hour , as there will probably be no further opportunity this session to consider bills from his committee .
