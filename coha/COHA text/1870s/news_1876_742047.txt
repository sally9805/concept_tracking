txt The President has dealt a telling thrust at the Rivers and Harbors bill , and at the party which is responsible for it . As we took occasion to say , when this appropriation bill was agreed to in conference , it has been a piece of patchwork from the first . The items put into the bill by Mr. HEREFORD , of West Virginia , who is Chairman of the Committee ou Commerce , were many of them extravagant and absurd . Mr. HEREFORD seems to have been possessed with the notion that the was a first- rate opportunity to gain local popularity at the cost of the nation . His plan , obviously , was to induce Congress to appropriate money for the " improvement " of the creeks and streams of the part of the country from which his political strength must be drawn . Under a pretense of facilitating navigation , it was proposed to spend the public money for the direct benefit of contractors and the indirect benefit of somebody else . It is easy to say that mill streams and trout-brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snags , rocks , or lodges which must be removed . Navigation relates to commerce , and the regulation of commerce is one of the functions of the National Government . This chain of reasoning being established , what easier than to claim that the Government must remove the impediments complained of ? This game was played very skillfully by the so-called Reform House of Representa ' Lives . As the bill left the Committee on Commerce , some of its provisions were simply monstrous . Thousands of dollars were appropriated for the improvement of rivers and harbors never before heard ot , except in some local chronicle . The lion 's share of the money was devoted to the State of the Chairman of the committee ; but good care was taken to secure the support of other States by conceding to them a few items of expenditure which were uunecessary and wasteful . When the bill reached the Senate it was tinkered by an interested band of schemers , who traded off their votes for the measure by stipulating for the insertion of jobs of their own . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the result was a bill which was botched and tinkered from beginning to end . Seri- , ator EDMUNDS made a caustic speech against the measure , as it had then been left ; and he urged that in these times , when economy is the rule , the petty places which cry out for appropriations must wait . They have managed to rub along without " improvement , " and the commerce of the country has not materially suffered in consequence of the failure to make two feet of water run where only six inches now flow . But , in one way and another , ? this bill of shreds and patches was licked into shape . As reported to the House , it appropriated $5,872 , - 850 . It was an omnibus in which were snugly packed all sorts of local jobs , for each one of which some one member was anxiously responsible . When it left the Senate , some of these objectionable passengers had been kicked out ; but others , equally objectionable were put in their places . Atter interminable conference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even five millions , and in that shape the bill went to the President . With a few exceptions , it would have been a good thing if the whole batch of appropriations had been killed by a veto . As it is. the President has notified the House that many of the sums voted in the act are for purely local purposes . If it had been made obligatory upon him to expend these amounts , ho would have refused to sign the bill , so palpably extravagant and wasteful are the appropriations . It happens , however , that the expenditures specified are to be made under the direction of the President . He may exercise his discretion in the premises , and , while he reminds the House of his duty , he gives it to understand that none of the proposed expenditures which to him seem wasteful will be authorized . This is a heavy blow to the schemers of the Hereford stamp . They have seemed to think that if their plans to secure the naming of their jobs in the Appropriation bill are complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appomattox down for $30,000 , Charlevoix Harbor , Mich. , for $10,000 , and sums ranging all the way from $5,000 to $50,000 for streams and harbors which even the Congressmen who ad-vocated their claims were not able to point out on the map . The President has done a substantial service to the country by refusing to sanction such shameless extravagance , and to tell the House bluntly that so long as the expenditures are left to his discretion , lie will not make them . This bill is only an example of the way in which petty local interests are permitted to fritter away the public funds . There was no reason , for example , why the Hiawassee River ( does the reader know that stream ? ) should be dredged out at an expense of ten thousand dollars taken from the United States Treasury . But the constituents of some Congressman who live on the Hiawassee are very much interested in this job , or some influential contractor wants a job ; so the Congressman considers that his whole term of official life is made valuable if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large . This is the history of more than one-half of these reckless appropriations . In the bill , as it has now become a law , are a few items of vital importance . Saving these , the whole affair might have been tumbled into the waste basket . As it is , the House has received a lesson in practical economy which it will find profit . able however unpalatable.
