txt Messrs . Thurman , , and Garland , the committee appointed by the Senate Democratic caucus to consider what shall be done in relation to the Warner Silver bill , have not as yet reached a conclusion , but it is expected that they will do so to-morrow morning . The questions involved have been very generally dismissed among the Democratic Senators , and the prevailing feeling among them now appears to be against doing - anything with the Silver bill at the present session . Messrs . Bayard and Kernan , , , of the Committee , on Finance , maintain their attitude . of opposition to reporting - the bill , and this determination will , it is ' believed , deter the silver men from attempting again to call up the Coke resolution to discharge the Finance Committee from further consideration of the measure . Leading Democratic Senators , in conversation to-night , expressed the belief that nothing further will be done in the matter at this session , and that the Silver bill will be permitted to remain with the Committee on Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Committee on Ways and Means , will tomorrow , should an opportunity offer , move to suspend the rules and pass the bill to abolish the duty on quinine . The advocates of this measure have been very active in canvassing the House , and claim that they have the twothirds vote necessary to pass it under a suspension of the rules , It is doubtful , however , whether they have the strength claimed , but it is conceded that should the House be brought to a vote on the measure a decided majority will be found voting for it . After 2 o'clock to-morrow the Committee on the District of.Columbia is entitled to the floor for the remainder of the day , and those onnosed to removingthe duty on quinine will endeavor so to occupy the time until 2 o'clock as to prevent Mr. Felton from obtaining the floor to move for a suspension of the rules .
