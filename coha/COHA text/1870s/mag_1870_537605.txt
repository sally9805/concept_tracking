SPECKLED TROUT . I N the number of this magazine for July , 1869 , under the head of " Birch Browsings , " I gave some account of a region that lies about the head-waters of the Delaware , in the State of New York , the second tract in the State of any considerable size where one can get a glimpse of genuine backwoods life , and as fresh an article in the way of camping out as can be had anywhere . Since the expedition to Thomas Lake , described in that paper , I have made another excursion to those woods , this time dipping well into them , - indeed taking the core fairly out of them and were it not for the speckled trout , which are always a standing invitation , and a deer or two , which I expect to shoot in them one of these days , - yes , and I may add , a black bear or two also , - I should be looking round for new worlds to conquer . Aaron , one of my companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speckled trout , though be had seen game equally slippery , and had been a constant and sometimes an unwilling camper-out for over four years ; and when I had the pleasure of showing him some noble specimens of the fish in a spring , at the house of a friend where we stopped before reaching the woods , I knew his curiosity was only half satisfied . It was not enough that they came up and took food from his hand ; he had a soldier 's desire to see them smoking over the coals . It was about three o'clock in the afternoon when the stage set us down at a little country store and post-office amid the mountains of Shandaken , where the Esopus emerges from Big Ingin Hollow , and takes its eastward course to the Hudson . We expected to join another party at this point , who were to come across the mountains from a different direction , and we experienced our first disappointment of the trip when no familiar faces came out to greet us but we proceeded to get ready for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-dozen or more young fellows , stained and sweaty and with their coats on their arms , came in from the backwoods on the Neversink , vhere they had been at work since spring . They were on their way out to get jobs in haying , and were brawny and well seasoned . They had come by the route we wished to take ; and on questioning them closely , I found that the rude draft I had made of the section from the county map was in its main features reliable . Just as we were ready to start our friends arrived , much to our joy ; and after exchanging congratulations all round , we set out , in fine spirits , for the head of the Big Ingin , about ten miles distant . On our way up the Hollow we met another party of men and boys , who had just come across the // 430 mountains ; they had a rifle and some game , - a wild pigeon , a ruffed grouse , and a gray squirrel . " Are there wild pigeons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now and then you see one . " " Did they nest here this year ? " " No , sir ; two years ago they nested on the Neversink in great numbers , hut a cold spell with deep snows came on in April and broke them up , and they have not been hack since . A great many froze to death on their nests , and a great many died from hunger . " The passenger pigeon is attracted to this section of country by the vast quantities of beech-nuts that usually abound ; they come when the March rains first begin to lay bare the ground , and in places make the woods blue with their numbers ; but though the crop of nuts seldom fails , the visits of the pigeons , for some cause or other , occur at longer and longer intervals , and may soon be expected to cease altogether . The account of the freezing of the pigeons , and the breaking up of their nests by the snow , was confirmed by all of whom we made inquiry . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nests filling the trees for miles , but not a pigeon anywhere . Big Ingin Hollow was not a very big Ingin after all . It had reached the second stage of growth as a settlement , - the stage when the log-houses are going out and the framed ones coming . in ; though as we neared its head , the little stumpy clearings , with their oneroomed log-dwellings , and a " smudge " near the door to keep off the midges or gnats , looked primitive enough . People certainly lived close to the bone here , and no doubt gnawed it hard and I hope found the meat sweet , though there must have been precious little of it . We satisfied ourselves that there was precious little in the streams ; for after tramping up and down the main branch and penetrating into the mountains where the smaller tributaries came down , we barely caught enough trout to afford a good smell for all . My chief reason for remembering the locality is the novel experience I had that night of trying to go to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A horse , it seems , never sleeps , at least as long as there is any hay in the rack . One of the animals was much disturbed by our proximity , and about every five minutes would prick up his ears and snort threateningly . Then at regular intervals would come the heavy stamping of the beasts changi nb their positions . Then if all grew still for a few moments , and the big jaws paused from very weariness , some sleeper would turn uneasily in the hay or set up a rival snoring , and thus arouse the suspicious animal beneath , who would wake up his companions , and the snorting and crunching and stamping would recommence as briskly as ever . To add to my discomfiture , the hay was musty , and the fine particles of dust choked me so whenever I stirred , that I more than half suspected I had the heaves . I endured it till after midnight , when I slid down on the floor , and , thoroughly regretting that I had not accepted the pressing invitation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I picked my way through the murky darkness , over logs and rocks , down to our camp-fire , where , rolled in my blanket at the foot of a sugar-maple , I found some sleep at last . The morning dawned rainy as the night had foreboded , and , after giving the trout another trial , without any better success , we took refuge in a saw-mill , kindling a fire in its huge box stove , and drying ourselves and making our coffee at the same time . Then we looked disconsolately out into the wild , dripping scene . Toward noon the rain slackened or degenerated into a fine drizzle , when we slung knapsacks and set out for the Neversink , which headed on the other side of the mountain , about five miles distant . The atmosphere was " muggy " and hot , and our tramp was a heavy one , relieved from time to October , // time by brief halts beside the delicious spring runs that here and there crossed our route . On the side of the mountain , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - breasted grossbeak , a rare nest in this State , and the first I had ever seen . My attention was attracted to it by the moaning cry of the parent bird ; it was a strange sound which I did not recognize . XVe struck the Neversink quite unexpectedly about the middle of the afternoon , at a point where it was a good-sized trout-stream . It had a gamy look , and with boyish eagerness I undid my fishing-tackle and wet my first fly in its waters . But the trees were too thick and their branches too near for fly-fishing , so I took in line and tried a worm , and found the trout small , but plenty and eager . On this hint other flshing-tackle was soon rigged , and the sport commenced in earnest , most of the fishers going down stream ; but the prospect up stream was so inviting that a youth and myself concluded to go thither . It was one of those black mountain brooks born of innumerable ice-cold springs , nourished in the shade , and shod , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers . The fish are as black as the stream and very wild . They dart from beneath the fringed rocks , or dive with the hook into the dusky depths , - an integral part of the silence and the shadows . The spell of the moss is over all . The fisherman 's tread is noiseless , as he leaps from stone to stone and from led ge to ledge along the bed of the stream . How cool it is ! He looks up the dark , silent defile , hears the solitary voice of the water , sees the decayed trunks of fallen trees bridging the stream , and all he has dreamed , when a boy , of the haunts of beasts of prey - the crouching feline tribes , especially if it be near nightfall and the gloom already deepenin* in the woods - comes freshly to mind , and he presses on , wary and alert , and speaking to his companions in low tones . After an hour or so the trout became less abundai*t , and with nearly a hund red of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here and there I saw the abandoned nests of the pigeons , sometimes half a dozen in one tree . In a yellow-birch which the floods had uprooted a number of nests were still in place , each consisting of a handful of small twigs arranged with very little show of art , and affording little or no protection to the eggs or the young birds against inclement weather . Before we had reached our companions the rain set in again and forced us to take shelter under a balsaim When it slackened we moved on , and soon came up with Aaron , who had caught his first trout , and , considerably drenched , was making his way toward camp , which one of the party had gone forward to build . After travelling less than a mile , we saw a smoke struggling up through the dripping trees , and in a few moments were all standing round a blazing fire . But the rain now comemenced again , and fairly poured down through the trees , rendering the prospect of cooking and eating our supper there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground without tent or cover of any kind , rather disheartening . We had been told of a bark shanty , a couple of miles farther down the creek , and thitherward we speedily took up our line of march . When we were on the point of discontinuing the search , thinking we had been misinformed or had passed it by , we came in sight of a bark-peeling , in the midst of which a small log-house lifted its naked rafters toward the now breaking sky . It had neither floor nor roof , and was less inviting on first sight than the open woods . But a board partition was still standing , out of which we buili a rude porch on the east side of the house , large en oubh for us all to sleep under , if well packed , and eat under , if we stood up . There was plenty of well-seasoned timber lying about , and a fire was soon burning in front of our quarters , that made the scene 50cm ' and picturesque , especially when the frying-pans were brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aaron , 43 ' // who was artist in this line , mingled its aroma with the wild-wood air . At dusk a balsam was felled , and the tips of the branches used to make a bed , which was more fragrant than soft ; hemlock is better , because its needles are finer and its branches more elastic . XVe were two in the bed and five in the middle , and counterfeited sleep very well ; but if my own experience be a safe one to go by , I should say that not more than twenty-five per cent of the snoring was genuine . One tries to cheat himself and his fellows , under such circumstances , into the notion that he is asleep , by breathing hard and by lying supine , when most of the time he feels every midge that bites and notes every stage of the fire by its effect upon his feet . This is the most serious drawback I meet with in my expeditions to the woods , - my inability to get anything more than a thin dilution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems , is a coy and fitful goddess , and the more you woo her at times , the more you may . Sometimes you can not fight her off and again she will not touch her fingers to your eyelids , beseech her never so patiently and long . The main , disturbing cause on the *present occasion was the huge fire blazing away there in such proximity to my feet . Some kind of brute instinct seemed to take possession of my body ; and no sooner would my mind begin to loosen its rational hold upon things , than this instinct would cry " Fire , ' and I would rouse up , expecting to find my feet wrapped in flame . And I remember it did get pretty warm when those green beech-logs got thoroughly agoing . The gnats , or " no-see-ems , " had to leave , and I found their power of endurance was about equal to my own , for I had to change my position soon afterward . Aaron 's nasal asseverations were no doubt sincere . It was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there wrapped in his gray blanket . While the rest of us threw ourselves down without so much as removing our coats , I noticed that he prepared himself elaborately , took off his shoes ( to rest his feet , he said ) and hung them up to dry , removed most of his outer clothing , and , rolling himself from top to toe in his blanket , lay down with the utmost matter-of-course air . There was a spirt or two of rain during the night , but not enough to find out the leaks in our roof . It took the shower or series of showers of next day to do that . They commenced about two o'clock in the afternoon . The forenoon had been fine , and we had brought into camp nearly three hundred trout ; but before they vere half dressed or the first panfuls fried , the rain set in . First came short , sharp dashes , then a gleam of treacherous sunshine , followed by more and heavier dashes . The wind was in the southwest , and to rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashes to a steady pour the transition was natural . We stood huddled together , stark and grim , under our cover , like hens under a cart . The fire fought bravely for a time , and retaliated with sparks and spiteful tongues of flame ; but gradually its spirit was broken , only a heavy body of coal and half-consumed logs in the centre holding out against all odds . The simmering fish were soon floating about in a yellow liquid that did not look in the least appetizing . Point after point gave way in our cover , till standing between the drops was no longer possible . The water coursed down the underside of the boards , and dripped in our necks and formed puddles on our hat-brims . We shifted our guns and traps and viands , till there was no longer any choice of position , when the loaves and the fishes , the salt and the sugar , the pork and the butter , shared the same watery fate . The whiskey was water-proof , else we should have had to drink it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . Little rivulets coursed about it , and bore away the quenched but steaming coals on their bosoms . The spring run 432 October , // in the rear of our camp swelled so rapidly , that part of the trout that had been hastily left lying on its banks again found themselves quite at home . For over two hours the floods came down . About four o'clock , Orville , who had not yet come from the day 's sport , appeared , - Orville the stubborn , who worried the trout in a faded linen coat and white hat , sticking to them till they grew familiar with his bleached appearance , and nibbled his hook in confidence . To say Orville was wet is not much ; he was better than that , - he had been washed and rinsed in at least half a dozen waters , and the trout that he bore dangling at the end of a string had hardly been out of their proper element . But he brought welcome news . He had been two or three miles down the creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stable he did not know , but it had the appearance of having a good ro of , which was inducement enough for us instantly to leave our present quarters . Our course lay along an old wood road , and much of the time we were to our knees in water . The woods were literally flooded everywhere . Every little rill and springlet ran like a mill-tail , while the main stream rushed and roared , foaming , leaping , lashing , its volume increased fifty-fold . The water was not roily , but of a rich coffee-color , from the leechings of the woods . No more trout for the next three days ! we thought , as we looked upon the rampant stream . After we had labored and floundered along for about an hour , the road turned to the left , and in a little stumpy clearing near the creek a gabl6 uprose on our view . It did not prove to be just such a place as poets love to contemplate . It required a greater effort of the imagination than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been a favorite resort of wood-nymphs or sylvan deities . It savored rather of the equine and the bovine . The bark-men had kept their teams there , horses on the one side and oxen on the other , and no Hercules had ever done duty in 433 cleansing the stables . My first impulse was to take to the woods again . I trust I am a lover of horses and cattle , and the savor of the stall with its occupant , and of the barn with long rows of patient cows , is agreeable to me ; but the prospect then before me of boarding in a musty manger , and treading the ooze beneath was not specially inviting . But there was a dry loft overhead with some straw , where we might get some sleep , in spite of the rain and the midges ; a double layer of boards , standing at a very acute angle , would keep off the former , while the mingled refuse hay and muck beneath would nurse a smoke that would prove a thorough protection against the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounting the trunk of a prostrate maple near by , had severed it thrice with easy and familiar stroke , and , rolling the logs in front of the shanty , had kindled a fire , which , getting the better of the dampness , soon cast a bright glow over all , sheddinb warmth and light even into the dingy stable , I consented to unsling my knapsack and accept the situation . The rain had ceased and the sun shone out behind the woods . We had trout sufficient for present needs ; and after my first meal in an ox stall , I strolled out on the rude log-bridge to watch the angry Neversink rush by . Its waters fell quite as rapidly as they rose , and before sundown it looked as if we might have fishing again on the morrow . We had better sleep that night than either night before , though there were two disturbing causes , - the smoke in the early part of it , and the cold in the latter . The " no-see-ems " left in disgust ; and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pallet of straw the closer . In the morning I felt much like a sugar-cured ham , minus the sugar . But the day dawned bright , and a plunge in the Neversink set me all right again . The creek , to our surprise and gratification , was only a little higher than before the rain , and some of the finest trout we had yet seen we caught that morning near camp . Speckled Trout . // Our friends here reached the end of their tether , and after breakfast , with feelings of sadness and regret , we saw them turn their faces homeward , leaving the original trio to finish their campaign , the plan of which embraced a farther traversing of the Neversink , a crossing of the mountains by an unknown way into the Beaverkill , thence to Balsam Lake , thence across the mountains again to the Mill Brook , and thence home , - in all a tramp of up*vards of forty miles in the woods . We tarried yet another day and night at the old stable , but taking our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now become quite dry . Part of the day I spent strolling about the woods , looking up old acquaintances among the birds , and , as always , half expectant of making some new ones . Curiously enough , the most abundant species were among those I had found rare in most other localities , viz , the small water wagtail ( Seiurz*s izoveboractmsis ) , the mourning ground warbler , and the yellow-bellied woodpecker . The latter seems to be the prevailing woodpecker through the woods of this region . I do not like to confess that I had the heart to shoot a robin which alighted on a tall tree near camp , but only that I began to tire of a diet of all fish and no flesh ; and had a " fat wren " happened to show himself in my vicinity , it is highly probable he would have been roasting over our coals in less than five minutes afterward . That night the midges , those motes that sting , held high carnival . We learned afterward , in the settlement below and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced in that valley . We had done no fishing during the day , but had anticipated some fine sport about sundown . Accordingly Aaron and I started off between six and seven o'clock , one going up stream and the other down . The scene was charming . The sun shot up great spokes of light from behind the woods , and beauty , like a presence , pervaded the atmosphere . But tor Spcc/*1cd Irout . October , ment , multiplied as the sands of the sea-shore , lurked in every tangle and thicket . In a thoughtless moment I removed my shoes and socks , and waded in the water to secure a finetrout that had accidentally slipped from my string and was helplessly floating ; with the current . This caused some delay and gave the gnats time to accumulate . Before I had got one foot half dressed , I was enveloped in a black mist that settled upon my hands and neck and face , filling my ears with infinitesimal pipings and covering my flesh with infinitesimal bitings . I thought I should have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " one stocking off and one stocking on " ; but I got my shoe on at last , . though not without many amusing interruptions and digressions . In a few moments after this adven -- ture I was in rapid retreat toward camp . Just as I reached the path leading from the shanty to the creek , my companion , in the same i , , noble plight , reached it also , his hat broken and rumpled , and his sanguine counte** nance looking more sanbuinary than I had ever before seen it , and his speech . also , in the highest degree inflammatory . His face and forehead were as blotched and swollen as if he had just run his head into a hornets ' nest , and his manner as precipitate as if the whole swarm was still at his back . No smoke or smudge which we ourselves could endure was sufficient in the earlier part of that evening to prevent serious annoyance from the same cause ; but later a respite was granted us . About ten o'clock , as we stood round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking display of the aurora borealis . My imagination had already been excited by talk of legends and of weird shapes and appearances . and when , on looking up toward the sky , I saw those pale , phantasmal wavesof magnetic light chasing each other across the little opening above our heads , and at first sight seeming barely to clear the tree-tops , I was as vividly // impressed as if I had caught a. glimpse of a veritable spectre of the Neversink . After we had climbed to our loft and had lain down to sleep , another adventure befell us . This time a new and uninviting customer appears upon the scene , the genius loci of the old stable , namely , the " fretful porcupine . " We had seen the marks and works of these animals about the shanty , and had been careful each night to hang our traps , guns , etc. beyond their reach , but of the prickly night-walker himself we feared we should not get a view . XVe had lain down some half-hour , and I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , to pass through the open door into the land of dreams , when I heard outside somewhere that curious sound , - a sound which I had heard every night I spent in these woods , not only on this but on former expeditions , and which I had settled in my mind as proceeding from the porcupine , since I knew the sounds our other common animals were likely to make , - a sound that might be either a gnawing on some hard , dry substance , or a grating of teeth , or a shrill grunting . Orville heard it also , and , raising up on his elbow , asked , " What is that ? " " What the hunters call a porcupig , ' " said I. " Sure Entirely so . " " XVhy does he make that noise ? " " It is a way he has of cursing our fire , " I replied . " I heard him last night also . " " Where do you suppose he is ? " inquired my companion , showing a disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps fifteen or twenty yards from our fire , where the shadows begin to deepen . " Orville slipped into his trousers , felt for my gun , and in a moment had disappeared down through the scuttlehole . I had no disposition to follow him , but was rather annoyed than otherwise at the disturbance . Getting the direction of the sound , he went picking his way over the rough , uneven ground , and , when he got where the light failed him , poking every doubtful object with the end of his gun . Presently he poked a light grayish object , like a large round stone , which surprised him by moving off . On this hint he fired , making an incurable wound in the " porcupig , " which , nevertheless , tried harder than ever to escape . I lay listening when , close on the heels of the report of the gun , came excited shouts . for a revolver . Snatching up my Smith and Westson , I hastened , shoeless and hatless , to the scene of action , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detain , with the end of the gun , an uncertain object that was trying to crawl off into the darkness . " Look out ! " said Orville , as he saw my bare feet , " the quills are lying thick around here . " And so they were ; he had blown or beaten them nearly all off the poor creature 's back , and was in a fair way completely to disable my gun , the ramrod of which was already broken and splintered clubbing his victim . But a couple of shots from the revolver , sighted by a lighted match , at the head of the animal , quickly settled him . It proved to be an unusually large Canada porcupine , an old patriarch , gray and venerable , with spines three inches long , and weighing , I should say , twenty pounds . The build of this animal is much like that of the woodchuck , that is , heavy and pouchy . The nose is blunter than that of the woodchuck , the limbs stronger , and the tail broader and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the animal can , no doubt , deal a smart blow with it . An old hunter with whom I talked thought it aided them in climbing . They are inveterate gnawers , and spend much of their time in trees gnawing the bark . In winter one will take up its abode in a hemlock , and continue there till the tree is quite denuded . The carcass emitted a peculiar offensive odor , and , though very fat , 1870. 435 // was not in the least inviting as game . If it is part of the economy of nature for one animal to prey upon some other beneath it , then the poor devil has indeed a mouthful that makes a meal off the porcupine . Panthers and lynxes have essayed it , but have invariably left off at the first course , and have afterward been found dead or nearly so , with their heads puffed up like a pincushion , and the quills protruding on all sides . A dog that understands the business will maneuvre round the porcupine till he gets an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastens on its quilless underbody . Aaron was puzzled to know how long-parted friends could embrace , when it was suggested that the quills could be depressed or elevated at pleasure . The next morning boded rain ; hut we had become thoroughly sated with the delights of our present quarters , outside and in , and packed up our traps to leave . Before we had reached the clearing , three miles below , the rain set in , keeping up a lazy , monotonous drizzle till the afternoon . The clearing was quite a recent one , made mostly by bark-peelers , who followed their calling in the mountains round about in summer , and worked in their shops making shingle in winter . The Biscuit Brook came in here from the west ,  --  a fine , rapid troutstream six or eight miles in length , with plenty of deer in the mountains about its head . On its banks we found the house of an old woodman , to whom we had been directed for information about the section we proposed to traverse . " Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Neversink into the head of the Beaverkill ? " " Not to me ; I could go it the darkest night ever was . And I can direct you so you can find the way without any trouble . You go down the Neversink about a mile , when you come to Iiighfall Brook , the first stream that comes down on the right . Follow up it to Jim Reed 's shanty , about three miles . Then cross the stream , and on the left bank , pretty well up on the side of the mountain , you will find a wood road , which was made by a fellow below here who stole some ash logs off the top of the ridge last winter and drew them out on the snow . When the road first begins to tilt over the mountain , strike down to your left , and you can reach the Beaverkill before sundown . " As miles , we concluded to take a whole day to it , and wait till next morning . The Beaverkill flowed west , the Neversink south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid the mountains and valleys that lie in either angle . Besides , I was glad of another and final opportunity to pay my respects to the finny tribes of the Neversink . At this point it was the finest trout stream I had ever beheld . I have seen many clear , cold streams , but none before so absolutely transparent as that . It was so sparkling , its bed so free from sediment or impurities of any kind , that it had a new look , as if it had just come from the hand of its Creator . I tramped along its marbin upwards of a mile that afternoon , part of the time wading to my knees , and casting my hook , baited only with a trout 's fin , to the opposite bank . Trout are real cannibals , and make no bones , and break none either , in lunching on each other . A friend of mine had several in his spring , when one day a large female trout gulped down one of her n*ale friends , nearly one third her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tail of her liege lord protruding from her mouth . A fish 's eye will do for bait , though the anal fin is better . One of the natives here told me , that when he wished to catch large trout ( and I judged he never fished for any other , - I never do ) , he used for bait the bullhead or dart , a little fish an inch and a half or two inches long , that rests on the pebbles near shore and darts quickly , when disturbed , from point to point . " Put that on your hook , " said he , " and // if there is a big fish in the creek he is bound to have it . " But the darts were not easily found ; the big fish , I concluded , had cleaned them all out ; and then it was easy enough to supply our wants with a fin . Declining the hospitable offers of the settlers , we spread our blankets that night in a dilapidated shingle-shop on the banks of the Biscuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shingle that day piled in one corner . The place had a great-throated chimney with a tremendous expanse of fireplace within , that cried " More " at every morsel of wood we gave it . But I must hasten over this part of the ground , nor let the delicious flavor of the milk we had that morning for breakfast , and that was so delectable after four days of fish , linger on my tongue , nor yet tarry to set down the talk of that honest , weather-worn passer-by who paused before our door , and every moment on the point of resuming his way , yet stood for an hour and recited his adventures hunting deer and hears on these mountains . Having replenished our stock of bread and salt-pork at the house of one of the settlers , midday found us at Reed 's shanty , - one of those temporary structures erected by the bark jobber , to lodge and board his " hands " near their work . Jim not being at home , we could gain no information from the " women folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just come in to dinner ; so we pushed on , as near as we could , according to the instructions we had previously received . Crossing the creek , we forced our way up the side of the mountain , through a perfect ekeval-defrise of fallen and peeled hemlocks , and , entering the dense woods above , began to look anxiously about for the woodroad . My companions at first could see no trace of it ; but knowing that a casual *vood-road cut in winter , when there was likely to be two or three feet of snow on the ground , would present only the slightest indications to the eye in summer , I looked a little closer , and could make out a mark or two here 437 and there . The larger trees had been avoided , and the axe used only on the small saplings and underbrush , which had been lopped off a couple of feet from the ground . By being constantly on the alert , we followed it till near the top of the mountain ; but when looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it disappeared altogether . Some stumps of the black cherry were found , and a solitary pair of snow-shoes were hanging high and dry on a branch , but no further trace of human hands could we see . While we were resting here a couple of hermit thrushes , one of them with some sad defect in his vocal powers which barred him from uttering more than a few notes of his song , gave voice to the solitude of the place . This was the second instance in which 1 have observed a song-bird with apparently some organic defect in its instrument . The other case was that of a bobolink , which , hover in midair and inflate its throat as it might , could only force out a few incoherent notes . But the bird in each case presented this striking contrast to human examples of the kind , that it was apparently just as proud of itself and just as well satisfied with its performance as its more successful rivals . After deliberating some time over a pocket - compass which I carried , we decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The descent was very gradual . Traces of bear and deer were noted at different points , but not a live animal was seen . About four o'clock , * . *. , we reached the bank of a stream flowing west . Hail to the Beaverkill ! and we pushed on along its banks . The trout were plenty , and rose quickly to the hook ; but we held on our way , designing to go into camp about six o'clock . Many inviting places , first on one bank , then on the other , made us linger , till finally we reached a spot , a smooth , dry place overshadowed by balsam and hemlock , where the creek bent around a little flat , which was so entirely to our fancy that we unslung our knapsacks at once . While my companions were cutting Speck/cd Trout . // wood and making other preparations for the night , it fell to my lot , as the most successful angler , to provide the trout for supper and breakfast . How shall I describe that wild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other mountain streams ? And yet , as I saw it in the deep twilight of those woods on that June afternoon , with its steady , even flow , and its tranquil , many-voiced murmur , it made an impression upon my mind distinct and peculiar , fraught in an eminent degree with the charm of seclusion and remoteness . The solitude was perfect ; and I felt that strangeness and insignificance which the civilized man must always feel when opposing himself to such a vast scene of silence and wildness . The trout were quite black , like all wood trout , and took the bait eager ly . I followed the stream till the deepening shadows warned me to turn back . As I neared camp , the fire shone far through the trees , dispelling the gathering gloom , but blinding my eyes to all obstacles at my feet . I was seriouslv disturbed on arriving to find that one of my companions had cut an ugly gash in his shin with the axe , while felling a tree . As we did not carry a fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have any of our members crippled , and I had bodings of evil . But , thanks to the healing virtues of the balsam , which must have adhered to the blade of the axe , and double thanks to the court-plaster with which Orville had supplied himself before leaving home , the wounded leg , by being fa vored that night and the next day , gave us little trouble . That night we had our first fair and square camping out , - that is , sleeping on the ground with no shelter over us but the trees ,  --  and it was in many respects the pleasantest night we spent in the woods . The weather was perfect and the place was perfect , and for the first time we were exempt from the midges and smoke ; and then we appreciated the clean new page we had to work on . Nothing is so acceptable to the camper-out as a pure article in the way of woods and waters . Any admixture of human relics mars the spirit of the scene . Yet I am willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the marks of an axe in a tree was a welcome sight . On resuming our march next day we followed the right bank of the Beaverkill , in order to strike a stream which flowed in from the north , and which was the outlet of Balsam Lake , the objective point of that day 's march . The distance to the lake from our camp could not have been over six or seven miles ; yet travelling as we did , without path or guide , climbing up banks , plunging into ravines , making detours around swampy places , and forcing our way through woods choked up with much fallen and decayed timber , it seemed at least twice that distance , and the mid-afternoon sun was shining when we emerged into what is called the " Ouaker Clearino- " ground that I had been over nine years before , and that lies about two miles south of the lake . From this point we had a well-worn path that led us up a sharp rise of ground , then through level woods till we saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am always struck on approaching these little mountain lakes with the extensive preparation that is made for them in the conformation of the ground . I am thinking of a depression , or natural basin in the side of the mountain or on its top , the brink of which I shall reach after a little steep climbing ; but instead of that , after I have accomplished the ascent , I find a broad sweep of level or gently undulating woodland that brings me after a half-hour or so to the lake , which lies in this vast lap like a drop of water in the palm of a man 's hand . Balsam Lake was oval shaped , scarcely more than half a mile long and a quarter of a mile wide , but presented a charming picture , with a group of dark gray hemlocks filling the valley about its head , and the mountains rising above and beyond . We found a cow-house in good repair , also a dug-out and paddle and several floats of logs . In the 438 October , // dug-out I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the trout were incessantly jumping for a species *f black fly , that , sheltered from the slight breeze , were dancing in swarms just above the surface of the water . The gnats were there in swarms also , and did their best toward balancing the accounts by preying upon me while I preyed upon the trout , which preyed upon the flies . But by dint of keeping my hands , face , and neck constantly wet , I am convinced that the balance of blood was on my side . The trout jumped most within a foot or two of shore , where the water was only a few inches deep . The shallo*vness of the water perhaps accounted for the inability of the fish to do more than lift their heads above the surface . They came up mouth wide open , and dropped back again in the most impotent manner . Where there is any depth of water , a trout will jump several feet into the air ; and where there is a solid , unbroken sheet or column , they will scale falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream and flower of our trout-fishing at this lake . For the first time we could use the fly to advantage ; and then the contrast between laborious tramping alon6 shore , and sitting in one end of a dug-out and casting your line right and left with no fear of entanglement in brush or branch , while you was gently propelled along , was of the most pleasing character . There were two varieties of trout in the lake , - what it seems proper to call silver trout and golden trout ; the former were the slimmer and seemed to keep apart from the latter . Starting from the outlet and working round on the eastern side toward the head , we invariably caught these first . They glanced in the sun like bars of silver . Their sides and bellies were indeed as white as new silver . As we neared the head , and especially as we came near a space occupied by some kind of watergrass that grew in the deeper part of the lake , the other variety would begin to take the hook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep orange 439 on their fins ; and as we returned to the place of departure with the bottom of the boat strewn with these bright forms intermingled , it was a sight not soon to be forgotten . It pleased my eye so , that I would fain linger over them , arranging them in rows and studying the various hues and tints . They were of nearly a uniform size , rarely one over ten or under ci ht inches in length , and it seemed as if the hues of all the precious metals and stones were reflected from their sides . The flesh was deep salmon - color ; that of brook trout is generally much lighter . Some hunters and fishers from the valley of the Mill Brook , whom we met here , told us the trout were much larger in the lake , though far less numerous than they used to be . This , I think , is generally the case ; brooktrout do not grow large till they become scarce . It is only in streams that have been long and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches in length . The liveliest sport I had on Balsam Lake was during a heavy thunder-shower . How the trout can distinguish the fly when it rains so hard that the surface of the water seems an inch or two deep with bubbles is more than I can tell ; yet I know they did , and that very readily . As the rain began to come down pretty briskly , Aaron headed the boat for camp . My fly was dragging , and as we were shooting over the watergrass which waved to and fro beneath the surface , two flame-finned beauties darted from the green depths and were instantly hooked . On this hint we backed water , took up a position with head to the wind , and for nearly an hour , amid the pouring rain and rattling thunder , the sport went on . I had on two flies , and usually both were snapped at the moment they touched the water . But the sport did not degenerate into wanton slaughter , for many were missed and many merely slapped the hook with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred , the blue sky shone out , and , drenched to the skin , we rowed leisurely back to camp . Speckled Trout . // The " porcupigs " were numerous about the lake , and not at all shy . One night the heat became so intolerable in our oven-shaped cow-house , that I was obliged to withdraw from under its cover and lie down a little to one side . Just at daybreak as I lay rolled in my blanket , something awoke me . Lifting up my head , there was a porcupine with his fore-paws on my hips . He was apparently as much surprised as I was ; and to my inquiry as to what he at that moment might be looking for , he did not pause to reply , but hitting me a slap with his tail which left three or four quills in my blanket , he scampered off down the bill into the brush . Being an observer of the birds , of course every curious incident connected with them fell under my notice . Hence as we stood about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was the only one to see a little commotion in the water , half hidden by the near branches , as of some tiny feathered swimmer struggling to reach the shore . Rushing to its rescue in the canoe , I found a yellow*umped warbler , quite exhausted , clinging to a twig that hung down into the water ; I brought the drenched and helpless thing to camp , and , putting it into a basket , hung it up to dry . An hour or two afterward I heard it fluttering in its prison , and cautiously lifting the lid to get a better glimpse of the lucky captive , it darted out and was gone in a twinkling . How came it in the water ? That was my wonder , and I can only guess that it was a young bird that had never before flown over a pond of water , and , seeing the clouds and blue sky so perfect down there , thought it was a vast opening or gateway into another summer land , perhaps a short cut to the tropics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye was delighted also with the red-bird that alighted for a moment on a dry branch above the lake , just where a ray of light from the setting sun fell full upon it . A mere crimson point , and yet how it offset that dark sombre background ! I have thus run over some of the features of an ordinary trouting excursion to the woods . People , inexperienced people , sitting in their rooms and thinking of these things , of all the poets have sung and romancers written , are apt to get sadly taken in when they attempt to realize their dreams . They expect to enter a sylvan paradise of trout , cool retreats , laughing brooks , picturesque views , balsamic couches , etc. , instead of which they find hunger , rain , smoke , toil , gnats , mosquitoes , dirt , broken rest , vulgar guides , and salt-pork ; and they are very apt not to see where the fun comes in . But he who goes in a right spirit will not he disappointed , and will find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the writers have described . 7ohu B ? rroughs. @
