" PUBLICANS AND SINNERS ; or , Lucius Davoren . " A novel . By Miss M. E. Braddon . New York : Harper &amp; Brothers . This work is , we suppose , Miss Braddon 's latest production . The prologue opens " in the far West " : Winter round them-not a winter in city streets , lamp-lit and glowing , or on a fair English country side , dotted with cottage roofs , humble village homes , sending up their incense of blue-gray smoke to the hearth goddess ; not the winter of civilization , with all means and appliances at hand to loosen the grip of the frost fiend ; but winter in its bleakest , direst aspect , amid barren plains and trackless forests , where the trapper walks alone ; winter among snowhuts and savage beasts ; winter in a solitude so drear that the sound of a human voice seems more strange and awful than the prevailing silence ; winter in an American forest , under the shadow of the Rocky Mountains . It is December , the bleakest dreariest month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Over a wood fire , in a roughly built loghut in the middle of this wilderness , three men sit crouching , dying of starvation . One is Lucius Davoren , surgeon , who came there " compelled by that deeprooted thirst of knowledge which in some minds is a passion . " Another is Geoffrey Hossack , three years since an under. - graduate at Balliol , " young , handsome , ardent , fickle , strong as a lion , gentle as a sucking dove , " whose object in going - on this expedition appears to have been vague and youthful . The third is a " small and plump " Dutchman , Absaloin Schanck . They have lost their way , and their Indian guide has disappeared , as well as most of their provisions , when a fourth traveller appears upon the scene , who goes by the Indiall name of MatchiMohkamarn , or the " Evil Knife , " but who is not an Indian . This fourth person is also lost , and stumbles upon them accidentally . They give him shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprovoked cannibalism . Lucius warns Matchi , whom he suspects , by the way , of being an Englishman , and who has as his principal talent an extraordinary skill in playing demoniac music upon the violin , that if he ever crosses his threshold , he will kill him . Matchi , however , does come again for shelter , and Lucius thereupon shoots him . So ends the prologue . Afterwards the scene changes to England , and we find that Lucius , Geoffrey , and Absalom all escaped from the wilderness , but Matchi has not returned . Matchi 's real name we discover to be Ferdinand Sivewright , and he it was who long before had won the affections of Lucius 's sister Janet , and by a marriage , valid or invalid , made her his wife . This lady , who now goes by the name of Mrs. Bertram , carries away the heart of Geoffrey , who does not know of her relationship to Lucius ; but he can not overcome the natural scruples which any woman so situated must feel on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her under still another name , he having been a scoundrel of the blackest kind from his cradle up , having robbed his kind father , and committed a long list of other offences , by the side of whi* , h his assumption of the name of Vandeleur for the convenience of the moment of marriage , seems a mere peccadillo . Lucius , of course , knows that he has killed Ferdinand , alias Vandeleur , alias Matchi-Mohkamarn , in the far West ; but for obvious reasons does not like to communicate the fact to his sister , or let it be generally known . He therefore hints the actual state of the case to Geoffi-ey , who at once tells Mrs. Bertram that her husband is dead ; that he knows this for a fact . But Mrs. Bertram is still incredulous , and very wise , in the end , she proves herself to have been ; for Matchi was not killed at all , but vcry soon returns to England , where he goes at once to his father 's for shelter , not asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young girl , Lucille , always spoken of and supposed to be the daughter of Ferdinand , and who lives with and takes care of Ferdinand 's father , old Mr. Sivewright . This Lucille , who is betrothed now to Lucius Daroren , was in reality not Ferdinand 's daughter at all , except by adoption ; but this fact he carefully kept concealed from the world . Old Mr. Sivewright is ill , and grows gradually worse ; his treasures he leaves to Lucius , and // makes himself ready to die , when suspicious circumstances occur which tend to convey the impression that he is not dying a natural death-that he is being poisoned . In fact , Lucille has , in fear and terror , given her supposed father admission to the house , and out of pity given him an upper chamber , unknown to every one , communicating in a mysterious way with Mr. Sivewright 's room . Here he has a convenient opportunity to poison the old gentleman , which he is not slow in using . In the end , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father with a knife ; but , foiled again , plunges through a familiar wall , down a mysterious staircase , bringing a part of the house after him , and burying himself in the ruins . He lives just long enough , however , to be able to state the true and honorable parentage of Lucille , whose father was a Glenlyne , and then dies , we are happy to say , a penitent man . So Lucille marries Lucius , and Geoffrey marri* Janet , and all ends happily . Of all the morals which may be drawn from this fascinating story , none perhaps is so obvious as that which points to the advantage to be derived from the habit of " going West "  --  the further , apparently , the better . " IVAN DE BuioN ; or , the Russian Court in the Middle of Last Century . " By the author of " Friends in Council , " etc . Boston : Roberts Brothers . Mr. Helps at the end of this historical romance tells his readers that it is " a narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief events during the eighteenth century in that empire which has since gone on increasing in greatness ; which , in the liberation of its serfs , has given to mankind an extraordinary example of daring humanity ; and which , if it advances with equal persistence in social and moral well-being as material prosperity , is evidently destined to become one of the most beneficent as well as one of the foremost powers of the world . " The story begins with a description of the state of affairs at the Russian court , A. D. 1740 , in which year , on the 18th of October , Mr. Finch , English ambassador at St. Petersburg , sent a despatch to Lerd Harrington , then Secretary of State for " the Northern Department , " which contained the announcement of the death of the Empress Anne . The last will of the Empress declared *s her successor Ivan III. , then an infant , the son of the Duke of Brunswick and of the Princess Anne , the gran*laughter of the elder brother of Peter the Great . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confided the regency of Russia to John Ernest de Biron , Duke of Courland . His real name was Biren , and he was of low origin ; but after his rise to power he was discovered to be related to the celebrated Dukes de Biron of France , a Ihet which led him to alter the spelling of his name . It is not this Ivan who is the hero of the story , but another and younger man of the same name , the private secretary of the Prince Regent . This young man 's love adventures , and fianl marriage with the Princess Marie Andreevna Serbatoff , form the thread on which Mr. Helps has strung his history ; for , however useful the love story may have been to him in the composition , it certainly appears to serve a subordinate and useful turn , rather than to be the most important thing in the book . The book opens with the Duke of Courland in full power at St. Petersburg , and all his enemies in Siberia , except the most dangerous of them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send to the frontier on a mission of great importance , which the Field Marshal wisely resolves not to execute . Instead of executing it , he persuades the mother of the infant heir to the throne that the Regent is a dangerous man , and by a midnight coup de'tat has him seized and sent to Siberia , where he finds himself in the midst of his own victims whom he has previously sent there . He maintains a disguise for a long time , however , and so escapes molestation . Meanwhile his private secretary , young Ivan , goes with him , and there finds the Princess Marie , to whom he makes love . It is hardly worth while , however , to attempt to follow the plot of the romance backward and forward . as the principal characters disappear and reappear , either in Siberia or St. Petersburg . It is enough to say that the revolution which drives out the Duke of Courland ends in the other which brings on to the throne Elizabeth , and that be . tween the two there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // south in it . Elizabeth is represented as a magnanimous and noble Empress , and her little weaknesses are quite put into the shade , as they ought to be in a Russian historical romance which is intended to make her career interesting . The book is rather entertaining , if not very romantic , and in the end the young secretary , who has achieved distinction at court , marries the Princess Marie , and we trust lived happily with her afterwards , though some doubts are thrown upon this by the author . Few people who are familiar with Mr. Helps only in his philosophical moods will recognize his hand in this tale of wild adventure , and we do not think that he has quite succeeded in making a beautiful or attractive picture of Russia in the last century . However , of that every one must judge for himself . There are attractions , no doubt , in murder , in tongue-cutting , solitary banishment , treason , stratagem , and spoils ; and certainly for these there is no country better than the Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Remarks upon the Memorial Address of Charles Francis Adams on the late William H. seward . " With Incidents and Comments illustrative of the Measures and Policy of the Administration of Abraham Lincoln , and Views as to the Relative Positions of the late President and Secretary of State . By Gideon Welles , ex-Secretary of the Mavy . New York : Sheldon &amp; Co . Of the eight persons who formed the cabinet of Mr. Lincoln , four , besides Mr. Lincoln himself and Mr.Seward , are dead . As Mr. Welles observes in the remarks he makes by way of preface to his interesting and instructive volume , only Mr. Montgomery Blair and himself survive . In the " Memorial Address ' * delivered by Mr. Adams at Albany in April , 1873 , the relative positions of Mr. Seward and Mr. Lincoln were , in the opinion of these survivors , so totally misrepresented , that they considered that a duty devolved upon them to set the matter right ; and " by special request of Mr. Blair , the duty of stating the facts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Adams , devolved on " Mr. Welles . He has performed this task very well , and his account of Mr. Seward carries conviction with it in a way that can hardly be said to be true of Mr. Adams 's elaborate eulogy . We have now three pictures of Mr. Seward 's character : one ot them furnished by Mr. Adams , one by the popular estimate formed during his life among the people who knew him best-his general reputation-and third , that given him by Mr. Welles . Mr. Adams 's account of Mr. Seward took most people by surprise . They were prcpared to hear him praise the subject of his oration , but hardly to select the qualities of statesmanship , steadfastness , wisdom , far-reaching sagacity , for his praise ; and they were especially surprised to find him credited with these qualities at the expense of Mr. Lincoln . Throughout the " Memorial Address , " as Mr. Welles very justly says , Mr. Adams belittled the fame of Mr. Lincoln for the purpose of extolling that of Mr. Seward . Mr. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever estimate he might put on his own natural judgment , he had to deal with a superior in native intellectual power , in extent of acquirement , in breadth of philosophic experience , and in the force of moral discipline " ; while on the other hand , Mr. Seward is represented as not blind " to the deficiencies of the chief in these respects , however highly he might value his integril*y of purpose , his shrewd capacity , and his generous and amiable disposition . " Mr. Seward is spoken of throughout the address as a statesman , or at least as a philosopher studying politics , and really managing , not only the State Department , but also the whole government , very fortunately for the country and for Mr. Lincoln , who would have been utterly unable to get on without him . The common impression on these points has always been that Mr. Seward was a shifty , adroit politician , with enough statesmanship to know beforehand how " the cat " was likely to " jump , " and a well-stocked armory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to this view of him , his life had been a life of intrigue for place and power , and he had never exhibited at any period any convictions whatever on any subject . Indeed , to speak of him as a man of conviction would have been laughable in the days of his intimate alliance with Mr. Thurlow Weed ; and at no time in his career did he show that force // of moral character which Mr. Adams attributes to him . He was not revered among the people who knew him ; he was looked on as a talented , able , artful manager of men . During the war he succeeded in making a reputation national which had hitherto only been local , but he did not do any more . His mischievous prophecies from time to time , that the war would be over " in ninety days , " did not gain him much credit ; and his retention of office after Mr. Lincoln 's death , by his adhesion to the Johnsonian policy of reconstruction , did not enhance what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that Mr. Seward 's antislavery principles , or his policy of reconstruction , were the result of moral conviction , or of statesmanlike comprehension of the necessities of the country , would have appeared ludicrous . Mr. Welles 's book confirms us in the belief that the popular apprehension of Mr. Seward 's character was correct . The picture we get of him in the office of Secretary of State is that of an extremely clever politician , managing the affairs of his department with great skill and dexterity , but not managing the government ; shifty , full of devices , tortuous in his methods of proceeding ; caring little for the means by which he attained his ends , so long as they were attained ; gaining this point by direct means , that by indirect and discreditable means ; persuading when he could persuade , yielding to circumstances gracefully when he could not obtain what he had at heart . We do not see that Mr. Welles at all proves that Mr. Seward administered the State Department and the foreign relations of the country ill indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Of course he made mistakes ; that any man would have done . On the whole , however , he helped to carry the country through a dangerous crisis with great tact and ability . But the statesmanship attributed to him by Mr. Adams , and his superiority to Mr. Lincoln , do not appear . On laying down the book the reader feels quite confident that , far from Mr. Seward managing Mr. Lincoln , Mr. Lincoln always remained in fact as well as in theory the master of the situation ; and that had either of them been away , irretrievable mistakes would have been committed . Indeed , the moment Mr. Lincoln died Mr. Seward began to get into difficulties ; and we may well ask , if he managed Mr. Lincoln , why did he not succeed in managing , at least for a little time , his sue-cessor ? A good deal of very interesting secret history is told in the book . Perhaps the most curious and characteristic fact touching Mr. Seward is that , from Mr.Welles 's account , it appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at politics with the enemy . We were , to be sure , not as good soldiers as we were politicians in those days ; still , Mr. Seward 's behavior does not seem to have been either good war or good statesmanship . The condition of Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens was among the matters of most pressing importance in the spring of 1861 . The President , in his inaugural address , had announced his intention of holding and occupying all such fortified places . Mr. Seward , however , had different views , and opposed sending reinforcements to Fort Sumter , and got General Scott , who was then General-in-Chief , to adopt his views . The President , however , adhered to his original plan , much to the disgust of Mr. Seward ; and it is Mr. Welles 's firm conviction that Mr. Seward had at that time promised the rebels that Sumter should be evacuated , and quotes Thurlow Weed as his authority . One evening in March , he says , the Sumter question still pending , the members of the Cabinet were informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott to evacuate not only Sumter , but Pickens . Great astonishment was expressed at this , and Mr. Lincoln decided , as we have said , that supplies should be sent to Sumter , and issued confidential orders to that effect . " To the surprise of the Administration , information of the confidential order to reinforce Sumter was promptly sent to Charleston . it was subsequently ascertained that this telegramwas sent by Mr. Harvey , a newspaper correspondent , who was intimate at the State Department . Mr. Harv.ey himself was soon after appointed Minister to Portugal , on the recommendation and by the request of Mr. Seward . " It was on the 28th of March that Mr. Lincoln informed the Cabinet of his determination to relieve the garrison in Sumter . On the 29th Mr. Seward , according to Mr. Welles , sent out , without any consultation // with the Secretary of War , General Scott , or any of the Cabinet , a seqret military expedition for the relief of Fort Pickens ( Fort Pickens being in no need of any such assistance ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relief of Sumter , the naval commander , Captain Mercer , the flagship , and more than all , the instructions for the expedition . " The Powhatan , with boats , supplies , and men destined for Sumter , had been withdrawn from the service to which she was specially ordered , and sent without naval orders or record , under a different and junior commander , on a secret and useless mission to Pensacola , by the Secretary of State . " Mr. Welles says : " I was not made acquainted with this secret proceeding until the Powhatan sailed , when I immediately informed the President . So soon as aware of the fact , he directed Mr. Seward , although it was then midnight , to telegraph forthwith and countermand the orders which detached that vessel ; to reinstate Mercer , and in no way to interfere with the arrangements of the Secretary of the Navy . " Mr. Seward sent " a brief and curious telegram " in his own name to New York , and a fast boat was despatched from the Navy Yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing was acconfplished . " The Sumter expedition sailed without a naval commander , the squadron had no head , and the Powbatan , one of the three naval vessels on the Atlantic coast on which the Government relied in that perilous emergency , ' with her large crew and armament , was sent to the Gulf , where she was not wanted , and where almost the whole home squadron was concentrated , while the whole maritine frontier north of Cape Florida was left destitute . It was on the night of the 6th of April that the Powhatan sailed for Pickens . On the next day Mr. Seward sent to Judge Campbell , a leading secessionist on the Supreme Bench : Faith as to Sumter fully kept . Wait and see . ' " This story , the essential points of which Mr. Montgomery Blair corroborates , certainly looks as if Mr. Adams 's estimate of Mr. Seward ought to be revised . " PERsoNAL RECOLLECTIONS , FROM EARLY LIFE TO OLD AGE , OF MARY SOMERVILLE . With Selections from her Corre spondence . " By her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biographer of Mrs. Somerville very truly remarks in the first chapter of this volume , " The life of a woman entirely devoted to her family duties and to scientific pursuits affords little scope for a biography , " and any one who opened these memoirs in the expectation of finding in them a tale of romance would be sadly mistaken . They are interesting Father as a curiosity-as containing the history of a woman of unusual energy of character and strength of mind in all directions . It is not a history which shows at all the ordinary level of attainment which women may expect to reach , any more than that of Mill shows the ordinary masculine level . When we hear of Mrs. Somerville that " it was not only in her childhood and youth " that her " studies encopntered disapproval , " that it was not " till she became a widow " that she had " perfect freedom to pursue them , " we are , perhaps , led to think of her as a person who labored under disadvantages such as no woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ; but on the other hand she had advantages of mind and strength such as few women ever have . Her daughter says : " It would be almost incredible were 1 to describe how much my mother contrived to do in the course of the day , when my sister and I were small children . Although busily engaged in writing for the press , she used to teach us for three hours every morning , besides managing her house carefully , reading the newspapers ( for she always was a keen , and , I must add , a liberal politician ) , and the most important new books on all subjects , grave and gay . In addition to all this she freely visited and received her friends . . Finally , to complete the list of her accomplishments , I must add that she was a remarkably neat and skilful needlewoman . We still possess some elaborate specimens of her embroidery and lace work . " When women have acquired physical strength enough to accomplish work of this kind , they will not merely compete on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether . Mrs. Somerville 's father was Admiral Sir William Fairfax , who distinguished himself in the battle of Camperdown , and belonged to the elder branch of the Fairfax // family , so well known in the annals of this country . The descriptions given by Mrs. Somerville of her early life at Burntisland , a small quiet seaport , " with little or no commerce , " on the coast of Fife , opposite Edinburgh , are pleasantly old-fashioned . Her memory went back to a time when , upon the death of any of the townspeople , it was the custom for a man to go about ringing a bell at the doors of the friends and acquaintances of the person just dead , and after crying " Oyez " three times , to announce the death which had taken place ; when the prisoners in the Tolbooth let down bags from the prison windows for alms ; when it was so common to take snuff that Mrs. Somerville is of opinion that " even young ladies " must have taken it ; when licensed beggars , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tin badge , wandering about the country , and welcomed as gossips at the farmhouses  --  a race which is familiar to the readers of Scott 's novels from his character of Edie Ochiltreewere not yet extinct ; and when it was the curious custom , if a man were a cripple and poor , that his relations should " put him in a handbarrow , " and wheel him to their next neighbor 's door , and there leave him- " some one came out , gave him oat cake or peasemeal bannock , and then wheeled him to the next door , and in this way , going from house to house , he obtained a fair livelihood ; " and when , more remarkable than all , the Scotch were still so strict that a lady in good Edinburgh society , a cousin of Mrs. Somerville , who had carried her love of gossip too far , was " tried for defamation and condemned to a month 's imprisonment , which she actually underwent in the Tolbooth . She was let out , " Mrs. Somerville continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate which , besides the guns fired at the castle , the boys let off squibs and crackers in all the streets . As the lady in question was walking up the High street , some lads in a wynd , or narrow street , fired a small cannon , and one of the slugs with which it was loaded hit her mouth and wounded her tongue . This raised a universal laugh ; and no one enjoyed it more than my uncle William , who disliked this somewhat masculine woman . " " Tmm Lirim or CHARLES DmcKFmms . " By John Forster . Vol . ILL. 1852-1870 . Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co . It can hardly be said that Mr. Forster has succeeded in inducing the public to take his account of Dickens as anything more than a first , incomplete attempt at a biography . He deserves more thanks than he has received for having done as much as he has done , yet we can not but agree with the general estimate the public has forni*d of the work accomplished . Perhaps it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of himself-we are quite ready to acquit him of all intention of attracting unnecessary attention  --  but he surely might have given us more of Dickens . The picture we get from this book is that of a rollicking youth , gradually hardening into a rigid and almost severe manhood , which grows gradually more instead of less absorbed in itself , every day more intensely egotistic instead of more genuinely human , and at length reaching a point at which it grows impossible any longer to distinguish between what is of interest to the man himself , and what is of interest to the human race Yet it must be that a man of so much genius , and who attracted such warm admiration , might be described quite as truly in a different way . Dickens was to the last an agreeable companion ; and even though Mr. Forster 's account does him justice , it is justice without the sort of sympathetic insight which Mr. Forster indeed seems to have always supposed that he had , but was never really gifted with . In reviewing Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taste for Dickens is not a thing of the past . Were Dickens writing even " Pickwick " or " Martin Chuzzlewit " now , would they be read , and who would read them ? There is no harm in asking the question , for it can not be answered ; and whether or no the fame of Dickens increases or diminishes as the years roll on , one thing is certain , that there are many hundreds of thousands of people still living who owe to him many of the happiest moments of their lives , and who would find it difficult to recall with certainty any writer who had made so vivid and lasting a moral impression on their minds . In the present volume we have among other things the difficulties between Dickens and his wife , and the trip to this country , which takes us strangely back // 717 to the furore made over his readings only a few years ago , when the rush of people was so great that the ticket speculators found it profitable to carry mattresses to the ticket-office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behindhand when the morning 's sale opened . " THE EDUCATION OF AMERICAN GIRLS , Considered in a Series of Essays . " Edited by Anna C. Brackett . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . " SEX AND EDUCATION , " a reply to Dr. E. H. Clarke 's " Sex in Education . " Edited by Mrs. Julia Ward Howe . The substance of Dr. Clarke 's book is easily got at by *hat the ladies say of it in the above works . The volume edited by Miss Brackett contains twelve essays by eleven ladies , some of whom are experienced school-teachers ; that edited by Mrs. Julia Ward Howe contains " the views of a number of thoughtful persons , chiefly wolnen . " The ladies , it is needless to say , are " down " on the Doctor with more or less temper , according to knowledge or position . Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi , for example , being better qualified to discuss the question from Dr. Clarke 's point of view , is moderate , while Mrs. Howe seems to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education , either of boys or girls , a difficult one to treat , and particularly at this moment , when theories of progress are getting to be based on what we know instead of on what we hope for . We gather from the above works that Dr. Clarke utters many unpalatable truths from a physiological basis instead of from the old-fashioned sentimental one . He is accordingly pretty roughly handled . The point in his book which the ladies think vulnerable is his charge against female colleges as to the effect of over-teaching on the health of the pupils . The instances he adduces , they say , are insufficient to prove his case . We take no sides in this matter , but content ourselves with offering a few ideas suggested by one or two of the essays . Girls ' colleges , it seems to us , are novelties , and their effects on the economy of life are not yet apparent . The best evidence in relation to institutions of this class that we can offer is the " Letter from a German Woman " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rood , wherein we have a glimpse of results quite good enough , and illustrative of a less pretentious system . If we must tell the truth , we think this letter is worth more for practical purposes than all ' the other essays put together . But let us try the question in another way . Ask an experienced man which woman he would prefer for wife or companion-one educated in a college or one educated elsewhere or , in other words , a woman with all the culture obtainable in a private or one that had graduated in a public institution . As we are aware that we should get no reply from any but the husbands of strong-minded women , as well as from strong-minded women without husbands , and as it is not likely that there will be a modern judgment of Paris according to intellectual endowments , we pass on to other views . There is a good deal of vague assertion in respect to the mode of educating girls . Ways and means differ . People do not make a proper distinction between instruction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the latter manners and morals . A cynical friend of ours , who is rich and cares nothing for " larnin ' , " says that the best wife for a young man is a girl that is known as her father 's pet . This means that a girl brought up under male authority and direction turns out a better wife , mother , and Companion than one who has been wholly subject to maternal influences . When we reflect on the education of Mine . de Sevign* , a woman whose blood and judgment , as Hamlet says , were well commingled , and think of the influence of her " bien bon " uncle , the Abbe de Coulanges , on her , and of Shakespeare 's imaginative sanction of the principle in the persons of Prospero and Miranda , with Portia in her obedience to her father 's will , we are disposed to regard the principle as a sound one . And again , when we recur to the scrapes into which girls without male protectors and guides have got , relying on being piloted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tragedy is due to this circumstance ! We must confess to being " staggered " *n reading the essay entitled " The Education of American Girls , " by Miss Brackett . She tells us at the outset that they " combine French nerve and force with Teutonic simplicity and // truthfulness . Less accustemed to leading-strings , they walk more firmly on their own feet ; and , breathing in the universal spirit of free inquiry , they are less - in danger of becoming unreasonable and capricious . " What , accordingly , is the use of bothering ourselves about a further development of beings so complete ? Nerve , force , simplicity , truthfulness , to which add beauty , not forgetting the " universal spirit of free inquiry " - what more could a sensible man wish for ? Conscious of the moral and material difficulties of living in this world , admirers of nerve and force , particularly in those who get ahead of us , worshippers of truthfulness and simplicity , and loyal to beauty , we should shrink from subjecting these qualities to collegiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous rose grow up in a heated conservatory . The ladies under notice must bear in mind that our opinions are limited to the sphere of woman regarded as man 's companion in some shape . They do not apply to a state of things in which women are expected to take care of themselves , and trot about the world emancipated from a system of common obligations based upon physical functions and organic refinements . " ON SELF-CULTURE , INTELLEcTuAL , PHYSICAL , AND MORAL . A Yade Mecum for Young Men and Students . " By John Stuart Blackie , Professor of Greek in the University of Edinburgh . New York : Scribner , Armstrong &amp; Company . Professor Blackie is a lively and almost an amusing writer , though his little handbook treats of subjects which are certainly well worn . We do not know that he has discovered any new or starthug truths with reference to self-culture ; but he has expressed some opinions of his own in a very original way . We have not space for long extracts , but we may refer to page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relation between piety and morality . Speaking of the utilitarians , he says : " A certain school of British moralists , from Jeremy Bentham downwards , have set themselves to tabulate a scheme of morals without any reference to religion , which , to say the least of it , is a very unnatural sort of divorce , and a plain sign of a certain narrowness and incompleteness in the mental constitution of those who advocate such views . " Having thus cleared away all obstructions in the way of criticism , the Professor admits that no doubt " a professor of wisdom , " such as " old Epicurus , " may be a very good man , and yet believe that the universe is the " product of a mere fortuitous concourse of blind atoms " ; just as in these days there are " few more virtuous men than some who talk of laws of nature , invariable sequence , natural selection , favorable conditions , happy combination of external circumstances , and other such reasonless phrases as may seem to explain the frame of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " a healthy mind " this " phasisofmorality " is " abnormal " and " monstrous , " and makes a curious comparison , which to some minds may seem pious , to others impious , and to still others very funny . " It is as if a good citizen in a monarchy were to pay all the taxes conscieuitiously , serve his time in the army , and fight the battles of his country bravely , but refuse to take off his hat to the Queen when she passed . " And then warming to his subject , he smites the atheist hip and thigh . " If we did not note such a fellow altogether with a black mark "  --  the man , this is , who refuses to take off his hat on proper occasions- as a disloyal and disaffected subject , we should feel a goodnatured contempt for him as a crotchety person and unmannerly . So it is exactly with atheists , whether speculative or practical ; they are mostly crotchet-mongers and puzzle-brains ; fellows who spin silken ropes in which to strangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoid of every noble inspiration ; whose leaden intellectual firmament has no heat and no color ; whose whole nature is exhausted in fostering a prim self-contained conceit about their petty knowledges , and who can , in fact , fasten their coarse feelers upon nothing but what they can finger , and classify , and tabulate , and dissect . " We have rarely met with a passage in which the atheist received better treatment than this , and the reader must be indeed of a skeptical turn if he doubts the sincerity of the author 's remarks here or elsewhere . The book is altogether more like extempore talking on the subject of self-culture , than like a // carefully elaborated system . It contains a good deal of sense , and some remarks are scattered through it which would do a good deal to enliven a duller treatise .

" " AMONG OUR SAILoRs . " By J. Grey Jewell , M.D. , late United States Consul , Singapore . With an Appendix containing Extracts from the Laws and Consular Regulations governing the United States Merchant Service . New York : Harper &amp; Brothers . According to Dr. Jewell 's account , the abuses recently discovered to exist in the English merchant service , through the energetic efforts of Mr. Plimsoll , are not without a parallel in this country . We have in American waters , it seems , the same rotton hulks , and in American ports the same rascally owners , sending these hulks on voyages , to their certain destruction and to the almost certain death of all on board , that they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these abuses will be properly investigated , though a good deal of feeling seems to exist on the subject just now ; for sailors have few friends on shore , and the nature of their occupation and their vr.grant lives make organized movements on their part for the redress of their own wrongs impracticable . Dr. Jewell 's book ought , however , to do something to call attention to the facts . He does not write in an exaggerated way , but a long familiarity with sailors and their habits has made him interested in doing what he can to alleviate their hard lot . The romance of the sea is almost a thing of the past . The days when it was the pride of the owner , the captain , and the crew to have their ship the finest afloat are gone , and we live in days in which the principal desire of all concerned is to make the voyage required in the shortest possible time , and thus get the highest possible profits . More ships are built every year in which speed is made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view . Sailors are reckless , and their lives are cheap . There is thus a censtant tendency to sacrifice every consideration of humanity and decency in the interest of high profit . It seems to us , however , that Dr. Jewell makes a mistake in supposing that the conflicting interests of the owners and underwriters have a bad effect in this respect . It is certainly true , as he says ( p. 17 ) , that the captain must obey the owners ' orders , and go to sea when they direct him to do so , even if it is blowing a gale , and even though his vessel may be rotten in her timbers , leaky , overloaded , short of men , badly victualled , or insufficiently supplied with extra sails , spars , and boats ; and on the other hand , it is equally true that the underwriter 's interests are exactly the opposite . " I warn you " ( the underwriter is represented as saying ) " to exercise great care and diligence , and run no risks whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find it out , and we shall mark you as an unsafe captain ; and we may refuse to insure vessels commanded by you , and you would thereby lose your position . " This may be the reverse of the owners ' instructions , but notwithstanding this , the general upshot of both conflicting demands is that the captain understands that he must use all means consistent with a due regard for the safety of crew , ship , and cargo , to make a successful and profitable voyage ; i. e. , the captain has it impressed upon his mind that success in navigating ships , just as success in everything else , depends on the skill with which he combines prudence with bravery , caution with audacity . Even if the underwriter did not exist , theowner-provided always that he is an honest and respectable owner-would not care to have every ship he sent out of port go to the bottom . Of course cases of a fraudulent design to overinsure and sink are beside the question . But in ordinary casesdo not the conflicting interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good management on the part of the cap . tam ? With regard to the recklessness of ' modern shipbuilding , Dr. Jewell 's fig- // tires show that during the five years from 1841 to 1845 there were 4,069 vessels built in the United States , while during the same period 688 vessels under the American flag were lost , or nearly 17 per cent . But from 1868 to 1872 the number of vessels built was 5,387 , while the number lost was 2,177 , the percentage of vessels lost to vessels built being about 40 . The causes of this frightful increase Dr. Jewell says are numerous . Wooden vessels are not built as they used to be : the timber is insufficient in quantity , not so good in quality , not so carefully selected , not so thoroughly seasoned ; timhers not so strongly bolted together ; iron bolts used instead of copper , the shaft of the bolt being frequently iron even when copper heads appear . Ships which used to take years in building are now finished in a few months . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily understand why it is that marine insurance should have steadily risen since 1845 , according to Dr. Jewell , from five or six to twelve per cent . " ADVENTURES OF AN ATTORNEY IN SEARcH OF PRACTICE . " By Sir George Stephen . Boston : Estes &amp; Lauriat . This book , dedicated " To all attorneys who want aclient , " is a reprint of a collection of attorneys ' anecdotes , interspersed with advice to attorneys , which may still he valuable in England , but has little application in this country . The distinction between attorneys and barristers not existing with us , much of the advice is out of place , and a good deal more of it unintelligible ; still , the book is amusing . The best story we have found in it is one which is told to illustrate the value of what the author calls " selPcommand , " A solicitor of the name of Fairfield was arguing a point before Master Stratford , and the Master , who waswell known not to take contradiction kindly , had already intimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The solicitor , however , being resolute , " and finding there was little chance in any other way , determined on angering him into silence , " and began very quietly , " I was observing , Master Stratford- " when the Master interrupted him angrily , saying , " I have heard your observations , sir , till I am weary of them . I heg you will be silent . I have quite made up my mind . " The dialogue then continues : " I see you have , sir , but it strikes me that- " " I really can not help what strikes you , sir . I shall not hear another word . " " I am sorry for it , sir . 1 have a great many yet to offer . " " Indeed ! " half rising from his chair , and then resuming it . " Pray , how long may you intend to talk ? " " Probably half an hour , sir ; it depends on the attention you will be so good as to give me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say half an hour , sir ? Do you know who you are talking to ? " " It may take me a trifle longer , Master Stratford : it depends on yourself in some measure . " " On me , sir ? on me ? Insufferable insolence ! Half an hour ! Depends on myself ! Pray , what may be your name , sir ? " " Fairfield , sir . If you are ready , I will begin . " This method of proceeding so astonished the learned Master that he drew back his chair , and gaped in astonished frenzy at this defiance of his authority ; while Mr. Fairfield went on with his argument , wholly undisturbed by the judicial agitation , and quoted cases by the dozen . " Meanwhile his client , an honest tradesman who knew as little of the etiquette of the Master 's office as of St. James 's , being weary of standing , seated himself on the nearest chair . This new offence actually bewildered poor Stratford . He looked from the solicitor to the client , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wholly regardless of the argument and the authorities , when , at this instant , a servant boy entered the august presence with the coal-scuttle . A happy idea flashed across the Master 's mind . Rising precipitately froift his chair , and grasping the lad by the arm , he forced him into it . Here , Jack , take my chair ! take my chair I I do n't see why one gentleman should not sit down as well as another ! The frightened boy took the chair . Fairfield , who was a man of uncommon talent , that justified as it was supported by uncommon assurance , continued speaking , as if unconscious of the substitution . The farce was too much even for the Master 's wrath ; he laughed himself into good humor , heard the argument to the end ; and , mirabile dictu , altered his opinion . " Whether Fairfield and Stratford are the true names or not , is not mentioned .                   @ @
