UNION COLLEGE . THE fathers chose wisely when they selected the permanent home of Union College at Schenectady , New York . The outlook from the college terrace over the rich valley of the Mohawk , and the mountain spurs that adorn its course , is one of rare beauty , and is imprinted for life on the memory of those who have seen it . The buildings on either side of the broad Campus are known as the North and South College , while the circular central building bears the name of Memorial Hal . The colleges include the dormitories , recitationrooms , chapel , and , indeed , all the working appliances of the institution , together with some of the professors ' residences , while the Memorial Hall is to be devoted to the library , art collections , and archives . Previous to the Revolution , there was but one college in the State , and that in New York City , then known as King 's , and after the war as Columbia College . When the smoke of battle had fairly cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be patent to its citizens , the wisest of them soon saw that their greatest need , as the chief State of the Confederation , was in higher training-schools for the rising generation , on whom was to devolve the task of giving tone and vigor to the rapidly growing country . Since the metropolis was already in possession of a well-known college , the natural tendency for a new institution , to supply the wants of the interior of the State , was toward its capital . Other rivals , however , soon put in claims , the locations ranging as far south as Poughkeepsie , and as far north as Waterford . In the meanwhile , a few of the solid men of Schenectady , of the old Dutch stock , had been developing a literary life in the form of an institution for the cultivation of literary investigation and debate , and the founding of an academy of a higher order for the careful classical and scientific training of the young . It was seen that this school would form a fine nucleus for the proposed college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backed by over one hundred from other portions of the State , petitioned the Board of Regents to grant them a charter for the foundation of a college , and pledged themselves , in case their request was granted , to aid the new enterprise with purse and influence . The character of the men who made this appeal was so lofty and sterling , that it was evident they meant success ; and consequently , notwithstanding vigorous opposition from other OLD " ACADEMY , " 1795 .

Y // qwq to have returned ; bells were rung and flags displayed during the day , and at night bonfires and the illumination of the houses made the town a flood of light and joy . The old " Academy , " shown in our second cut , came forth from this blaze as " Union College . " Union , the name now so dear to patriots in a political sense in . their efforts to consolidate the States into one civil power , was here adopted in a new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the evangelical sects with the view to build up an institution of learning where all Christian men could find a fitting place for the education of their sons ; - it was an example of Christian unity which has ever since been followed by the most satisfactory results . The college was designed to be an institution in which the Christian religion should be regarded and cherished without reference to particular tenets . It was the first college in the United States not of a strictly qwq ciation of the wants of a college . President Nott soon appealed to the State for aid , and thus laid the foundation of measures which resulted in training the legislators and the people of the Commonwealth to consider the matter of popular and higher education as the paramount duty of a republican government . The college was so rapidly increasing in numbers under his popular and judicious management , that new buildings became a necessity , and , largely on his own responsibility , President Nott obtained the beautiful and spacious site now occupied by the college . By his untiring exertions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill brought before the Legislature of the State , by which Union College was to have two hundred thousand dollars ,  --  one hundred for the erection of college buildings , thirty thousand to pay debts already contracted , twenty thousand for a library and philosophical apparatus , and fifty thousand to constitute a fund for the aid of indigent students . In this period these were princely sums for such purposes , and to some of the members they were simply appalling . There was an immediate outcry that this was favoritism to a single institution , to which Dr. Nott replied by recommending the grant of $40,000 for the neighboring institution of Hamilton , recently founded , and $30,000 for the College of Physicians and Surgeons . Columbia had already received large gifts , but these were enhanced by the donation to that college , at the suggestion of Dr. Nott , of the grounds in New York City known as the Botanical Gardens ; and the increase in the value of this property has since been a great source of wealth to that college . The discussions attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole State , during which the movement in favor of establishing common schools became so pol ) ular that men who were at first opposed to it began to tone down their opposition . One of the most violent opponents of the measure in the Senate said to the President of the college : " You and your friends have gotten up such an excitement in regar4 to common schools , that it is perhaps necessary to do something for them ; " and then suggested a plan which seemed to favor , but in reality would have defeated the bill . Nearly all of the legislators were favorable to the College Bill , and soon the bitterest partisans feared to oppose the Common School Bill . The result of this was that the party lines which were showing themselves in the beginning soon disappeared , and the men who opposed the bill did so from conviction or stubbornness . Dr. Nott strongly advised party conciliation , and the avoidance in debate of anything that would tend to weaken the influence of any man who was in favor of the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under bonds to keep the peace during the progress of the measure , so that some of them became impatient of the restraint , and anxious that the bill should be l ) ut through , that they might be released from their obligation . In the mean while , Dr. Nott was the power behind the throne ; and he schooled his champions with arguments that were telling and unanswerable in favor of the cause of common schools and higher education under the fostering care of the State . The close of the session was approaching and the bill was not yet safe . The President watched it day by day and hour by hour . One day he discovered , as he thought , an intention to bring it up at an afternoon session , when many of its friends would be absent at a large dinner party . He himself was invited , but preferred to remain in the Senate chamber . He soon saw his fears realized , but engaged a friend of the bill to talk against time , until word could reach the other members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the table , passed the bill in triumph , and returned with a good conscience to appease an appetite sharpened by the pleasure of their victory . From this period down through the days of Marcy , Silas Wright , and Seward , the influence of Dr. Nott at the Capital was very potent , and aided greatly in advancing the welfare of the institution . The new buildings were finished for the immediate purposes of the college , while those in the town , formerly used for the entire institution , were kept solely for the accommodation of the lower classes . The grounds , containing over two hundred acres , were laid out on a broad scale , abundant room being reserved for campus in front and between the college buildings , north and south , with provision for gardens and groves . The Faculty were chosen from among the very first scholars and educators of the land , among whom were Francis Wayland and Alonzo Potter . The former cordially co-operated with the President in the development of scientific studies , while the latter made his mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also as the most distin // guished practical friend of universal education . He was for many years the trusted adviser of all who were fighting the battles of the common schools . As the patronage and means of the college increased , and the wants of the country were developed , departments were extended , and new ones added to meet the popular demand . Dr. Nott himself was a universal genius in the line of mechanical invention and the utilization of the latent wealth of the country . He was among the first to aid and supplement the labors of Fulton in his efforts to introduce steam navigation on the Hudson River ; and the steamer " Novelty , " which was largely constructed under his guidance , came from New York to Albany at a speed that astonished the age . In these efforts to improve and introduce machinery , and especially to utilize the newly discovered power of steam , Dr. Notts attention was largely directed to the production and materials of combustion for mechanical and domestic purposes . The famous " Nott stoves " were long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a broad public popularity for their utilization of anthracite coal as an article of fuel . The problem was to construct a stove in which this newly discovered treasure would readily burn ; and easy as this , with all our modern improvements , now seems to be , it cost a great deal of thought and labor , and much money , to bring the stoves to perfection for that purpose . Dr. Nott spent years of time and thousands of dollars in perfecting his base-burning stoves , and the slow progress of his work may be traced at the Patent Office at Washington . Albany and Troy owe their pre-eminence in the stove manufacture not a little to his immediate presence and counsel . These events are a part of college history , from the fact that the course of his investigations and the results of his experiments were frequently brought right to the recitationrooms . The students were intensely interested in his lectures and the illustrations describing his experiments , and especially in his prophetic view of thc productive application of heat to economical purposes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster in the students a love for the application of science to the actual affairs of life . In harmony with this feeling was founded , at an early day , the Chemical Laboratory , with a generous supply of instruments and fixtures from Europe . Thus also the School of Civil Engineering was founded in 1845 , and was among the first in TI-lB NOTT STOVE DR . NOTT. // the country to begin the work of training young men for the growing wants of the age in this department . The establishment of this school in connection with Union College was largely the result of the construction of the Erie Canal and the railroad between Schencctady and Albany ; these enterprises caused the region to feel the need of educated engineers , and some of the leading men connected witb the corporations brought this want to the attention of the authorities of Union College . The development and efficiency of this branch of the institution are largely due to the rare learning and accomplishments of Professor William M. Gillespie , who continue ( I to be its leading spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special advantages are its immediate connection with the college , which enables its pupils to enjoy the profitable connection of collegiate with scientific studies . And this opportunity has been largely enhanced of late by an extension of the course to four years , and a combination with the scientific course of the college proper , so that in their curriculum the engineering students may pursue many desirable studies of the college , especially in the modern languages and literary department , along with the special engineering course . The Engineering department of the college has numerous graduates in all parts of the country , directing many of its great engineering enterprises and fostering its industrial development . Thus the college went on during the first fifty years of its existence , enlarging its means of usefulness in every way , adding to its buildings , increasing and strengthening its departments , and gaining greatly in means and students . Many men of sound learning and steiling talents adorned its Faculty , and , as an educational institution , it became a power in the land . The completion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reunion of all those who had been connected with its history , and extensive preparations were made at the Commencement of 1843 to have a grand assemblage of the sons of Union on the occasion of the Semi-Centennial . It was resolved to hold this during the Commencement season of 1843 , and to that end a committee of twenty gentlemen was appointed , representing the first twenty graduating classes of the institution , one from each , to consider and report upon the most fitting arrangements to cele-* brate the auspicious event . This committee met at the Commencement of 44 , and de THE UNION ARMY . PROF . TAYLER LEWIS . // cided to celebrate the existence of the first half-century of the college by two public addresses , to be delivered before the Alumni at the next annual Commencement . One of these was to be pronounced by a graduate from the earlier , and one by a graduate of the later , classes , representing thus both the old and the young . The committee chose for this important duty Rev. Joseph Sweetman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. D. , of the class of r8i8 . Among the names of the committee of correspondence we find those of William H. Seward , Bishop Thomas C. Brownell , and Hon. Samuel H. Foote-  --  the last gentleman still living . The gala-day was inaugurated by an address by the Iayor , and a response by member of the class of r8o6 , Rev. Cornelius Cuyler , D. D. , and an ode by the widow of a member of the class of i8i8 . The procession was one of the most notable of all the college history . Another interesting event was the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of Dr. Nott 's Presidency , which was held on the 25th July , 1854 , addresses being given by Hon. W. W. Campbell , Rev. Dr. Wayland , and President Nott . The proceedings revealed anew the feelings of love and reverence for the aged President . A few years previous to this time , Dr. Laurens P. Hickok , an alumnus of the college , a noted professor of the Auburn Theological Seminary , was called to the Vice-Presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the duties of the sinking President . Dr. Hickok 's rare acumen in mental science soon gave him a leading position among educators , and in his long career as Vice-President , and finally President , of the college , he endeared himself by his Christian character to all the graduates during his administration , which extended through the last days of Dr. Nott , who lived for twelve years after his SemiCentennial , but , in his latter years , in a state of great weakness of mind and body . Upon the death of the President on the 29th of January , i866 , Dr. Hickok was elected as his successor by the Board . This responsible position he continued to fill for two years , when he resigned , in accordance with the long-cherished conviction that at the age of seventy he would retire from active life and devote the remainder of his years and strength to the revision and extension of his numerous literary works , in which task he is still engaged . On his retirement , Rev. Charles A. A. Aiken , D. D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacancy , which he did with peculiar acceptance , as scholar , teacher , and disciplinarian , for two years , when he withdrew , on account of illness in his family , which demanded a less rigorous climate during the winter months . In this emergency , the choice of a successor , after a short interim , fell on the Rev. Eliphalet Nott Potter , D. D. , grandson of Dr. Nott , and son of Bishop Alonzo Potter . The election of so young a man to so responsible a post meant the insertion of a new graft upon the old stock ,  --  meant a breaking away from many old forms and traditions , and entrance into a new and modern life , and an adaptation to the wants and educational progress of the age ,  --  meant , in short , New Union based on " Old Union . " In this spirit , the Faculty , one and all , rallied around their new leader , and participated , each in his sphere , in the revived life . The first step taken was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erection of much-needed edifices of various kinds . A few years previously some ten thousand dollars had been expended on the internal renovation of the dormitories , to which but little had been done since their erection . The result was a far more cheerful aspect to PRESIDENT ELIPHALET NOTT POTTER . // rooms and halls , which had borne a sort of gloomy and monastic look . Some of the rooms were connected with others by doors , that a group of students might occupy one room as a dormitory and another as a study and sitting-room . Other experiments are even now being tried with a view to make the accommodations as home-like and ace ptable as attainable in the nature of the case . Some of the recitation-rooms have been very much altered and improved , especially in the matter of blackboard and other facilities , and in that of convenient seating . The outside of the colleges has been entirely re-grouted , so that they hear a new and neat appearance . Of the entirely new buildings , the chief is the Alumni or Memorial Hall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South College . The solid foundation for this was laid some time before the war , by the aid of generous contributions from some of the Alumni . Various untoward events interfered with its erection , while the massive walls , just towering above the level of the C ' mpus , were a continual reminder of unfulfilled plans . As this enterprise was the one especially undertaken by the Alumni , it was thought to be appropriate to the new life to begin the work of it without delay . I'wo of that body , brothers of the President , advanced $40,000 for the purpose , which they have since increased to $so , ooo , and the work was begun on the old foundations . The edifice is circular and surmounted by a dome , according to the original plans . The walls are of native blue-stone , with white Ohio sandstone trimmings , and the roof and dome are of corrugated iron , covered with slate . The interior is adorned with iron columns from base to summit , supporting the spacious dome at the top and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one great rotunda from floor to top of dome . It will be in strict sense a Memorial Hall and fireproof Library , and will , when completed inside , contain many portraits of prominent men connected with the history of the Institution , as well as other paintings given by Alumni and friends , and statues , busts , and other works of art . It is proposed to have it formally opened at the next Coinmencen*ent , in commemoration of the Centennial year . The Gymnasium is the largest , it is believed , connected with an American college . It is handsomely equipped with all the requisites for a first-class gymnasium , and the whole enterprise , as a means of physical development and improvement , is under the control of a professional gymnast , whose theory is to use its peculiar opportunities with special reference to physical development and manly exercise , to the exclusion of all useless or dangerous feats . Rooms are furnished in the basement for other forms of physical amusement , and for the accommodation of the Base-ball and Boating Clubs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable improvements , a handsome dwelling has been erected as a Presidential residence , largely from the generous donation to the Christian Union Endowinent Fund , on the part of a member of the Board of Trustees ; and a few other residences are contemplated by individuals on very favorable terms for the Institution , so that , before long , it is hoped that all who are connected with the College will be able to find appropriate homes on , or near , the grounds . One hundred acres have been reserved for a College Park , never to be encroached upon , while the remainder has been greatly improved by the intersection of broad boulevards and drives , and by the general beautifying of the grounds . With these material advances of the new nigime , others of a more intellectual nature have gone hand in hand . Both the old classical and the scientific course have been greatly enlarged . The latter was a favorite department of the college in days when it was almost alone COLLEGE ENTRANCE . // in Union , and it has gone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands equal in training and careful discipline with the classical course , and absorbs as much time , while , in all respects , it is open to the same grade of honors and distinction . The Department of Natural History , for some years in possession of the famous Wheatley Collection of Shells and Minerals , now valued at $30,000 , has been greatly enlarged of late years by the annual dredging on several of our coasts for marine specimens . The gentleman in charge of this department is a graduate of the college and an enthusiast in his special line , and has largely increased the various collections , zo6logical and marine . Last winter he spent several months on the southern coast of Florida , and came home with twenty barrels of fine corals , sponges , and shells . His recitations are held within sight and reach of these , so that they are made practically useful to the young men , some of whom occasionally accompany the Professor in his dredging expeditions . In the Chemical and Philosophical Departments corresponding improvements have been made . Gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general use , as well as for the special use of the Chemical Laboratory , where , during all study hours , young men may be found working at practical chemical experiments at their desks . The demonstrations of Experimental Philosophy are largely aided by apparatus of the most extensive character , much of it new and rare , made under the personal supervision of the chief of that department , in the workshops of Paris , Munich , and London . The Professor has spent some time abroad , engaged in the selection and purchase of the best instruments to the value of over ten thousand dollars . Union has also a Military Department , which is in charge of a national officer , a graduate of West Point , and member of the artillery corps . The department was established here , as in many other colleges , at the suggestion of the Government , which has provided the " army " with muskets . - n in*xpensive fatigue uniform has been adopted , and great interest is manifested in the regular drills . The physical , disciplinary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment a success . Since the accession of the new President , about $300,000 has been added to the resources of the college , all of it collected under the name of the " Christian Union Endowment Fund . " Union College received the impulse that brought it into being , from the desire of Christian union among the various denominations , and at a time when there was no institution in the State supported by the patronage of the separate churches . Since that period , A CURIOSITY OF UNION COLLEON. // many denominational schools have arisen and done valiant work ; and still Union College clings to the broad principle of its and Dr. Nott made it a special point to seek out and encourage worthy men in this way ; and although of late , especially since the war , both the number of the applicants and the cost of their education have greatly increased , yet the college authorities have desired to keep up the reputation of Union in this regard , and are proud to say that no young man is forced to stay away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purpose Miss Catherine L. Wolfe , of New York city , has placed $50,000 at the disposal of President Potter . This is the consummation of the generous intentions of her father , the late John David Wolfe , who at the time of his death was maturing plans for the education of deserving young men n the Southern States whose parents had become impoverished . This beneficence has enabled the college to open its doors more widely , and already about twenty-five Southerri students are enrolled upon its books . Some years ago Union College recognized the fact that a very essential element of her future success would he the loyal support of her large body of Alumni . To further deserve and secure this , a few years ago the Alumni were admitted to a representation in the Board of Trustees . This was done by alteration of the charter , which now calls for the election of *four of the Board from among the Alumni , one being chosen annually for the period of four years . In response to this the Alumni have been extremely active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Faculty , in the formation , * &amp;&lt; . MARIA . foundation , in the belief that now , more than ever , there is also need of a school where all evangelical Christians can unite in the work of education without distinction of peculiar religious belief ; and , therefore , it emphasizes its newly adopted motto : In essentials , unity ; in non-essentials , liberty ; in all things , charity . " And with a view to strengthen this characteristic , and to perpetuate it , this Christian Union Endowment Fund has been instituted . The first great gift was $ioo , ooo from Mr. James Brown , of Brown , Brothers &amp; Co. ; then , $50,000 for the Memorial Hall , and , again , nearly $ , *o , ooo for the various new buildings , including the Gymnasium , heretofore mentioned . One of the greatest needs of the increased attendance of students was found to be the means of aiding deserving ones in their struggle to obtain an education . A fund given by the State for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest days of the college has aided many a young cities of the country , East and West . Many man . Some of the brightest minds and of these bodies have formed State organizamost talented men sent forth by Union tions , and hold annual meetings . One of College were in part sustained by this fund , their favorite projects is to form an Alumni " THE PIPE OF PEACE ' * // fund of about $ioo , ooo to endow three emeritus chairs , the first occupants of which are to be Doctors Isaac W. Jackson , John Foster , and Tayler Lewis . The history of the literary societies is very rich in labor and reminiscence , and no small portion of it has been made by men who have since made their mark in the world . One of these societies actually antedates the college , and was merged into it at its foundation , and their diplomas and certificates of membership are very highly prized by the holders . A Theological Society of Christian Inquiry has also had a very long and successful career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual body , known as the Senate and House of Representatives , was organized in the Senior and Junior classes , for parliamentary debate . This body has familiarized many a future legislator with the practical machinery of legislation . Mr. Seward himself aided in its organization , and spoke several times at its anniversaries . Another famous association , which has brought before it on its anniversary occasions such men as Seward and Sumner , is the Phi Beta Kappa of Union College , which possesses the Alpha Chapter of New York . The original society was founded in 1776 , at William and Mary College in Virginia , and this , the first chapter in the State of New York , in 1817 . As is well known , the Phi Beta Kappa is the special guardian of sound classical culture , and its influence among the colleges of the United States has been extremely conducive to classical investigation . The college songs , which have been collected into a volume entitled " Carmina Concordi* , " represent a large part of the student life , and are worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " by Fitz Hugh Ludlow ( 56 ) now deceased , is always sung at the close of the Commencement exercises , the audience joining with enthusiasm in the chorus : " Then here 's to thee , the brave and free , Old Union smiling o'er us ; And for many a day , as thy walls grow gray , May they ring with thy children 's chorus . " The " Terrace Song , " by the same author , is perhaps the favorite of all . The terrace in front of the college buildings overlooks the park and the Mohawk Valley , and here the " Boys " frequently gather on warm evenings after tea to have a smoke , and to sing : " Ye Union Boys whose pipes are lit , Come forth in merry throng ; Upon the terrace let us sit , And cheer our souls with song . Old Prex may have his easy chair , The Czar may have his throne ; Their cushions get the worse for wear , But not our seat of stone . This grand old seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Howard Payne , the author of " Home , Sweet Home , " spent some of his early years at Union , and Alfred B. Street , of Albany , to whom the boys owe their " Greeting to Alma Mater , " is nmnbered among the Alumni . The songs are in all keys , from the rollicking humor of " Co-cache-lunk , " so dear to all college boys , to the laments for " Whately " or " Mechanics , " which are sung in well-simulated sadness : " Round the College hear the groaning , Hear the mournful sound ! All the Sophomores are weeping ,  - -  Whately 's in the cold , cold ground . " The entrance to the college grounds is known as the Blue Gate . Near the entrance is the mansion occupied by Dr. Nott during the closing years of his life , now the residence of his estimable and benevolent widow , Mrs. Urania Nott , who cOLLEOE GROUNDS . // retains an ardent interest in the college . Between this dwelling and the college proper is the Presidential residence recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the members of the Faculty live on the grounds-some in buildings that form a part of the main structures , others in detached residences . The present Faculty embraces a number of celebrated scholars , of whom Dr. Tayler Lewis is perhaps most widely known . The theory of Dr. Nott was that of family government as far as practicable , and to attain this he brought the Faculty as much as possible in personal contact with the students . He was himself very intimate with the boys , and many stories are told of him by the older graduates , the most famous of which is the following : One night the Doctor 's hen-roost was unusually noisy . Concemed about his poultry and his eggs , he hastened out in dressing-gown and slippers , in time to surprise certain disguised figures , which quickly vanished , leaving a few of his choicest fowls beheaded . The Doctor had a magic way of finding out evil-doers , and he soon discovered these . But instead of taking off their heads in turn , he invited them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fowls with whose necks they had made free the night before . The Doctor made no allusion to the occurrence , trusting to the conviction that every mouthful of contraband chicken would stick in the throat , to teach them a better lesson than any he could convey in words . When the meal was finished the boys were politely bowed out , firmly resolved never again to prepare for themselves so uncomfortable a meal . The culprits never heard the last of " Prex 's Chickens . " The fantastical decoration of their rooms by college students has perhaps reached its extremest limit in the whims of one of the Union boys , a view of whose room we give on page 236 . Disgusted at the paucity of taste iP the wall-papers of the day , he has departed from the conventional , and , putting his brother students under contribution for all the discarded envelopes that can be begged or borrowed , has covered his bare walls with over four thousand of these , to the exposure of a motley group of correspondents . This effect is varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is one of the curiosities of the college . An important personage about the college is a sturdy German Frau , " Maria , Queen of the Broom . " The boys like Maria and obey her , for she does them many a good turn in daily clearing up their rooms , making their beds , and keeping things in order . When the Freshman first makes his appearance in the dormitories , he is introduced to Maria for consultation about his furniture ; perchance she will sell him some that she has bought of a departing Senior , and , when , at the end of his course , he can find no one else willing to look at the furniture that he has been hacking and kicking at for four years , Maria comes in as a forlorn hope to take his relics for a trifle . It is rumored too that Maria 's generous heart at times unlooses her purse-strings to some of the improvident ones of her flock . Class Day at Unionis very similar to that at other institutions , unless we except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace , " over which all rivalry and antagonisms of student life are forgotten , men who had perchance been enemies , parting as friends . The Seniors sit in a careless group on the turf , and the " Pipe of Peace " occupies the center . The coil , with mouthpiece , is passed around from one to another , each taking a whiff as a pledge of life-long friendship . The Union Pipe is made in imitation of the Memorial Hall as it will look when finished . The first movement toward this building was made some twenty years ago , when the foundations were laid by means of a fund raised by the Alumni . In the midst of the work the war came on and separated sections and men , and the enterprise thus stopped for awhile . When the college renewed its vigor a few years ago , the work was resumed . In the meanwhile , departing classes kept alive the memory of early vows by pledging their faith over a Pipe of Peace , in the form of Memorial Hall . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incense rise ; May every puff a care release , While joy its place supplies . " Preserved carefully with the relics of the college is the " Old Cocked Hat , " so long worn by Dr. Nott , while conferring 05 . NOTT 'S COCKEO HAT . // degrees on Commencement Day , and so well known to the early graduates of the college . The cocked hat became , to a certain extent , a Revolutionary emblem after the close of our war with Great Britain , and the Doctor seemed to think it more fitting to the peculiarly American College , as Union has often been styled , than the cap worn by the scholars of the English universities . He clung to it to the last , and wore it well , as is proved by the specimen still in existence , which bears the marks of use . He wore this hat for the last time , we believe , at the Commencement exercises cf i86o . The best full-length portrait of Dr. Nott , that by the artist Inman , now preserved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown , and a roll of diplomas , in the act of conferring degrees . Another memento of Dr. Nott is the best specimen of the " Nott Stove " now to be found , which is still in use by his widow , in the hail of the house in which he died . He and some of the older members of the Faculty clung to this style of stove through all the innovations that have so greatly affected and varied the style of modern heaters . And this one holds its own as a heat-producer , about as well as most of the more recent rivals ; for the Ii ) octor almost perfected the essentials of the base-burning stove . His wood stove for the rooms of the students , is considered no mean invention even yet , and many specimens of it are still in use in the college . From its peculiar shape , it long ago received the sobriquet of " Coffin , " which is yet its popular appellation . The gradual disuse of wood as fuel will probably soon end its days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - for many years was a famous vehicle , ktiown as the " Threewheeled Chariot , " in which the Doctor used to drive about . It was built at his suggestion , as a great improvement on the " One-horse shay . " The body of the vehicle was supported by the rear axle on the two wheels , while a third wheel in front , was in close connection with the shafts , so that it revolved with them as they turned . By this arrangement , the body of the carriage could be hung low , supported entirely by the wheels , while the third wheel in front , revolving in a small circle with the shaft , enabled the occupants to make a short and safe turn . Thus , the whole was a model of convenience and safety , and a favorite not only with its owner , but with the students and the town . Nothing is left of it but an outline in the memory of those that saw the quaint affair in use . The " Boys " have a legend that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SCHENECTADY. // Elijah of old , was thus transported to the heavenly land , and they yet sing : " Where , oh where , is the good old Doctor ? Where , oh where , is the good old Doctor ? He went up in the Three-wheeled Chariot , Safe to the Promised Land . " And while the stillness of the night is sometimes broken by the harmony of many voices joining in this assurance , profane lips sometimes kindly assume to transport other members of the Faculty on their final journey in this same charmed vehicle , a fact of which these honorable gentlemen are individually made aware , by the insertion of their names in the ditty instead of the Doctor 's as their admiring pupils pass their respective houses . And now , before we leave the college , a parting word to the quaint old town , Schenectady . About all that is now left of the past , is an old Dutch house here and there as a reminder of the days of old . One of these had a certain connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of its officers , Jonas Holland ; for which reason it was for many years known as the " Holland House . " It is now generally known as the " Old Dutch House , " and a cut of it is here given . It was built in i*zp* , and occupied by Jonas Holland from 1814 to 1839 , the year of his death . Mr. Holland was captain of a company in the war of 1812 , then superintendent of the workmen of the present college buildings on the Hill from 1812 to 1815 , and was subsequently Registrar and Treasurer of the college until the day of his death . Another cherished monument of the old Dutch " Vans , " whose descendants are still numerous here , was known as the " Old Mohawk Bridge . " There was only one other just like it in all the country , and that was over the Delaware at Trenton . It was built in spans resting on abutments , and these spans were formed of beams so immense , that popular tradition declares them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter had lodged on the neighboring Helderbergs . The whole structure was thus such a curiosity , both from the antique origin of its timbers and the everlasting character of its frame , that it was about the first sight to be shown to the curious stranger . For many years at each returning spring the wiseacres of the town had been predicting its destruction by the breaking up of the ice on the Mohawk . The confidence in this event often attracted crowds to the bridge . But year after year the beams withstood the shock of icy masses piled up almost to the summit of the bridge . At last , the irreverent generation of the period laid violent hands upon it , unjointed and unspiked the massive structure , and carried it off piecemeal , wondering all the while , as the dismantling went on , at the patience and strength of the fathers that built it . Burr , the most celebrated builder of the day , was the architect , and it was first used in i 8o8 . Its completion was the occasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion with their presence , as a testimony of the great importance of the work to the rapidly extending settlement of the State and the country . Of late , " Old Dorp , " as the town is frequently called by the Dutch settlers in and around it , has thrown off its lethargy and wheeled into line to keep progress with the age . And in consonance with this spirit , its favorite institution , on the brow of the overlooking hill , is also putting on new life , so that its favorite cognomen of " Oki Union " is almost a misnomer .
