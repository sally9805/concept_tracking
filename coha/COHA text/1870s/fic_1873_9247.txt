Apartment in the palace of Irene . Irene , reclining upon a divan . Irene . Ir ene How strange a fate is mine ! Young , fair , and highborn , I may not choose on whom I will bestow my love ! Betrothed to a prince whom I have never seen ; compelled to honor and obey one whom my heart perchance can never love , alas ! alas ! And yet , they tell me that Constantine is noble , brave , and good . What more can I desire ? Ah , if he do but love me I shall be content noise without ; she rises . Hark ! ' t is his messenger approaching with letters from the queen , his mother . I will question this ambassador , and learn yet more of this young prince , my future husband seats herself with dignity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rienzi The queen , my mistress , sends thee greeting , lady , and this scroll . May it please thee , read . I await your pleasure . Irene Irene takes the letter and reads . My lord , with a woman 's curiosity , I fain would ask thee of thy prince , whose fate the gods have linked with mine . Tell me , is he tender , true , and noble ? Answer truly , I do command thee . Rienzi . Rienzi Lady , he is tender as a woman , gentle as thy heart could wish , just and brave as a king should ever be . The proudest lady in all Greece were well matched with our noble Constantine . Irene . Irene And is he fair to look upon ? Paint me his likeness , if thou canst . Rienzi . Rienzi I can but ill perform that office . Thou must see if thou wouldst rightly know him . The gods have blessed him with a fair and stately form , a noble face , dark locks , and a king-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is he , our brave young prince ; one to honor , lady ; one to trust and  --  love . Irene . Irene ' T is a noble man thou hast painted . One more question and thou mayst retire . Hath he ever spoken of her who is to be his wife ? Nay , why do I fear to ask thee ? Does he love her ? Rienzi . Rienzi Lady , I beg thee ask me not . Who could fail to love when once he had looked upon thee ? Irene . Irene Thou canst not thus deceive me . Answer truly : What doth he think of this betrothal and approaching marriage ? Rienzi . Rienzi He hath not seen thee , princess , knows of thee nothing save that thou art beautiful , and one day to become his wife . But he is young , and hath no wish to wed , and even his mother 's prayers have failed to win his free consent to this most cherished plan , that by uniting thy fair kingdom unto his , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Irene . Irene Perchance his heart is given to another . Has no fair Grecian maiden won the love he can not offer me ? Rienzi . Rienzi Nay , lady . He loves nought but his mother , his subjects , and his native land . But soon we trust , when thou art by his side , a deeper love will wake within him , and thou wilt be dearer than country , home , or friends . Irene . Irene ' T is well ; thou mayst retire . I will send answer by thee to thy queen , and seek some gift that may be worthy her acceptance . And now , adieu ! Rienzi bows and retires . He does not love me , then , and I must wed a cold and careless lord . And yet  --  so tender to all others , he could not be unkind to me alone . Oh , that I could win his love unknown , and then when truly mine , to cast away the mask , and be myself again . Stay ! let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely the gods have sent the thought ! I will disguise me as a slave , and as a gift sent to his mother , I can see and learn to know him well . I will return with the ambassador , Rienzi . I spake to him of a gift . He little thinks in the veiled slave he shall bear away , the princess is concealed . Yes , Constantine , as a nameless girl will Irene win thy heart ; and when as a wife she stands beside thee , thou shalt love her for herself alone . Tableau . curtain . SCENE SECOND . A room in the palace of The Queen . The Queen alone . Queen . Queen Zelneth Why comes he not ? They told me that our ambassador to the Princess Irene had returned , and bore a gift for me . Would that it were a picture of herself ! They say she is wondrous fair ; and could my wayward son but gaze upon her , his heart might yet be won . Enter Irene , disguised as the slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou ? Ione kneels and presents a letter . Queen Queen Zelneth reads the letter . Ah , welcome ! Thy mistress tells me she hath chosen from among her train the fairest and most faithful of her slaves , as a gift for me . With thanks do I accept thee . Lift thy veil , child , that I may see how our maidens do compare with thee . Ione lifts her veil . The Queen gazes in surprise at her beauty . Thou art too beautiful to be a slave . What is thy name ? Ione . Ione Ione ; may it please thee , lady . Queen . Queen Zelneth ' T is a fit name for one so fair ; and thy country , maiden ? Ione . Ione With the princess , my kind mistress , have I dwelt for many happy years ; and honored by her choice now offer my poor services to thee . Queen . Queen Zelneth What canst thou do , Ione ? Thou art too fair and delicate to bear the heavy water-urn or gather fruit . Ione @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harp , and sing sweet songs ; can bear thee wine , and tend thy flowers . I can be true and faithful , and no task will be too hard for thy grateful slave , Ione . Queen . Queen Zelneth Thou shalt find a happy home with me , and never grieve for thy kind mistress . And now , listen while I tell thee what thy hardest task shall be . I will confide in thee , Ione , for thou art no common slave , but a true and gentle woman whom I can trust and love . Thou hath heard thy lady is betrothed to my most noble son ; and yet , I grieve to say , he loves her not . Nay , in the struggle ' gainst his heart , hath lost all gayety and strength , and even the name Irene will chase the smile away . He loves no other , yet will not offer her his hand when the heart that should go with it feels no love for her who is to be his wife . I honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and the worth of thy fair lady , he yet might love . Thou shalt tell him this : all the kind deeds she hath done , the gentle words she hath spoken ; all her loveliness and truth thou shalt repeat ; sing thou the songs she loved ; weave round his cups the flowers she wears ; and strive most steadfastly to gain a place within his heart for love and Lady Irene . Canst thou , wilt thou do this , Ione ? Ione . Ione Dear lady , all that my poor skill can do shall yet be tried . I will not rest till he shall love my mistress as she longs to be beloved . Queen . Queen Zelneth If thou canst win my son to health and happiness again , thou shalt be forever my most loved , most trusted friend . The gods bless thee , child , and give thy work success ! Now rest thee here . I will come ere long to lead thee to the prince . Exit The Queen . Ione . Ione All goes well ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him whom I already love ; to sing to him , weave garlands for his brow , and tell him of the thoughts stirring within my heart . Yes , I most truly long to see him whom all love and honor . The gods be with me , and my task will soon be done . curtain . SCENE THIRD . Another room in the palace . Constantine , sad and alone . Con . Cons tantine Another day is well-nigh passed , and nearer draws the fate I dread . Why must I give up all the bright dreams of my youth , and wed a woman whom I can not love ? They tell me she is young and fair , but I seek more than that in her who is to pass her life beside me . Youth and beauty fade , but a noble woman 's love can never die . Oh , Irene , if thou couldst know how hard a thing it is to take thee , princess though thou art ! Enter Ione . Ah , lady , thou hast mistaken thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments . Ione . Ione Nay , my lord ; I have come from her . She bid me say it was her will that I , her slave , should strive with my poor skill to while away the time till she could join thee . Con . Constantine Thou , a slave ? By the gods ! methought it was some highborn lady ,  --  nay , even the Princess Irene herself , seeking the queen , my mother . Ione . Ione She was my mistress , and bestowed me as a gift upon the queen . This scroll is from her hand . May it please thee , read it kneels and presents letter . Con . Constant ine Rise , fair maiden ! I would rather listen to thy voice . May I ask thee to touch yon harp ? I am weary , and a gentle strain will sooth my troubled spirit . Stay ! let me place it for thee . Prince moves the harp and gazes upon Ione Ione as she sings and plays . The wild birds sing in the orange groves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles ' neath a summer sky Through the joyous fleeting hours . But oh ! in the slave girl 's lonely heart , Sad thoughts and memories dwell , And tears fall fast as she mournfully sings , Home , dear home , farewell ! Though the chains they bind be all of flowers , Where no hidden thorn may be , Still the free heart sighs ' neath its fragrant bonds , And pines for its liberty . And sweet , sad thoughts of the joy now gone , In the slave girl 's heart shall dwell , As she mournfully sings to her sighing harp , Native land , native land , farewell ! Con . Constantine ' T is a plaintive song . Is it thine own lot thou art mourning ? If so , thou art a slave no longer . Ione . Ione Nay , my lord . It was one my Lady Irene loved , and thus I thought would please thee . Con . Constantine Then never sing it more ,  --  speak not her name ! Nay , forgive me if I pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love her . Was she kind to thee ? By what name shall I call thee ? Ione . Ione Ione , your Highness . Ah , yes ; she was too kind . She never spake a cruel word , nor chid me for my many faults . Never can I love another as I loved my gentle mistress . Con . Constantine And is she very fair ? Has she no pride , no passion or disdain to mar her loveliness ? She is a princess ; is she a true and tender woman too ? Ione . Ione Though a princess , ' neath her royal robes there beats a warm , true heart , faithful and fond , longing to be beloved and seeking to be worthy such great joy when it shall come . Thou ask'st me of her beauty . Painters place her face among their fairest works , and sculptors carve her form in marble . Yes , she is beautiful ; but ' t is not that thou wouldst most care for . Couldst thou only know her !  --  pardon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within thy breast as now . Con . Constantine Ah , do not cease ! say on ! There is that in the music of thy voice that soothes and comforts me . Come , sit beside me , fair Ione , and I will tell thee why I do not love thy princess . Ione . Ione You do forget , my lord , I am a slave ; I will kneel here . Prince reclines upon a couch . Ione kneels beside him . Con . Constantine Listen ! From a boy I have been alone ; no loving sister had I , no gentle friend ,  --  only cold councillors or humble slaves . My mother was a queen , and ' mid the cares of State , tho ' fondly loving me , her only son , could find no time to win me from my lonely life . Thus , tho ' dwelling ' neath a palace roof with every wish supplied , I longed most fondly for a friend . And now , ere long , a crown will rest upon my head , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more earnestly than ever do I seek one who can share with me the joys and cares of my high lot ,  --  a woman true and noble , to bless me with her love . Ione . Ione And could not the Princess Irene be to thee all thou hast dreamed ? Con . Constantine I fear I can not love her . They told me she was beautiful and highborn ; and when I sought to learn yet more , ' t was but to find she was a cold , proud woman , fit to be a queen , but not a loving wife . Thus I learned to dread the hour when I must wed . Yet ' t is my mother 's will ; my country 's welfare calls for the sacrifice , and I must yield myself . Ione . Ione They who told thee she was proud and cold do all speak falsely . Proud she is to those who bow before her but to gain some honor for themselves , and cold to such as love her for her royalty alone . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that finds its happiness in noble deeds can make a queen , Irene is worthy of the crown she will wear . And now , if it please thee , I will seek the garden ; for thy mother bid me gather flowers for the feast . Adieu , my lord ! She bows , her veil falls ; Constantine hands it to her . Nay , kings should not bend to serve a slave , my lord . Con . Constantine I do forget myself most strangely . There , take thy veil , and leave me turns aside . Nay , forgive me if I seem unkind , but I can not treat thee as a slave . Come , I will go with thee to the garden ; thou art too fair to wander unprotected and alone . Come , Ione leads her out . curtain . SCENE FOURTH . The gardens of the palace . Ione weaving a garland . Ione . I one The rose is Love 's own flower , and I will place it in the wreath I weave for thee , O Constantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily ! And yet , methinks , if all goes on as now , the slave Ione will ere long win a prince 's love . He smiles when I approach , and sighs when I would leave him ; listens to my songs , and saves the withered flowers I gave him days ago . How gentle and how kind ! Ah , noble Constantine , thou little thinkest the slave thou art smiling on is the " proud , cold " Princess Irene , who will one day show thee what a fond , true wife she will be to thee sings . Enter Helon ; kneels to Ione . Ione . Io ne Helon , my father 's friend ! thou here ! Ah , hush ! Betray me not ! I am no princess now . Rise , I do beseech thee ! Kneel not to me . Helon . Helon Dear lady , why this secrecy ? What dost thou here , disguised , in the palace where thou art soon to reign a queen ? Ione . Ione Hark ! is all still ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell thee all . Thou knowest the young prince loves me not ,  --  nay , do not sigh ; I mean the princess , not the slave Ione , as I now call myself . Well , I learned this , and vowed to win the heart he could not give ; and so in this slave 's dress I journeyed hither with Rienzi , the ambassador , as a gift unto the queen . Thus , as a poor and nameless slave , I seek to win the noble Constantine to life and love . Dost understand my plot , and wilt thou aid me , Father Helon ? Helon . Helon ' T is a strange thought ! None but a woman would have planned it . Yes , my child , I will aid thee , and thou yet shall gain the happiness thy true heart well deserves . We will talk of this yet more anon . I came hither to see the prince . They told me he was pale and ill , in sorrow for his hated lot . Say , is this so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I am cause of all this sorrow . Father , tell me , can not I by some great deed give back his health , and never have the grief of knowing that he suffered because I was his bride ? How can I avert this fate ? I will do all , bear all , if he may be saved . Helon . Helon Grieve not , my child ; he will live , and learn to love thee fondly . The cares of a kingdom are too much for one so young ; but he would have happiness throughout his native land , and toiling for the good of others he hath hidden his sorrow in his own heart , and pined for tenderness and love . Thou hast asked if thou couldst save him . There is one hope , if thou canst find a brave friend that fears no danger when a good work leads him on . Listen , my daughter ! In a deep and lonely glen , far beyond the palace gates , there grows an herb whose magic power ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreathe it round their head in slumber . Yet none dare seek the spot , for spirits are said to haunt the glen , and not a slave in all the palace but grows pale at mention of the place . I am old and feeble , or I had been there long ere this . And now , my child , who canst thou send ? Ione . Ione I will send one who fears not spirit or demon ; one who will gladly risk e'en life itself for the brave young prince . Helon . Helon Blessed be the hand that gathers , thrice blessed be he who dares the dangers of the way . Bring hither him thou speakest of . I would see him . Ione . Ione She stands before thee . Nay , start not , Father . I will seek the dreaded glen and gather there the magic flowers that may bring health to Constantine and happiness to me . I will away ; bless , and let me go . Helon . Helon Thou , a woman delicate and fair ! Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better he should die than thou shouldst come to harm . I can not let thee go . Ione . Ione Thou canst not keep me now . Thou hast forgot I am a slave , and none may guess beneath this veil a princess is concealed . I will take my water-urn , and with the other slaves pass to the spring beyond the city gates ; then glide unseen into the haunted glen . Now , tell me how looks the herb , that I may know it . Helon . Helon ' T is a small , green plant that blossoms only by the broad , dark stream , dashing among the rocks that fill the glen . But let me once again implore thee not to go . Ah , fatal hour when first I told thee ! ' T is sending thee to thy death ! Stay , stay , my child , or let me go with thee . Ione . Ione It can not be ; do thou remain , and if I come not back ere set of sun , do thou come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so farewell . I return successful , or I return no more . Ione rushes out . Helon . Helon Thou brave and noble one to dare so much for one who loves thee not ! I 'll go and pray the gods to watch above thee , and bring thee safely back . Exit Helon. curtain . SCENE FIFTH . A terrace beside the palace . Enter Constantine . Con . Constantine Why comes she not ? I watched her slender form when with the other slaves she went forth to the fountain yonder . I knew her by the rosy veil and snow-white arm that bore the water-urn . The morning sun shone brightly on the golden hair , and seemed more beautiful for resting there ; and now ' t is nearly set , and yet she comes not . Why should I grieve because my mother 's slave forgets me ? Shame on thee , Constantine ! How weak and childish have I grown ! This fever gives no rest when Ione is not here to sing sweet songs , and cheer the weary hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flowers . Where hast thou been , Ione ? The long day passed so slowly , and I missed thee sadly from my side . But thou art pale ; thy locks are damp ! What has chanced to thee ? Speak , I beseech thee ! Ione . Ione ' T is nothing ; calm thyself , my lord . I am well , and bring thee from the haunted glen the magic flowers whose power I trust will win thee health and happiness . May it please thee to accept them kneels , and gives the flowers . Con . Constan tine Thou , thou , Ione ? Hast thou been to that fearful spot , where mortal foot hath feared to tread ? The gods be blessed , thou art safe again ! How can I thank thee ? Ah , why didst thou risk so much for my poor life ? It were not worth the saving if thine were lost . Ione . Ione My lord , a loving nation looks to thee for safety and protection . I am but a feeble woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep for the friendless slave , Ione . Con . Constantine Oh , say not thus ! Tears would be shed for thee , and one heart would grieve for her who risked so much for him . Speak not of death or separation , for I can not let thee go . Ione . Ione I will not leave thee yet , till I have won thy lost health back . The old priest , Helon , bid me seek the herbs , and bind them in a garland for thy brow . If thou wilt place it there , and rest awhile , I am repaid . Con . Constantine If thy hand gave it , were it deadly poison I would place it there . Now sing , Ione ; thy low sweet voice will bring me pleasant dreams , and the healing sleep will be the deeper with thy music sounding in mine ears . The prince reclines upon the terrace . Ione weaves a garland and sings . Flowers , sweet flowers , I charge thee well , O'er the brow where ye bloom cast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have borne thee here , thy power to tell . Flowers , pale flowers , o'er the brow where ye lie , Cast thy sweetest breath ere ye fade and die . Ione places the garland on the head of the prince , who falls asleep . She sits beside him softly singing . curtain . SCENE SIXTH . The Queen 's apartment . The Queen alone . Queen . Queen Zelneth ' T is strange what power this slave hath gained o'er Constantine . She hath won him back to health again , and never have I seen so gay a smile upon his lips as when she stood beside him in the moonlight singing to her harp . And yet , tho ' well and strong again , he takes no interest in his native land . He comes no more to council hall or feast , but wanders ' mong his flowers with Ione . How can I rouse him to the danger that is near ! The Turkish sultan and his troops are on their way to conquer Greece , and he , my Constantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaving garlands with the lovely slave girl ! Ah , a thought hath seized me ! Why can not she who hath such power o'er him rouse up with noble words the brave heart slumbering in his breast ? I hear her light step in the hall . Ione , Ione ,  --  come hither ! I would speak with thee . Enter Ione . Ione . Io ne Your pleasure , dearest lady . Queen . Queen Zelneth Ione , thou knowest how I love thee for the brave deeds thou hast done . Thou hast given health unto my son , hath won him back to happiness . Thou hast conquered his aversion to the princess , and he will gladly wed her when the hour shall come . Is it not so ? Ione . Ione Dear lady , that I can not tell thee . He never breathes her name , and if I speak of her as thou hast bid me , he but sighs , and grows more sad ; and yet I trust , nay , I well know that when he sees her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as the princess will . Then do not grieve , but tell thy slave how she may serve thee . Queen . Queen Zelneth Oh , Ione , if thou couldst wake him from the quiet dream that seems to lie upon his heart . His country is in danger , and he should be here to counsel and command . Go , tell him this in thine own gentle words ; rouse him to his duty , and thou shalt see how brave a heart is there . Thou hast a wondrous power to sadden or to cheer . Oh , use it well , and win me back my noble Constantine ! Canst thou do this , Ione ? Ione . Ione I will ; and strive most earnestly to do thy bidding . But of what danger didst thou speak ? No harm to him , I trust ? Queen . Queen Zelneth The Turkish troops are now on their way to carry woe and desolation into Greece , and he , the prince , hath taken no part in the councils . His nobles mourn at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know not why , but some new happiness hath come to him , and all else is forgot . But time is passing . I will leave thee to thy work , and if thou art successful , thou wilt have won a queen 's most fervent gratitude . Adieu , my child ! Exit The Queen . Ione . Ione Yes , Constantine , thy brave heart shall awake ; and when thy country is once safe again , I 'll come to claim the love that now I feel is mine . Exit Ione. curtain . SCENE SEVENTH . Apartment in the palace . Enter Ione with sword and banner . Ione . Io ne Now may the gods bless and watch above thee , Constantine ; give strength to thine arm , courage to thy heart , and victory to the cause for which thou wilt venture all . Ah , could I but go with thee , thy shield would then be useless , for with mine own breast would I shelter thee , and welcome there the arrows meant for thee . He comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try my power o'er his heart . Enter Constantine . Con . Constantine What high thoughts stirring in thy heart hath brought the clear light to thine eye , Ione , the bright glow to thy cheek ? What mean these arms ? Wouldst thou go forth to meet the Turks ? Thy beauty would subdue them sooner than the sword thou art gazing on so earnestly . Ione . Ione Thou hast bade me speak , my lord , and I obey ; but pardon thy slave if in her wish to serve she seem too bold . Thy mother and thy subjects wonder at thy seeming indifference when enemies are nigh . Thine army waits for thee to lead them forth ; thy councillors sit silent , for their prince is gone . While grief and terror reign around , he is wandering ' mong his flowers , or listening to the music of his harp . Ah , why is this ? What hath befallen thee ? Thou art no longer pale and feeble , yet there seems a spell set on thee . Ah , cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . Con . Constantine I am no coward , Ione ; but there is a spell upon me . ' T is a holy one , and the chain that holds me here I can not break ,  --  for it is love . I have lost the joy I once took in my subjects and my native land , and am content to sit beside thee , and listen to the music of thy voice . Ione . Ione Then let that voice arouse thee . Oh , fling away the chain that keeps thee from thy duty , and be again the noble prince who thought but of his people . Oh , let me plead for those who sorrow for thy care , and here let me implore thee to awaken from thy dream and be thyself again she kneels . Con . Constant ine Oh , not to me ! Rise , I beseech thee , rise ! Thou hast led me to my duty ; I will obey thee . Ione . Ione I would have thee gird on thy sword , and with shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go forth and conquer like a king . Show those who doubt thee that their fears are false ,  --  that thou art worthy of their love . Lead forth thy troops , and save thy country from the woe that now draws nigh . Victory surely will be theirs when thou shalt lead them on . Con . Constantine Give me my sword , unfurl my banner , and say farewell . I will return victorious , or no more . Thy voice hath roused me from my idle but most lovely dream , and thy brave words shall cheer me on till I have won the honor of my people back . Pity and forgive my fault ; and ah , remember in thy prayers one who so passionately loves thee . Farewell ! farewell ! Kisses her robe and rushes out . Ione sinks down . curtain . SCENE EIGHTH . On the battlements . Ione , watching the battle . Ione . Io ne The battle rages fiercely at the city gates , and the messengers are fearful of defeat . I can not rest while Constantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray for him . Ah , I can see his white plume waving in the thickest of the fight , where the blows fall heaviest and the danger is most great . The gods guard him in this fearful hour ! See how small the brave band grows ; they falter and retreat . One blow now bravely struck may turn the tide of battle . It shall be done ! I will arm the slaves now in the palace , and lead them on to victory or death . We may win  --  and if not , I shall die in saving thee , Constantine ! Ione rushes out . curtain . SCENE NINTH . The castle terrace . Enter Constantine . Con . Constantine The victory is ours , and Greece again is free , thanks to the gods , and to the brave unknown who led on my slaves , and saved us when all hope seemed gone . Who could have been the fearless stranger ? Like an avenging spirit came the mysterious leader , carrying terror and destruction to the Turkish ranks . My brave troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought him , he was gone , and none could tell me where . He hath won my deepest gratitude , and the honor of all Greece for this brave deed . But where is Ione ? Why comes she not to bid me welcome home ? Ah , could she know that thoughts of her gave courage to my heart , and strength to my weak arm , and led me on that I might be more worthy her ! Ah , yonder comes the stranger ; he may not think to see me here . I will step aside . Constantine retires . Enter Ione in armor , bearing sword . Ione . Ione The gods be thanked ! the brave young prince hath conquered . From the flying Turk I won his banner back , and now my task is done . I must fling by this strange disguise and be myself again . I must bind up my wound and seek to rest , for I am faint and weary . Ah , what means this sudden dimness of mine eyes , this faintness  --  can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is for thee ! Ione faints ; Constantine rushes in . Con . Constantine Ione , Ione , look up and listen to the blessings of my grateful heart for all thou hast dared and done for me . So pale , so still ! Ah , must she die now I have learned to love so fervently and well ? Ione , awake ! Ione rouses . Ione . Ione Pardon this weakness ; I will retire , my lord . Con . Constantine Ah , do not leave me till I have poured out my gratitude . My country owes its liberty to thee : then let me here before thee offer up my country 's thanks , and tell thee what my heart hath striven to hide . Dear Ione , listen , I do beseech thee ! Kneels .

I have made thee weep , and every tear that falls reproaches me for my rash words . Forget them , and forgive me . Ione . Ione Ask not forgiveness of thy slave , my lord . ' T is I who have offended . And think not thus of Lady Irene , who in her distant home hath cherished tender thoughts of one whom all so honored . Think of her grief when she shall find thee cold and careless , and shall learn that he who should most love and cherish , deems her but a burden , and hates the wife whom he hath vowed to wed . Ah , think of this , and smile no more upon the slave who may not listen to her lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will obey thee , and seek to hide my sorrow within my lonely breast . Teach me to love thy mistress as I ought , and I will sacrifice each selfish wish , and be more worthy thy forgiveness , and a little place within thy heart . Trust me , I will speak no more of my unhappy love , and will seek thee only when thine own voice bids me come . The sunlight of thy presence is my truest joy , and banishment from thee the punishment my wilful heart deserves . Rest here , Ione , and weep for me no more . I am happy if thou wilt but smile again . Farewell , and may the gods forever bless thee ! Kisses her robe , and rushes out. curtain . SCENE TENTH . A gallery in the palace . Enter Ione with flowers . Ione . I one How desolate and dreary all hath grown ! The garden once so bright hath lost its beauty now , for Constantine no longer walks beside me . The palace rooms seem sad and lonely , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his harp is never heard . His pale face haunts me through all my waking hours , and his mournful eyes look on me in my dreams .

I hear a step . It is Rienzi . How shall I escape ,  --  my veil is in the garden ! He knows me and will discover all . Stay ! this curtain shall conceal me hides within the drapery . Enter Rienzi stealthily . Rienzi . Ri enzi How ! not here ? I told the messenger to meet me in the gallery that leads from the garden .

Ione Surely the gods have sent me to watch above thee , Constantine , and save thee from the danger that surrounds thee . I will haste to tell him all I have discovered . Yet , no ! Rienzi may escape , and I can charge none other with the crime . They meet near the haunted glen , and not a slave would follow even his brave prince to that dark spot . How can I aid him to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will go alone . Once have I dared the dangers of the way to save thy life , Constantine ; again I 'll tread the fearful path , and watch the traitors at their evil work . It shall be done ! I will dare all , and fail not , falter not , till thou who art dearer to me than life itself art safe again . Exit . curtain . SCENE ELEVENTH . A wood near the haunted glen . Ione shrouded in white glides in and conceals herself among the trees . Enter Rienzi . Rienzi Rienzi looking fearfully about . ' T is a wild and lonely spot , and ' t is said strange spirits have been seen to wander here . Why come they not ? ' T is past the hour , and I who stand undaunted when the fiercest battle rages round me , now tremble with strange fear in this dim spot . Shame on thee , Rienzi , there is nought to fear opens a scroll and reads . Here are their names , all pledged to see the deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must fall when foes like these are round him . Ione appears within the glen . Ha ! methought I heard a sound ! Nay , ' t was my foolish fancy . Spirits , I defy thee ! Ione . Ione Beware ! Beware ! Rienzi . Rienzi Ye gods , what 's that ? It was a voice . Rushes wildly towards the glen , sees Ione , drops scroll and dagger . ' T is a spirit ! The gods preserve me , I will not stay ! Exit in terror . Enter Ione . Ione . Io ne Saved ! saved ! Here are the traitors ' names , and here Rienzi 's dagger to prove my story true . Now hence with all my speed , no time is to be lost ! These to thee , Constantine , and joy unfailing to my own fond heart . Exit Ione. curtain . SCENE TWELFTH . Apartment in the palace . Enter Constantine . Con . Constantine This little garland of pale , withered flowers is all now left me of Ione , faded like my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet still I cherish it , for her dear hand wove the wreath , and her soft eyes smiled above the flowers as she twined them for my brow . Those happy days are passed ; she comes no more , but leaves me sorrowing and alone . And yet ' t is better so . The princess comes to claim my hand , and then ' twill be a sin to watch Ione , to follow her unseen , and listen to her voice when least she thinks me near . The gods give me strength to bear my trial worthily , and suffer silently the greatest sorrow life can give ,  --  that of losing her leans sadly upon the harp . Enter Ione . Ione . Io ne My lord  --  He does not hear me , how bitter and how deep must be his grief , when the voice that most he loves falls thus unheeded on his ear . My lord  --  Con . Constantine starting . And thou art really here ? Ah , Ione , I have longed for thee most earnestly . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and told the happiness thy presence brings . What wouldst thou with me ? Ione . Ione My lord , I have strange tidings for thine ear . Con . Constantine Oh , tell me not the Princess Irene hath arrived ! Ione . Ione Nay , ' t is not that I have learned the secret of a fearful plot against thy life . Rienzi , and a band of other traitors , seek to win thy throne and take the life of their kind prince . Con . Constantine It can not be , Ione ! They could not raise their hands ' gainst one who hath striven for their good . They can not wish the life I would so gladly have lain down to save them . Who told thee this , Ione ? I can not  --  no , I will not think they could prove so ungrateful unto their prince . Ione . Ione I can not doubt the truth of this , my lord , for one whose word I trust learned it , and followed to the haunted glen , there saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving behind this scroll whereon are all the traitors ' names . And this dagger ,  --  ' t is his own , as thou mayst see shows dagger and scroll . Con . Constant ine I can no longer doubt ; but I had rather have felt the dagger in my heart than such a wound as this . The names are few ; I fear them not , and will ere long show them a king may pardon all save treachery like this . But tell the name of thy brave friend who hath discovered this deep treason , and let me offer some reward to one who hath watched above me with such faithful care . Ione . Ione Nay , my lord , no gift , no thanks are needed . ' T is a true and loving subject , who is well rewarded if his king be safe . Con . Constantine Thou canst not thus deceive me . It was thine own true heart that dared so much to save my life . Oh , Ione , why wilt thou make me love thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow heavier to bear , the parting sadder still ? Ione . Ione Thou dost forget , my lord , I have but done my duty . May it please thee , listen to a message I bear thee from the queen . Con . Constantine Say on . I will gladly listen to thy voice while yet I may . Ione . Ione She bid me tell thee that tomorrow , ere the sun shall set , the Princess Irene will be here . Constantine starts and turns aside . Forgive me that I pain thee , but I must obey . Yet , farther : thy bride hath sent her statue as a gift to thee , and thou wilt find it in the queen 's pavilion . She bid me say she prayed thee to go look upon it , and remember there thy solemn vow . Con . Constantine Oh , Ione , could she send none but thee to tell me this ? To hear it from thy lips but makes the tidings heavier to bear . Canst thou bid me go , and vow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou bid me leave thee for a fate like this ? Ione . Ione My lord , thou art soon to be a king ; then for thy country 's sake , remember thy hand is plighted to the princess , and let no kindly thoughts of a humble slave keep thy heart from its solemn duty . Con . Constantine I am no king ,  --  ' t is I who am the slave , and thou , Ione , are more to me than country , home , or friends . Nay , do not turn away ,  --  think only of the love I bear thee , and listen to my prayer . Ione . Ione I must not listen . Hast thou so soon forgot the vow thou made that no word of love should pass thy lips ? Remember , ' t is a slave who stands before thee . Con . Constantine Once more thou shalt listen to me , Ione , and then I will be still forever . Thou shalt be my judge , thy lips shall speak my fate . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cherish her while my heart is wholly thine ? Wouldst thou ask me to pass through life beside her with a false vow on my lips , and , with words of love I do not feel , conceal from her the grief of my divided heart ? Must I give up all the bright dreams of a happier lot , and feel that life is but a bitter struggle , a ceaseless longing but for thee ? Rather bid me to forget the princess and bind with Love 's sweet chains the slave unto my side ,  --  my bride forever . Ione . Ione The slave Ione can never be thy bride , and thou art bound by solemn vows to wed the Princess Irene . My duty and thine honor are more precious than a poor slave 's love . Banish all thoughts of her , and prove thyself a faithful lord unto the wife who comes now trustingly to thee . Ask thine own heart if life could be a bitter pilgrimage , when a sacrifice like this had been so nobly made . A tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ,  --  oh , were not this a happier fate than to enjoy a short , bright dream of love , but to awake and find thy heart 's peace gone , thy happiness forever fled ; to see the eyes that once looked reverently upon thee now turned aside , and lips that spoke but tender words now whisper scornfully of broken vows thou wert not brave enough to keep . Forgive me , but I can not see the prince so false to his own noble heart . Cast off this spell ; forget me , and Irene shall win thee back to happiness . Con . Constantine Never ! All her loveliness can never banish the pure , undying love I bear to thee . Oh , Ione , canst thou doubt its truth , when I obey thee now and prove how great thy power o'er my heart hath grown ? Oh , let the sacrifice win from thee one gentle thought , one kind remembrance of him whose life thou hast made so beautiful for a short hour . And in my loneliness , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bear all for thy dear sake . And now farewell . Forgive if I have grieved thee , and at parting grant me one token to the silent love that henceforth must lie unseen within my heart . Farewell , Ione ! He kisses her . Ione Ione falling at his feet . Ah , forgive me ,  --  here let me seek thy pardon for the grief I have brought thee . May all the happiness that earth can bring be ever thine . But , if all others should forsake thee , in thine hour of sorrow remember there is one true heart that can not change . Oh , may the gods bless thee ! ' T is my last wish , last prayer weeps . Farewell ! Con . Constantine Stay ! I would claim from thee one little word which hath the power to brighten e'en my sorrow . I have never asked thee , for I thought my heart had read it in thine eyes that looked so kindly on me ; in the lips that spoke such gentle words of hope . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , dear Ione ? Ione . Ione I do , most fondly , truly love thee . Con . Constantine Ione , thy voice hath been a holy spell to win me to my duty . Thy love shall keep me pure and faithful , till we meet above . Farewell ! Ione . Ione Farewell !  --  and oh , remember how I have loved thee ; and may the memory of all I have borne for thee win thy pardon for any wrong I may have done thee . The princess will repay the grief the slave hath caused thy noble heart . Remember Ione , and be true . Exit . Con . Constantine Gone , gone , now lost to me forever ! Remember thee ! Ah , how can I ever banish thy dear image from this heart that now hath grown so desolate ? I will be true . None shall ever know how hard a struggle hath been mine , that I might still be worthy thee . Yes , Irene , I will strive to love thee , and may the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I give thee up ! Picks up a flower Ione has dropped , and puts it in his bosom and goes sadly out. curtain . SCENE THIRTEENTH . The Queen 's pavilion . A dark curtain hangs before an alcove . Enter Constantine . Con . Constantine The hour hath come when I shall gaze upon the form of her who hath cost so dark a shadow o'er my life . Beautiful and young , and blessed with all that makes her worthy to be loved , and yet I fear I have not taught my wilful heart the tenderness I ought . I fear to draw aside the veil that hides her from me , for I can not banish the sweet image that forever floats before mine eyes . Ione 's soft gaze is on me , and the lips are whispering , " I love thee ! " But I have promised to be true ,  --  no thoughts of her must lead me now astray . My fate is here approaches the curtain . Let me gaze upon it , and think gently of the wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear ? Courage , my heart ! He draws aside the curtain , and Ione , veiled , appears as a statue upon its pedestal . Another veil to raise ! How hard the simple deed hath grown . One last sweet thought of thee , Ione , and then I will no longer falter . He turns away and bows his head . Ione . Ione Constantine ! He starts , and gazes in wonder as the statue , casting aside the veil , comes down and kneels . Here at thy feet kneels thy hated bride ,  --  the " proud , cold princess , " asking thee to pardon all the sorrow she hath given thee . Ah , smile upon me , and forget Ione , who as a slave hath won thy love , but as the princess will repay it ,  --  forgive , and love me still ! Con . Constantine Thou , thou Irene ,  --  she whom I so feared to look upon ? Ah , no !  --  thou art Ione , the gentle slave . Say am I dreaming ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be borne ? Fling by thy crown and be Ione again . Irene Irene rising . Listen , Constantine , and I will tell thee all . I am Irene . In my distant home I learned thou didst not love me , and I vowed to win thy heart before I claimed it . Thus , unknown , the proud princess served thee as a slave , and learned to love thee with a woman 's fondest faith . I watched above thee that no harm should fall ; I cheered and gladdened life for thee , and won the heart I longed for . I knew the sorrow thou wouldst feel , but tried thy faith by asking thee to sacrifice thy love and keep thine honor stainless . Here let me offer up a woman 's fondest trust and most undying love . Wilt thou believe , and pardon mine offence ? Kneels again before him . Con . Constantine Not at my feet , Irene !  --  ' t is I who should bend low before thee , asking thy forgiveness . For all thou hast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every loving thought , all I can lay before thee is a fond and faithful heart , whose reverence and love can never die , but through the pilgrimage of life shall be as true and tender as when I gave it to the slave Ione embraces Irene .
