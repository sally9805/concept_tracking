txt Our returns from Connecticut came in slowly , but are very complete . Though the heavy rains of Sunday made the roads nearly impassable , and the up-country towns were , many of them , not heard from till . 2 A. M. , wo give the ? figures from all but ten of the 166 tc.wns . As the figures stand , Gov . JEwitu.i. is fairly ahead of the field , and he will secure a re-election on a popular vote . Up to the present time , he has gained slightly on tho vote of last year , beside overcoming a scattering vote of some two thousand , nearly all of which is drawn from the Republicans , being cast for GILLETTE , the Temperance candidate . who has shown unexpected strength . The Labor Reform vote has not amounted to anything , and the returns will afford cold comfort to Judge DAMS . The Republicans of Connecticut have struggled this year against unusual odds . The Democrats formed their platform and . chose their candidate with special reference to making a division in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep their own voters together , and hoped to draw off enough of their opponents by the dodge of the " nw departure " to destroy the very slight advantage obtained last year . In this scheme trey were aided , directly and indirectly , by- the Anti-Grant factionists , who felt that a Republican victory in Connecticut would be fatal to the Cincinnati movement . Messrs .

In spite of these obstacles to a full Republican vote , there is not the slightest indication of any defection from the party on national issues . The vote for JEWELL will be within a fraction of that cast last year , while if all the Republicans who voted the Temperance ticket were added to his majority . it would be nearly as great as that of President GRANT in 1868 . The Legislature will be largely Republican . We feel justified in calling attention to our returns of the election . They form a fitting conclusion to our full and accurate account of the canvass , as it has progressed , and . are an earnest of the complete political news we shall continue to furnish our readers during the Presidential campaign , and which , we may justly say , will make the TIMES indispensable to all persons interested in politics , to whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
