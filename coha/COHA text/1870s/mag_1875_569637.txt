ARTICLE IV. - MATTIIEW ARNOLD 'S " LITERATURE AND DOGMA . " Literature arid Dogma . An Essay toward a better apprehension of the Bible . By MATTHEW ARNOLD , DCL . Boston : James IR . Osgood &amp; Co . WITH the professed aim of this book we must declare ourselves to be in hearty sympathy . Matthew Arnold is certainly not the only , nor the first man that has seen the necessity of some religious re-adjustments , to meet the exigences of the age and of coming ages-re-adjustments not of fundamental and essential truths-these are " the same yesterday , to-day , and forever , " - but in our modes of statement and in our organic arrangements . Systems of religious thought and modes of ecclesiastical organization which to a great extent originated , or at least derived their present foi 'm and spirit , from dark ages of prevailing ignorance , superstition , and spiritual despotism , can not be reasonably presumed to be well suited to an age of higher culture , both in the direction of literature and of science , than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see-must see-that if Christianity is to stand up as a controling power in the midst of the intense illumination of such an age , it must be by completely divesting herself of all those forms of thought and government with which she has allied herself in the dark and gloomy ages through which she has made her way . The assumption is not an unreasonable one , that in her progress through these ages , she may have absorbed into herself more or less of what Mr. Arnold calls " extra belief " not pertaining to her as she came from her divine author ; and that that " extra belief " obscures her great essential truths , and places her under a necessity of defending much that is indefensible , and in attempting to defend which she must be easily vanquished by her enemies . If she is to stand and be mighty in an age of literature and science and culture , it must be by putting off all these old and tattered and filthy garments , // in which benighted men and ages have arrayed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which she was originally arrayed . The question really and fairly at issue between Christianity and those enemies who assail it from the side of culture and science , is not whether the system of speculative thought relative to the topics with which Christianity is conversant that has come down to us from the times of Augustine , or that ecclesiastical system which grew up in the declining period of the Roman Empire , can be successfully defended ; but whether the religion of the Bible can be defended . No man has any claim to be comAdered a true friend of the Christian cause who will not recognize this distinction , and who will not unite his best endeavors with those of all good men of all parties , in an effort to eliminate from Christianity , as it now appears before the world , all foreign elements which have been incorporated with it in bygone ages of darkness and ignorance , and present it Founder . Mr. Arnold professes to have this end only in view in the book we have in hand . This avowed aim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity of our day is a necessity of the nineteenth century . It is a condition of its successful vindication against the assaults of its modern enemies , and of its being accepted by those populations of the world to whom it is now cifered by the Christian missionary , and of its prevalence and beneficent power in coming ages . So far we have no controversy with our author . But has he succeeded in the re-adjustment which he has pro . posed and attempted ? We propose in this Essay to answer this question , and very freely to point out the very grave and , as it seems to us , fatal errors into which he has fallen . That we may do this justly and fairly , it is incumbent on us first to give attention to the central idea of the book , for it has a central idea , of which the author is never unmindful . It is very fairly indicated by the title , " Literature and Dogma . " It may be thus stated , that the language of the Bible is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to be treated as the language of the people and not of system-makers and dogmatists ; and // that whenever this rule is violated great injustice is done to the book , and its teachings are likely to be greatly perverted and distorted . The correctness of this position we can not for one moment hesitate to concede . The Bible may contain the elements out of which a system of theology can be constructed . But if it does contain such materials , they are not systematically stated in logical form . It is not a hook of dogmatic propositions and terms employed with techuical accuracy . Its forms of presentation are popular and concrete , and its language is that of the people . On this point , therefore , we think no intelligent advocate of the Bible will have any controversy with our author . We meet the author , then , on his own chosen ground of literary criticism . As a critic , has he dealt fairly and wisely with the Bible ? In order to answer this question , let us first examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " righteousness . " In dealing with these two terms , the author says , " If there be any thing with which metapbysics have nothing to do , and where a plain man , without skill to walk in the arduous paths of abstruse reasoning , may yet find himself at home , it is religion . This is quite true . And yet if that p lain man , say David or Isaiah , has written out an account of his religious experience and life , in his own plain way , it may be a very important qualification for the just criticism of that composition that the critic should be a sound metaphysician. it may still be true that Mr. Arnold 's being " so notoriously deficient in every thing of that kind " may be a disqualification , and not , as he claims , a qualification for the task of literary criticism he has undertaken . He is bound fairly to meet the question , what did these writers mean by the words " God " and " righteousness ? " They were no dogmatists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ; and if we would know what they meant by such words , we must inquire what are the universal intuitions of the human soul in relation to God and moral duty ? No man can answer this question without metaphysical speculation and abstruse reasoning , and no man who has not so qualified himself can be a sound critic of the theology and morality of the Bible . // Mr. Arnold says , " morality " represents for everybody a thoroughly definite and ascertained idea . " And yet it can not be denied that men 's ideas of morality have differed through as wide a range as their ideas of God . In no one thing have the teachings of the Bible done more for mankind than by rendering their idea of moral duty clear , definite , and comprehensive . At the present time , the moral teaching of the Bible is not more accurately comprehended than its teachings respecting God . The morality of the Bible is like its idea of God , progressive through all the ages over which divine revelation extends , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perfectly right in maintaining that " righteousness is a special object of Bible religion . " It is its whole object , its sole aim . But he fails greatly when he asserts that religion is " conduct , " and " conduct is tbree-foarths of bft . " If religion is conduct , then conduct is the whole of life . Our author makes conduct to respect the regulation of all those appetites which have reference to the preservation of life and the reproduction of the race . But if religion is conduct , then conduct is the regulation of all our appetites , desires , and propensities . It is true , religion does not teach *stheties , but it does prescribe the ends and aims to which *sthetie culture is to be consecrated , and the limit to which , in the case of each mdivideal , it may be pursued . The law of morality is truly enunciated by the Apostle : * Whether , therefore , ye eat or ( Irink , or whatever ye do , do all to the glory of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human well-being by the creations of the artist than in any other way , religion prescribes such a use of that man 's life as a high moral duty , as truly as it forbids him to waste his talents in sensuality and debauchery . All , therefore , which our author says of religion having reference to " three-fourths of life " falls to the ground . Righteousness is not the mere regulation of the appetites which relate to selfpreservation and the reproduction of the race . It suggests the only true aim of all life , and furnishes the proper impelling power to all our activities . fought , not only teaches me to restrain my appetites within the limits of moderation , but to love my neighbor as myselg and fully to exert my active powers in efforts to promote universal well.being . I ought , is an original // intuition of human reason , informed , enlightened , exalted by the teachings of Moses and the Prophets , and perfected by the wondrous words and still more wondrous deeds and voluntarily endured sufferings of the Man Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both by not apprehending morality as an original intuition of reason , and by not appreciating its maturity and completion in the life and death of the Christ of God . He has drawn a distinction between morality and religion , but in this he again fails . Morality he makes to be mere ethics , practical duty . Religion is " ethics heightened , enkindled , lit up by feeling . " He quotes many examples of the use of language to sustain this distinction . To economize space , we must make one serve as a specimen of them all . He quotes Cicero as saying , " Hold off from sensuality , for if you give yourself up to it , you will find yourself unable to think of any thing else . " " This , " he says , " is morality . " In contrast with this he quotes our Lord 's words , " Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God , " as a specimen of religion . We willingly accept the two examples as fairly exemplifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly indicated the difference between them ? Is it merely a difference in the amount of feeling manifested in the two cases ? We can have very little confidence in the criticism of the man that thinks so . The real difference is that Cicero presents morality in its merely human and earthly relations . Jesus presents morality as sustained and exalted by the known will and emotions , and moral authority of God . The former is morality as an atheist might look upon it ; the latter is morality as it must ever be viewed by the devout worshipper of the God of the Bible . This conducts us to the true distinction . Religion is morality sustained , exalted , and enforced by the devout worship of the only living and true God as revealed in the Bible . This brings us to examine the soundness of Mr. Arnold 's criticism in treating the word " God . " This is certainly the most remarkable feature of the book . In his treatment of this topic , Mr. Arnold manifests a certain animosity and bitterness not quite easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems that // on some occasion , notorious to the English public , but of no special interest to ourselves , the Bishop of Gloucester had spoken of the " blessed truth that the God of the Universe is a person . " This utterance of the Right Reverend Bishop seems to have excited in Mr. Arnold 's mind a very remarkable degree of anger and contempt , which so pervade the book , as almost to suggest the suspicion that the book was written to give them utterance . Indeed , we see abundant evidence that Mr. Arnold is maddened and rendered desperate by the arrogant assumptions of the English hierarchy , and yet , like his father before him , so dazzled by its splendors as to be blind to the chains that bind him , and to the iron that enters into his souL We would like to join the distinguished son of iDr . Thomas Arnold , in a good hearty protest against the hideous usurpations of the English Established Church . But of our enjoying this pleasure we see no prospect . He says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rise and its organizations , out of sight altogether . Much as is made of them , they are comparatively unimportant . " While this is his view of that matter , it is in on r heart to say to him , IDear critic , keep your temper . Things are quite as well in that direction as you have any right to expect they will be . Under the present organization of the English Church it is not probable that her dignitaries will either be more wise or less arrogant than at present . You have not nearly so much cause to be angry on the present occasion as you seem to think you have . It will not be denied that the word " God , ' * in the Old Testament and the New , is the language , not of dogmatism , but of literature , poetry , eloquence . But this doth not forbid the inquiry , what does it mean ? for surely it has meaning . And the only true criticism is that which can help us to answer this question rightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , which must guide us in this inquiry , and such a knowledge of metaphysics as will qualify us to understand these laws , we must call to our aid on this occasion . We are quite aware that David and Isaiah are not metaphysical writers , but for that very reason it is all the more certain that they have used language in accord . ance with those laws of thought which underlie all human knowing and believing . // un examining this point it is fair , first , to notice the author 's own definition of the word God as vised in the Bible . And yet we ought not to say definition , he does not propound it as a definition ; indeed , he would be quite shocked at such a suggestion . He proposes that , in order to disentangle our religion from all the cavils of unbelief , we limit our notion of God to the conception of " an enduring power , not ourselves , that makes for righteousness . " This conception he claims is real and solid , and capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this restricted view of God , science will go with us , and the schism between religion and science will be healed . He admits that " the people of Israel came , by tradition , emotion , imagination , to attach more than this plain sense " to the words and phrases by which God is described . But this plain , restricted sense he thinks will fully answer our purpose for bringing the Bible before the mind of the world as a power for righteousness . And he would advise us , in order to secure for that book its legitimate influence in the world , to confine our conception of God to this cold , narrow , and restricted definition . This , according to Mr. Arnold , is the result of literary criticism applied to the Bible . Is it fair , is it wise , is it just criticism ? In our ignorance , we had supposed that a true criticism must sympathise with the warmth , the glow , the fervor of literature . But such criticism as this is colder than the driest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the anatomist . The author says , " by tradition , by emotion , by imagination , the Hebrews no doubt came to attach more than this plain sense to these phrases . " We wonder when they " came to " it ? and when the " tradition " commenced which betrayed them into such folly ; just such " Aberglaube " for all the world as the Bishops of Winchester and Gloucester preach in our degenerate days ! If the Bible must be treated thus , in order to make it a book capable of defence and perpetuity , it is surely no book for plain men . To interpret and defend it requires more power of abstruse thought than all the dignitaries of the English Church lay claim to . A plain man could more easily master all the intricacies of metaphysical theology , than appreciate the application of such a criticism to the Psalms of David . // Let us try it upon an example . " As a father pitieth his children so the Lord pitieth them that fear him ; for He knoweth our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us read this according to the conception of our critic . As a father pitieth his children , so " an enduring Power , not ourselves , " pitieth them that fear it : for it knoweth our frame , it remembereth that we are dust . We use the impersonal pronoun of necessity , in order to carry out the conception of our author . For if we use " He " we at once invest " an enduring Power not ourselves " with personality , and reinstate that idea of the personality of God which Mr. Arnold thinks it so important to eliminate . Indeed , we do not eliminate it by using the impersonal pronoun , for an impersonal Power can neither pity nor know . It is impossible to reduce this grand utterance of the Psalmist within the limits of this restricted conception of God , without converting it into absurdity and nonsense . Yet this example from the Old Testament is only one of thousands which might be cited . Such criticism would convert a very large portion of the book into absurd and meaningless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sound , just criticism . We might as well subject the glorious human form to the dissecting knife of the anatomist , in order to secure its presentation in its own proper beauty , as to give the Bible into such hands to secure for it the reverence and submission of an age of culture . We may be quite sure those men of science who assail the notion of a personal God with undisguised antipathy , do not ask and will not accept at our hands any such enervated , emasculated Bible . They must be converted to a humble faith in that God of Israel whom the Psalmist adored and loved , or they will reject the Bible because it draws all its inspiration and power from a doctrine which seems to them inconsistent with their systems of science . Let us , if possible , speak the whole truth in reference to this matter . That which offends in the doctrine of a personal God , is that worship , that affectionate and reverential adoration , that trust in a Heavenly Father , that prayer to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dependence , that devout belief in a creating and ruling God , of which the Bible is full , and which can no more be eliminated from the religion // of the Bible than veins and arteries can be eliminated from the human body without destroying life . Criticism never attempted a more hopeless task than that of rendering the Bible acceptable to men who reject and despise the doctrine that the God of the Universe is a Person. , 7 But Mr. Arnold tells us , we are to remember that those writers who applied such language to God were poets and orators , and therefore when under the influence of emotion used personification of course . All this is mere anthropomorphism . Goethe is quoted as saying " Man never k*wws how anthropomorphic he is " Anthropomorphic , indeed , Israel was , if he believed in no personal God . He prayed to a power which he did not believe to possess any personal attributes , worshipped it , built altars , and the tabernacle in the wilderness , and the temple at Jerusalem , and solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . We are told they were poets , orators , and under the influence of strong emotion at the clear perception that " there is an enduring power not ourselves that works for righteousness . " The men of these modern ages have come to the knowledge of another enduring power , not ourselves , that works for the order , and harmony , and perpetuity of the material universe . And there have been in these ages poets , orators , and a great deal of emotion about this newly-found power . But men do not pray to the force of gravity , they do not sing hymns to it , they do not rear altars and temples for its worship , they do not talk of " serving it " and " pleasing it . ' Why was Israel , why are all men so " anthropomorphic " in speaking of God , even Goethe himself ? so that when he stood on the top of Brocken the words which rose naturally to his lips were , " Lord , what is man that thou mindest him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is Saul also among the prophets ? " Has Goethe united with the " Bishops of Winchester and Gloucester " in confessing " the blessed truth that the God of the universe is a person . " This rank and irrepressible growth of all humanity has a root somewhere , and it is time we make an honest effort to find it . This universal anthropomorphism is a phenomenon to be accounted for . And we shall not be deterred from an effort to account for it by any solemn protest that Israel was not skilled in metaphysical // speculations . Israel was human and used language according to the same laws which underlie all human speech . We must discover what those laws are , or we can never soundly criticise the theological literature of Jew or Gentile . l*XThy then did Israel always invest " the Eternal " with personal attributes , not only in his eloquence , his poetry , but in his architecture , in his laws , in his armies , in the whole practical life of the nation ? And why in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ages done the same ? One answer only can satisfy this inquiry . Man-not Israel - not the Aryan-not any particular race  --  but man , sees in effect cause , in adaptation of means to ends design , in design purpose , character , personality , in nature God , in himself a being made in the image of God . Such an intuition of God explains the reason why men worship him , and pray to him , and build altars and temples and offer holocausts to him . Such an intuition unclouded by superstition , informed and exalted by the influence of men who had stood in the very presence-chamber of divinity , is the inspiring , life-giving principle of the Old Testament and the New . It was this that made the Psalmist exclaim , " As a father pitieth his children , so the Lord pitieth them that fear him . " It was this that made even Goethe , with all his contemptuous unbelieg exclaim , in a moment of honest emotion in presence of nature , " Lord , what is man that thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thou visitest him . " In that moment the great high priest of godless culture made an honest utterance of the voice of nature that spoke within him . There is an anthropomorphism , not only in the Bible , but in all literature . But it furnishes no explanation of the personal attributes ascribed to God in the Bible . It is itself a phenomenon needing to be explained . We are told the Greeks , the Romans , the Egyptians personified the productive powers and forces in nature . But why did they ? Because they saw in nature every where the manifestation of personal attributes , mind , soul , will , character . Our minds manifest their powers and workings only through bodily senses and organs . Therefore it is that we conceive of God and all other spiritual beings anthropomorphically . If it were possible so to instruct and // train the human mind , that this intuition of mind in nature should no longer exist , literature would cease to be anthropomorphic . It would become as atheistic as the coldest materialist could desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the most hopeless task that science has ever undertaken . Goethe , we have seen , could not educate himself out of the intuition of God in nature . At this stage of our discussion it is perfectly apparent why Mr. Arnold fell into error when he attempted to draw the line between morality and religion . God , he assumed , is the mere symbol of emotion , a mere creation of the imagination under the influence of strong feeling . When Jesus said , " Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God , " Mr. Arnold assumes that it was of course not to be supposed that Jesus believed in a personal God at all , but that he was speaking under the influence of strong feeling , and therefore personified the " enduring power , not ourselves , that works for righteousness . ' This " religion is morality touched with feeling . " Grant to a man who proposes to apply criticism to the elucidation of the Bible , the liberty of making such assumptions at pleasure , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a very dull man if he can not make any thing out of any thing . Yet such an assumption as this Mr. Arnold smuggles into the very first chapter of his book , without even an attempt at proof . He does it almost " on the sly . " Verily , this is the man who is going to make our Bible presentable to an age of culture and science , by the application of sound criticism . For our part , we must heartily join with the Bishops of Winchester and Gloucester in exulting in the " blessed truth that the God of the universe is a person , " - certainly , that the God of the Bible is . But after all Mr. Arnold tells us that science will never receive this conception of God , because it can not be verified . What then does the author mean by verification ? Does he mean , to test by experiment ? This mode of verification is by no means possible through all the realms of matter . By an induction founded on observation and experiment we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the slightest hesitation to innumerable substances which we have not examined // and which it is impossible we ever should examine . What is our authority for doing so ? Not experiment , for experiment we can not have . Our only authority for applying the law to cases which we have not examined is dependent on an assumption which the nature of the human mind and the nature of things compel us to make , that the universe is made according to a consistent and rational plan . Such is the undoubting confidence with which the universal human race receives that assumption , that without the least misgiving we apply that law to the very limits of the material universe . Yet any verification of the law outside the range of observation and experiment , other than this universal and necessary assumption , is in the nature of the case impossible . We can have no verification of any truth , except to reduce it to some one of those necessary and universal assumptions which are the criteria of all truth . This very law of induction is itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can not help assuming , that the universe is constructed according to a consistent and rational plan and consistent and rational plan in the creation is an attribute of a personal God . It is rational mind in nature . If we have not rational mind , a reasonable plan in nature , it not only follows that we have no God , but no science as well . Induction becomes impossible , science perishes , and the universe becomes a chaos . The rejection of the intuition of God for the want of verification is a virtual denial of mental or moral science . Take as an example moral accountability . All moral science rests on the assumption that men are morally free and accountable for their conduct . But how shall this assumption be " verified ? " Not certainly by observation or experiment . Observation and experiment can decide nothing of the matter . In one only way can this foundation principle of all moral science and moral law be verified . It is an original intuition-an assumption as inevitable to a human being as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a criterion of truth , then are there no criteria of truth : moral science and moral law are mere chiineras . The intuition of a personal God in nature needs no verification any more than any other necessary category of the human mind . There is nothing for it but that men // of science , meaning mere physical science , must live in ignorance and darkness , respecting God , till they can escape that mental narrowness which disqualifies them to accept any truth which can not be verified by the coarse processes of weight and measurement . We come , therefore , to the conclusion that the Bible , in respect to the law of righteousness and the conception of a personal God , needs not for its defence , and can not without committing suicide accept , such help as Mr. Matthew Arnold proffers . But our task is by no means yet done . Our author not only proposes to relieve the Bible of the doctrine of a personal God , but of all responsibility for any claim to either prophecy or miracle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our readers who may not have read the hook , or otherwise become acquainted with the author 's ideas , it must seem a puzzle how any one can wholly reject the supernatural , and yet claim to appear as the advocate of the Bible . Yet precisely such a claim does Mr. Arnold seek to establish for himself and his book . Some explanation is , therefore , at this point necessary , of the author 's ideas , in order that our criticisms upon them may be intelligible . That many supernatural occurrences are narrated in the Bible , our author of course admits . But these are to be set down to the ignorance , the superstition , and consequent blunders of the writers . No doubt the authors of the four gospels have ascribed many stupendous miracles to Jesus himself But it was their mistake . Jesus never wrought any miracles , or pretended to work any . In his conversations with his disciples he even denied plainly enough that he possessed any miraculous powers . The disciples reported after the crucifixion that he had risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven in their sight . But there was never any foundation for such reports . They were mere rumors , that grew by gradual accretions , during the first century , and were taken up and recorded by the four evangelists in their books , but without any sufficient authority . These reports were generally received as true by the Christians of the first age . and by after ages ; but Jesus was in no way responsible for their origin . The age was superstitious and credulous , and received with ready credulity any marvels respecting so wonderful a person , // and thus the Church 's belief in the supernatural in all ages of her history originated . So of prophecy : Jesus never believed in any promised , predicted Messiah , much less ever pretended to be such himself . All such ideas were mere Jewish superstition . There were no prophecies of Christ in the Old Testament , nor prophecies of any thing else . The whole notion of prophecy is a delusion , for which we are to hold the Jews of the later ages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , if we would give it any chance of retaining its influence in the a0es of culture . Such are the results to which the author thinks we are in cvitably conducted by the application of a just criticism to the Bible . And he professes to believe , and we suppose does really believe , that the Bible , as thus expurgated , will retain its power over the present and coming ages , as the Book of religion . Our question returns upon us . Is this criticism sound and just ? Are its results to be accepted ? Has Arnold the son legitimately attained these results , by applying to Hebrew his . tory and literature , those same principles of historical criticism which Arnold the father applied , with results so decisive , to Roman history and literature ? It is important here to remark , that the author 's ideas just explained are logically consequent on that denial of a personal Creator on which we have already commented . It is a great mistake of the defenders of the Bible to employ themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forms of recent scepticism are legitimate growths from one and the same root . That root is Sadducceism , the denial of angel or spirit , or any form of mind , personality , independent of a corporeal organization . Of course , the existence of the human soul after the dissolution of the body , and of a personal Creator , is alike rejected . If no Creator then no creation . Hence comes a so-called science which " finds in matter the promise and potency of every form of life . " But a miracle , say the feeding of five thousand men with a few loaves of bread , is a creation . If , therefore , a personal Creator and a creation are denied , then miracles must be denied also . On the other hand , admit a personal Creator and a creation , and no man can tell us when the exer // tion of creative power ceased . It remains a reasonable expectation that it will be exerted whenever , in the thought of an allwise and all-powerful Creator , the best good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought , and each is within itself complete and consistent . The one is , no personal Creator , no creation , and of course no miracle , no supernatural . The other is , a personal Creator , a creation of the heavens and the earth , and of course a miracle in no wise improbable whenever an emergency shall arise requiring it . Of course , when Mr. Arnold suggested in his first chapter to eliminate from the Bible the conception of a personal God , he sapped the very foundation of a supernatural religion , and of course necessitated all the other sweeping negations of his book . But Mr. Arnold does not openly employ this premise , which he has so artfully sought to establish in his first chapter , in his argument against miracles . Indeed , he professes that it is not his object to argue against miracles at all . But he assures us that faith in them is declining , and is sure to decline more and more ; and advises us that , inasmuch as belief in the supernatural is doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a part of our religion , lest men should renounce our religion on account of findino it in so distasteful an alliance . He even approaches the subject with a certain degree of reverence . He admits that " miracles , when fully believed , are felt by men in general to be a source of authority . " To deny this " is absurd . " And absurd enough it is . But it is an absurdity into which most of the assailants of miracles rush with reckless haste . He also admits that " it is almost impossible to exaggerate the proneness of the human mind to take miracles as evidence , and to seek for miracles as evidence ; and the extent to which religion , and religion of a true and admirable kind , has been and is still held in connection with reliance on miracles . " These two admissions strike to the very root of the matter , or at least would have done if the last had been a little more accurate in its expression ; if instaad of saying " has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he had said what the truth requires , that it has gained a reception in the world against the most bitter and relentless opposition , through the authority of // the miracles which its preachers claimed to perform as an attestation of it as a revelation from God . How important these admissions are we shall see as we proceed . After having made these admissions , which surely decency demanded of one who claims a i ) lace among the most zealous admirers and defenders of the Bible , he opens an attack upon the miracles of the Bible , which in point of insidious unfairness and utter want of candor is unsurpassed by any utterance of unbelief which has fallen under our notice . He begins by an effort to confound and mingle together in a common class the miracles of the New Testament and those of the Papal Church in all subsequent ages , and weakly tries to conceal from view the obvious and palpable differences in the two cases by which the miracles of the New Testament are so grandly distinguished . He pronounces the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miracles of the New Testament and all other pretensions to miraculous power , mere extravagances , ' ' without one word of argument to make good his assertion against the authority of so sound a thinker . It is simply Matthew Arnold 's contemptuous assertion , against Archbishop Whately 's argument ; a position which a son of Dr. Thomas Arnold would not have been very willing to occupy if he had been a modest man . He then presents to us this alternative . " One of two things must be made out in order to place either the Bible miracles alone , or the Bible miracles and the miracles of the Catholic Church with them in a class by themselves , - either they must be shown to have arisen at a time eminently unfavorable to amplification , arid the production of legend , or they must be shown to be recoi-ded in documents of an eminently historic mo ( le of birth and publication . " Our author knows well enough that in respect to the miracles of the Roman Catholic Church neither of these things can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would simply demand faith in the miracles of the Church on the authority of the Church herself , while lie rests the authority of the Church on the miracles of the Bible . Our author has made no contribution to the literature of the subject by suggesting the necessity of making out the two things which he insists on . The defenders of Christianity have recognized this // EJan. , necessity for ages . Precisely these two things they have made out by a chain of argument which is not to be broken or weakened by the two or three flimsy and unfairly selected examples which our author has adduced . No Christian writer of any authority would regard the miracle of the falling down of the walls of Jericho , standing by itself as sustained by satisfactory historic evidence . For the most part , the miracles of the Old Testament are received by the modern believer on account of their relation to the New Testament . It is difficult to see how a man of Mr. Arnold 's reading could have cited that case without a consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold is too well informed not to know that no intelligent advocate of Christianity ever thought of constrncting an argument for miracles out of such an example as the miracle which occurred at the martyrdom of Stephen .. There are many narrations of miracles which we all admit would have no validity as evidence , when taken by themselves , and which Christians receive only because of their historic connection with other miracles which are supported by high historic evidence . A man who will not see , or seeing will not acknowledge , the ( listinction in this regard between the miracle last mentioned and the restoring the blind man to sight ( John 9th ) , or the healing of the lame man at the Beautiful gate of the temple , is hardly to be argued with . We do not care to waste words on such an antagonist . Yet precisely this unfairness and want of candor is apparent in every example which Mr. Arnold cites for the purpose of breaking down the distinction between the miracles of the Bible and those of the Roman Catholic Church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this part of the subject . All this will pass for nothing with candid and thoughtful men , and for such only we write . Indeed , we should have let it pass without any notice , but that it seemed right that it should be made apparent to what extent Mr. Arnold , while professing himself to be among the most reverent advocates of the Bible , assimilates himself in spirit and aim to the bitterest of its enemies . The only point of his argument against the credibility of miracles which is any real contribution to the literature of the // subject is his attempt to account for the origin and early existence of the reports of miracles , without admitting their truth . It is precisely here that all the efforts of unbelief have failed in their onset upon the Christian argument . Here is the testimony , here are the facts . How can the existence of this testimony , these facts , be accounted for , on the supposition that the miracles were never wrought ? Precisely this weak place in the argument of unbelief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has accomplished much . Has he succeeded ? His explanation of the matter is , that these reports of marvelous and miraculous events grew up by slow and gradual accretions , as tradition was busy in passing the story from one credulous man to another , till finally they became incorporated in the books which have transmitted them to our times , just as all the other legendary literature of the world has originated ; that there really is no reason why we should repose any more confidence in the marvelous stories of the Bible , say of the New Testament , than in those of Grecian and Roman history , or those of the early and mediaeval church ; that literature shows that such marvelous stories are a normal product of human nature , and that wherever we meet them , we are to refer them to the same causes and treat them as alike unworthy of confidence . This is Mr. Arnold 's view stated in its full strength . All the plausibility of this argument is derived from assuming that things are alike , and therefore are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore belong to different classes . The miracles of the Bible , for example the resurrection of Christ , are not like the marvels and wonders of Greek and Roman mythology or of ancient history . In respect to these latter no one pretends to know where or when they originated . no historical witness is in any way responsible for them , the authors who have transmitted them to us do not pretend themselves to believe them , nobody ever had any motive for disbelieving them , or calling them in question ; they have simply floated along on the stream of tradition , buoyed up by the love of the marvelous in human nature . On the other hand , we know when and where the story of Christ 's resurrec // tion originated : it is solemnly vouched for as a fact by persons living at the time , intimately acquainted with Jesus , and personally active in the events with which the story is connected . On its reception as a fact or its rejection as a falsehood , depended the result of the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and learning , and influence were all on the side of those who disbelieved it ; to prevent its spread the most bitter persecution of those who propagated the story was every where resorted to ; and yet from the very time and place of the alleged crucifixion and resurrection , a religions revolution commenced , proceeding everywhere upon the belief of this miracle as a fact , a revolution which in a brief period overturned the religions of the civilized world , and established in their stead a new religion , which everywhere held as the fundamental article of its creed , that Jesus Christ rose from the dead the third day . To say , then , that these miracles of the Bible are like the marvels and wonders of Livy and Tacitus , or like the prodigies of any Pagan mythology , is not argument , it is not criticism ; it is simply confounding things that essentially differ ; it is perverting history , misstating facts , to help the reader to draw false conclusions by furnishing him with false premises . The distinctions we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mere extravagances , " but historic facts of solemn weight and importance . Neither are the Christian miracles like those of the IRoman Catholic Church . When these latter miracles gained currency , they were for the most part , if not without an exception , backed by the faith of the multitude and the power and influence of the governing and influential classes : nobody had any motive for calling them in question ; they were alleged in support of a religion which all believed in and desired to exalt and honor ; in short , they have come down to ns unsustained by any historic argument . XYhat Mr. Arnold expects to gain for the cause of truth by placing events so entirely unlike in the same class and insisting that they are due to the same causes , it is not possible for us to discern . The anthor says : " To pick Scripture miracles one by one to pieces is an odious and repulsive task . " We should think so , to a man that sincerely reverences the Bible . But to throw discredit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserting their similarity in character to reports of the marvelous from which they do in point of fact differ in all their most essential and characteristic features , does not seem to be , to our author , " an odious and repulsive task " at all . He does it with a will , and expects it to be received as sound , enlightened criticism , and very helpful to the Christian cause . Perhaps we have given more space to these really stale arguments against miracles than we ought . We could not well pass them unnoticed . It is far more important to our purpose to remark that the author 's view of the subject entirely fails to account for the facts which certainly did occur . There is no escaping the fact that , commencing at Jerusalem very soon after the crucifixion , within a period of thirty-five years , the religion greatly prevailed , and Christian churches were extensively established over a large part of the Roman empire . Tacitus ' account of the condition of Christianity at Rome at the time of the burning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeniable that it went on , spreading with such irresistible power that in a comparatively short time it became the religion of the empire . How is this to be explained ? What was it that gave the name of Jesus Christ such power from Jerusalem to Greece , and Italy , and Gaul , and Britain ? Accordiug to Mr. Arnold , there was no miracle . These reports were all after-thoughts of his ignorant and superstitious disciples , growing up by little and little , as the story of Jesus was reported orally from man to man and from country to country . The resurrection was only an incredible story springing up and gaining currency in the same way , a product of pious fraud , excited enthusiasm , and love of the marvelous . Jesus never pretended to be the Christ , or to be a fu-lfillment of ancient prophecy at all . He was crucified as a malefactor , and buried in a malefactor 's grave , and this was the end of his career . He never had any means of influence even on the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any pretensions to miraculous powers , which might have been set up for him during his lifetime , if unsustained by facts , must have provoked the hatred and contempt of the leading classes , who were certainly his enemies , and made them feel that he deserved his cruel and ignominious // death , as a deceiver of the people . We do not hesitate to affirm that had these been the facts , his reputation even at Jerusalem would never have recovered from the ignominy of that malefactor 's death . His name would not have been heard in the speech of his countrymen fifty years after his death . His morality , though divine , was not at all appreciated by the Jews of that generation . The sermon on the mount and the parable of the prodigal son could not have inspiied much enthusiasm in such an age , among such a people . According to our author , his chosen disciples did not understand him , and have terribly misrepresented him , and are terribly misrepresenting him today , in those very Bibles of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourses they delivered to the people had little to say of his morality , but instead , were full of the absnrd and false story of his having conic to life after his crucifixion , and flimsy proofs from ancient prophecy of his being the promised Messiah . For extending his influence beyond Jerusalem and the land of Israel , the disciples had , according to our author 's theory , still fewer advantages , nothing , absolutely nothing , but the ethics of their crucified and dishonored Master . They must have gone everywhere preaching in the name of an ignominious criminal , a morality of quiet , gentle , foi-giving benevolence , to an age of pride , violence , and ambition . To this must be added the prejudice and contempt which they everywhere encountered as Jews . Ethical lectures have never been a power in any age ; they are not in our own , and when the author shall have succeeded in reducing all our religions teaching to the dimensions of his theory , he will see how feeble such teaching is . Still more feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liomans ; and when delivered in the name of a crucified master , they could have been only contemptible . Now we submit to the candid reader , that to have spread his fame and his influence from Jerusalem to Home in thirty-five years , and filled the empire with assemblies of his avowed and zealous followers under these conditions , was simply impossible . Mr. Arnold would excuse ns from believing in miracles , but he imposes a far heavier tax on our credulity , by requiring us to believe that Christianity could have been thus propagated over the Roman empire in the time of the C*esars. // If we will give heed to the facts as they have come down to us , we know well how it was done . We know causes which are entirely adequate to the effects produced . Let us admit the truth of the evangelic narrative , and all is easy of explanation . The force that accomplished that mightiest religious revolution of history was not the miracles alone , it was the wonderous personage Jesus Christ in all the aspects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed and inspired , and pervaded by his exalted views of morality , of God , and of the moral universe . Who ever heard without awe those words from John 's gospel , " I am the resurrection and the life . He that believeth in me , though he were dead yet shall he live ? Yet these divine words , that have thrilled men 's souls through the ages , are inseparably intertwined with the graphic narrative of the raising of Lazarus from the dead . Take another example , the scene in the garden of Gethsemane . It may be safely affirmed that no other narrative of personal experience ever affected human thought , opinion , and character more profoundly than this . In presence of it the most daring and hardened impiety is , for the moment at least , subdued and awe-stricken . It has impressed itself ineffaceably upon all Christian ages in all Christian lands . It can never perish from human literature and sacred remembrance . To what then does this solemn tragedy owe its power over the human heart ? To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was himself a prophet , and foresaw with perfect clearness the events that were before him , the palace of the High Priest , the judgment hall of Pilate , Calvary ; that he saw that the great work of human salvation which he had on his hands could be accomplished only by drinking the bitter cup which was about to be presented to his lips ; that the agony of his spirit in the prospect was such as to cause the sweat to trickle down to the ground like drops of blood , and to draw from him the prayer , " Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me ; " yet too intent on his mission of love to defend himself by the miraculous powers of which he had given so many proofs , or to save himself by flight , which he could easily have done , for the power of his persecutors extended but a little way from Jerusalem ; that he therefore // suffered himself to be " led as a lamb to the slaughter . " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Messiah to an ordinary , weak , and helpless man ; take from him his prophetic power , and let him be only a good man , with no knowledge of what was about to happen to him , and no peculiar necessity of offering himself an unresisting victim to his enemies , and the whole scene dwindles to an ordinary experience of a humble and suffering saint , the equal of which may be found thousauds of times among his faithful followers , no one of which would make any impression on the world beyond the circle of immediate friends and admirers . Indeed , for his neglect to save himself by flight , we can not , in this view of the facts , help blaming him as weak and pusillanimous , especially when we take into the account the agony of his apprehension of what might be before him . The power of the narrative lies in his consciousness of his high function as the Messiah , and the Saviour , and his clear prophetic knowledge of what was before him . It is these considerations only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mighty moral force in the world for eighteen centuries . In the crucifixion of such a being as a malefactor , followed almost immediately by the testimony of his plain , straightforward , honest disciples , that he had risen from the dead , and that they had seen him many times after his resurrection ; and in their bold and fearless assertion of his resurrection before the rulers of the nation , who had procured his crucifixion , there was a power that shook Jerusalem as with an earthquake . Three thousand gave in their adhesion to him in a single day , and the prevalence of the religion could not be resisted , or ever afterwards arrested . One cause only can ever explain the prevalence of Christianity after the crucifixion , and the permanent establishment of the Christian Church . That cause is the combination of the high supernatural powers and relations of Jesus Christ with that unique morality and theology which Jesus taught , which alone of all the thinking of the world solves the problems of human life and destiny . The morality without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , comparatively powerless , and never heard of beyond the limits of Palestine . The pretension to miracles , to the supernatural , // without the high and unique morality , would have been incredible and contemptible , aud would have been rejected with scorn . The power of the two combined not only filled Jerusalem with the doctrine , and carried it to the extreme limits of the empire , but have borne it along over eighteen centuries , and will bear it along to the limits of the earth , and to the consummation of all things . There is no philosophy , no wisdom in the supercilious contempt with which Mr. Arnold rejects the supernatural . It is a maxim of all sound philosophy that facts must be accounted for . This is not only true of the facts which meet us in the material world , the facts of weight and measurement , but of those also which occur in the development of human nature in its social and religious aspect* . The time is not distant when we shall have a philosophy as reverently considerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the phenomena of the glaciers , or the relations of genera and species in living beings . It is a fatal mistake of Mr. Arnold and of many other thinkers of our day , that they reach conclusions the most sweeping , and construct systems for which they claim universality , in utter disregard of many of the most universal , unquestionable , and characteristic facts of humanity . Such conclusions should not obtain our assent , such systems have no claim to our acceptance . We have already referred to Mr. Arnold 's admission that " miracles when fully believed are hAt by men in general to be a source of authority . " He says it is " absurd to deny it . " No doubt of it . There is not a nian of us who , had he been present when Jesus of Nazareth called Lazarus out of the grave where he had already lain four days , would not , at least for the moment , have believed that the being who possessed such powers over matter , life , and death , could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world unseen . Mr. Arnold himself would have accepted the conclusion . But is such a. fact as this of no significancy According to Mr. Arnold 's theory , none at all . No account whatever is made of it . Can this be a philosophical procedure ? Is it easy to believe that such a " consensus gerteris humani " is a delusion ? Is it not far more natural to suppose that it points to some real and permanent relationship between the physical // laws that prevail around us , and the moral government under which we live ? Such a fact taken in connexion with that other admission of our author , that " it is almost impossible to exaggerate the proneness of the human mind to take miracles as evidence and to seek for miracles as evidence , " must surely point to some lesson important for men to learn . If a universal appetite for animal food indicates that man was intended in part to be nourished by it , why does not such a universal expectation of receiving religious instruction through miracles indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his creatnre man ? If this nearly universal expectation of receiving religions instruction through miracles does not indicate a plan of the Creator so to reveal himself , what does it indicate ? Has God made man to be the easy dupe of any impostor who might wish to profit by his weakness ? Has he made the race vainly to pursue a phantom , an absurdity ? Is it not far more probable that rash and self-confident men have misinterpreted the facts of human nature ? We have shown that two diametrically opposite systems of thought are contending for the dominion of the human mind for the future . One of them is no personality , no mind , no conscious spirit existing apart from an organized body , and therefore no Creator , no creation , no miracle , and no life after death . The other is a personal God , a Creator , a creation , and therefore miracle , which is creation , when the well-being of man requires it , and an immortal future . The longing expectation of receiving instruction concerning God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is admitted to have prevailed through the ages , gives clear indication that human nature is on the side of that system of thought which begins in the intuition of a personal God . And that self-styled philosopher who takes sides with the opposing system has the facts of human nature against him , and they will prove too strong for him . There are in the universe no facts better established , or better worthy the careful , thoughtful study of the scientific inquirer , than the phenomena of man 's moral and religious nature . No system of thought can be true which overlooks them . // It is necessary to Mr. Arnold 's system of thought to eliminate prophecy from the Bible as well as miracle , for prophecy is supernatural , and it implies a personal , conscious , knowing God . For such a God there is no place in his mind . Of prophecy , therefore , the Bible must be expurgated . In this attempt it seems to us his efforts are lame and singularly unsuccessful . There are points of exegesis here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss . It would extend this Article to an unreasorable length , and our own special studies have not been such as to qualify us to deal with this class of questions with facility . But our author 's signal failure in this branch of his subject is conspicuous enough , without an especial examination of prophecy . He admits that there was , at the time when Jesus appeared , a general expectation of a Messiah , a Christ who should fulfill a long line of ancient prophecies , as they were interpreted by that age , and bring great deliverance to the Lord 's people . He claims , indeed , that these interpretations of the ancient writings were false , an " aberglaube , " an " extra belief , " unwarranted by the Psalms and the Prophets ; but he admits that such an expectation was general and inspired a great deal of enthusiasm in that age . Here , then , is a coincidence which for the author 's system is very awkward . Just at the time when that expectation was at its height , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was , by our author 's own confession , worthy of the loftiest strains of the poet 's lyre , and the most fervid uttermees of the seer 's foresight , a personage who came charged with incalculable blessings , not only to the Jew but to all the world , emphatically the revealer of the true religion ( the author will not permit us to say God ) to mankind . " Aberglaube " was in the right . Its most sanguine interpretations of the prophets were verified by the fact . Nor is this all . Though Jesus never regarded himself as the Messiah , ( so teaches our author , ) and never believed in or countenanced the Messianic inteTretation of the prophets , yet , in his efforts to get the ear of the people , he was obliged to connect himself in their minds with their notions of the Messiah . When they asked him , " Art thou the Christ ? " his // answer was " I am . " Mr. Arnold justifies this " pious fraud , " ( for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion of the Messiah entertained by the Jews of that time was utterly false and corrupting , so corrupting that nothing could be done for them unless they could be induced to accept as the promised Messiah such an one as Jesus , instead of the hero an ( l conqueror they were looking for , and therefore he told them that he was the Messiah that was to come , thus assenting and giving his sanction to that false interpretation of the prophets . And more , and for the author worse than this , he highly commended Peter for saying , " Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God , " and that not before the multitude , but in a confidential conversation with his disciples . The author can not escape from this example except by saying that this is one of the numerous mistakes of the apostle , growing out of their utter incompetency to understand Jesus . But to this we reply , if the apostles are not trustworthy witnesses to such a fact as this , what do we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can throw no doubt over it , that Jesus was received and followed by his own disciples , he was believed in by all the thousands who gave in their adhesion to him at Jerusalem directly after the crucifixion , and by all the hundreds of thousands who composed the early churches , as the Christ , the Messiah , the fulfillment of ancient prophecy . Of the truth of this the very word Christian is a standing , and will be an everlasting , monument . As Archbishop Whately suggested , the Christians did not designate themselves by that name . Of this the New Testament is ample proof Their Jewish enemies would never have called them Christians ; for the very question at issue with them was , whether Jesus was the Christ , and they denied it . The name Christian must then have been given them by their Pa*an enemies , in derision . The disciples were always talking of their founder , not by his name Jesus , but by his high prophetic designation , Christ . Their enemies therefore said of them , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirms that Jesus did not represent himself as the fulfillment of Messianic prophecy , as the Messiah , the Christ . If criticism can make this out of the patent facts of the case , it can make // any thing out of any thing . When Mr. Arnold denies that Jesus represented himself as the prophetic Messiah , the real meaning is , that he wishes he had not done so . There is perhaps no fact pertaining to the Messianic prophecies more striking and wonderful than the almost contradictory character of the symbols under which the coming One was dcscribed . Tn some of the prophecies he is presented under images which represent power , the monarch , the conqueror ; rn others he appears under emblems which indicate lowliness , gentleness , humility , unresisting suffering . Mr. Arnold admits that Jesus saw that these were to be fulfilled in the same person , and that he was the first who ever had perceived it . If there was no prophecy , this is another most marvelous coincidence . Undoubtedly Jesus did thus interpret prophecy and so teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth chapter of Revelation , Christ is represented almost in the same sentence , first , under the symbol of a lion , and then under that of a lamb . This is striking enough , yet Mr. Arnold thinks Jesus was no believer in prophecy . We can not bring our remarks on this book to a close without briefly noticing the condition in which Mr. Arnold 's criticism would leave our Bible and our religion . When we have sacrificed all which he would require us to sacrifice to the demands of modern unbelief , what would remain for the religion of the future ? We ought very seriously to consider this , before we consent to follow our author 's advice . The proposition with which the book opens , that we relinquish our faith in a personal God , of course implies that worship is absurd . No man can worship an abstraction or an unconscious impersonal law . Prayer is not to be thought of , for who would think of praying to the law of gravitation , or the power of electricity , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will , character ? To say " Our Father , which art in heaven , " is as senseless as though the words were addressed to the moon or the planet Jupiter . Filial reverence for God is impossible . Trust in God as a friend is a delusion , for there is no friendship or affection in an impersonal power . When the Psalmist said , " As a father pitieth his children so the Lord pitieth them that fear him , " he talked but wildly and at random . Every altar ever // built , every holocaust ever offered , every temple ever erected for the worship of God , was an act of pitiable superstition . If there is no personal God , then of course is there no divine Saviour . Jesus was not the Christ , for prophecy was but a ground less pretension to an impossible prescience of the future . If there is no personal Creator , then no creation and no miracle , and the supernatural in every form vanishes from our religion . Our Bible may be and is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are false pretensions , which mar the sacred volume , and we must hasten to clear our religion of all such follies , and charge all this over to the ignorance and blind . ness of the different writers of the book . for which our religion is not held in the least responsible . If there is no miracle , then is not Christ risen from the dead , and his ascension into heaven is but an incredible fable . All the reported interviews of Christ with his disciples after the pretended resurrection are groundless fables also . There is then no living Saviour to be with his people , to govern his Church , and finally come to the judgment . What then remains ? The bare ethics of the Bible as exhib* ited in the preceptive teaching of Christ and other great and good men in their merely human relations and lives . The highest , infinitely the most impressive , moral teaching of Christ himself forever vanishes from such a religion . The unique and most affecting of all lessons of self-sacrifice for the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Jesus the Christ giving himself up a voluntary victim for the salvation of the world . For this there is no place in Mr. Arnold 's system . His righteousness can go no further than the regulation of those appetites which have reference to the preservation of life and the reproduction of the race . This is all that will remain of our religion when Mr. Arnold 's criticism has done its work . Will the world , will the skepticism of science and culture accept such a religion and reverence such a Bible ? Will the Bible , with Mr. Arnold 's estimate of it , be an object of reverent and earnest study to coming ages of refinement and scientific culture ? With all this mass of fable and superstition , and Ibily and delusion , which Mr. Arnold teaches us to find in it , will it continue to be regarded as the Book of religion for the human // race , for the sake of the few grains of ethical truth , which are scattered here and there among its confused masses of incredible fiction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the consideration of the wise . Mr. Arnold 's object m writing his book is to conciliate to the Bible the affectionate reverence of all coming ages . We most assuredly think , that if he has succeeded in his argument , he has certainly defeated the professed object of his book . We can not forbear saying also , that if Mr. Arnold 's argument is sound and his conclusions are to be received , then the religion which was established in the world by the apostles was not the religion of Jesus , and the churches which they founded were not his churches . Their preaching , as they have transmitted it to us ( and they certainly were competent to report their own preaching correctly ) , did not exhibit the true Jesus at all , but Jesus the Christ , and Jesus as raised from the dead . No wellinformed man can deny , or will attempt to deny , that the two doctrines on which that religion was chiefly founded were the Messiahship of Jesus and his resurrection from the grave after the crueiflx*on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can all see how all that is great and good and fitted to bless mankind in the Christ of the New Testament , is so intertwined . with these two doctrines as to insure its presence and evergrowing power wherever they are received . They are the everlasting pillars around which all the living truths and j ) recious moralities of the Gospel entwine in ever-increasing greenness and beauty , yielding their precious fruit for the healing of the nations . But if these two doctrines are but the " aberglaube " of Christ 's ignorant disciples , if they are but delusion and fable , to be rejected by every intelligent man , then was the preaching of the apostles , as for example Peter 's on the day of Penteeost* fundamentally false , and the churches of the apostles , founded on delusion and falsehood , never could have become vehicles for conveying the living truth of Jesus to coming ages . Then were the successes of the apostles not the successes of Jesus , but of a wild and extravagant enthusiasm with which Jesus would have had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Article , we vividly feel that the Christian forces of this age need readjustment , to prepare the Church for the mighty conflicts of the present and the immediate future . Christianity did not come through those dark and bloody and superstitious ages untarnished , at least in her garments . The time has fully come when she needs the fine linen clean and white . But in any attempt at the readjustment she may need , we hope the Church may be saved from following the lead of any such thinkers as Matthew Arnold .
