Between forty and fifty persons were present . I George Williamson . a white man , tried to raise a disturbance in the town , and by the false rumors he spread made many of the negroes afraid to attend . Thomas J. Foster . Representative elect , was in the Chair . A resident of Leesburg reported that William Long would not let his hands leave work on the day of election . The threats he used prevented fifteen from going to the polls . From Milton Township it was reported that John Lea also intimidated his workmen , causing a loss of ten Republican votes .

He looked over my note-book , interrupted the conversation , and repeatedly asked the negro to go away with him . A reign of terror seems to have been inaugurated in Caswell .
