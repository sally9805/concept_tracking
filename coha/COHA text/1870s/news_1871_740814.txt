txt As we have already observed , the contrast between the views of the President and the Secretary of the Treasury on the subject of revenue reform is somewhat striking . The President sees how the Present rate of taxation is eating into the means of every one , and that a burden is placed upon the people out of proportion to their ability . He urges accordingly that both customs and internal taxes be reduced , so as to bring " the greatest relief to the greatest number . " The statement will meet the approval of all revenue reformers . The Secretary , on the other hand , is ready to reduce internal taxation to the amount of sixteen millions , by taking off taxes from everything but stamps , spirits , tobacco and malt liquors ; thus making the whole revenue from internal sources about one hundred and ten million dollars . But in the enormous income expected from customs  --  namely , two hundred and twelve million dollars ? he is only willing to relieve us of twenty million dollars ; which is scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elasticity , " as economists absurdly call it ? resulting from growth of population . For payments on account of the public debt , including the Sinking Fund , he is willing to allow fifty million dollars . Thus his total Proposed reduction of taxation is only $36,000,000 , and , so far as customs are concerned , he would only relieve ns of fifty per cent . of the duties on salt , fifty cents a ton on bituminous coal . and a portion of the duties on raw hides and skins , ? at the same time entirely removing the taxes from a great number of imported . articles , not produced here , but entering into our manufactures , which yield but small revenue . We are confident we do not mistake the temper of the people when we say that this small reduction of burdens will by no means satisfy them . Every man , woman , and child in the country is paying something of the heavy taxes levied in the tariff , and each one is poorer in consequence . The farmers especially feel them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clothing . All branches of manufacture feel them , and many are utterly unable in consequence to compete with foreign manufacturers . It is not " foreign pauper labor " which is ruining American manufacture , but pnces of raw material , lumber , iron , steel , fine wool and other equally important elements . Owing to the most unfortunate abolition of the Commission on Internal Revenue , Mr. BOUTWELL% recommendations have no intelligible scientific basis to go upon . We can not tell from his report , where the reduction of duties should be placed . what industries would be most benefited by it , and what most hampered , and we learn absolutely nothing of the depressed condition of our manufactures , exceptin one branch  --  ship-building . We only know from Mr. Bourevals. that the customs alone of 1871 were some twelve millions in excess of the year 1870 , despite the lowering of the tariff  --  thus again illustrating the principle so often urged by economists , that a lessening of the tax often increases the revenue . Instead of a reduction of twenty millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - 060,000 to $75,000,000 reduction . A tariff revenue of $212,000,000 is equivalent to an expenditure of four dollars per capita in 1872 for every one in 1860 . This is excessive . This generation should not rightly be called upon to bear so large a proportion of the expenses of the war . In apportioning the reduction of $75,000,000 among the various articles imported , the true principle to- consider is that alluded to by the President " the greatest relief to the greatest number . " Now , we well know , that the masses are not especially relieved by reducing taxes on luxuries ; indeed , it is a sound principle of political economy that luxuries should always be a principal source of taxation . Therefore all articles such as silks , wines , liquors and ornaments should pay the highest revenue duty . Then , among those which are lightened , should rank first the " raw material " of manufacture  --  all those articles which enter into our processes of production , and which are especially used ey the laboring classes . Take as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but owing to the tariff taxes on fine wool , dye-stuffs , and other materials , the price is excessively high for these articles , and yet the foreign manufacturer is able to import some fifty million dollars worth of these goods every year . With all this , the farmer is not benefited , as the price of out coarse wool and of mutton has been at the lowest , and the number of sheep is diminishing . If our manufacturers could have the " raw material " of fine wool to mix with the native coarse wool at a low rate , they could produce cheaper goods , relieve the working classes , and give a greater market to our sheep-raisers . The tax in this case has almost ruined farmer and . manufacturer both , and has burdened all consumers . A similar principle will apply to a reduction of duty on pig-iron , steel-rails. and lumber . In one form or other these articles are the " raw material " for an immense.proportion of our manufactures , and for the labors of the farmers . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . A great reduction of the taxes on them would at once enable many of our manufacturers to compete with foreign manufacturers , and would increase home demand so that as much pig-iron and lumber would be produced here as before . We should all find houses , machinery , tools and freights cheaper , and every man would . be richer . while our own producers would not be injured .
