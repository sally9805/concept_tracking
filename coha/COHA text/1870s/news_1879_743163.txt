txt Civilized and uncivilized races agree in believing each that its own particular women are fairer than any other women are or can be , firmness of belief being generally in an inverse ratio to the degree of civilization . South Sea savages feel far more confident of tee unapproached and unapproachable beauty of their females than Londoners or Parisians or New Yorkers do of the beauty of their finest women . Every kind of people is addicted to bragging about the extraordinary loveliness of its wives and daughters , people in the cities and towns of the same country sharing the wide-spread weakness . If a New-Yorker or Charlestonian or Chicagoan praises the comeliness of his feral. - nine fellow-citizens , he is very apt to hear from local sources that they are altogether inferior in this respect to the famous belles of Bricksburg or Skaneateles . The truth is that the women of each country , city , and village are the most beautiful in the world , and may be proved to be such , if persons immediately interested be allowed to fix the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Americans have boasted a great deal of the beauty of their women , not so much perhaps as the French , the English , the Spaniards , or Italians have boasted of theirs , but still , more than is becoming or commendable . If the women of any country are remarkable for personal charms , the world is likely to learn the fact without continual advertisement , although the prejudice which each land has in favor of its own may restrict taste and warp judgment . One nation is seldom inclined to allow the I claims of another in regard to feminine loveliness , and it is all the more extraordinary , therefore , that within a few years , especially within two or three , Europeans have begun to I praise the good looks of our women almost without stint . Many of them have gone , and are going , beyond our own compatriots in their admiration , which is not confined to one people , but shared by Russians , Italians , French , Germans , and Britons . One is continually seeing in Old World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasteful dressing of young unmarried American women ; those who are wives and mothers , particularly if beyond their prime , not being held in great favor . The American girl may well be said to have gained a wide transatlantic reputation . She figures in foreign novels , and her person and toilet are usually described in glowing colors . The English weeklies have occupied a deal of space recently in lauding the youthful daughters of the Republic , and albeit they often criticise their voices and their manners , they admit that their beauty , grace , and vivacity are well-nigh irresistible . We have read , in those weeklies , accounts too extravagant for domestic credit . Indeed , it may be said that the fame of American women tor beauty is , to-day , greater abroad than . it is at home , which ' is a circumstance little less than marvelous . The same thing assuredly can not be said of the women of any other race . Englishmen admire and laud the personal apperance of their women far more than any other nation does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans stand similarly affected toward their feminine population . Each country sees it at a most auspicious angle of patriotism . Chauvinism lays a glamour on the eye and fixes a bias in the mind . Taste changes with times and conditions . A pretty woman in ancient clays would not have . been counted pretty in the Middle Ages ; nor would a medi√¶val charmer be necessarily so esteemed in this century . Throughout Europe , feminine delicacy has grown into favor ; slender , oval faces , bright and varying facial expression , slight , willowy figures are prized as they have never been before , and these eminently belong to the American type . We observe , therefore , that ; many of the noted belles of Berlin , Vienna , Rome , Paris , and London , if they are not Americans , are more or less after the American pattern . Delicacy and slenderness are the prevailing mode throughout high civilization , and delicacy and slenderness are striking traits among the maidens and matrons of the Western World . Our women now attract attention and admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears ; in half a dozen languages : " Strikingly handsome woman that ; she must be an American . " " She has the figure and movement of an American . " " Those little barbarians from over the sea are singularly fair . " ' Where do these American girls get their charm of person and of manner ? " It is not a matter of much moment , perhaps , whether American women are attractive or plain ; but it is certainly noteworthy that other countries should rate their comeliness as they do , and should so constantly extol their physical fascinations . American women ought to be possessed of fine persons ; for they have the blood of many races , and the most composite order of humanity is the highest order . There is more individuality , more social freedom , more general intelligence , for women here than there is abroad , and these help to make expression and gracefulness . It may be that Europe is unduly prejudiced on behalf of our women just now ; but whether it is or not , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nations . the country of yesterday , should be ranked in the older civilizations as exe tiepins of grace and loveliness.
