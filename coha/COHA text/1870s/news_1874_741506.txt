txt There has been a good deal of genuine interest felt iu the question of an adequate reform of the civil service during the past four or live years , and a great many Republicans have found fault with their party for not moving fast enough in the matter . Doubtless more rapid progress , if it could have been substantial and permanent , would have been a good thing . But it must be remembered that in this country reforms of any kind in the public service depend on the strength and extent of the popular desire for them , and in this particular case the portion of the Government supposed to be most nearly representative of the popular desire , has constantly interposed obstacles to the reform . We may not think that Gen. GRANT has done all he might for civil service reform , but no one can deny that lie has done more than Congress approved of , and that what is being done at this moment is opposed to the action of Congress last session . It is a vital question , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as far as our own State is concerned , they will have a chance to show this to-morrow . The radical principle of civil service reform is that tenure of office shall depend on fitness and on nothing else . If that principle can be applied thoroughly to the great body of executive officers in the United States , it will put an end to many evils , and make the experiment of representative government in this country vastly more promising than it now is . Patronage in public offices  --  a practice introduced by a Democratic Administration  --  has a double effect in interference with our institutions : it tends to raise up a , class of interested politicians who work to control elections for their own profit , and it tends to discourage and alienate the mass of citizens who act from disinterested motives . This is a growing evil , and . ought to be got rid of as fast as possible . Until our public servants are chosen because they can perform the duties of their office well , and not because of political prejudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up-hill work getting an honest and efficient government . But in this reform the people must set the example . They must show what they wish done by showing what they will do themselves . Gen Dix 's election is a case in point . He has done well in his office . Everyone concedes that . In the course of this canvass , which has been very bitter on the part of the Democrats , no one has breathed a suggestion that Gov . Dix has not been an excellent Governor . He has been sagacious . He knows the cardinal principles of free government , and he has applied them firmly and judiciously . ' No Governor has ever been more vigilant ; more laborious and careful to see that no harm came to the people through errors or otherwise . With great executive ability he has united rare experience and . ripeness of judgment , which have enabled him to influence largely the course of legislation , and always for good . He has shown by the severest test that he possesses every qurlification for his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no one could fail to see the force , of the people 's desire for a sound system of the civil service . A failure to elect him could . result from nothing but comparative indifference of the people with reference to the fitness of their most important executive officer for his trust . If Gov . Dix is not re-elected to-morrow , it is the merest nonsense for those who fail to vote for him to grumble about civil service reform . If the people of the State of New York are not ready to retain a man of distipguished. merit in an office he has filled with great success . they can not expect that their representatives will.disregaid so plain a hint . The defeat of Dix would be an emphatic , - practical declaration that the voters do not prefer merit to all other considerations in filling political offices . What other interpretation could be put upon it ? There is no reason which an intelligent man can be expected to approve why Gen. Dix should not be elected . The arguments against him are not worth discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris visiting cards with his " titles " on them  --  did . his opponents ever pause to reflect that every title was one calling him to the service of his country , and that he never failed to do his duty in response to such a call ? He is " old , " &c.,; &c.; But no one says he has not done well ; that he Ls not firm , courageous , industrious , and just . It does not seem possible that the people of the State wish to rate such qualities as worth nothing . If they do , they can not expect that a reform which consists in rating fitness above everything can get on very well . Moreover , Democratic supremacy in this State means the most thorough opposition to the principle that we have said underlies all reform of the public service . The Democracy is essentially a party of patronage . That is , on the whole , its most powerful motive for action . It is to that motive that it owes its discipline . Men who think only of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seek , are faithful servants of the party that controls them . But they are not faithful to the people . These they will neglect , if they do not rob . We repeat that one of the most important questions to be decided to-morrow is how far the people of the State really desire reform in the public service .
