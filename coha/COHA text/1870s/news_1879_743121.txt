txt Bishop O'Conner , of this Roman Catholic diocese , in an interview to-day concerning the article he wrote for the Catholic Quarterly Review about Gen. Grant 's Des Moines speech , says , concerning the Philadelphia inquirer interview with Dr. Keating , that the Inquirer is not exactly correct as to what the Bishop said . " Dr. Keating or the reporter , " he continued , " may either of them have misunderstood my exact words . What I meant to have said was this : attached too much importance to the speech when I wrote the article in the Catholic Quarterly Review . if I had read the speech at all , I read it in a hasty manner , or read an incomplete report of it . On ' reading it afterward , I felt that what Grant said could have been uttered without intention to reflect upon the Catholic community . It certainly could have been interpreted more mildly . I wrote without the speech before me . I said what I said largely in the light of views expressed on the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation , I think I , as well as others of the Catholic Church , misinterpreted his motives . He ought to have been acquitted of any intention to offend . I am glad , indeed anxious , to make amends for the mistake . My conversation with Dr. Keating may have been unguarded . I met him , with Mr. Borie , at Fremont , and rode to Omaha with them . I have known Keating since his childhood . Borie was a parishioner of mine in Philadelphia . Hence we talked very freely Referring to a portion of the recent speech , in which he said : The next struggle will not be with the rebellion , but with ignorance , with the opponents of general education , ' or language quite like that , you remember , he commented upon the common-school system and arraigned its opponents in general terms . I got the idea he had made a specific attack upon the Catholic body , so , incidentally , in the article in question , I referred to the speech . I am now satisfied that Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , and regret that I made so much of , it ? that I misinterpreted his motives . This was the substance of the discussion on the cars . I can see it could have been said in such a way as to lead to the misstatement made in the Inquirer. "
