THE STORY OF A TELESCOPE . WHEN we trace back the chain of causes which led to the constructicin of the great Washington telescope , we find it to commence with so small a matter as the accidental breaking of a dinner bell in thc year 1843 at the Phillips Academy , Andover , Massachusetts . One of the scholars of the Academy , George B. Clark by name , gathered up the fragments of the bell , took them to his home in Cambridgeport , put them into a crucible with some tin , and proceeded to melt them in the kitchen fire . His mother very naturally inquired the cause of such an interference with the culinary arrangements , to which he replied that he was going to make a telescope . Having melted his metals , he cast them into a disc , and commenced grinding them into a slightly concave mirror . His father learning what he was doing , lent a helping hand , and the combined skill of father and son was soon rewarded by the completion of a five-inch reflecting telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saturn , and other telescopic objects . Such was the origin of the now wellknown firm of Alvan Clark &amp; Sons . The father was then a portrait painter in Cami ) ridgeport , and within the limited circle of his acquaintance the accuracy of his portraits and the patience which he devoted to their finish , brought his work into high esteem . He was entirely self-made , having received no higher education than that afforded by the district school of his native place , or by his own reading ; but this defect was more than compensated by his natural genius , which was of a much higher order than that of the so-called practical man . It is interesting to notice the early development of those qualities he has since exhibited in the construction of telescopes . At the time of which we speak he was much more widely known as a champion shooter with rifles of his own make than he was as a portrait painter . His success in this apparently unartistic and unscientific pursuit was due to the extreme accuracy with which he cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to the precision of his eye-sight . He now entered with ardQr upon the path so curiously opened up by the experiment of his son . He made reflectors of larger size , and began to employ them in scanning the heavens . Among other objects he examined was the great Nebula of Orion , that celestial mystery which nearly every great telescope of the world has sought to unravel . He confined himself to making a little map of all the small stars he could see in the nebula , and when it was done he exhibited it to Professor Bond , the director of the newly-founded observatory at Cambridge . Surprise was expressed at the number of minute stars Mr. Clark could see with so small an instrument , and the astronomer remarked one *n particular which Herschel had not seen with his twenty-foot reflector . Mr. Clark now began to consider the feasibility of grinding the glasses of a refracting telescope , and suggested the project to his son . " Ah , father , we can not do it , " replied the learned boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an operation of extreme difficulty . " But the father was not a man to be stopped by any dictum of so vague a body as that of " writers , " and he resolved to make the attempt . A pair of four-inch discs of optical glass were procured , and , after considerable labor , he produced an object glass which seemed to him perfect . He now went to Professor Bond and told him that he had a four-inch glass which he proposed to try alongside of a Munich glass , which Bond considered one of the finest he had ever seen . The proposal was accepted , and the new glass was brought to the observatory , mounted in a wooden tube . Pointing it at a bright star the practiced eye of the astronomer soon detected what seemed to be a very serious defect . The glass did not show the star in its proper shape as a simple lucid point , but added a little tail like that of a minute comet , which seemed to extend upwards from the star . Mr. Ck*rk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was quite sure the glass had never before shown such an appendage , and that it was not due to any defect in the instrument itself . But he was quite unable to explain it , and the glass was in consequence pronounced a failure . After considerable thought and experiment the cause of the difficulty was divined , The wooden tube under the cold sky radiated heat from its upper surface , and was warmed by the heat from the ground on its under surface . The result was that inside of the tube was a very thin layer of warm air at the bottom , and an equally thin layer of cold air on top . The tube // was scarcely larger on the inside than the aperture of the object glass . The consequence was that much of the light which traversed the extreme edge of the glass was refracted upwards by these layers of air through which it had to pass , and formed the tail to the star . Mr. Clark found that he could avoid the difficulty by making the tube at least half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it when he used it under the open sky . The small radiating power of the tin-foil prevents its cooling so rapidly by radiation to the sky , while it reflects most of the heat which comes from the ground , and thus preserves a more equable temperature than the naked wood . During several years Mr. Clark devoted his leisure to the making of glasses of gradually increasing size , which he mounted in the simplest manner , and generally sold to private individuals . Some of these are still to be found in the hands of exhibitors on Boston Common . To many of our readers it may seem strange that a maker of telescopes equal to any in Europe , should have worked for ten years without receiving the slightest recognition or encouragement from any official , scientific , or educational quarter , although the time was most favorable for such recognition . The year in which he made his first telescope was marked by the projection or foundation of the Cambridge , Washington , and Cincinnati observatories , and the ten years during which he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we might say , the foundation of practical astronomy in the United States . The case strongly illustrates the cause which more than any other now retards the progress of science in America ; namely , our total indifference to genius which does not force itself into notice . Even at the present time the highest scientific ability in this country stands hardly a chance of recognition away from the great center of activity . As these lines are written , one of the first mathematicians of the century-fairly the peer of Hansen or Leverrier-has for ten years studied and worked in obscurity in a county district without receiving a fourth of the recognition , reward , or encouragement he would have received in any country of Europe . We trust that every true lover of the intellectual progress of America will feel mortified to learn that the first scientific recognition of Mr. Clark's*genius in the diffi cult art he has pursued with such success , came from Europe . The Rev. W. R. Dawes of England , was , at the time referred to , one of the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances in the measurement of double stars . He was among the finest and most critical judges of telescopes living , while his personal character and virtues corresponded to his intellect . To him Mr. Clark ventured to write without any introduction , describing his efforts in the construction of telescopes , and stating what he had been able to do in resolving the very difficult triple star of Andromeda . This letter opened a correspondence which lasted as long as Mr. Dawes lived . The latter began by sending Mr. Clark a list of certain difficult celestial objects which he wished him to examine and describe . This was done in a manner so satisfactory to Mm Dawes , that he made a proposal to purchase Mr. Clark 's glass , which the latter accepted , and the glass was sent over to England in the Autumn of 1853 . Its performance was so satisfactory that Mr. Dawes soon ordered a second . The reason for sending these orders to America was that there was not , at that time , an establishment in England which could grind a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in this respect entirely dependent upon the two or three German houses who possessed the art . When a thirteen-inch telescope was constructed for the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , it was found necessary to send to Munich for the object glass . Although England had lost the art of shaping object glasses , the yet more difficult art of casting rough glass of the necessary purity and uniformity was brought to the highest perfection by an English firm , of which we shall have further occasion to speak . Mr. Clark was therefore obliged to import his rough discs to fill the orders of Mr. Dawes . Here he met with a serious obstacle from a piece of machinery operated by the Government for the nominal purpose of " protecting domestic industry , " but the real effect of which is to obstruct the higher forms of industry by increasing the cost of all the appliances necessary to their successful prosecution . The Custom-House no sooner found Mr. Clark importing unheard-of lumps of glass of great value than it set upon him as if he were a public enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff , the discs were classified as cut glass , owing to one or two square inches on the edge having been polished to test them ; and the enormous duty of 30 per cent . was levied upon them . What was still worse , the duty was based not on the actual value of the discs as optical glass , but upon the guarantee value , which included the large additional sum paid to the founder in consideration of guaranteeing that if the glass did not prove good , new discs would be furnished . Applying to the Collector to know whether he could not secure a drawback upon the duties in consideration of the article being designed for re-exportation , he was humorously informed that if he would pay for the services of a watchman to keep control of the glass during the whole period of the manufacture , so that the watchman could swear that the glass exported was the identical one on which the duty had been paid , a drawback would be allowed . These illegal exactions of the Custom-House became so oppressive that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brought suit against the Collector for duties illegally levied , and gained his case , but the costs absorbed the whole amount recovered . The second glass ordered by Mr. Dawes was almost completed when , one day , as Mr. Clark was carrying it out to test it , it slipped from his hands and was broken to pieces . The product of many months of labor , and of no small pecuniary outlay , lay before his eyes a pile of worthless fragments . He could not even begin his work over again until he had again purchased his glass in England , and again paid the demands of the Custom-House . As soon as he could recover from the shock , he sent another order for the glass , but it was so long in being executed that he made inquiries in New York , to learn whether a pair of discs could not be procured there . In this inquiry he was successful , so that when the discs first ordered at length arrived , he had two pairs on hand . He worked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them both to Mr. Dawes , who found so much difficulty in making a choice that he kept them both . Mr. Dawes , we may say , was a sort of telescope fancier , who had the keenest appreciation of the good points of a fine instrument , but was always on the track of improvements in the construction and mounting , so as to gain the greatest convenience in use . The German makers were more or less wedded to their particular forms of machinery for working the instrument , and deviated from them with great reluctance . But Mr. Clark , not being a trained engineer , Mr. Dawes found in him one who was ready to adopt and incorporate in an instrument any feature he might desire , and who would follow his multiplicity of minute directions with the most scrupulous accuracy . When he wished to introduce improvements , his general course was not to alter the instrument he already had , but to order a new one with the improvements , and then sell the old one . With his high reputation , both as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never had any difficulty in disposing of such an instrument . It thus happened that up to the time of his death , in 1867 , he had ordered some half dozen object glasses and several complete telescopes from Mr. Clark , which are now scattered in various hands throughout England . During the period of these transactions with Mr. Dawes , Mr. Clark 's reputation was widely extended in his own country , and he was able to turn his entire energies to his new profession with a good prospect of success . About 1859 he procured glass for the construction of the largest refracting telescope yet made . The great pair of refractors made by Merz and Mahler for the observatories at Pulkowa and Cambridge had reigned without rivals for about twenty years . The clear aperture of the object glass of each was about fifteen inches . The discs which Mr. Clark now commenced to work were large enough for a clear aperture of 18 ' 2 inches , and would therefore admit about fifty per cent . more light than the instruments of Cambridge and Pulkowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely pointed at the heavens in its temporary tube when a remarkable discovery was made with it . To comprehend the interest of this discovery , we must mention a circumstance in the recent history of astronomy . It is perhaps half a century since Bessel found , by a comparison of Bradley 's observations of Sirius , made between 1750 and 1756 , with his own , that the motion of that star exhibited a remarkable peculiarity . It did not move in the heavens in a straight line with a uniform velocity like other fixed stars , but varied its motion in such a way as to indicate that it was revolving around some center very near it . Bessel could not doubt that this force was due to the // attraction of an invisible satellite moving around the bright star . Some years afterwards Dr. C. A. F. Peters , by a careful study and comparison of all the observed right ascensions of Sirius , was able to calculate the orbit of the attracting body . Afterwards Mr. T. H. Safford was led to the same result by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that there could no longer remain any reasonable doubt that the satellite really existed , though it continued to elude the most careful search . On the evening of January 31 , 1862 , Alvan G. Clark , pointed the newly finished glass at Sirius , probably without any knowledge of the researches to which we have alluded . " Why , father , " he exclaimed , " there is a companion ! " The father looked . There was the satellite surely-distance about ten seconds . As the news went round the world , every great telescope was pointed at Sirius . Now , when it was known exactly where the companion was , it was found that many telescopes would show it , and measures of its distance and direction flowed in from all quarters . The French Academy of Sciences awarded Mr. Clark the Lalande medal , which is given annually to the maker of the most interesting discovery of the year . It was awarded not simply for the discovery , but also for making the object glass which led to it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been predicted , could only be settled by long continued observation . After four years it was found that the observed position and motion of the satellite both corresponded so nearly with those predicted from theory that no serious doubt of the . identity of the seen and unseen bodies could be entertained . Mr. Clark commenced the construction of this telescope for the University of Mississippi ; but the outbreak of the civil war necessarily prevented that institution from completing its contract , and the glass was sold to the Chicago Astronomical Society . It was placed in charge of Mr. T. H. Safford , the distinguished astronomer and computer of Cambridge . Very little has , however , been done with it , as the architectural defects of the dome in which it is mounted have interfered with its use . During all the time of which we have been speaking , while observatories supplied with large telescopes were springing up all over the country , and while an association of private gentlemen had supplied themselves with the largest refracting telescope ever made , the great telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a 9 ' 2 glass , mounted with all the ancient inconveniences . This was clearly a state of things which called for improvement , but a remedy was by no means easy . When the war had to be prosecuted ; when the national debt was to be paid off ; and when Mr. E. B. Washburne , " the watchdog of the treasury , " presided over the House Committee on Appropriations , asking Congress to vote money for a telescope seemed , indeed , a hopeless enterprise . However , in the summer of 1867 , the writer sought an interview with Mr. Clark , to learn on what conditions he could be induced to undertake a telescope for the Government of not less than two feet clear aperture . He was not at all enthusiastic on the subject . He was willing to undertake the work for forty thousand dollars in gold , but would not make a contract on any other than a gold basis , for fear of a subsequent depreciation of the currency . This condition was very embarrassing , as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorize a gold contract within the country , and the project seemed so hopeless that no further attempt to carry out the scheme was then made . In the course of the year following the necessity of some action , if the Observatory was ever to have the telescope , became apparent . Rumors that some one else would order the instrument came in from various quarters , and , especially , from Princeton College , where they had gone so far as to project a building for it . As it did not seem likely that Mr. Clark would be able to undertake more than one instrument of the size desired , and as this was expected to occupy more than four years in its completion , prompt action seemed urgently necessary . Accordingly , in his annual report of i868 , Rear Admiral Sands set forth the wants of the Observatory , and the ability of Mr. Clark to supply it , and asked for four annual appropriations , each of ten thousand dollars in gold , to pay for the telescope . But the words were spoken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no estimates for improvements in any branch of the Naval service should be sent to // Congress with his sanction , but that expenditures should be confined to what was necessary to keep the public property in repair , and carry on the necessary operations of the Navy on the most limited scale , unless Congress should see fit to authorize more on its own responsibility . The telescope being clearly an improvement , the estimate for its construction could not reach Congress through the proper official channel at all . If Congress had been aware of this rule adopted by the Secretary of the Navy , and had known that the nonappearance of an item of this kind in his estimate by no means indicated disapproval on his part , its ear might still have been obtained for the project . But the Committee on Appropriations did not know ai*thing of the sort , and no amount of statement or explanation could make them aware of it . They looked to the Secretary of the Navy for all estimates for the Naval Observatory , and knew nothing about any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year following , but with no better immediate effect . If we were writing only the official history of the project , we should have but to say that about the close of the following session , in July , 1870 , Congress suddenly changed its mind , and authorized the telescope . But to explain how Congress came to change its mind , we must intrude upon a private dinner party , given by one of our most honored citizens , trusting for pardon to the great public importance of a movement which originated over the table . Among the party were Senators Hamlin and Casserly , Mr. J. E. Hilgard , of the Coast Survey , and a young gentleman from New York who had spent the day in examining the sights of Washington . Being called upon for an account of what he bad seen , he described his visit to the Observatory , and expressed his surprise at the absence of a large telescope , the largest there not only being much smaller than many at quite unknown observatories , but smaller than Mr. Rutherfurd 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulity , and appealed to Mr. Hilgard to know whether the visitor was not mistaken through a failure to find the largest telescope of the Observatory . The latter replied that the statement was entirely correct , the telescope having been procured at a time when the success of large ones wa* still . cQnsidered doubtful . " This ought not to be , " said one of the Senators . " Why is so great a deficiency not supplied ? " Mr. Hilgard adduced the supposed reluctance of Congress to appropriate money for a telescope . " But it must be done . You have the case properly represented to Congress , and we will see that an appropriation is passed by the Senate , at least . " Mr. Hilgard did not lose a day in following this advice . He called upon the Superintendent of the Observatory , who of course gladly assented to the plan . He then communicated by telegraph with a number of the leading men of science throughout the country , who authorized their signatures to the proper petition . The latter called attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observatory in his last two annual reports , and to the ability of the Messrs . Clark to supply this want . It was duly printed , and put in the hands of Senator Hamlin for presentation to the Senate within three or four days of the dinner party . The proposed measure being considered by the Committee on Naval Affairs , and on Appropriations , was adopted in the Senate as an amendment to the Naval Appropriation bill , without opposition . The great difficulty now was to get the amendment through the House of Representatives , or rather through its Committee on Appropriations , as the session and the bill were together in a stage where everything had to be decided by the appropriate committees . To prevent misapprehension we must say that no government is more ready than our own to appropriate money for scientific objects of the value of which it is fully satisfied , when the case is properly resented and fully understood . The great difficulty ( greater , perhaps , than would be supposed outside of Washington , ) is to secure such presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of Congress never looks at any printed document sent him through the mail , so that personal application is the only way of calling his attention to any subject . After a canvass of the House Appropriation Committee , it was believed that a clear , majority was in favor of the measure ; we were therefore much surprised to find that it recommended non-concurr* e . This left the question to the joint committee of conference , which fortunately comprised such men as Drake , of the Senate , and Niblack , of the House . There // the telescope was agreed to , and the clause authorizing its construction speedily became a law . The price was limited to fifty thousand dollars , and ten thousand were appropriated for the first payment . About the time the bill passed , an occurrence threatened to complicate matters exceedingly , and perhaps endanger the possession of the telescope by the Government . Mr. L. J. McCormick , of reapingmachine fame , had conceived the idea of getting the largest telescope that could be made for an observatory he intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvan Clark &amp; Sons while the appropriation was still pending in Congress . Mr. *Aark , however , believed that he could complete a pair of twin instruments almost as quickly as a single one , and in one way the contract with Mr. McCormick facilitated that with the government . It being made on a gold basis , Mr. Clark was quite willing to enter into the government contract on a currency basis , which removed one of the principal difficulties in its way . The question who should have the first telescope was amicably settled by Mr. McCormick 's withdrawal of his claim to it .. Another circumstance which probably . facilitated the undertaking was that a rival house had meanwhile arisen in England , in the persons of Thomas Cooke &amp; Sons , of York , who had made a glass of twentyfive inches aperture for R. S. Newall , Esq. , of Gateshead , England . This glass was much larger than that of the Chicago telescope ; a state of things to which the Clarks were by no means disposed to submit . But for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undertake anything larger than twenty-four inches , but they now very readily consented to try twenty-six . While negotiating the contract , the writer contended persistently for some provision which would enable the government to secure a larger telescope than Mr. McCormick , but they would agree to nothing of the sort , the supposed right of that gentleman to a telescope of equal size being guarded as completely as if he had been a party to the negotiations . As the only establishment in the world to be entrusted with the making of the inALVAN CLARK . // strument was that of the Clarks , so only a single firm could be relied on to furnish glass discs of the necessary size and purity for the lenses , namely , that of Chance &amp; Co. , of Birmingham , England , from whom Mr. Clark had procured nearly all his optical glass during the twenty years he had been making telescopes . As soon as the contract with the government was completed , George B. Clark , the same who melted the bell in the kitchen fire twenty-seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract with Chance &amp; Co. for the glass . Making discs of the required size proved to be a task of such difficulty , that more than a year elapsed before entire success was reached , a number of trials having failed in the meantime . To give our readers a clear idea of the subsequent operations , we must describe the construction of an achromatic object glass , or objective , as it is usually termed . Every one knows that when light passes through a refracting surface it is decomposed , or separated into a number of prismatic colors . The result of this is that a lens can not bring all the rays from a luminous object to the same focus , the focus for red rays being always more distant than that for blue rays , so that there is no distinct image . In consequence , Newton and his contemporaries considered the construction of refracting telescopes which would show an object with entire distinctness to be impossible . But Dollond , an English optician of the last century , conceived the idea of combining two lenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a way that each should counteract the effect of the other in decomposing the light , but should leave an outstanding difference in their refracting power , and thus bring all the rays to the same focus . The two sorts of glass thus used are flint and crown glass , of which the former has about double the dispersive or decomposing power of the latter . An accompanying figure shows the section of an objective , as made by the Clarks . It will be seen that the flint glass has only one curved surface , while the crown has two . The effects of the two glasses in dispersing the light are equal and opposite , while the crown , having , by its two curved surfaces , the excess of refracting power , brings all the light to a focus . The completed discs of flint and crown glass reached Cambridge in December , 1871 . By the terms of the contract the first payment of ten thousand dollars was to be made when the glasses were tested and found of proper quality ; they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests were'made by direct optical examination , and by polarized light . To apply the first , the glass was set up on its edge between firm supports , in the middle of a large , nearly dark room . A lamp was set at one end of the room , so as to shine upon the back surface of the glass at right angles ; behind the glass was placed a large lens of short focus , so that the light of the lamp passed through both the lens and the disc , and came to a focus at about an equal distance on the other side . The eye being placed exactly at this focus , that portion of the glass disc backed by the lens appeared as a brilliantly illuminated surface , on which the slightest defects were magnified in a startling degree . The minutest specks , bubbles , and scratches appeared as huge deformities , and any vein of unequal density would appear as a wave on the bright surface . The practiced eye of the elder Clark soon detected such a wave . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would not give a penny for it . " The apparent defect was soon seen by all . The important question was whether it was in the interior of the glass or on the surface . To settle this its position - was marked by pasting a pointed strip of paper on the glass , and the lamp was moved to one side so as to shine through the glass obliquely , and the position of the wave was again examined . If in the interior of the glass , it would seem to move away from the paper point , in consequence of parallax . No such change of position was perceptible , showing that the defect , whatever it might be , did not extend into the interior . Careful examination showed several other lines of the same sort , but the test indicated that they were all on the same surface , and would therefore be removed in the operation of grinding the glass . It was still of interest to learn what they really were , and a careftil examination showed that they were only accidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give an even surface to the glass , which had not been entirely removed by the polisher . This first test having been successful on both glasses , that by polarized light was applied . Hearers of Professor Tyndall 's lectures last winter may remember how , by // 5 ' S N C - SE -I Cu H N C SECTION OF OBJECTIVE . glasses were thus roughly brought to the desired shape in a few days . The forms chosen were m u c h more simple than those usually employed in curiously enough , it disappeared during the grinding , so that when the lenses were completed , no trace of unequal annealing could be seen . The application of these tests was corn-. pleted early in January , 1872 , and the work of grinding was immediately commenced . Owing to the great size of the glasses the first rough grinding was done by machinery , the " grindstone " being a rapidly revolving iron wheel , over which a stream of water and sand was kept running . The simply submitting a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he was able to change its action on the light in a remarkable manner . This property of polarized light affords the most delicate test of the equal annealing of glass . To apply the test , the glasses were open air , and laid on the ground upon a piece of black cloth . Each glass was then viewed in such a way that the light of the sky or clouds should be reflected from THE NEW WASHINGTON TELESCOPE . its under surface , and reach the eye after twice traversing its thickness . This light was viewed through a Nicol 's prism held in the hand , and turned round and round , the glass also being turned round so that the light should be examined in all directions . The result indicated that the flint glass was perfectly uniform , while in the crown there were very slight circles of strain from the center to the circumference . This defect would not interfere with the usefulness of the glass , and large glasses , the crown glass being double convex , with an equal curvature on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the other side was concave , with the same curvature as the crown glass . The process of grinding and polishing was now carried on in the usual manner . The tools are very simple-round plates of cast iron , about three feet in diameter , hollowed out to suit the curves of the lens . They have somewhat the appearance of huge shallow saucers , or more nearly still , . // of the shallow iron drinking cups attached to pumps or hydrants in some of our cities . Three of these tools were necessary , one nearly flat , for the inner surface of the flint glass , one convex , for its outer surface , and one concave , for the crown glass . The surface of the tool is covered with coarse emery and water , the glass is laid upon it , and the grinding is carried on by sliding the glass back and forth on the tool . While sliding , the glass is slowly turned round so that the grinding strokes occur successively in every direction on the glass , . while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other direction , so that the strokes are made successively in every direction on the tool . The result of these combined motions is that every inequality , either on the glass or the tool , is gradually worn away , and both are reduced to portions of nearly perfect spheres . When this result is attained , the grinding is continued with emery of continually greater degrees of fineness , until the surface becomes quite smooth . The next operation is that of polishing . The whole tool is covered with a thin coating of pitch , which is pressed while still warm into the proper shape . It is then covered with a layer of water and the polishing rouge , and the glass is again laid upon it , and kept in motion in the same way as in the fine grinding . Thus each surface of the two glasses is speedily brought to a high polish . The operations we have thus far described require no extraordinary skill on the part of the workman . With a little patience and practice almost any one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention of the achromatic telescope . But , such a glass would by no means serve the purposes of astronomy now , and the chances of a glass of any size turning out exactly right on the first trial are very slight . The skill of the optician is now called into play to rectify the figure . Two formidable difficulties have to be overcome , to find what the defects of the glass are , and where they are situated , and then to remove them without introducing others . To find the defects , the g*asses are put together , set up on edge , facing a luminous point at a distance e lual to ten or fifteen times the focal length . The image of the point formed in the focus of the glass is then examined with an eye-piece of high power , or the eye is placed exactly in the focus , and the aspect of the glass noted as the light from the I ) oint passes through it . By these means the skilled optician can judge where the curves of the glasses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ari* now taken back to the tool and the polishing process is recoinmenced , only pressing upon those parts of the glass where it has to be ground away . The glass is then tried again , and again returned to the polisher . The defects in a small glass can be thus polished away in a few days , but as the size is increased the process becomes more and more tedious , and the difficulties of judging what the defects are , and of handling the glass on the polisher so as to diminish them , increase enormously . It is in this tentative process of gradually working out every defect of // figure , and even in compensating defects in the uniformity of the glass itself by a suitable change of figure , that the Clarks have exhibited their unrivaled skill . So tedious did they expect the process to be in the case of the great telescope that they asked three years for its completion . But the glass was worked into shape with unexpected rapidity . We have said that the operation was commenced in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass was in such good shape that only an expert could see any defect whatever . Looking through it , we could read a microscopic photograph , illegible to the naked eye , at the distance of some four hundred feet . Had an opportunity offered , we might have read a love-letter over a young lady 's shoulder half a mile away . Artificial double stars , one-third of a second apart , were clearly separated . In hands less severely critical than those of makers , it would have passed as optically perfect . Nevertheless , four months more were spent on it , and it was not till October that it was reported finished and the payment then due requested . The influence of temperature on its figure was now quite perceptible . In the evening , while temperature was falling , the defect of spherical aberration was one way , but after it became stationary the defect was slightly in the opposite direction . The telescope is by no means finished with the glass . The latter must be carried in one end of the tube , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tube must admit of being pointed with ease and celerity in any required-direction . The observer must be able to tell , at any moment , the oirection in which it points with extreme precision . It must admit of being moved by clock work in such a way that as the earth revolves from west to east the telescope shall revolve from east to west with exactly the same velocity , and thus point steadily at the same star . The details of the machinery for attaining these and a multitude of other objects have required a large amount of thought , contrivance , and calculation , and it is only after the expiration of another year that everything is complete . The construction of a building in which a telescope is to be placed is second in importance only to that of the instrument itself ; from the fact that defects in the structure may seriously interfere with the efficiency of the instrument . The sole object of the building is to protect the instrument and observer against wind and weather ; in all other respects its influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currents of warm and cold air around a telescope interfere with seeing by keeping the object observed in a state of continual agitation . Any one who has looked at a distant object along a street or waI1 heated by the sun 's rays , or above a hot stove , has noted the agitation produced by irregular refraction of the light while passing through the currents of warm air . In the telescope this agitation is increased in the ratio of the magnifying power . Consequently in large instruments , it can never be entirely avoided , and is greatly increased by any notable difference of temperature between the walls of the building , the air inside the room , and the air outside . Perfect uniformity of temperature around the instrument is therefore necessary : no matter how cold outside , it must be equally cold inside the observing room . Now , when the latter has thick brick or stone walls , and is constructed , in the usual way , on top of a great building , the walls are heated up by the sun 's rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at night as fast as the air , and the required uniformity of temperature becomes impossible . The larger the dome the harder it is to cool , and hence the greater the evil . Architects are great offenders against astronomy in this respect , everything they like being positively injurious . So , in erecting the dome for the great Washington telescope , no architect was employed , the plans being prepared by a competent engineer and draughtsman under the immediate direction of the astronomer , and the work being executed under the general supervision of the latter . The floor of the dome is on the same level with the ground floor of the main building , and is therefore very easy of access ; the walls , above the floor , are of heavy oak timber , covered with thin galvanized iron , while the dome itself is of pine , covered in the same way . Although of forty-one feet interior diameter , it can be turned round by one man in about three minutes , the machinery for this purpose being the simplest possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be easy to secure the requisite equality of temperature , while there is no building below to cause currents of warm air . The only corresponding drawback is that a portion // of the horizon is cut off from the sweep of the telescope , but , as astronomical observations are scarcely ever made near the horizon , this is not a serious matter . To all the other advantages of this style of building we must add that of economy . The total cost of the tower , dome , and foundation for the instrument , including three rooms for the use of the observers , was about $14,000 , and the price of the instrument itself being about $48,000 , the entire cost of building and telescope will be about $62,000 . One or two thousand more may be expended in completing all the arrangements , but this will be all . The first question the public always asks about a great telescope is " how does it compare with Lord Rosse 's telescope ? " The question whether the great Washington telescope will prove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the comparison is not to be simply made with the telescope of Lord Rosse . If we seek for the telescope which has , in recent times , been most effective in the discovery of objects invisible with other instruments , we shall find it to be not Lord Rosse 's giant reflector , but those of Mr. William Lassel of England . In 1848 , Professor Bond , at Cambridge , discovered an eighth satellite of Saturn , and the discovery was made independently by Mr. Lassel only a day or two afterward . This gentleman also discovered the satellite of Neptune and two new satellites of Uranus , and his telescopes are , we believe , the only ones with which the latter bodies have actually been observed . His largest telescope was a reflector of four feet aperture , while Lord Rosse 's great reflector is of six feet aperture , and ought , theoretically , to show an object with twice the brilliancy of Mr. Lassel 's . But , for some reason , it has never proved so effective as the latter . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescopes . His great forty foot reflector was , perhaps , the most celebrated of modern times , yet , he rarely used it ; and as nearly all his discoveries and researches , even those which required the greatest telescopic power , were made with a twenty foot rufle tor , we may judge that he fcund the latter about as effective as the former . If we can not judge the real power of different reflecting telescopes by their size , it must be much more difficult to compare the new Washington telescope , which is a refractor , with these great reflectors . A comparison of what the two classes of telescopes ought , theoretically , to do is indeed quite easy , and a simple calculation will show that our new refractor is theoretically equivalent to a reflecting telescope of about three feet aperture , which is much less than that of the great reflectors of Rosse and Lassel . Therefore the reflecting telescopes have , theoretically , the advantage , because it is so much more easy to construct a large reflector than a large refractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to several drawbacks , the most serious of which are the difficulties of keeping every part of the great mirror in perfect polish and in proper figure . The slightest distortion of the mirror , even that produced by its own weight , will totally destroy the image of a star in the focus ; it must , therefore , be supported by a complicated system of machinery , which is liable , in the course of time , to get out of order . In most great reflectors the observer has to mount to the upper end of the telescope and look down into the mirror , which is a great inconvenience . In the great telescope recently made by Grubb , of Dublin , for the Melbourne Observatory , this difficulty is avoided by the use of a second *reflector , which throws the light back through an opening in the center of the first one , so that the observer stands below the latter , and looks up through the opening . Here , however , two reflectors have to be kept in order instead of one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these drawbacks is that great reflectors have seldom proved efficient in regular and continued use , and it is not at all unlikely that the new Washington glass will show anything ever seen by any other instrument . That it will be capable of doing more steady work in the measurement of minute objects , and in the gauging of the heavens , than any other ever made , the writer does not doubt ; it is , however , necessary that its owners , the people of the United States , shall allow their astronomers the uninterrupted use of it . As only an insignificant fraction of the entire people can see it under any circumstances , it is expected that the masses who can not see it will support the astronomers in their resolution to allow no one else to look through it , especially whcn they know that its use as a general gazing instrument is entirely incompatible with its use in advancing astronomy . If any are thus disappointed , they must allow // us to console them with the assurance that and Saturn , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the public with a small telescope as with a large wish to look , such as the moon , Jupiter one . @
