txt A very exciting capture of a gang of burglars was made last night at Oaktown , a thriving village nine miles north of this city . On Wednesday the Postmaster received a letter from the Postmaster of Bloomfield , Ind. , giving him notice that a gang of burglars from Bloomfield would visit Oaktown for the purpose of plundering its stores ; also describing a young man , Mont John , who would accompany the gang , but who was to be protected , as he was playing the part of a detective . That night five men were stationed in each business house , but no attack was made . These precautions were repeated last night . About 11 o'clock the men in Madigan 's saloon heard a noise at the door , and immediately prepared for work , so that when the door yielded to the force of a pinch-bar the burglars , three in number , found themselves looking into the muzzles of four revolvers .
