txt //the spirit we are of , " whilst allusions to the intellect are of very rare occurrence . " A handful of good life , " says George Herbert , " is worth a bushel of learning . " Not that learning is to be despised , but that it must be allied to goodness . Intellectual capacity is sometimes found associated with the meanest moral character with abject servility to those in high places , and arrogance to those of low estate . A man may be accomplished in art , literature , and science , and yet , in honesty , virtue , truthfulness , and the spirit of duty , be entitled to take rank after many a poor and illiterate peasant . " You insist , " wrote Perthes to a friend , " on respect for learned men . I say , Amen ! But , at the same time , do n't forget that largeness of mind , depth of thought , appreciation of the lofty , experience of the world , delicacy of manner , tact and energy in action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all these may be wanting in a man who may yet be very learned . " 102 When some one , in Sir Walter Scott 's hearing , made a remark as to the value of literary talents and accomplishments , as if they were above all things to be esteemed and honoured , he observed , " God help us ! what a poor world this would be if that were the true doctrine ! I have read books enough , and observed and conversed with enough of eminent and splendidly-cultured minds , too , in my time ; but I assure you , I have heard higher sentiments from the lips of poor UNEDUCATED men and women , when exerting the spirit of severe yet gentle heroism under difficulties and afflictions , or speaking their simple thoughts as to circumstances in the lot of friends and neighbours , than I ever yet met with out of the Bible . We shall never learn to feel and respect our real calling and destiny , unless we have taught ourselves to consider everything as moonshine , compared with the education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any necessary connection with elevation of character . On the contrary , it is much more frequently the cause of its corruption and degradation . Wealth and corruption , luxury and vice , have very close affinities to each other . Wealth , in the hands of men of weak purpose , of deficient self-control , or of ill-regulated passions , is only a temptation and a snare  --  the source , it may be , of infinite mischief to themselves , and often to others . On the contrary , a condition of comparative poverty is compatible with character in its highest form . A man may possess only his industry , his frugality , his integrity , and yet stand high in the rank of true manhood . The advice which Burns 's father gave him was the best : " He bade me act a manly part , though I had ne'er a farthing , For without an honest manly heart no man was worth regarding . " One of the purest and noblest characters the writer ever knew was a labouring man in a northern county , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounting to more than ten shillings a week . Though possessed of only the rudiments of common education , obtained at an ordinary parish school , he was a man full of wisdom and thoughtfulness . His library consisted of the Bible , ' Flavel , ' and ' Boston '  --  books which , excepting the first , probably few readers have ever heard of . This good man might have sat for the portrait of Wordsworth 's well-known ' Wanderer . ' When he had lived his modest life of work and worship , and finally went to his rest , he left behind him a reputation for practical wisdom , for genuine goodness , and for helpfulness in every good work , which greater and richer men might have envied . When Luther died , he left behind him , as set forth in his will , " no ready money , no treasure of coin of any description . " He was so poor at one part of his life , that he was under the necessity of earning his bread by turning , gardening , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thus working with his hands , he was moulding the character of his country ; and he was morally stronger , and vastly more honoured and followed , than all the princes of Germany . Character is property . It is the noblest of possessions . It is an estate in the general goodwill and respect of men ; and they who invest in it  --  though they may not become rich in this world 's goods  --  will find their reward in esteem and reputation fairly and honourably won . And it is right that in life good qualities should tell  --  that industry , virtue , and goodness should rank the highest  --  and that the really best men should be foremost . Simple honesty of purpose in a man goes a long way in life , if founded on a just estimate of himself and a steady obedience to the rule he knows and feels to be right . It holds a man straight , gives him strength and sustenance , and forms a mainspring of vigorous action . " No man , " once said Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ,  --  no , nor to be wise ; but every man is bound to be honest . " 104 But the purpose , besides being honest , must be inspired by sound principles , and pursued with undeviating adherence to truth , integrity , and uprightness . Without principles , a man is like a ship without rudder or compass , left to drift hither and thither with every wind that blows . He is as one without law , or rule , or order , or government . " Moral principles , " says Hume , " are social and universal . They form , in a manner , the PARTY of humankind against vice and disorder , its common enemy . " Epictetus once received a visit from a certain magnificent orator going to Rome on a lawsuit , who wished to learn from the stoic something of his philosophy . Epictetus received his visitor coolly , not believing in his sincerity . " You will only criticise my style , " said he ; " not really wishing to learn principles . "  --  " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I attend to that sort of thing ; I shall be a mere pauper , like you , with no plate , nor equipage , nor land . "  --  " I do n't WANT such things , " replied Epictetus ; " and besides , you are poorer than I am , after all . Patron or no patron , what care I ? You DO care . I am richer than you . I do n't care what Caesar thinks of me . I flatter no one . This is what I have , instead of your gold and silver plate . You have silver vessels , but earthenware reasons , principles , appetites . My mind to me a kingdom is , and it furnishes me with abundant and happy occupation in lieu of your restless idleness . All your possessions seem small to you ; mine seem great to me . Your desire is insatiate  --  mine is satisfied . " 105 Talent is by no means rare in the world ; nor is even genius . But can the talent be trusted ?  --  can the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is this quality more than any other that commands the esteem and respect , and secures the confidence of others . Truthfulness is at the foundation of all personal excellence . It exhibits itself in conduct . It is rectitude  --  truth in action , and shines through every word and deed . It means reliableness , and convinces other men that it can be trusted . And a man is already of consequence in the world when it is known that he can be relied on ,  --  that when he says he knows a thing , he does know it ,  --  that when he says he will do a thing , he can do , and does it . Thus reliableness becomes a passport to the general esteem and confidence of mankind . In the affairs of life or of business , it is not intellect that tells so much as character ,  --  not brains so much as heart ,  --  not genius so much as self-control , patience , and discipline , regulated by judgment . Hence there is no better provision for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair share of ordinary good sense guided by rectitude . Good sense , disciplined by experience and inspired by goodness , issues in practical wisdom . Indeed , goodness in a measure implies wisdom  --  the highest wisdom  --  the union of the worldly with the spiritual . " The correspondences of wisdom and goodness , " says Sir Henry Taylor , " are manifold ; and that they will accompany each other is to be inferred , not only because men 's wisdom makes them good , but because their goodness makes them wise . " 106 It is because of this controlling power of character in life that we often see men exercise an amount of influence apparently out of all proportion to their intellectual endowments . They appear to act by means of some latent power , some reserved force , which acts secretly , by mere presence . As Burke said of a powerful nobleman of the last century , " his virtues were his means . " The secret is , that the aims of such men are felt to be pure and noble , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reputation of men of genuine character may be of slow growth , their true qualities can not be wholly concealed . They may be misrepresented by some , and misunderstood by others ; misfortune and adversity may , command the confidence which they really deserve . It has been said of Sheridan that , had he possessed reliableness of character , he might have ruled the world ; whereas , for want of it , his splendid gifts were comparatively useless . He dazzled and amused , but was without weight or influence in life or politics . Even the poor pantomimist of Drury Lane felt himself his superior . Thus , when Delpini one day pressed the manager for arrears of salary , Sheridan sharply reproved him , telling him he had forgotten his station . " No , indeed , Monsieur Sheridan , I have not , " retorted Delpini ; " I know the difference between us perfectly well . In birth , parentage , and education , you are superior to me ; but in life , character , and behaviour , I am superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a great man of character . He was thirty-five before he gained a seat in Parliament , yet he found time to carve his name deep in the political history of England . He was a man of great gifts , and of transcendent force of character . Yet he had a weakness , which proved a serious defect  --  it was his want of temper ; his genius was sacrificed to his irritability . And without this apparently minor gift of temper , the most splendid endowments may be comparatively valueless to their possessor . Character is formed by a variety of minute circumstances , more or less under the regulation and control of the individual . Not a day passes without its discipline , whether for good or for evil . There is no act , however trivial , but has its train of consequences , as there is no hair so small but casts its shadow . It was a wise saying of Mrs. Schimmelpenninck 's mother , never to give way to what is little ; or by that little , however you may despise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every thought , every feeling , contributes to the education of the temper , the habits , and understanding ; and exercises an inevitable influence upon all the acts of our future life . Thus character is undergoing constant change , for better or for worse  --  either being elevated on the one hand , or degraded on the other . " There is no fault nor folly of my life , " says Mr. Ruskin , " that does not rise up against me , and take away my joy , and shorten my power of possession , of sight , of understanding . And every past effort of my life , every gleam of rightness or good in it , is with me now , to help me in my grasp of this art and its vision . " 107 The mechanical law , that action and reaction are equal , holds true also in morals . Good deeds act and react on the doers of them ; and so do evil . Not only so : they produce like effects , by the influence of example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is not the creature , so much as he is the creator , of circumstances : 108 and , by the exercise of his freewill , he can direct his actions so that they shall be productive of good rather than evil . " Nothing can work me damage but myself , " said St. Bernard ; " the harm that I sustain I carry about with me ; and I am never a real sufferer but by my own fault . " The best sort of character , however , can not be formed without effort . There needs the exercise of constant self-watchfulness , self-discipline , and self-control . There may be much faltering , stumbling , and temporary defeat ; difficulties and temptations manifold to be battled with and overcome ; but if the spirit be strong and the heart be upright , no one need despair of ultimate success . The very effort to advance  --  to arrive at a higher standard of character than we have reached  --  is inspiring and invigorating ; and even though we may fall short of it , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in an upward direction . And with the light of great examples to guide us  --  representatives of humanity in its best forms  --  every one is not only justified , but bound in duty , to aim at reaching the highest standard of character : not to become the richest in means , but in spirit ; not the greatest in worldly position , but in true honour ; not the most intellectual , but the most virtuous ; not the most powerful and influential , but the most truthful , upright , and honest . It was very characteristic of the late Prince Consort  --  a man himself of the purest mind , who powerfully impressed and influenced others by the sheer force of his own benevolent nature  --  when drawing up the conditions of the annual prize to be given by Her Majesty at Wellington College , to determine that it should be awarded , not to the cleverest boy , nor to the most bookish boy , nor to the most precise , diligent , and prudent boy ,  --  but to the noblest boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a large-hearted , high-motived man . 109 Character exhibits itself in conduct , guided and inspired by principle , integrity , and practical wisdom . In its highest form , it is the individual will acting energetically under the influence of religion , morality , and reason . It chooses its way considerately , and pursues it steadfastly ; esteeming duty above reputation , and the approval of conscience more than the world 's praise . While respecting the personality of others , it preserves its own individuality and independence ; and has the courage to be morally honest , though it may be unpopular , trusting tranquilly to time and experience for recognition . Although the force of example will always exercise great influence upon the formation of character , the self-originating and sustaining force of one 's own spirit must be the mainstay . This alone can hold up the life , and give individual independence and energy . " Unless man can erect himself above himself , " said Daniel , a poet of the Elizabethan era , " how poor a thing is man ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of will , which is the root , and wisdom , which is the stem of character  --  life will be indefinite and purposeless  --  like a body of stagnant water , instead of a running stream doing useful work and keeping the machinery of a district in motion . When the elements of character are brought into action by determinate will , and , influenced by high purpose , man enters upon and courageously perseveres in the path of duty , at whatever cost of worldly interest , he may be said to approach the summit of his being . He then exhibits character in its most intrepid form , and embodies the highest idea of manliness . The acts of such a man become repeated in the life and action of others . His very words live and become actions . Thus every word of Luther 's rang through Germany like a trumpet . As Richter said of him , " His words were half-battles . " And thus Luther 's life became transfused into the life of his country , and still lives in the character of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity and a soul of goodness , may only represent the embodied principle of evil . It is observed by Novalis , in his ' Thoughts on Morals , ' that the ideal of moral perfection has no more dangerous rival to contend with than the ideal of the highest strength and the most energetic life , the maximum of the barbarian  --  which needs only a due admixture of pride , ambition , and selfishness , to be a perfect ideal of the devil . Amongst men of such stamp are found the greatest scourges and devastators of the world  --  those elect scoundrels whom Providence , in its inscrutable designs , permits to fulfil their mission of destruction upon earth . 1010 Very different is the man of energetic character inspired by a noble spirit , whose actions are governed by rectitude , and the law of whose life is duty . He is just and upright ,  --  in his business dealings , in his public action , and in his family life  --  justice being as essential in the government of a home as of a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words and in his work . He will be generous and merciful to his opponents , as well as to those who are weaker than himself . It was truly said of Sheridan  --  who , with all his improvidence , was generous , and never gave pain  --  that , " His wit in the combat , as gentle as bright , Never carried a heart-stain away on its blade . " Such also was the character of Fox , who commanded the affection and service of others by his uniform heartiness and sympathy . He was a man who could always be most easily touched on the side of his honour . Thus , the story is told of a tradesman calling upon him one day for the payment of a promissory note which he presented . Fox was engaged at the time in counting out gold . The tradesman asked to be paid from the money before him . " No , " said Fox , " I owe this money to Sheridan ; it is a debt of honour ; if any accident happened to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , " said the tradesman , " I change MY debt into one of honour ; " and he tore up the note . Fox was conquered by the act : he thanked the man for his confidence , and paid him , saying , " Then Sheridan must wait ; yours is the debt of older standing . " The man of character is conscientious . He puts his conscience into his work , into his words , into his every action . When Cromwell asked the Parliament for soldiers in lieu of the decayed serving-men and tapsters who filled the Commonwealth 's army , he required that they should be men " who made some conscience of what they did ; " and such were the men of which his celebrated regiment of " Ironsides " was composed . The man of character is also reverential . The possession of this quality marks the noblest , and highest type of manhood and womanhood : reverence for things consecrated by the homage of generations  --  for high objects , pure thoughts , and noble aims  --  for the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our contemporaries . Reverence is alike indispensable to the happiness of individuals , of families , and of nations . Without it there can be no trust , no faith , no confidence , either in man or God  --  neither social peace nor social progress . For reverence is but another word for religion , which binds men to each other , and all to God . " The man of noble spirit , " says Sir Thomas Overbury , " converts all occurrences into experience , between which experience and his reason there is marriage , and the issue are his actions . He moves by affection , not for affection ; he loves glory , scorns shame , and governeth and obeyeth with one countenance , for it comes from one consideration . Knowing reason to be no idle gift of nature , he is the steersman of his own destiny . Truth is his goddess , and he takes pains to get her , not to look like her . Unto the society of men he is a sun , whose clearness directs their steps in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the example of the indifferent , the medicine of the vicious . Thus time goeth not from him , but with him , and he feels age more by the strength of his soul than by the weakness of his body . Thus feels he no pain , but esteems all such things as friends , that desire to file off his fetters , and help him out of prison . " 1011 Energy of will  --  self-originating force  --  is the soul of every great character . Where it is , there is life ; where it is not , there is faintness , helplessness , and despondency . " The strong man and the waterfall , " says the proverb , " channel their own path . " The energetic leader of noble spirit not only wins a way for himself , but carries others with him . His every act has a personal significance , indicating vigour , independence , and self-reliance , and unconsciously commands respect , admiration , and homage . Such intrepidity of character characterised Luther , Cromwell , Washington , Pitt , Wellington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am convinced , " said Mr. Gladstone , in describing the qualities of the late Lord Palmerston in the House of Commons , shortly after his death  --  " I am convinced that it was the force of will , a sense of duty , and a determination not to give in , that enabled him to make himself a model for all of us who yet remain and follow him , with feeble and unequal steps , in the discharge of our duties ; it was that force of will that in point of fact did not so much struggle against the infirmities of old age , but actually repelled them and kept them at a distance . And one other quality there is , at least , that may be noticed without the smallest risk of stirring in any breast a painful emotion . It is this , that Lord Palmerston had a nature incapable of enduring anger or any sentiment of wrath . This freedom from wrathful sentiment was not the result of painful effort , but the spontaneous fruit of the mind . It was a noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all others it was delightful to observe , delightful also to remember in connection with him who has left us , and with whom we have no longer to do , except in endeavouring to profit by his example wherever it can lead us in the path of duty and of right , and of bestowing on him those tributes of admiration and affection which he deserves at our hands . " The great leader attracts to himself men of kindred character , drawing them towards him as the loadstone draws iron . Thus , Sir John Moore early distinguished the three brothers Napier from the crowd of officers by whom he was surrounded , and they , on their part , repaid him by their passionate admiration . They were captivated by his courtesy , his bravery , and his lofty disinterestedness ; and he became the model whom they resolved to imitate , and , if possible , to emulate . " Moore 's influence , " says the biographer of Sir William Napier , " had a signal effect in forming and maturing their characters ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those three men , while his early discovery of their mental and moral qualities is a proof of Moore 's own penetration and judgment of character . " There is a contagiousness in every example of energetic conduct . The brave man is an inspiration to the weak , and compels them , as it were , to follow him . Thus Napier relates that at the combat of Vera , when the Spanish centre was broken and in flight , a young officer , named Havelock , sprang forward , and , waving his hat , called upon the Spaniards within sight to follow him . Putting spurs to his horse , he leapt the abbatis which protected the French front , and went headlong against them . The Spaniards were electrified ; in a moment they dashed after him , cheering for " EL CHICO BLANCO ! " 10the fair boy , and with one shock they broke through the French and sent them flying downhill . 1012 And so it is in ordinary life . The good and the great draw others after them ; they lighten and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are as so many living centres of beneficent activity . Let a man of energetic and upright character be appointed to a position of trust and authority , and all who serve under him become , as it were , conscious of an increase of power . When Chatham was appointed minister , his personal influence was at once felt through all the ramifications of office . Every sailor who served under Nelson , and knew he was in command , shared the inspiration of the hero . When Washington consented to act as commander-in-chief , it was felt as if the strength of the American forces had been more than doubled . Many years late ; in 1798 , when Washington , grown old , had withdrawn from public life and was living in retirement at Mount Vernon , and when it seemed probable that France would declare war against the United States , President Adams wrote to him , saying , " We must have your name , if you will permit us to use it ; there will be more efficacy in it than in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great President 's noble character and eminent abilities were held by his countrymen ! 1013 An incident is related by the historian of the Peninsular War , illustrative of the personal influence exercised by a great commander over his followers . The British army lay at Sauroren , before which Soult was advancing , prepared to attack , in force . Wellington was absent , and his arrival was anxiously looked for . Suddenly a single horseman was seen riding up the mountain alone . It was the Duke , about to join his troops . One of Campbell 's Portuguese battalions first descried him , and raised a joyful cry ; then the shrill clamour , caught up by the next regiment , soon swelled as it ran along the line into that appalling shout which the British soldier is wont to give upon the edge of battle , and which no enemy ever heard unmoved . Suddenly he stopped at a conspicuous point , for he desired both armies should know he was there , and a double spy who was present pointed out Soult , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellington fixed his eyes on that formidable man , and , as if speaking to himself , he said : " Yonder is a great commander ; but he is cautious , and will delay his attack to ascertain the cause of those cheers ; that will give time for the Sixth Division to arrive , and I shall beat him "  --  which he did . 1014 In some cases , personal character acts by a kind of talismanic influence , as if certain men were the organs of a sort of supernatural force . " If I but stamp on the ground in Italy , " said Pompey , " an army will appear . " At the voice of Peter the Hermit , as described by the historian , " Europe arose , and precipitated itself upon Asia . " It was said of the Caliph Omar that his walking-stick struck more terror into those who saw it than another man 's sword . The very names of some men are like the sound of a trumpet . When the Douglas lay mortally wounded on the field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder than before , saying there was a tradition in his family that a dead Douglas should win a battle . His followers , inspired by the sound , gathered fresh courage , rallied , and conquered ; and thus , in the words of the Scottish poet :  --  " The Douglas dead , his name hath won the field . " 1015 There have been some men whose greatest conquests have been achieved after they themselves were dead . " Never , " says Michelet , " was Caesar more alive , more powerful , more terrible , than when his old and worn-out body , his withered corpse , lay pierced with blows ; he appeared then purified , redeemed ,  --  that which he had been , despite his many stains  --  the man of humanity . " 1016 Never did the great character of William of Orange , surnamed the Silent , exercise greater power over his countrymen than after his assassination at Delft by the emissary of the Jesuits . On the very day of his murder the Estates of Holland resolved " to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uttermost , without sparing gold or blood ; " and they kept their word . The same illustration applies to all history and morals . The career of a great man remains an enduring monument of human energy . The man dies and disappears ; but his thoughts and acts survive , and leave an indelible stamp upon his race . And thus the spirit of his life is prolonged and perpetuated , moulding the thought and will , and thereby contributing to form the character of the future . It is the men that advance in the highest and best directions , who are the true beacons of human progress . They are as lights set upon a hill , illumining the moral atmosphere around them ; and the light of their spirit continues to shine upon all succeeding generations . It is natural to admire and revere really great men . They hallow the nation to which they belong , and lift up not only all who live in their time , but those who live after them . Their great example becomes the common heritage of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most glorious of legacies to mankind . They connect the present with the past , and help on the increasing purpose of the future ; holding aloft the standard of principle , maintaining the dignity of human character , and filling the mind with traditions and instincts of all that is most worthy and noble in life . Character , embodied in thought and deed , is of the nature of immortality . The solitary thought of a great thinker will dwell in the minds of men for centuries until at length it works itself into their daily life and practice . It lives on through the ages , speaking as a voice from the dead , and influencing minds living thousands of years apart . Thus , Moses and David and Solomon , Plato and Socrates and Xenophon , Seneca and Cicero and Epictetus , still speak to us as from their tombs . They still arrest the attention , and exercise an influence upon character , though their thoughts be conveyed in languages unspoken by them and in their time unknown . Theodore Parker has said that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than many such states as South Carolina ; that if that state went out of the world to-day , she would not have done so much for the world as Socrates . 1017 Great workers and great thinkers are the true makers of history , which is but continuous humanity influenced by men of character  --  by great leaders , kings , priests , philosophers , statesmen , and patriots  --  the true aristocracy of man . Indeed , Mr. Carlyle has broadly stated that Universal History is , at bottom , but the history of Great Men . They certainly mark and designate the epochs of national life . Their influence is active , as well as reactive . Though their mind is , in a measure ; the product of their age , the public mind is also , to a great extent , their creation . Their individual action identifies the cause  --  the institution . They think great thoughts , cast them abroad , and the thoughts make events . Thus the early Reformers initiated the Reformation , and with it the liberation of modern thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as but the lengthened shadow of some great man : as Islamism of Mahomet , Puritanism of Calvin , Jesuitism of Loyola , Quakerism of Fox , Methodism of Wesley , Abolitionism of Clarkson . Great men stamp their mind upon their age and nation  --  as Luther did upon modern Germany , and Knox upon Scotland . 1018 And if there be one man more than another that stamped his mind on modern Italy , it was Dante . During the long centuries of Italian degradation his burning words were as a watchfire and a beacon to all true men . He was the herald of his nation 's liberty  --  braving persecution , exile , and death , for the love of it . He was always the most national of the Italian poets , the most loved , the most read . From the time of his death all educated Italians had his best passages by heart ; and the sentiments they enshrined inspired their lives , and eventually influenced the history of their nation . " The Italians , " wrote Byron in 1821 , " talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this moment , to an excess which would be ridiculous , but that he deserves their admiration . " 1019 A succession of variously gifted men in different ages  --  extending from Alfred to Albert  --  has in like manner contributed , by their life and example , to shape the multiform character of England . Of these , probably the most influential were the men of the Elizabethan and Cromwellian , and the intermediate periods  --  amongst which we find the great names of Shakspeare , Raleigh , Burleigh , Sidney , Bacon , Milton , Herbert , Hampden , Pym , Eliot , Vane , Cromwell , and many more  --  some of them men of great force , and others of great dignity and purity of character . The lives of such men have become part of the public life of England , and their deeds and thoughts are regarded as among the most cherished bequeathments from the past . So Washington left behind him , as one of the greatest treasures of his country , the example of a stainless life  --  of a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model for his nation to form themselves by in all time to come . And in the case of Washington , as in so many other great leaders of men , his greatness did not so much consist in his intellect , his skill , and his genius , as in his honour , his integrity , his truthfulness , his high and controlling sense of duty  --  in a word , in his genuine nobility of character . Men such as these are the true lifeblood of the country to which they belong . They elevate and uphold it , fortify and ennoble it , and shed a glory over it by the example of life and character which they have bequeathed . " The names and memories of great men , " says an able writer , " are the dowry of a nation . Widowhood , overthrow , desertion , even slavery , can not take away from her this sacred inheritance .... Whenever national life begins to quicken .... the dead heroes rise in the memories of men , and appear to the living to stand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost which feels herself overlooked by such glorious witnesses . They are the salt of the earth , in death as well as in life . What they did once , their descendants have still and always a right to do after them ; and their example lives in their country , a continual stimulant and encouragement for him who has the soul to adopt it . " 1020 But it is not great men only that have to be taken into account in estimating the qualities of a nation , but the character that pervades the great body of the people . When Washington Irving visited Abbotsford , Sir Walter Scott introduced him to many of his friends and favourites , not only amongst the neighbouring farmers , but the labouring peasantry . " I wish to show you , " said Scott , " some of our really excellent plain Scotch people . The character of a nation is not to be learnt from its fine folks , its fine gentlemen and ladies ; such you meet everywhere , and they are everywhere the same . " While statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , the men who found industries and carve out new careers , as well as the common body of working-people , from whom the national strength and spirit are from time to time recruited , must necessarily furnish the vital force and constitute the real backbone of every nation . Nations have their character to maintain as well as individuals ; and under constitutional governments  --  where all classes more or less participate in the exercise of political power  --  the national character will necessarily depend more upon the moral qualities of the many than of the few . And the same qualities which determine the character of individuals , also determine the character of nations . Unless they are highminded , truthful , honest , virtuous , and courageous , they will be held in light esteem by other nations , and be without weight in the world . To have character , they must needs also be reverential , disciplined , self-controlling , and devoted to duty . The nation that has no higher god than pleasure , or even dollars or calico , must needs be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homer 's gods than be devoted to these ; for the heathen deities at least imaged human virtues , and were something to look up to . As for institutions , however good in themselves , they will avail but little in maintaining the standard of national character . It is the individual men , and the spirit which actuates them , that determine the moral standing and stability of nations . Government , in the long run , is usually no better than the people governed . Where the mass is sound in conscience , morals , and habit , the nation will be ruled honestly and nobly . But where they are corrupt , self-seeking , and dishonest in heart , bound neither by truth nor by law , the rule of rogues and wirepullers becomes inevitable . The only true barrier against the despotism of public opinion , whether it be of the many or of the few , is enlightened individual freedom and purity of personal character . Without these there can be no vigorous manhood , no true liberty in a nation . Political rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depraved . Indeed , the more complete a system of popular suffrage , and the more perfect its protection , the more completely will the real character of a people be reflected , as by a mirror , in their laws and government . Political morality can never have any solid existence on a basis of individual immorality . Even freedom , exercised by a debased people , would come to be regarded as a nuisance , and liberty of the press but a vent for licentiousness and moral abomination . Nations , like individuals , derive support and strength from the feeling that they belong to an illustrious race , that they are the heirs of their greatness , and ought to be the perpetuators of their glory . It is of momentous importance that a nation should have a great past 1021 to look back upon . It steadies the life of the present , elevates and upholds it , and lightens and lifts it up , by the memory of the great deeds , the noble sufferings , and the valorous achievements of the men of old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great treasury of experience , which , wisely used , issues in social progress and improvement ; or , misused , issues in dreams , delusions , and failure . Like men , nations are purified and strengthened by trials . Some of the most glorious chapters in their history are those containing the record of the sufferings by means of which their character has been developed . Love of liberty and patriotic feeling may have done much , but trial and suffering nobly borne more than all . A great deal of what passes by the name of patriotism in these days consists of the merest bigotry and narrow-mindedness ; exhibiting itself in national prejudice , national conceit , amid national hatred . It does not show itself in deeds , but in boastings  --  in howlings , gesticulations , and shrieking helplessly for help  --  in flying flags and singing songs  --  and in perpetual grinding at the hurdy-gurdy of long-dead grievances and long-remedied wrongs . To be infested by SUCH a patriotism as this is , perhaps , amongst the greatest curses that can befall any country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a noble patriotism  --  the patriotism that invigorates and elevates a country by noble work  --  that does its duty truthfully and manfully  --  that lives an honest , sober , and upright life , and strives to make the best use of the opportunities for improvement that present themselves on every side ; and at the same time a patriotism that cherishes the memory and example of the great men of old , who , by their sufferings in the cause of religion or of freedom , have won for themselves a deathless glory , and for their nation those privileges of free life and free institutions of which they are the inheritors and possessors . Nations are not to be judged by their size any more than individuals : " it is not growing like a tree In bulk , doth make Man better be . " For a nation to be great , it need not necessarily be big , though bigness is often confounded with greatness . A nation may be very big in point of territory and population and yet be devoid of true greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet what a great life they developed , and how powerful the influence they have exercised on the destinies of mankind ! Greece was not big : the entire population of Attica was less than that of South Lancashire . Athens was less populous than New York ; and yet how great it was in art , in literature , in philosophy , and in patriotism ! 1022 But it was the fatal weakness of Athens that its citizens had no true family or home life , while its freemen were greatly outnumbered by its slaves . Its public men were loose , if not corrupt , in morals . Its women , even the most accomplished , were unchaste . Hence its fall became inevitable , and was even more sudden than its rise . In like manner the decline and fall of Rome was attributable to the general corruption of its people , and to their engrossing love of pleasure and idleness  --  work , in the later days of Rome , being regarded only as fit for slaves . Its citizens ceased to pride themselves on the virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell because it did not deserve to live . And so the nations that are idle and luxurious  --  that " will rather lose a pound of blood , " as old Burton says , " in a single combat , than a drop of sweat in any honest labour "  --  must inevitably die out , and laborious energetic nations take their place . When Louis XIV . asked Colbert how it was that , ruling so great and populous a country as France , he had been unable to conquer so small a country as Holland , the minister replied : " Because , Sire , the greatness of a country does not depend upon the extent of its territory , but on the character of its people . It is because of the industry , the frugality , and the energy of the Dutch that your Majesty has found them so difficult to overcome . " It is also related of Spinola and Richardet , the ambassadors sent by the King of Spain to negotiate a treaty at the Hague in 1608 , that one day they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , sitting down upon the grass , proceed to make a meal of bread-and-cheese and beer . " Who are those travellers ? " asked the ambassadors of a peasant . " These are worshipful masters , the deputies from the States , " was his reply . Spinola at once whispered to his companion , " We must make peace : these are not men to be conquered . " In fine , stability of institutions must depend upon stability of character . Any number of depraved units can not form a great nation . The people may seem to be highly civilised , and yet be ready to fall to pieces at first touch of adversity . Without integrity of individual character , they can have no real strength , cohesion , soundness . They may be rich , polite , and artistic ; and yet hovering on the brink of ruin . If living for themselves only , and with no end but pleasure  --  each little self his own little god  --  such a nation is doomed , and its decay is inevitable . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as next to lost . Where it ceases to esteem and to practise the virtues of truthfulness , honesty , integrity , and justice , it does not deserve to live . And when the time arrives in any country when wealth has so corrupted , or pleasure so depraved , or faction so infatuated the people , that honour , order , obedience , virtue , and loyalty have seemingly become things of the past ; then , amidst the darkness , when honest men  --  if , haply , there be such left  --  are groping about and feeling for each other 's hands , their only remaining hope will be in the restoration and elevation of Individual Character ; for by that alone can a nation be saved ; and if character be irrecoverably lost , then indeed there will be nothing left worth saving . CHAPTER II .  --  HOME POWER . " So build we up the being that we are , Thus deeply drinking in the soul of things , We shall be wise perforce . " WORDSWORTH . " The millstreams that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  --  HELPS . " In the course of a conversation with Madame Campan , Napoleon Buonaparte remarked : ' The old systems of instruction seem to be worth nothing ; what is yet wanting in order that the people should be properly educated ? ' ' MOTHERS , ' replied Madame Campan . The reply struck the Emperor . ' Yes ! ' said he ' here is a system of education in one word . Be it your care , then , to train up mothers who shall know how to educate their children . ' "  --  AIME MARTIN . " Lord ! with what care hast Thou begirt us round ! Parents first season us . Then schoolmasters Deliver us to laws . They send us bound To rules of reason . "  --  GEORGE HERBERT . HOME is the first and most important school of character . It is there that every human being receives his best moral training , or his worst ; for it is there that he imbibes those principles of conduct which endure through manhood , and cease only with life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man ; " and there is a second , that " Mind makes the man ; " but truer than either is a third , that " Home makes the man . " For the home-training includes not only manners and mind , but character . It is mainly in the home that the heart is opened , the habits are formed , the intellect is awakened , and character moulded for good or for evil . From that source , be it pure or impure , issue the principles and maxims that govern society . Law itself is but the reflex of homes . The tiniest bits of opinion sown in the minds of children in private life afterwards issue forth to the world , and become its public opinion ; for nations are gathered out of nurseries , and they who hold the leading-strings of children may even exercise a greater power than those who wield the reins of government . 111 It is in the order of nature that domestic life should be preparatory to social , and that the mind and character should first be formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society are dealt with in detail , and fashioned one by one . From the family they enter life , and advance from boyhood to citizenship . Thus the home may be regarded as the most influential school of civilisation . For , after all , civilisation mainly resolves itself into a question of individual training ; and according as the respective members of society are well or ill-trained in youth , so will the community which they constitute be more or less humanised and civilised . The training of any man , even the wisest , can not fail to be powerfully influenced by the moral surroundings of his early years . He comes into the world helpless , and absolutely dependent upon those about him for nurture and culture . From the very first breath that he draws , his education begins . When a mother once asked a clergyman when she should begin the education of her child , then four years old , he replied : " Madam , if you have not begun already , you have lost those four years . From the first smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins . " But even in this case the education had already begun ; for the child learns by simple imitation , without effort , almost through the pores of the skin . " A figtree looking on a figtree becometh fruitful , " says the Arabian proverb . And so it is with children ; their first great instructor is example . However apparently trivial the influences which contribute to form the character of the child , they endure through life . The child 's character is the nucleus of the man 's ; all after-education is but superposition ; the form of the crystal remains the same . Thus the saying of the poet holds true in a large degree , " The child is father of the man ; " or , as Milton puts it , " The childhood shows the man , as morning shows the day . " Those impulses to conduct which last the longest and are rooted the deepest , always have their origin near our birth . It is then that the germs of virtues or vices , of feelings or sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The child is , as it were , laid at the gate of a new world , and opens his eyes upon things all of which are full of novelty and wonderment . At first it is enough for him to gaze ; but by-and-by he begins to see , to observe , to compare , to learn , to store up impressions and ideas ; and under wise guidance the progress which he makes is really wonderful . Lord Brougham has observed that between the ages of eighteen and thirty months , a child learns more of the material world , of his own powers , of the nature of other bodies , and even of his own mind and other minds , than he acquires in all the rest of his life . The knowledge which a child accumulates , and the ideas generated in his mind , during this period , are so important , that if we could imagine them to be afterwards obliterated , all the learning of a senior wrangler at Cambridge , or a first-classman at Oxford , would be as nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolong his existence for a week . It is in childhood that the mind is most open to impressions , and ready to be kindled by the first spark that falls into it . Ideas are then caught quickly and live lastingly . Thus Scott is said to have received , his first bent towards ballad literature from his mother 's and grandmother 's recitations in his hearing long before he himself had learned to read . Childhood is like a mirror , which reflects in after-life the images first presented to it . The first thing continues for ever with the child . The first joy , the first sorrow , the first success , the first failure , the first achievement , the first misadventure , paint the foreground of his life . All this while , too , the training of the character is in progress  --  of the temper , the will , and the habits  --  on which so much of the happiness of human beings in after-life depends . Although man is endowed with a certain self-acting , self-helping power of contributing to his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the life around him , the bias given to his moral character in early life is of immense importance . Place even the highest-minded philosopher in the midst of daily discomfort , immorality , and vileness , and he will insensibly gravitate towards brutality . How much more susceptible is the impressionable and helpless child amidst such surroundings ! It is not possible to rear a kindly nature , sensitive to evil , pure in mind and heart , amidst coarseness , discomfort , and impurity . Thus homes , which are the nurseries of children who grow up into men and women , will be good or bad according to the power that governs them . Where the spirit of love and duty pervades the home  --  where head and heart bear rule wisely there  --  where the daily life is honest and virtuous  --  where the government is sensible , kind , and loving , then may we expect from such a home an issue of healthy , useful , and happy beings , capable , as they gain the requisite strength , of following the footsteps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and contributing to the welfare of those about them . On the other hand , if surrounded by ignorance , coarseness , and selfishness , they will unconsciously assume the same character , and grow up to adult years rude , uncultivated , and all the more dangerous to society if placed amidst the manifold temptations of what is called civilised life . " Give your child to be educated by a slave , " said an ancient Greek , " and instead of one slave , you will then have two . " The child can not help imitating what he sees . Everything is to him a model  --  of manner , of gesture , of speech , of habit , of character . " For the child , " says Richter , " the most important era of life is that of childhood , when he begins to colour and mould himself by companionship with others . Every new educator effects less than his predecessor ; until at last , if we regard all life as an educational institution , a circumnavigator of the world is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nurse . " 112 Models are therefore of every importance in moulding the nature of the child ; and if we would have fine characters , we must necessarily present before them fine models . Now , the model most constantly before every child 's eye is the Mother . One good mother , said George Herbert , is worth a hundred schoolmasters . In the home she is " loadstone to all hearts , and loadstar to all eyes . " Imitation of her is constant  --  imitation , which Bacon likens to " a globe of precepts . " But example is far more than precept . It is instruction in action . It is teaching without words , often exemplifying more than tongue can teach . In the face of bad example , the best of precepts are of but little avail . The example is followed , not the precepts . Indeed , precept at variance with practice is worse than useless , inasmuch as it only serves to teach the most cowardly of vices  --  hypocrisy . Even children are judges of consistency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the opposite , are quickly seen through . The teaching of the friar was not worth much , who preached the virtue of honesty with a stolen goose in his sleeve . By imitation of acts , the character becomes slowly and imperceptibly , but at length decidedly formed . The several acts may seem in themselves trivial ; but so are the continuous acts of daily life . Like snowflakes , they fall unperceived ; each flake added to the pile produces no sensible change , and yet the accumulation of snowflakes makes the avalanche . So do repeated acts , one following another , at length become consolidated in habit , determine the action of the human being for good or for evil , and , in a word , form the character . It is because the mother , far more than the father , influences the action and conduct of the child , that her good example is of so much greater importance in the home . It is easy to understand how this should be so . The home is the woman 's domain  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over the little subjects she rules there is absolute . They look up to her for everything . She is the example and model constantly before their eyes , whom they unconsciously observe and imitate . Cowley , speaking of the influence of early example , and ideas early implanted in the mind , compares them to letters cut in the bark of a young tree , which grow and widen with age . The impressions then made , howsoever slight they may seem , are never effaced . The ideas then implanted in the mind are like seeds dropped into the ground , which lie there and germinate for a time , afterwards springing up in acts and thoughts and habits . Thus the mother lives again in her children . They unconsciously mould themselves after her manner , her speech , her conduct , and her method of life . Her habits become theirs ; and her character is visibly repeated in them . This maternal love is the visible providence of our race . Its influence is constant and universal . It begins with the education of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prolonged by virtue of the powerful influence which every good mother exercises over her children through life . When launched into the world , each to take part in its labours , anxieties , and trials , they still turn to their mother for consolation , if not for counsel , in their time of trouble and difficulty . The pure and good thoughts she has implanted in their minds when children , continue to grow up into good acts , long after she is dead ; and when there is nothing but a memory of her left , her children rise up and call her blessed . It is not saying too much to aver that the happiness or misery , the enlightenment or ignorance , the civilisation or barbarism of the world , depends in a very high degree upon the exercise of woman 's power within her special kingdom of home . Indeed , Emerson says , broadly and truly , that " a sufficient measure of civilisation is the influence of good women . " Posterity may be said to lie before us in the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that child will eventually become , mainly depends upon the training and example which he has received from his first and most influential educator . Woman , above all other educators , educates humanly . Man is the brain , but woman is the heart of humanity ; he its judgment , she its feeling ; he its strength , she its grace , ornament , and solace . Even the understanding of the best woman seems to work mainly through her affections . And thus , though man may direct the intellect , woman cultivates the feelings , which mainly determine the character . While he fills the memory , she occupies the heart . She makes us love what he can only make us believe , and it is chiefly through her that we are enabled to arrive at virtue . The respective influences of the father and the mother on the training and development of character , are remarkably illustrated in the life of St. Augustine . While Augustine 's father , a poor freeman of Thagaste , proud of his son 's abilities , endeavoured to furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was extolled by his neighbours for the sacrifices he made with that object " beyond the ability of his means "  --  his mother Monica , on the other hand , sought to lead her son 's mind in the direction of the highest good , and with pious care counselled him , entreated him , advised him to chastity , and , amidst much anguish and tribulation , because of his wicked life , never ceased to pray for him until her prayers were heard and answered . Thus her love at last triumphed , and the patience and goodness of the mother were rewarded , not only by the conversion of her gifted son , but also of her husband . Later in life , and after her husband 's death , Monica , drawn by her affection , followed her son to Milan , to watch over him ; and there she died , when he was in his thirty-third year . But it was in the earlier period of his life that her example and instruction made the deepest impression upon his mind , and determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early impressions made upon a child 's mind , springing up into good acts late in life , after an intervening period of selfishness and vice . Parents may do all that they can to develope an upright and virtuous character in their children , and apparently in vain . It seems like bread cast upon the waters and lost . And yet sometimes it happens that long after the parents have gone to their Rest  --  it may be twenty years or more  --  the good precept , the good example set before their sons and daughters in childhood , at length springs up and bears fruit . One of the most remarkable of such instances was that of the Reverend John Newton of Olney , the friend of Cowper the poet . It was long subsequent to the death of both his parents , and after leading a vicious life as a youth and as a seaman , that he became suddenly awakened to a sense of his depravity ; and then it was that the lessons which his mother had given him when a child sprang up vividly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were from the dead , and led him gently back to virtue and goodness . Another instance is that of John Randolph , the American statesman , who once said : " I should have been an atheist if it had not been for one recollection  --  and that was the memory of the time when my departed mother used to take my little hand in hers , and cause me on my knees to say , ' Our Father who art in heaven ! ' " But such instance must , on the whole , be regarded as exceptional . As the character is biassed in early life , so it generally remains , gradually assuming its permanent form as manhood is reached . " Live as long as you may , " said Southey , " the first twenty years are the longest half of your life , " and they are by far the most pregnant in consequences . When the worn-out slanderer and voluptuary , Dr. Wolcot , lay on his deathbed , one of his friends asked if he could do anything to gratify him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly , " give me back my youth . " Give him but that , and he would repent  --  he would reform . But it was all too late ! His life had become bound and enthralled by the chains of habit . ' 113 Gretry , the musical composer , thought so highly of the importance of woman as an educator of character , that he described a good mother as " Nature 's CHEF-D'OEUVRE . " And he was right : for good mothers , far more than fathers , tend to the perpetual renovation of mankind , creating , as they do , the moral atmosphere of the home , which is the nutriment of man 's moral being , as the physical atmosphere is of his corporeal frame . By good temper , suavity , and kindness , directed by intelligence , woman surrounds the indwellers with a pervading atmosphere of cheerfulness , contentment , and peace , suitable for the growth of the purest as of the manliest natures . The poorest dwelling , presided over by a virtuous , thrifty , cheerful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , virtue , and happiness ; it may be the scene of every ennobling relation in family life ; it may be endeared to a man by many delightful associations ; furnishing a sanctuary for the heart , a refuge from the storms of life , a sweet resting-place after labour , a consolation in misfortune , a pride in prosperity , and a joy at all times . The good home is thus the best of schools , not only in youth but in age . There young and old best learn cheerfulness , patience , self-control , and the spirit of service and of duty . Izaak Walton , speaking of George Herbert 's mother , says she governed her family with judicious care , not rigidly nor sourly , " but with such a sweetness and compliance with the recreations and pleasures of youth , as did incline them to spend much of their time in her company , which was to her great content . " The home is the true school of courtesy , of which woman is always the best practical instructor . " Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were but ill-licked cubs . " Philanthropy radiates from the home as from a centre . " To love the little platoon we belong to in society , " said Burke , " is the germ of all public affections . " The wisest and the best have not been ashamed to own it to be their greatest joy and happiness to sit " behind the heads of children " in the inviolable circle of home . A life of purity and duty there is not the least effectual preparative for a life of public work and duty ; and the man who loves his home will not the less fondly love and serve his country . But while homes , which are the nurseries of character , may be the best of schools , they may also be the worst . Between childhood and manhood how incalculable is the mischief which ignorance in the home has the power to cause ! Between the drawing of the first breath and the last , how vast is the moral suffering and disease occasioned by incompetent mothers and nurses ! Commit a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no culture in after-life will remedy the evil you have done . Let the mother be idle , vicious , and a slattern ; let her home be pervaded by cavilling , petulance , and discontent , and it will become a dwelling of misery  --  a place to fly from , rather than to fly to ; and the children whose misfortune it is to be brought up there , will be morally dwarfed and deformed  --  the cause of misery to themselves as well as to others . Napoleon Buonaparte was accustomed to say that " the future good or bad conduct of a child depended entirely on the mother . " He himself attributed his rise in life in a great measure to the training of his will , his energy , and his self-control , by his mother at home . " Nobody had any command over him , " says one of his biographers , " except his mother , who found means , by a mixture of tenderness , severity , and justice , to make him love , respect , and obey her : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A curious illustration of the dependence of the character of children on that of the mother incidentally occurs in one of Mr. Tufnell 's school reports . The truth , he observes , is so well established that it has even been made subservient to mercantile calculation . " I was informed , " he says , " in a large factory , where many children were employed , that the managers before they engaged a boy always inquired into the mother 's character , and if that was satisfactory they were tolerably certain that her children would conduct themselves creditably . NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE CHARACTER OF THE FATHER . " 114 It has also been observed that in cases where the father has turned out badly  --  become a drunkard , and " gone to the dogs "  --  provided the mother is prudent and sensible , the family will be kept together , and the children probably make their way honourably in life ; whereas in cases of the opposite sort , where the mother turns out badly , no matter how well-conducted the father may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the children are comparatively rare . The greater part of the influence exercised by women on the formation of character necessarily remains unknown . They accomplish their best work in the quiet seclusion of the home and the family , by sustained effort and patient perseverance in the path of duty . Their greatest triumphs , because private and domestic , are rarely recorded ; and it is not often , even in the biographies of distinguished men , that we hear of the share which their mothers have had in the formation of their character , and in giving them a bias towards goodness . Yet are they not on that account without their reward . The influence they have exercised , though unrecorded , lives after them , and goes on propagating itself in consequences for ever . We do not often hear of great women , as we do of great men . It is of good women that we mostly hear ; and it is probable that by determining the character of men and women for good , they are doing even greater work than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , or compose great operas . " It is quite true , " said Joseph de Maistre , " that women have produced no CHEFS-DOEUVRE . They have written no ' Iliad , ' nor ' Jerusalem Delivered , ' nor ' Hamlet , ' nor ' Phaedre , ' nor ' Paradise Lost , ' nor ' Tartuffe ; ' they have designed no Church of St. Peter 's , composed no ' Messiah , ' carved no ' Apollo Belvidere , ' painted no ' Last Judgment ; ' they have invented neither algebra , nor telescopes , nor steam-engines ; but they have done something far greater and better than all this , for it is at their knees that upright and virtuous men and women have been trained  --  the most excellent productions in the world . " De Maistre , in his letters and writings , speaks of his own mother with immense love and reverence . Her noble character made all other women venerable in his eyes . He described her as his " sublime mother "  --  " an angel to whom God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To her he attributed the bent of his character , and all his bias towards good ; and when he had grown to mature years , while acting as ambassador at the Court of St. Petersburg , he referred to her noble example and precepts as the ruling influence in his life . One of the most charming features in the character of Samuel Johnson , notwithstanding his rough and shaggy exterior , was the tenderness with which he invariably spoke of his mother 115  --  a woman of strong understanding , who firmly implanted in his mind , as he himself acknowledges , his first impressions of religion . He was accustomed , even in the time of his greatest difficulties , to contribute largely , out of his slender means , to her comfort ; and one of his last acts of filial duty was to write ' Rasselas ' for the purpose of paying her little debts and defraying her funeral charges . George Washington was only eleven years of age  --  the eldest of five children  --  when his father died , leaving his mother a widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resources , a good woman of business , an excellent manager , and possessed of much strength of character . She had her children to educate and bring up , a large household to govern , and extensive estates to manage , all of which she accomplished with complete success . Her good sense , assiduity , tenderness , industry , and vigilance , enabled her to overcome every obstacle ; and as the richest reward of her solicitude and toil , she had the happiness to see all her children come forward with a fair promise into life , filling the spheres allotted to them in a manner equally honourable to themselves , and to the parent who had been the only guide of their , principles , conduct , and habits . 116 The biographer of Cromwell says little about the Protector 's father , but dwells upon the character of his mother , whom he describes as a woman of rare vigour and decision of purpose : " A woman , " he says , " possessed of the glorious faculty of self-help when other assistance failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremest adverse turn ; of spirit and energy equal to her mildness and patience ; who , with the labour of her own hands , gave dowries to five daughters sufficient to marry them into families as honourable but more wealthy than their own ; whose single pride was honesty , and whose passion was love ; who preserved in the gorgeous palace at Whitehall the simple tastes that distinguished her in the old brewery at Huntingdon ; and whose only care , amidst all her splendour , was for the safety of her son in his dangerous eminence . " 117 We have spoken of the mother of Napoleon Buonaparte as a woman of great force of character . Not less so was the mother of the Duke of Wellington , whom her son strikingly resembled in features , person , and character ; while his father was principally distinguished as a musical composer and performer . 118 But , strange to say , Wellington 's mother mistook him for a dunce ; and , for some reason or other , he was not such a favourite as her other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be proud of him . The Napiers were blessed in both parents , but especially in their mother , Lady Sarah Lennox , who early sought to inspire her sons ' minds with elevating thoughts , admiration of noble deeds , and a chivalrous spirit , which became embodied in their lives , and continued to sustain them , until death , in the path of duty and of honour . Among statesmen , lawyers , and divines , we find marked mention made of the mothers of Lord Chancellors Bacon , Erskine , and Brougham  --  all women of great ability , and , in the case of the first , of great learning ; as well as of the mothers of Canning , Curran , and President Adams  --  of Herbert , Paley , and Wesley . Lord Brougham speaks in terms almost approaching reverence of his grandmother , the sister of Professor Robertson , as having been mainly instrumental in instilling into his mind a strong desire for information , and the first principles of that persevering energy in the pursuit of every kind of knowledge which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an Irishwoman of great natural ability , for whom her gifted son entertained the greatest love and respect to the close of his career . She was a woman of no ordinary intellectual power . " Indeed , " says Canning 's biographer , " were we not otherwise assured of the fact from direct sources , it would be impossible to contemplate his profound and touching devotion to her , without being led to conclude that the object of such unchanging attachment must have been possessed of rare and commanding qualities . She was esteemed by the circle in which she lived , as a woman of great mental energy . Her conversation was animated and vigorous , and marked by a distinct originality of manner and a choice of topics fresh and striking , and out of the commonplace routine . To persons who were but slightly acquainted with her , the energy of her manner had even something of the air of eccentricity . " 119 Curran speaks with great affection of his mother , as a woman of strong original understanding , to whose wise counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she diligently enforced on the minds of her children , he himself principally attributed his success in life . " The only inheritance , " he used to say , " that I could boast of from my poor father , was the very scanty one of an unattractive face and person ; like his own ; and if the world has ever attributed to me something more valuable than face or person , or than earthly wealth , it was that another and a dearer parent gave her child a portion from the treasure of her mind . " 1110 When ex-President Adams was present at the examination of a girls ' school at Boston , he was presented by the pupils with an address which deeply affected him ; and in acknowledging it , he took the opportunity of referring to the lasting influence which womanly training and association had exercised upon his own life and character . " As a child , " he said , " I enjoyed perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed on man  --  that of a mother , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children rightly . From her I derived whatever instruction 11religious especially , and moral has pervaded a long life  --  I will not say perfectly , or as it ought to be ; but I will say , because it is only justice to the memory of her I revere , that , in the course of that life , whatever imperfection there has been , or deviation from what she taught me , the fault is mine , and not hers . " The Wesleys were peculiarly linked to their parents by natural piety , though the mother , rather than the father , influenced their minds and developed their characters . The father was a man of strong will , but occasionally harsh and tyrannical in his dealings with his family ; 1111 while the mother , with much strength of understanding and ardent love of truth , was gentle , persuasive , affectionate , and simple . She was the teacher and cheerful companion of her children , who gradually became moulded by her example . It was through the bias given by her to her sons ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in early years , drew to them the name of Methodists . In a letter to her son , Samuel Wesley , when a scholar at Westminster in 1709 , she said : " I would advise you as much as possible to throw your business into a certain METHOD , by which means you will learn to improve every precious moment , and find an unspeakable facility in the performance of your respective duties . " This " method " she went on to describe , exhorting her son " in all things to act upon principle ; " and the society which the brothers John and Charles afterwards founded at Oxford is supposed to have been in a great measure the result of her exhortations . In the case of poets , literary men , and artists , the influence of the mother 's feeling and taste has doubtless had great effect in directing the genius of their sons ; and we find this especially illustrated in the lives of Gray , Thomson , Scott , Southey , Bulwer , Schiller , and Goethe . Gray inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , while his father was harsh and unamiable . Gray was , in fact , a feminine man  --  shy , reserved , and wanting in energy ,  --  but thoroughly irreproachable in life and character . The poet 's mother maintained the family , after her unworthy husband had deserted her ; and , at her death , Gray placed on her grave , in Stoke Pogis , an epitaph describing her as " the careful tender mother of many children , one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her . " The poet himself was , at his own desire , interred beside her worshipped grave . Goethe , like Schiller , owed the bias of his mind and character to his mother , who was a woman of extraordinary gifts . She was full of joyous flowing mother-wit , and possessed in a high degree the art of stimulating young and active minds , instructing them in the science of life out of the treasures of her abundant experience . 1112 After a lengthened interview with her , an enthusiastic traveller said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is . " Goethe himself affectionately cherished her memory . " She was worthy of life ! " he once said of her ; and when he visited Frankfort , he sought out every individual who had been kind to his mother , and thanked them all . It was Ary Scheffer 's mother  --  whose beautiful features the painter so loved to reproduce in his pictures of Beatrice , St. Monica , and others of his works  --  that encouraged his study of art , and by great self-denial provided him with the means of pursuing it . While living at Dordrecht , in Holland , she first sent him to Lille to study , and afterwards to Paris ; and her letters to him , while absent , were always full of sound motherly advice , and affectionate womanly sympathy . " If you could but see me , " she wrote on one occasion , " kissing your picture , then , after a while , taking it up again , and , with a tear in my eye , calling you ' my beloved son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes the stern language of authority , and to occasion to you moments of pain . * * * Work diligently  --  be , above all , modest and humble ; and when you find yourself excelling others , then compare what you have done with Nature itself , or with the ' ideal ' of your own mind , and you will be secured , by the contrast which will be apparent , against the effects of pride and presumption . " Long years after , when Ary Scheffer was himself a grandfather , he remembered with affection the advice of his mother , and repeated it to his children . And thus the vital power of good example lives on from generation to generation , keeping the world ever fresh and young . Writing to his daughter , Madame Marjolin , in 1846 , his departed mother 's advice recurred to him , and he said : " The word MUST  --  fix it well in your memory , dear child ; your grandmother seldom had it out of hers . The truth is , that through our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the work of the hands , or by the exertion of one 's self-denial . Sacrifices must , in short , be ever going on if we would obtain any comfort or happiness . Now that I am no longer young , I declare that few passages in my life afford me so much satisfaction as those in which I made sacrifices , or denied myself enjoyments . ' Das Entsagen ' 11the forbidden is the motto of the wise man . Self-denial is the quality of which Jesus Christ set us the example . " 1113 The French historian Michelet makes the following touching reference to his mother in the Preface to one of his most popular books , the subject of much embittered controversy at the time at which it appeared :  --  " Whilst writing all this , I have had in my mind a woman , whose strong and serious mind would not have failed to support me in these contentions . I lost her thirty years ago 11I was a child then  --  nevertheless , ever living in my memory , she follows me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my poverty , and was not allowed to share my better fortune . When young , I made her sad , and now I can not console her . I know not even where her bones are : I was too poor then to buy earth to bury her ! " " And yet I owe her much . I feel deeply that I am the son of woman . Every instant , in my ideas and words 11not to mention my features and gestures , I find again my mother in myself . It is my mother 's blood which gives me the sympathy I feel for bygone ages , and the tender remembrance of all those who are now no more . " " What return then could I , who am myself advancing towards old age , make her for the many things I owe her ? One , for which she would have thanked me  --  this protest in favour of women and mothers . " 1114 But while a mother may greatly influence the poetic or artistic mind of her son for good , she may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Byron  --  the waywardness of his impulses , his defiance of restraint , the bitterness of his hate , and the precipitancy of his resentments  --  were traceable in no small degree to the adverse influences exercised upon his mind from his birth by his capricious , violent , and headstrong mother . She even taunted her son with his personal deformity ; and it was no unfrequent occurrence , in the violent quarrels which occurred between them , for her to take up the poker or tongs , and hurl them after him as he fled from her presence . 1115 It was this unnatural treatment that gave a morbid turn to Byron 's after-life ; and , careworn , unhappy , great , and yet weak as he was , he carried about with him the mother 's poison which he had sucked in his infancy . Hence he exclaims , in his ' Childe Harold ' :  --  " Yet must I think less wildly :  --  I have thought Too long and darkly , till my brain became , In its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus , UNTAUGHT IN YOUTH MY HEART TO TAME , MY SPRINGS OF LIFE WERE POISONED . " In like manner , though in a different way , the character of Mrs. Foote , the actor 's mother , was curiously repeated in the life of her joyous , jovial-hearted son . Though she had been heiress to a large fortune , she soon spent it all , and was at length imprisoned for debt . In this condition she wrote to Sam , who had been allowing her a hundred a year out of the proceeds of his acting : - " Dear Sam , I am in prison for debt ; come and assist your loving mother , E. Foote . " To which her son characteristically replied  --  " Dear mother , so am I ; which prevents his duty being paid to his loving mother by her affectionate son , Sam Foote . " A foolish mother may also spoil a gifted son , by imbuing his mind with unsound sentiments . Thus Lamartine 's mother is said to have trained him in altogether erroneous ideas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St.-Pierre , by which his sentimentalism , sufficiently strong by nature , was exaggerated instead of repressed : 1116 and he became the victim of tears , affectation , and improvidence , all his life long . It almost savours of the ridiculous to find Lamartine , in his ' Confidences , ' representing himself as a " statue of Adolescence raised as a model for young men . " 1117 As he was his mother 's spoilt child , so he was the spoilt child of his country to the end , which was bitter and sad . Sainte-Beuve says of him : " He was the continual object of the richest gifts , which he had not the power of managing , scattering and wasting them  --  all , excepting , the gift of words , which seemed inexhaustible , and on which he continued to play to the end as on an enchanted flute . " 1118 We have spoken of the mother of Washington as an excellent woman of business ; and to possess such a quality as capacity for business is not only compatible with true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort and wellbeing of every properly-governed family . Habits of business do not relate to trade merely , but apply to all the practical affairs of life  --  to everything that has to be arranged , to be organised , to be provided for , to be done . And in all these respects the management of a family , and of a household , is as much a matter of business as the management of a shop or of a counting-house . It requires method , accuracy , organization , industry , economy , discipline , tact , knowledge , and capacity for adapting means to ends . All this is of the essence of business ; and hence business habits are as necessary to be cultivated by women who would succeed in the affairs of home  --  in other words , who would make home happy  --  as by men in the affairs of trade , of commerce , or of manufacture . The idea has , however , heretofore prevailed , that women have no concern with such matters , and that business habits and qualifications relate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of figures . Mr. Bright has said of boys , " Teach a boy arithmetic thoroughly , and he is a made man . " And why ?  --  Because it teaches him method , accuracy , value , proportions , relations . But how many girls are taught arithmetic well ?  --  Very few indeed . And what is the consequence ?  --  When the girl becomes a wife , if she knows nothing of figures , and is innocent of addition and multiplication , she can keep no record of income and expenditure , and there will probably be a succession of mistakes committed which may be prolific in domestic contention . The woman , not being up to her business  --  that is , the management of her domestic affairs in conformity with the simple principles of arithmetic  --  will , through sheer ignorance , be apt to commit extravagances , though unintentional , which may be most injurious to her family peace and comfort . Method , which is the soul of business , is also of essential importance in the home . Work can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hugger-mugger becomes a thing unknown . Method demands punctuality , another eminently business quality . The unpunctual woman , like the unpunctual man , occasions dislike , because she consumes and wastes time , and provokes the reflection that we are not of sufficient importance to make her more prompt . To the business man , time is money ; but to the business woman , method is more  --  it is peace , comfort , and domestic prosperity . Prudence is another important business quality in women , as in men . Prudence is practical wisdom , and comes of the cultivated judgment . It has reference in all things to fitness , to propriety ; judging wisely of the right thing to be done , and the right way of doing it . It calculates the means , order , time , and method of doing . Prudence learns from experience , quickened by knowledge . For these , amongst other reasons , habits of business are necessary to be cultivated by all women , in order to their being efficient helpers in the world 's daily life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home aright , women , as the nurses , trainers , and educators of children , need all the help and strength that mental culture can give them . Mere instinctive love is not sufficient . Instinct , which preserves the lower creatures , needs no training ; but human intelligence , which is in constant request in a family , needs to be educated . The physical health of the rising generation is entrusted to woman by Providence ; and it is in the physical nature that the moral and mental nature lies enshrined . It is only by acting in accordance with the natural laws , which before she can follow woman must needs understand , that the blessings of health of body , and health of mind and morals , can be secured at home . Without a knowledge of such laws , the mother 's love too often finds its recompence only in a child 's coffin . 1119 It is a mere truism to say that the intellect with which woman as well as man is endowed , has been given for use and exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Such endowments are never conferred without a purpose . The Creator may be lavish in His gifts , but he is never wasteful . Woman was not meant to be either an unthinking drudge , or the merely pretty ornament of man 's leisure . She exists for herself , as well as for others ; and the serious and responsible duties she is called upon to perform in life , require the cultivated head as well as the sympathising heart . Her highest mission is not to be fulfilled by the mastery of fleeting accomplishments , on which so much useful time is now wasted ; for , though accomplishments may enhance the charms of youth and beauty , of themselves sufficiently charming , they will be found of very little use in the affairs of real life . The highest praise which the ancient Romans could express of a noble matron was that she sat at home and span  --  " DOMUM MANSIT , LANAM FECIT . " In our own time , it has been said that chemistry enough to keep the pot boiling , and geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was science enough for any woman ; whilst Byron , whose sympathies for woman were of a very imperfect kind , professed that he would limit her library to a Bible and a cookery-book . But this view of woman 's character and culture is as absurdly narrow and unintelligent , on the one hand , as the opposite view , now so much in vogue , is extravagant and unnatural on the other  --  that woman ought to be educated so as to be as much as possible the equal of man ; undistinguishable from him , except in sex ; equal to him in rights and votes ; and his competitor in all that makes life a fierce and selfish struggle for place and power and money . Speaking generally , the training and discipline that are most suitable for the one sex in early life , are also the most suitable for the other ; and the education and culture that fill the mind of the man will prove equally wholesome for the woman . Indeed , all the arguments which have yet been advanced in favour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour of the higher education of women . In all the departments of home , intelligence will add to woman 's usefulness and efficiency . It will give her thought and forethought , enable her to anticipate and provide for the contingencies of life , suggest improved methods of management , and give her strength in every way . In disciplined mental power she will find a stronger and safer protection against deception and imposture than in mere innocent and unsuspecting ignorance ; in moral and religious culture she will secure sources of influence more powerful and enduring than in physical attractions ; and in due self-reliance and self-dependence she will discover the truest sources of domestic comfort and happiness . But while the mind and character of women ought to be cultivated with a view to their own wellbeing , they ought not the less to be educated liberally with a view to the happiness of others . Men themselves can not be sound in mind or morals if women be the reverse ; and if , as we hold to be the case , the moral condition of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the education of women is to be regarded as a matter of national importance . Not only does the moral character but the mental strength of man find their best safeguard and support in the moral purity and mental cultivation of woman ; but the more completely the powers of both are developed , the more harmonious and well-ordered will society be  --  the more safe and certain its elevation and advancement . When about fifty years since , the first Napoleon said that the great want of France was mothers , he meant , in other words , that the French people needed the education of homes , provided over by good , virtuous , intelligent women . Indeed , the first French Revolution presented one of the most striking illustrations of the social mischiefs resulting from a neglect of the purifying influence of women . When that great national outbreak occurred , society was impenetrated with vice and profligacy . Morals , religion , virtue , were swamped by sensualism . The character of woman had become depraved . Conjugal fidelity was disregarded ; maternity was held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity no longer bound society together . France was motherless ; the children broke loose ; and the Revolution burst forth , " amidst the yells and the fierce violence of women . " 1120 But the terrible lesson was disregarded , and again and again France has grievously suffered from the want of that discipline , obedience , self-control , and self-respect which can only be truly learnt at home . It is said that the Third Napoleon attributed the recent powerlessness of France , which left her helpless and bleeding at the feet of her conquerors , to the frivolity and lack of principle of the people , as well as to their love of pleasure  --  which , however , it must be confessed , he himself did not a little to foster . It would thus seem that the discipline which France still needs to learn , if she would be good and great , is that indicated by the First Napoleon  --  home education by good mothers . The influence of woman is the same everywhere . Her condition influences the morals , manners , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is debased , society is debased ; where she is morally pure and enlightened , society will be proportionately elevated . Hence , to instruct woman is to instruct man ; to elevate her character is to raise his own ; to enlarge her mental freedom is to extend and secure that of the whole community . For Nations are but the outcomes of Homes , and Peoples of Mothers . But while it is certain that the character of a nation will be elevated by the enlightenment and refinement of woman , it is much more than doubtful whether any advantage is to be derived from her entering into competition with man in the rough work of business and polities . Women can no more do men 's special work in the world than men can do women 's . And wherever woman has been withdrawn from her home and family to enter upon other work , the result has been socially disastrous . Indeed , the efforts of some of the best philanthropists have of late years been devoted to withdrawing women from toiling alongside of men in coalpits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still not uncommon in the North for the husbands to be idle at home , while the mothers and daughters are working in the factory ; the result being , in many cases , an entire subversion of family order , of domestic discipline , and of home rule . 1121 And for many years past , in Paris , that state of things has been reached which some women desire to effect amongst ourselves . The women there mainly attend to business  --  serving the BOUTIQUE , or presiding at the COMPTOIR  --  while the men lounge about the Boulevards . But the result has only been homelessness , degeneracy , and family and social decay . Nor is there any reason to believe that the elevation and improvement of women are to be secured by investing them with political power . There are , however , in these days , many believers in the potentiality of " votes , " 1122 who anticipate some indefinite good from the " enfranchisement " of women . It is not necessary here to enter upon the discussion of this question . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women do not possess politically is far more than compensated by that which they exercise in private life  --  by their training in the home those who , whether as men or as women , do all the manly as well as womanly work of the world . The Radical Bentham has said that man , even if he would , can not keep power from woman ; for that she already governs the world " with the whole power of a despot , " 1123 though the power that she mainly governs by is love . And to form the character of the whole human race , is certainly a power far greater than that which women could ever hope to exercise as voters for members of Parliament , or even as lawmakers . There is , however , one special department of woman 's work demanding the earnest attention of all true female reformers , though it is one which has hitherto been unaccountably neglected . We mean the better economizing and preparation of human food , the waste of which at present , for want of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that man is to be regarded as a benefactor of his species who makes two stalks of corn to grow where only one grew before , not less is she to be regarded as a public benefactor who economizes and turns to the best practical account the food-products of human skill and labour . The improved use of even our existing supply would be equivalent to an immediate extension of the cultivable acreage of our country  --  not to speak of the increase in health , economy , and domestic comfort . Were our female reformers only to turn their energies in this direction with effect , they would earn the gratitude of all households , and be esteemed as among the greatest of practical philanthropists . CHAPTER III .  --  COMPANIONSHIP AND EXAMPLES " Keep good company , and you shall be of the number . "  --  GEORGE HERBERT . " For mine own part , I Shall be glad to learn of noble men .

"  --  OWEN FELTHAM The natural education of the Home is prolonged far into life  --  indeed , it never entirely ceases . But the time arrives , in the progress of years , when the Home ceases to exercise an exclusive influence on the formation of character ; and it is succeeded by the more artificial education of the school and the companionship of friends and comrades , which continue to mould the character by the powerful influence of example . Men , young and old  --  but the young more than the old  --  can not help imitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of George Herbert 's mother , intended for the guidance of her sons , " that as our bodies take a nourishment suitable to the meat on which we feed , so do our souls as insensibly take in virtue or vice by the example or conversation of good or bad company . " Indeed , it is impossible that association with those about us should not produce a powerful influence in the formation of character . For men are by nature imitators , and all persons are more or less impressed by the speech , the manners , the gait , the gestures , and the very habits of thinking of their companions . " Is example nothing ? " said Burke . " It is everything . Example is the school of mankind , and they will learn at no other . " Burke 's grand motto , which he wrote for the tablet of the Marquis of Rockingham , is worth repeating : it was , " Remember  --  resemble  --  persevere . " Imitation is for the most part so unconscious that its effects are almost unheeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that account . It is only when an impressive nature is placed in contact with an impressionable one , that the alteration in the character becomes recognisable . Yet even the weakest natures exercise some influence upon those about them . The approximation of feeling , thought , and habit is constant , and the action of example unceasing . Emerson has observed that even old couples , or persons who have been housemates for a course of years , grow gradually like each other ; so that , if they were to live long enough , we should scarcely be able to know them apart . But if this be true of the old , how much more true is it of the young , whose plastic natures are so much more soft and impressionable , and ready to take the stamp of the life and conversation of those about them ! " There has been , " observed Sir Charles Bell in one of his letters , " a good deal said about education , but they appear to me to put out of sight EXAMPLE , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my brothers . There was , in all the members of the family , a reliance on self , a true independence , and by imitation I obtained it . " 121 It is in the nature of things that the circumstances which contribute to form the character , should exercise their principal influence during the period of growth . As years advance , example and imitation become custom , and gradually consolidate into habit , which is of so much potency that , almost before we know it , we have in a measure yielded up to it our personal freedom . It is related of Plato , that on one occasion he reproved a boy for playing at some foolish game . " Thou reprovest me , " said the boy , " for a very little thing . " " But custom , " replied Plato , " is not a little thing . " Bad custom , consolidated into habit , is such a tyrant that men sometimes cling to vices even while they curse them . They have become the slaves of habits whose power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to create and maintain that vigour of mind which is able to contest the empire of habit , may be regarded as one of the chief ends of moral discipline . Though much of the education of character by example is spontaneous and unconscious , the young need not necessarily be the passive followers or imitators of those about them . Their own conduct , far more than the conduct of their companions , tends to fix the purpose and form the principles of their life . Each possesses in himself a power of will and of free activity , which , if courageously exercised , will enable him to make his own individual selection of friends and associates . It is only through weakness of purpose that young people , as well as old , become the slaves of their inclinations , or give themselves up to a servile imitation of others . It is a common saying that men are known by the company they keep . The sober do not naturally associate with the drunken , the refined with the coarse , the decent with the dissolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vicious tendencies , and to frequent their society leads to inevitable degradation of character . " The conversation of such persons , " says Seneca , " is very injurious ; for even if it does no immediate harm , it leaves its seeds in the mind , and follows us when we have gone from the speakers  --  a plague sure to spring up in future resurrection . " If young men are wisely influenced and directed , and conscientiously exert their own free energies , they will seek the society of those better than themselves , and strive to imitate their example . In companionship with the good , growing natures will always find their best nourishment ; while companionship with the bad will only be fruitful in mischief . There are persons whom to know is to love , honour , and admire ; and others whom to know is to shun and despise ,  --  " DO NT LE SAVOIR N'EST QUE BETERIE , " as says Rabelais when speaking of the education of Gargantua . Live with persons of elevated characters , and you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wolves , " says the Spanish proverb , " and you will learn to howl . " Intercourse with even commonplace , selfish persons , may prove most injurious , by inducing a dry , dull reserved , and selfish condition of mind , more or less inimical to true manliness and breadth of character . The mind soon learns to run in small grooves , the heart grows narrow and contracted , and the moral nature becomes weak , irresolute , and accommodating , which is fatal to all generous ambition or real excellence . On the other hand , association with persons wiser , better , and more experienced than ourselves , is always more or less inspiring and invigorating . They enhance our own knowledge of life . We correct our estimates by theirs , and become partners in their wisdom . We enlarge our field of observation through their eyes , profit by their experience , and learn not only from what they have enjoyed , but  --  which is still more instructive  --  from what they have suffered . If they are stronger than ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wise and energetic never fails to have a most valuable influence on the formation of character  --  increasing our resources , strengthening our resolves , elevating our aims , and enabling us to exercise greater dexterity and ability in our own affairs , as well as more effective helpfulness of others . " I have often deeply regretted in myself , " says Mrs. Schimmelpenninck , " the great loss I have experienced from the solitude of my early habits . We need no worse companion than our unregenerate selves , and , by living alone , a person not only becomes wholly ignorant of the means of helping his fellow-creatures , but is without the perception of those wants which most need help . Association with others , when not on so large a scale as to make hours of retirement impossible , may be considered as furnishing to an individual a rich multiplied experience ; and sympathy so drawn forth , though , unlike charity , it begins abroad , never fails to bring back rich treasures home . Association with others is useful also in strengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never lose sight of our main object , to thread our way wisely and well . " 122 An entirely new direction may be given to the life of a young man by a happy suggestion , a timely hint , or the kindly advice of an honest friend . Thus the life of Henry Martyn the Indian missionary , seems to have been singularly influenced by a friendship which he formed , when a boy , at Truro Grammar School . Martyn himself was of feeble frame , and of a delicate nervous temperament . Wanting in animal spirits , he took but little pleasure in school sports ; and being of a somewhat petulant temper , the bigger boys took pleasure in provoking him , and some of them in bullying him . One of the bigger boys , however , conceiving a friendship for Martyn , took him under his protection , stood between him and his persecutors , and not only fought his battles for him , but helped him with his lessons . Though Martyn was rather a backward pupil , his father was desirous that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the age of about fifteen he sent him to Oxford to try for a Corpus scholarship , in which he failed . He remained for two years more at the Truro Grammar School , and then went to Cambridge , where he was entered at St. John 's College . Who should he find already settled there as a student but his old champion of the Truro Grammar School ? Their friendship was renewed ; and the elder student from that time forward acted as the Mentor , of the younger one . Martyn was fitful in his studies , excitable and petulant , and occasionally subject to fits of almost uncontrollable rage . His big friend , on the other hand , was a steady , patient , hardworking fellow ; and he never ceased to watch over , to guide , and to advise for good his irritable fellow-student . He kept Martyn out of the way of evil company , advised him to work hard , " not for the praise of men , but for the glory of God ; " and so successfully assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination he was the first of his year . Yet Martyn 's kind friend and Mentor never achieved any distinction himself ; he passed away into obscurity , leading , most probably , a useful though an unknown career ; his greatest wish in life having been to shape the character of his friend , to inspire his soul with the love of truth , and to prepare him for the noble work , on which he shortly after entered , of an Indian missionary . A somewhat similar incident is said to have occurred in the college career of Dr. Paley . When a student at Christ 's College Cambridge , he was distinguished for his shrewdness as well as his clumsiness , and he was at the same time the favourite and the butt of his companions . Though his natural abilities were great , he was thoughtless , idle , and a spendthrift ; and at the commencement of his third year he had made comparatively little progress . After one of his usual night-dissipations , a friend stood by his bedside on the following morning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to sleep for thinking about you . I have been thinking what a fool you are ! I have the means of dissipation , and can afford to be idle : YOU are poor , and can not afford it . I could do nothing , probably , even were I to try : YOU are capable of doing anything . I have lain awake all night thinking about your folly , and I have now come solemnly to warn you . Indeed , if you persist in your indolence , and go on in this way , I must renounce your society altogether ! " It is said that Paley was so powerfully affected by this admonition , that from that moment he became an altered man . He formed an entirely new plan of life , and diligently persevered in it . He became one of the most industrious of students . One by one he distanced his competitors , and at the end of the year he came out Senior Wrangler . What he afterwards accomplished as an author and a divine is sufficiently well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example on the young than did Dr. Arnold . It was the great lever with which he worked in striving to elevate the character of his school . He made it his principal object , first to put a right spirit into the leading boys , by attracting their good and noble feelings ; and then to make them instrumental in propagating the same spirit among the rest , by the influence of imitation , example , and admiration . He endeavoured to make all feel that they were fellow-workers with himself , and sharers with him in the moral responsibility for the good government of the place . One of the first effects of this highminded system of management was , that it inspired the boys with strength and self-respect . They felt that they were trusted . There were , of course , MAUVAIS SUJETS at Rugby , as there are at all schools ; and these it was the master 's duty to watch , to prevent their bad example contaminating others . On one occasion he said to an assistant-master : " Do you see those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You should make an especial point of observing the company they keep : nothing so tells the changes in a boy 's character . " Dr. Arnold 's own example was an inspiration , as is that of every great teacher . In his presence , young men learned to respect themselves ; and out of the root of self-respect there grew up the manly virtues . " His very presence , " says his biographer , " seemed to create a new spring of health and vigour within them , and to give to life an interest and elevation which remained with them long after they had left him ; and dwelt so habitually in their thoughts as a living image , that , when death had taken him away , the bond appeared to be still unbroken , and the sense of separation almost lost in the still deeper sense of a life and a Union indestructible . " 123 And thus it was that Dr. Arnold trained a host of manly and noble characters , who spread the influence of his example in all parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he breathed the love of virtue into whole generations of pupils . " To me , " says the late Lord Cockburn , " his lectures were like the opening of the heavens . I felt that I had a soul . His noble views , unfolded in glorious sentences , elevated me into a higher world ... They changed my whole nature . " 124 Character tells in all conditions of life . The man of good character in a workshop will give the tone to his fellows , and elevate their entire aspirations . Thus Franklin , while a workman in London , is said to have reformed the manners of an entire workshop . So the man of bad character and debased energy will unconsciously lower and degrade his fellows . Captain John Brown  --  the " marching-on Brown "  --  once said to Emerson , that " for a settler in a new country , one good believing man is worth a hundred , nay , worth a thousand men without character . " His example is so contagious , that all other men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevates and lifts them up to his own standard of energetic activity . Communication with the good is invariably productive of good . The good character is diffusive in his influence . " I was common clay till roses were planted in me , " says some aromatic earth in the Eastern fable . Like begets like , and good makes good . " It is astonishing , " says Canon Moseley , " how much good goodness makes . Nothing that is good is alone , nor anything bad ; it makes others good or others bad  --  and that other , and so on : like a stone thrown into a pond , which makes circles that make other wider ones , and then others , till the last reaches the shore .... Almost all the good that is in the world has , I suppose , thus come down to us traditionally from remote times , and often unknown centres of good . " 125 So Mr. Ruskin says , " That which is born of evil begets evil ; and that which is born of valour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the life of every man is a daily inculcation of good or bad example to others . The life of a good man is at the same time the most eloquent lesson of virtue and the most severe reproof of vice . Dr. Hooker described the life of a pious clergyman of his acquaintance as " visible rhetoric , " convincing even the most godless of the beauty of goodness . And so the good George Herbert said , on entering upon the duties of his parish : " Above all , I will be sure to live well , because the virtuous life of a clergyman is the most powerful eloquence , to persuade all who see it to reverence and love , and  --  at least to desire to live like him . And this I will do , " he added , " because I know we live in an age that hath more need of good examples than precepts . " It was a fine saying of the same good priest , when reproached with doing an act of kindness to a poor man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought of such actions " would prove music to him at midnight . " 126 Izaak Walton speaks of a letter written by George Herbert to Bishop Andrewes , about a holy life , which the latter " put into his bosom , " and after showing it to his scholars , " did always return it to the place where he first lodged it , and continued it so , near his heart , till the last day of his life . " Great is the power of goodness to charm and to command . The man inspired by it is the true king of men , drawing all hearts after him . When General Nicholson lay wounded on his deathbed before Delhi , he dictated this last message to his equally noble and gallant friend , Sir Herbert Edwardes :  --  " Tell him , " said he , " I should have been a better man if I had continued to live with him , and our heavy public duties had not prevented my seeing more of him privately . I was always the better for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give my love to them both ! " There are men in whose presence we feel as if we breathed a spiritual ozone , refreshing and invigorating , like inhaling mountain air , or enjoying a bath of sunshine . The power of Sir Thomas More 's gentle nature was so great that it subdued the bad at the same time that it inspired the good . Lord Brooke said of his deceased friend , Sir Philip Sidney , that " his wit and understanding beat upon his heart , to make himself and others , not in word or opinion , but in life and action , good and great . " The very sight of a great and good man is often an inspiration to the young , who can not help admiring and loving the gentle , the brave , the truthful , the magnanimous ! Chateaubriand saw Washington only once , but it inspired him for life . After describing the interview , he says : " Washington sank into the tomb before any little celebrity had attached to my name . I passed before him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glory  --  I in the depth of my obscurity . My name probably dwelt not a whole day in his memory . Happy , however , was I that his looks were cast upon me . I have felt warmed for it all the rest of my life . There is a virtue even in the looks of a great man . " When Niebuhr died , his friend , Frederick Perthes , said of him : " What a contemporary ! The terror of all bad and base men , the stay of all the sterling and honest , the friend and helper of youth . " Perthes said on another occasion : " It does a wrestling man good to be constantly surrounded by tried wrestlers ; evil thoughts are put to flight when the eye falls on the portrait of one in whose living presence one would have blushed to own them . " A Catholic money-lender , when about to cheat , was wont to draw a veil over the picture of his favourite saint . So Hazlitt has said of the portrait of a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be impossible in its presence . " It does one good to look upon his manly honest face , " said a poor German woman , pointing to a portrait of the great Reformer hung upon the wall of her humble dwelling . Even the portrait of a noble or a good man , hung up in a room , is companionship after a sort . It gives us a closer personal interest in him . Looking at the features , we feel as if we knew him better , and were more nearly related to him . It is a link that connects us with a higher and better nature than our own . And though we may be far from reaching the standard of our hero , we are , to a certain extent , sustained and fortified by his depicted presence constantly before us . Fox was proud to acknowledge how much he owed to the example and conversation of Burke . On one occasion he said of him , that " if he was to put all the political information he had gained from books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge of the world and its affairs taught him , into one scale , and the improvement he had derived from Mr. Burke 's conversation and instruction into the other , the latter would preponderate . " Professor Tyndall speaks of Faraday 's friendship as " energy and inspiration . " After spending an evening with him he wrote : " His work excites admiration , but contact with him warms and elevates the heart . Here , surely , is a strong man . I love strength , but let me not forget the example of its union with modesty , tenderness , and sweetness , in the character of Faraday . " Even the gentlest natures are powerful to influence the character of others for good . Thus Wordsworth seems to have been especially impressed by the character of his sister Dorothy , who exercised upon his mind and heart a lasting influence . He describes her as the blessing of his boyhood as well as of his manhood . Though two years younger than himself , her tenderness and sweetness contributed greatly to mould his nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She gave me eyes , she gave me ears , And humble cares , and delicate fears ; A heart , the fountain of sweet tears , And love and thought and joy . " Thus the gentlest natures are enabled , by the power of affection and intelligence , to mould the characters of men destined to influence and elevate their race through all time . Sir William Napier attributed the early direction of his character , first to the impress made upon it by his mother , when a boy ; and afterwards to the noble example of his commander , Sir John Moore , when a man . Moore early detected the qualities of the young officer ; and he was one of those to whom the General addressed the encouragement , " Well done , my majors ! " at Corunna . Writing home to his mother , and describing the little court by which Moore was surrounded , he wrote , " Where shall we find such a king ? " It was to his personal affection for his chief that the world is mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The History of the Peninsular War . ' But he was stimulated to write the book by the advice of another friend , the late Lord Langdale , while one day walking with him across the fields on which Belgravia is now built . " It was Lord Langdale , " he says , " who first kindled the fire within me . " And of Sir William Napier himself , his biographer truly says , that " no thinking person could ever come in contact with him without being strongly impressed with the genius of the man . " The career of the late Dr. Marshall Hall was a lifelong illustration of the influence of character in forming character . Many eminent men still living trace their success in life to his suggestions and assistance , without which several valuable lines of study and investigation might not have been entered on , at least at so early a period . He would say to young men about him , " Take up a subject and pursue it well , and you can not fail to succeed . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young friend , saying , " I make you a present of it ; there is fortune in it , if you pursue it with energy . " Energy of character has always a power to evoke energy in others . It acts through sympathy , one of the most influential of human agencies . The zealous energetic man unconsciously carries others along with him . His example is contagious , and compels imitation . He exercises a sort of electric power , which sends a thrill through every fibre  --  flows into the nature of those about him , and makes them give out sparks of fire . Dr. Arnold 's biographer , speaking of the power of this kind exercised by him over young men , says : " It was not so much an enthusiastic admiration for true genius , or learning , or eloquence , which stirred within them ; it was a sympathetic thrill , caught from a spirit that was earnestly at work in the world  --  whose work was healthy , sustained , and constantly carried forward in the fear of God  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty and its value . " 127 Such a power , exercised by men of genius , evokes courage , enthusiasm , and devotion . It is this intense admiration for individuals  --  such as one can not conceive entertained for a multitude  --  which has in all times produced heroes and martyrs . It is thus that the mastery of character makes itself felt . It acts by inspiration , quickening and vivifying the natures subject to its influence . Great minds are rich in radiating force , not only exerting power , but communicating and even creating it . Thus Dante raised and drew after him a host of great spirits  --  Petrarch , Boccacio , Tasso , and many more . From him Milton learnt to bear the stings of evil tongues and the contumely of evil days ; and long years after , Byron , thinking of Dante under the pine-trees of Ravenna , was incited to attune his harp to loftier strains than he had ever attempted before . Dante inspired the greatest painters of Italy  --  Giotto , Orcagna , Michael Angelo , and Raphael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lighted up each other 's glory . Great and good men draw others after them , exciting the spontaneous admiration of mankind . This admiration of noble character elevates the mind , and tends to redeem it from the bondage of self , one of the greatest stumbling blocks to moral improvement . The recollection of men who have signalised themselves by great thoughts or great deeds , seems as if to create for the time a purer atmosphere around us : and we feel as if our aims and purposes were unconsciously elevated . " Tell me whom you admire , " said Sainte-Beuve , " and I will tell you what you are , at least as regards your talents , tastes , and character . " Do you admire mean men ?  --  your own nature is mean . Do you admire rich men ?  --  you are of the earth , earthy . Do you admire men of title ?  --  you are a toad-eater , or a tuft-hunter. 128 Do you admire honest , brave , and manly men ?  --  you are yourself of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the season of youth , while the character is forming , that the impulse to admire is the greatest . As we advance in life , we crystallize into habit ; and " NIL ADMIRARI " too often becomes our motto . It is well to encourage the admiration of great characters while the nature is plastic and open to impressions ; for if the good are not admired  --  as young men will have their heroes of some sort  --  most probably the great bad may be taken by them for models . Hence it always rejoiced Dr. Arnold to hear his pupils expressing admiration of great deeds , or full of enthusiasm for persons or even scenery . " I believe , " said he , " that ' NIL ADMIRARI ' is the devil 's favourite text ; and he could not choose a better to introduce his pupils into the more esoteric parts of his doctrine . And , therefore , I have always looked upon a man infected with the disorder of anti-romance as one who has lost the finest part of his nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 129 It was a fine trait in the character of Prince Albert that he was always so ready to express generous admiration of the good deeds of others . " He had the greatest delight , " says the ablest delineator of his character , " in anybody else saying a fine saying , or doing a great deed . He would rejoice over it , and talk about it for days ; and whether it was a thing nobly said or done by a little child , or by a veteran statesman , it gave him equal pleasure . He delighted in humanity doing well on any occasion and in any manner . " 1210 " No quality , " said Dr. Johnson , " will get a man more friends than a sincere admiration of the qualities of others . It indicates generosity of nature , frankness , cordiality , and cheerful recognition of merit . " It was to the sincere  --  it might almost be said the reverential  --  admiration of Johnson by Boswell , that we owe one of the best biographies ever written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been some genuine good qualities in Boswell to have been attracted by such a man as Johnson , and to have kept faithful to his worship in spite of rebuffs and snubbings innumerable . Macaulay speaks of Boswell as an altogether contemptible person  --  as a coxcomb and a bore  --  weak , vain , pushing , curious , garrulous ; and without wit , humour , or eloquence . But Carlyle is doubtless more just in his characterisation of the biographer , in whom  --  vain and foolish though he was in many respects  --  he sees a man penetrated by the old reverent feeling of discipleship , full of love and admiration for true wisdom and excellence . Without such qualities , Carlyle insists , the ' Life of Johnson ' never could have been written . " Boswell wrote a good book , " he says , " because he had a heart and an eye to discern wisdom , and an utterance to render it forth ; because of his free insight , his lively talent , and , above all , of his love and childlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heroes , especially if they be book-readers . Thus Allan Cunningham , when a mason 's apprentice in Nithsdale , walked all the way to Edinburgh for the sole purpose of seeing Sir Walter Scott as he passed along the street . We unconsciously admire the enthusiasm of the lad , and respect the impulse which impelled him to make the journey . It is related of Sir Joshua Reynolds , that when a boy of ten , he thrust his hand through intervening rows of people to touch Pope , as if there were a sort of virtue in the contact . At a much later period , the painter Haydon was proud to see and to touch Reynolds when on a visit to his native place . Rogers the poet used to tell of his ardent desire , when a boy , to see Dr. Johnson ; but when his hand was on the knocker of the house in Bolt Court , his courage failed him , and he turned away . So the late Isaac Disraeli , when a youth , called at Bolt Court for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock , to his dismay he was informed by the servant that the great lexicographer had breathed his last only a few hours before . On the contrary , small and ungenerous minds can not admire heartily . To their own great misfortune , they can not recognise , much less reverence , great men and great things . The mean nature admires meanly . The toad 's highest idea of beauty is his toadess . The small snob 's highest idea of manhood is the great snob . The slave-dealer values a man according to his muscles . When a Guinea trader was told by Sir Godfrey Kneller , in the presence of Pope , that he saw before him two of the greatest men in the world , he replied : " I do n't know how great you may be , but I do n't like your looks . I have often bought a man much better than both of you together , all bones and muscles , for ten guineas ! " Although Rochefoucauld , in one of his maxims , says that there is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even our best friends , it is only the small and essentially mean nature that finds pleasure in the disappointment , and annoyance at the success of others . There are , unhappily , for themselves , persons so constituted that they have not the heart to be generous . The most disagreeable of all people are those who " sit in the seat of the scorner . " Persons of this sort often come to regard the success of others , even in a good work , as a kind of personal offence . They can not bear to hear another praised , especially if he belong to their own art , or calling , or profession . They will pardon a man 's failures , but can not forgive his doing a thing better than they can do . And where they have themselves failed , they are found to be the most merciless of detractors . The sour critic thinks of his rival : " When Heaven with such parts has blest him , Have I not reason to detest him ? " The mean mind occupies itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to scoff at everything but impudent effrontery or successful vice . The greatest consolation of such persons are the defects of men of character . " If the wise erred not , " says George Herbert , " it would go hard with fools . " Yet , though wise men may learn of fools by avoiding their errors , fools rarely profit by the example which , wise men set them . A German writer has said that it is a miserable temper that cares only to discover the blemishes in the character of great men or great periods . Let us rather judge them with the charity of Bolingbroke , who , when reminded of one of the alleged weaknesses of Marlborough , observed ,  --  " He was so great a man that I forgot he had that defect . " Admiration of great men , living or dead , naturally evokes imitation of them in a greater or less degree . While a mere youth , the mind of Themistocles was fired by the great deeds of his contemporaries , and he longed to distinguish himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marathon had been fought , he fell into a state of melancholy ; and when asked by his friends as to the cause , he replied " that the trophies of Miltiades would not suffer him to sleep . " A few years later , we find him at the head of the Athenian army , defeating the Persian fleet of Xerxes in the battles of Artemisium and Salamis ,  --  his country gratefully acknowledging that it had been saved through his wisdom and valour . It is related of Thucydides that , when a boy , he burst into tears on hearing Herodotus read his History , and the impression made upon his mind was such as to determine the bent of his own genius . And Demosthenes was so fired on one occasion by the eloquence of Callistratus , that the ambition was roused within him of becoming an orator himself . Yet Demosthenes was physically weak , had a feeble voice , indistinct articulation , and shortness of breath  --  defects which he was only enabled to overcome by diligent study and invincible determination . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker ; all his orations , especially the most famous of them , exhibiting indications of careful elaboration ,  --  the art and industry of the orator being visible in almost every sentence . Similar illustrations of character imitating character , and moulding itself by the style and manner and genius of great men , are to be found pervading all history . Warriors , statesmen , orators , patriots , poets , and artists  --  all have been , more or less unconsciously , nurtured by the lives and actions of others living before them or presented for their imitation . Great men have evoked the admiration of kings , popes , and emperors . Francis de Medicis never spoke to Michael Angelo without uncovering , and Julius III . made him sit by his side while a dozen cardinals were standing . Charles V. made way for Titian ; and one day , when the brush dropped from the painter 's hand , Charles stooped and picked it up , saying , " You deserve to be served by an emperor . " Leo X. threatened with excommunication whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author 's consent . The same pope attended the deathbed of Raphael , as Francis I. did that of Leonardo da Vinci . Though Haydn once archly observed that he was loved and esteemed by everybody except professors of music , yet all the greatest musicians were unusually ready to recognise each other 's greatness . Haydn himself seems to have been entirely free from petty jealousy . His admiration of the famous Porpora was such , that he resolved to gain admission to his house , and serve him as a valet . Having made the acquaintance of the family with whom Porpora lived , he was allowed to officiate in that capacity . Early each morning he took care to brush the veteran 's coat , polish his shoes , and put his rusty wig in order . At first Porpora growled at the intruder , but his asperity soon softened , and eventually melted into affection . He quickly discovered his valet 's genius , and , by his instructions , directed it into the line in which Haydn eventually acquired so much distinction . Haydn himself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father of us all , " he said on one occasion . Scarlatti followed Handel in admiration all over Italy , and , when his name was mentioned , he crossed himself in token of veneration . Mozart 's recognition of the great composer was not less hearty . " When he chooses , " said he , " Handel strikes like the thunderbolt . " Beethoven hailed him as " The monarch of the musical kingdom . " When Beethoven was dying , one of his friends sent him a present of Handel 's works , in forty volumes . They were brought into his chamber , and , gazing on them with reanimated eye , he exclaimed , pointing at them with his finger , " There  --  there is the truth ! " Haydn not only recognised the genius of the great men who had passed away , but of his young contemporaries , Mozart and Beethoven . Small men may be envious of their fellows , but really great men seek out and love each other . Of Mozart , Haydn wrote " I only wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on great men in particular , the same depth of musical sympathy , and profound appreciation of Mozart 's inimitable music , that I myself feel and enjoy ; then nations would vie with each other to possess such a jewel within their frontiers . Prague ought not only to strive to retain this precious man , but also to remunerate him ; for without this the history of a great genius is sad indeed .... It enrages me to think that the unparalleled Mozart is not yet engaged by some imperial or royal court . Forgive my excitement ; but I love the man so dearly ! " Mozart was equally generous in his recognition of the merits of Haydn . " Sir , " said he to a critic , speaking of the latter , " if you and I were both melted down together , we should not furnish materials for one Haydn . " And when Mozart first heard Beethoven , he observed : " Listen to that young man ; be assured that he will yet make a great name in the world . " Buffon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so highly that he had always his portrait before him while he sat at work . So Schiller looked up to Shakspeare , whom he studied reverently and zealously for years , until he became capable of comprehending nature at first-hand , and then his admiration became even more ardent than before . Pitt was Canning 's master and hero , whom he followed and admired with attachment and devotion . " To one man , while he lived , " said Canning , " I was devoted with all my heart and all my soul . Since the death of Mr. Pitt I acknowledge no leader ; my political allegiance lies buried in his grave . " 1211 A French physiologist , M. Roux , was occupied one day in lecturing to his pupils , when Sir Charles Bell , whose discoveries were even better known and more highly appreciated abroad than at home , strolled into his class-room . The professor , recognising his visitor , at once stopped his exposition , saying : " MESSIEURS , C'EST ASSEZ POUR AUJOURD'HUI , VOUS AVEZ VU SIR CHARLES BELL ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has usually proved an important event in every young artist 's life . When Correggio first gazed on Raphael 's ' Saint Cecilia , ' he felt within himself an awakened power , and exclaimed , " And I too am a painter " So Constable used to look back on his first sight of Claude 's picture of ' Hagar , ' as forming an epoch in his career . Sir George Beaumont 's admiration of the same picture was such that he always took it with him in his carriage when he travelled from home . The examples set by the great and good do not die ; they continue to live and speak to all the generations that succeed them . It was very impressively observed by Mr. Disraeli , in the House of Commons , shortly after the death of Mr. Cobden :  --  " There is this consolation remaining to us , when we remember our unequalled and irreparable losses , that those great men are not altogether lost to us  --  that their words will often be quoted in this House  --  that their examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even their expressions will form part of our discussions and debates . There are now , I may say , some members of Parliament who , though they may not be present , are still members of this House  --  who are independent of dissolutions , of the caprices of constituencies , and even of the course of time . I think that Mr. Cobden was one of those men . " It is the great lesson of biography to teach what man can be and can do at his best . It may thus give each man renewed strength and confidence . The humblest , in sight of even the greatest , may admire , and hope , and take courage . These great brothers of ours in blood and lineage , who live a universal life , still speak to us from their graves , and beckon us on in the paths which they have trod . Their example is still with us , to guide , to influence , and to direct us . For nobility of character is a perpetual bequest ; living from age to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The sage , " say the Chinese , " is the instructor of a hundred ages . When the manners of Loo are heard of , the stupid become intelligent , and the wavering determined . " Thus the acted life of a good man continues to be a gospel of freedom and emancipation to all who succeed him : " To live in hearts we leave behind , is not to die . " The golden words that good men have uttered , the examples they have set , live through all time : they pass into the thoughts and hearts of their successors , help them on the road of life , and often console them in the hour of death . " And the most miserable or most painful of deaths , " said Henry Marten , the Commonwealth man , who died in prison , " is as nothing compared with the memory of a well-spent life ; and great alone is he who has earned the glorious privilege of bequeathing such a lesson and example to his successors ! " CHAPTER IV .  --  WORK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord be with thee . "  --  l CHRONICLES xxii. 16 . " Work as if thou hadst to live for aye ; Worship as if thou wert to die to-day . "  --  TUSCAN PROVERB . " C'est par le travail qu'on regne. "  --  LOUIS XIV " Blest work ! if ever thou wert curse of God , What must His blessing be ! "  --  J. B. SELKIRK . " Let every man be OCCUPIED , and occupied in the highest employment of which his nature is capable , and die with the consciousness that he has done his best "  --  Sydney Smith . WORK is one of the best educators of practical character . It evokes and disciplines obedience , self-control , attention , application , and perseverance ; giving a man deftness and skill in his special calling , and aptitude and dexterity in dealing with the affairs of ordinary life . Work is the law of our being  --  the living principle that carries men and nations onward . The greater number of men have to work with their hands , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all must work in one way or another , if they would enjoy life as it ought to be enjoyed . Labour may be a burden and a chastisement , but it is also an honour and a glory . Without it , nothing can be accomplished . All that is great in man comes through work ; and civilisation is its product . Were labour abolished , the race of Adam were at once stricken by moral death . It is idleness that is the curse of man  --  not labour . Idleness eats the heart out of men as of nations , and consumes them as rust does iron . When Alexander conquered the Persians , and had an opportunity of observing their manners , he remarked that they did not seem conscious that there could be anything more servile than a life of pleasure , or more princely than a life of toil . When the Emperor Severus lay on his deathbed at York , whither he had been borne on a litter from the foot of the Grampians , his final watchword to his soldiers was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant toil maintained the power and extended the authority of the Roman generals . In describing the earlier social condition of Italy , when the ordinary occupations of rural life were considered compatible with the highest civic dignity , Pliny speaks of the triumphant generals and their men , returning contentedly to the plough . In those days the lands were tilled by the hands even of generals , the soil exulting beneath a ploughshare crowned with laurels , and guided by a husbandman graced with triumphs : " IPSORUM TUNC MANIBUS IMPERATORUM COLEBANTUR AGRI : UT FAS EST CREDERE , GAUDENTE TERRA VOMERE LAUREATO ET TRIUMPHALI ARATORE. " 131 It was only after slaves became extensively employed in all departments of industry that labour came to be regarded as dishonourable and servile . And so soon as indolence and luxury became the characteristics of the ruling classes of Rome , the downfall of the empire , sooner or later , was inevitable . There is , perhaps , no tendency of our nature that has to be more carefully guarded against than indolence . When Mr. Gurney asked an intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , whether he had observed any one quality which , more than another , could be regarded as a universal characteristic of our species , his answer was , in broken English , " Me tink dat all men LOVE LAZY . " It is characteristic of the savage as of the despot . It is natural to men to endeavour to enjoy the products of labour without its toils . Indeed , so universal is this desire , that James Mill has argued that it was to prevent its indulgence at the expense of society at large , that the expedient of Government was originally invented . 132 Indolence is equally degrading to individuals as to nations . Sloth never made its mark in the world , and never will . Sloth never climbed a hill , nor overcame a difficulty that it could avoid . Indolence always failed in life , and always will . It is in the nature of things that it should not succeed in anything . It is a burden , an incumbrance , and a nuisance  --  always useless , complaining , melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious , book  --  the only one , Johnson says , that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise  --  describes the causes of Melancholy as hingeing mainly on Idleness . " Idleness , " he says , " is the bane of body and mind , the nurse of naughtiness , the chief mother of all mischief , one of the seven deadly sins , the devil 's cushion , his pillow and chief reposal .... An idle dog will be mangy ; and how shall an idle person escape ? Idleness of the mind is much worse than that of the body : wit , without employment , is a disease  --  the rust of the soul , a plague , a hell itself . As in a standing pool , worms and filthy creepers increase , so do evil and corrupt thoughts in an idle person ; the soul is contaminated .... Thus much I dare boldly say : he or she that is idle , be they of what condition they will , never so rich , so well allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in abundance and felicity that heart can wish and desire , all contentment  --  so long as he , or she , or they , are idle , they shall never be pleased , never well in body or mind , but weary still , sickly still , vexed still , loathing still , weeping , sighing , grieving , suspecting , offended with the world , with every object , wishing themselves gone or dead , or else carried away with some foolish phantasie or other . " 133 Burton says a great deal more to the same effect ; the burden and lesson of his book being embodied in the pregnant sentence with which it winds up :  --  " Only take this for a corollary and conclusion , as thou tenderest thine own welfare in this , and all other melancholy , thy good health of body and mind , observe this short precept , Give not way to solitariness and idleness . BE NOT SOLITARY  --  BE NOT IDLE . " 134 The indolent , however , are not wholly indolent . Though the body may shirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not grow corn , it will grow thistles , which will be found springing up all along the idle man 's course in life . The ghosts of indolence rise up in the dark , ever staring the recreant in the face , and tormenting him : " The gods are just , and of our pleasant vices , Make instrument to scourge us . " True happiness is never found in torpor of the faculties , 135 but in their action and useful employment . It is indolence that exhausts , not action , in which there is life , health , and pleasure . The spirits may be exhausted and wearied by employment , but they are utterly wasted by idleness . Hense a wise physician was accustomed to regard occupation as one of his most valuable remedial measures . " Nothing is so injurious , " said Dr. Marshall Hall , " as unoccupied time . " An archbishop of Mayence used to say that " the human heart is like a millstone : if you put wheat under it , it grinds the wheat into flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then ' t is itself it wears away . " Indolence is usually full of excuses ; and the sluggard , though unwilling to work , is often an active sophist . " There is a lion in the path ; " or " The hill is hard to climb ; " or " There is no use trying  --  I have tried , and failed , and can not do it . " To the sophistries of such an excuser , Sir Samuel Romilly once wrote to a young man :  --  " My attack upon your indolence , loss of time , &c.,; was most serious , and I really think that it can be to nothing but your habitual want of exertion that can be ascribed your using such curious arguments as you do in your defence . Your theory is this : Every man does all the good that he can . If a particular individual does no good , it is a proof that he is incapable of doing it . That you do n't write proves that you ca n't ; and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an admirable system !  --  and what beneficial effects would it be attended with , if it were but universally received ! " It has been truly said , that to desire to possess , without being burdened with the trouble of acquiring , is as much a sign of weakness , as to recognise that everything worth having is only to be got by paying its price , is the prime secret of practical strength . Even leisure can not be enjoyed unless it is won by effort . If it have not been earned by work , the price has not been paid for it . 136 There must be work before and work behind , with leisure to fall back upon ; but the leisure , without the work , can no more be enjoyed than a surfeit . Life must needs be disgusting alike to the idle rich man as to the idle poor man , who has no work to do , or , having work , will not do it . The words found tattooed on the right arm of a sentimental beggar of forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , might be adopted as the motto of all idlers : " LE PASSE M'A TROMPE ; LE PRESENT ME TOURMENTE ; L'AVENIR M'EPOUVANTE ; "  --  13The past has deceived me ; the present torments me ; the future terrifies me The duty of industry applies to all classes and conditions of society . All have their work to do in the irrespective conditions of life  --  the rich as well as the poor . 137 The gentleman by birth and education , however richly he may be endowed with worldly possessions , can not but feel that he is in duty bound to contribute his quota of endeavour towards the general wellbeing in which he shares . He can not be satisfied with being fed , clad , and maintained by the labour of others , without making some suitable return to the society that upholds him . An honest highminded man would revolt at the idea of sitting down to and enjoying a feast , and then going away without paying his share of the reckoning . To be idle and useless is neither an honour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be content merely to consume  --  FRUGES CONSUMERE NATI  --  men of average endowment , of manly aspirations , and of honest purpose , will feel such a condition to be incompatible with real honour and true dignity . " I do n't believe , " said Lord Stanley 13now Earl of Derby at Glasgow , " that an unemployed man , however amiable and otherwise respectable , ever was , or ever can be , really happy . As work is our life , show me what you can do , and I will show you what you are . I have spoken of love of one 's work as the best preventive of merely low and vicious tastes . I will go further , and say that it is the best preservative against petty anxieties , and the annoyances that arise out of indulged self-love . Men have thought before now that they could take refuge from trouble and vexation by sheltering themselves as it were in a world of their own . The experiment has , often been tried , and always with one result . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destiny of humanity .... Those who shirk from facing trouble , find that trouble comes to them . The indolent may contrive that he shall have less than his share of the world 's work to do , but Nature proportioning the instinct to the work , contrives that the little shall be much and hard to him . The man who has only himself to please finds , sooner or later , and probably sooner than later , that he has got a very hard master ; and the excessive weakness which shrinks from responsibility has its own punishment too , for where great interests are excluded little matters become great , and the same wear and tear of mind that might have been at least usefully and healthfully expended on the real business of life is often wasted in petty and imaginary vexations , such as breed and multiply in the unoccupied brain . " 138 Even on the lowest ground  --  that of personal enjoyment  --  constant useful occupation is necessary . He who labours not , can not enjoy the reward of labour . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our waking hours are happy , when they are employed ; and a little sense of toil is necessary to the enjoyment of leisure , even when earned by study and sanctioned by the discharge of duty . " It is true , there are men who die of overwork ; but many more die of selfishness , indulgence , and idleness . Where men break down by overwork , it is most commonly from want of duly ordering their lives , and neglect of the ordinary conditions of physical health . Lord Stanley was probably right when he said , in his address to the Glasgow students above mentioned , that he doubted whether " hard work , steadily and regularly carried on , ever yet hurt anybody . " Then , again , length of YEARS is no proper test of length of LIFE . A man 's life is to be measured by what he does in it , and what he feels in it . The more useful work the man does , and the more he thinks and feels , the more he really lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent his life may be prolonged , merely vegetates . The early teachers of Christianity ennobled the lot of toil by their example . " He that will not work , " said Saint Paul , " neither shall he eat ; " and he glorified himself in that he had laboured with his hands , and had not been chargeable to any man . When St. Boniface landed in Britain , he came with a gospel in one hand and a carpenter 's rule in the other ; and from England he afterwards passed over into Germany , carrying thither the art of building . Luther also , in the midst of a multitude of other employments , worked diligently for a living , earning his bread by gardening , building , turning , and even clockmaking. 139 It was characteristic of Napoleon , when visiting a work of mechanical excellence , to pay great respect to the inventor , and on taking his leave , to salute him with a low bow . Once at St. Helena , when walking with Mrs. Balcombe , some servants came along carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ordered them out of the way , on which Napoleon interposed , saying , " Respect the burden , madam . " Even the drudgery of the humblest labourer contributes towards the general wellbeing of society ; and it was a wise saying of a Chinese Emperor , that " if there was a man who did not work , or a woman that was idle , somebody must suffer cold or hunger in the empire . " The habit of constant useful occupation is as essential for the happiness and wellbeing of woman as of man . Without it , women are apt to sink into a state of listless ENNUI and uselessness , accompanied by sick headache and attacks of " nerves . " Caroline Perthes carefully warned her married daughter Louisa to beware of giving way to such listlessness . " I myself , " she said , " when the children are gone out for a half-holiday , sometimes feel as stupid and dull as an owl by daylight ; but one must not yield to this , which happens more or less to all young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with interest and diligence . Work , then , constantly and diligently , at something or other ; for idleness is the devil 's snare for small and great , as your grandfather says , and he says true . " 1310 Constant useful occupation is thus wholesome , not only for the body , but for the mind . While the slothful man drags himself indolently through life , and the better part of his nature sleeps a deep sleep , if not morally and spiritually dead , the energetic man is a source of activity and enjoyment to all who come within reach of his influence . Even any ordinary drudgery is better than idleness . Fuller says of Sir Francis Drake , who was early sent to sea , and kept close to his work by his master , that such " pains and patience in his youth knit the joints of his soul , and made them more solid and compact . " Schiller used to say that he considered it a great advantage to be employed in the discharge of some daily mechanical duty  --  some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thousands can bear testimony to the truth of the saying of Greuze , the French painter , that work  --  employment , useful occupation  --  is one of the great secrets of happiness . Casaubon was once induced by the entreaties of his friends to take a few days entire rest , but he returned to his work with the remark , that it was easier to bear illness doing something , than doing nothing . When Charles Lamb was released for life from his daily drudgery of desk-work at the India Office , he felt himself the happiest of men . " I would not go back to my prison , " he said to a friend , " ten years longer , for ten thousand pounds . " He also wrote in the same ecstatic mood to Bernard Barton : " I have scarce steadiness of head to compose a letter , " he said ; " I am free ! free as air ! I will live another fifty years .... Would I could sell you some of my leisure ! Positively the best thing a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , Good Works . " Two years  --  two long and tedious years passed ; and Charles Lamb 's feelings had undergone an entire change . He now discovered that official , even humdrum work  --  " the appointed round , the daily task "  --  had been good for him , though he knew it not . Time had formerly been his friend ; it had now become his enemy . To Bernard Barton he again wrote : " I assure you , NO work is worse than overwork ; the mind preys on itself  --  the most unwholesome of food . I have ceased to care for almost anything .... Never did the waters of heaven pour down upon a forlorner head . What I can do , and overdo , is to walk . I am a sanguinary murderer of time . But the oracle is silent . " No man could be more sensible of the practical importance of industry than Sir Walter Scott , who was himself one of the most laborious and indefatigable of men . Indeed , Lockhart says of him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of indefatigable energy , in union with serene self-possession of mind and manner , such as Scott 's , must be sought for in the roll of great sovereigns or great captains , rather than in that of literary genius . Scott himself was most anxious to impress upon the minds of his own children the importance of industry as a means of usefulness and happiness in the world . To his son Charles , when at school , he wrote :  --  " I can not too much impress upon your mind that LABOUR is the condition which God has imposed on us in every station of life ; there is nothing worth having that can be had without it , from the bread which the peasant wins with the sweat of his brow , to the sports by which the rich man must get rid of his ENNUI .... As for knowledge , it can no more be planted in the human mind without labour than a field of wheat can be produced without the previous use of the plough . There is , indeed , this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that another shall reap what the farmer sows ; but no man can be deprived , whether by accident or misfortune , of the fruits of his own studies ; and the liberal and extended acquisitions of knowledge which he makes are all for his own use . Labour , therefore , my dear boy , and improve the time . In youth our steps are light , and our minds are ductile , and knowledge is easily laid up ; but if we neglect our spring , our summers will be useless and contemptible , our harvest will be chaff , and the winter of our old age unrespected and desolate . " 1311 Southey was as laborious a worker as Scott . Indeed , work might almost be said to form part of his religion . He was only nineteen when he wrote these words :  --  " Nineteen years ! certainly a fourth part of my life ; perhaps how great a part ! and yet I have been of no service to society . The clown who scares crows for twopence a day is a more useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idleness . " And yet Southey had not been idle as a boy  --  on the contrary , he had been a most diligent student . He had not only read largely in English literature , but was well acquainted , through translations , with Tasso , Ariosto , Homer , and Ovid . He felt , however , as if his life had been purposeless , and he determined to do something . He began , and from that time forward he pursued an unremitting career of literary labour down to the close of his life  --  " daily progressing in learning , " to use his own words  --  " not so learned as he is poor , not so poor as proud , not so proud as happy . " The maxims of men often reveal their character . 1312 That of Sir Walter Scott was , " Never to be doing nothing . " Robertson the historian , as early as his fifteenth year , adopted the maxim of " VITA SINE LITERIS MORS EST " 13Life without learning is death . Voltaire 's motto was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourite maxim of Lacepede , the naturalist , was , " VIVRE C'EST VEILLER " 13To live is to observe : it was also the maxim of Pliny . When Bossuet was at college , he was so distinguished by his ardour in study , that his fellow students , playing upon his name , designated him as " BOS-SUETUS ARATRO " 13The ox used to the plough . The name of VITA-LIS 13Life a struggle , which the Swedish poet Sjoberg assumed , as Frederik von Hardenberg assumed that of NOVA-LIS , described the aspirations and the labours of both these men of genius . We have spoken of work as a discipline : it is also an educator of character . Even work that produces no results , because it IS work , is better than torpor ,  --  inasmuch as it educates faculty , and is thus preparatory to successful work . The habit of working teaches method . It compels economy of time , and the disposition of it with judicious forethought . And when the art of packing life with useful occupations is once acquired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leisure , when it comes , will be enjoyed with all the greater zest . Coleridge has truly observed , that " if the idle are described as killing time , the methodical man may be justly said to call it into life and moral being , while he makes it the distinct object not only of the consciousness , but of the conscience . He organizes the hours and gives them a soul ; and by that , the very essence of which is to fleet and to have been , he communicates an imperishable and spiritual nature . Of the good and faithful servant , whose energies thus directed are thus methodized , it is less truly affirmed that he lives in time than that time lives in him . His days and months and years , as the stops and punctual marks in the record of duties performed , will survive the wreck of worlds , and remain extant when time itself shall be no more . " 1313 It is because application to business teaches method most effectually , that it is so useful as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained by active and sympathetic contact with others in the affairs of daily life . It does not matter whether the business relate to the management of a household or of a nation . Indeed , as we have endeavoured to show in a preceding chapter , the able housewife must necessarily be an efficient woman of business . She must regulate and control the details of her home , keep her expenditure within her means , arrange everything according to plan and system , and wisely manage and govern those subject to her rule . Efficient domestic management implies industry , application , method , moral discipline , forethought , prudence , practical ability , insight into character , and power of organization  --  all of which are required in the efficient management of business of whatever sort . Business qualities have , indeed , a very large field of action . They mean aptitude for affairs , competency to deal successfully with the practical work of life  --  whether the spur of action lie in domestic management , in the conduct of a profession , in trade or commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the training which gives efficiency in dealing with these various affairs is of all others the most useful in practical life . 1314 Moreover , it is the best discipline of character ; for it involves the exercise of diligence , attention , self-denial , judgment , tact , knowledge of and sympathy with others . Such a discipline is far more productive of happiness as well as useful efficiency in life , than any amount of literary culture or meditative seclusion ; for in the long run it will usually be found that practical ability carries it over intellect , and temper and habits over talent . It must , however , he added that this is a kind of culture that can only be acquired by diligent observation and carefully improved experience . " To be a good blacksmith , " said General Trochu in a recent publication , " one must have forged all his life : to be a good administrator one should have passed his whole life in the study and practice of business . " It was characteristic of Sir Walter Scott to entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he professed that he did not consider any amount of literary distinction as entitled to be spoken of in the same breath with a mastery in the higher departments of practical life  --  least of all with a first-rate captain . The great commander leaves nothing to chance , but provides for every contingency . He condescends to apparently trivial details . Thus , when Wellington was at the head of his army in Spain , he directed the precise manner in which the soldiers were to cook their provisions . When in India , he specified the exact speed at which the bullocks were to be driven ; every detail in equipment was carefully arranged beforehand . And thus not only was efficiency secured , but the devotion of his men , and their boundless confidence in his command . 1315 Like other great captains , Wellington had an almost boundless capacity for work . He drew up the heads of a Dublin Police Bill 13being still the Secretary for Ireland , when tossing off the mouth of the Mondego , with Junot and the French army waiting for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest commanders , is said to have written an essay on Latin Rhetoric while crossing the Alps at the head of his army . And Wallenstein when at the head of 60,000 men , and in the midst of a campaign with the enemy before him , dictated from headquarters the medical treatment of his poultry-yard . Washington , also , was an indefatigable man of business . From his boyhood he diligently trained himself in habits of application , of study , and of methodical work . His manuscript school-books , which are still preserved , show that , as early as the age of thirteen , he occupied himself voluntarily in copying out such things as forms of receipts , notes of hand , bills of exchange , bonds , indentures , leases , land-warrants , and other dry documents , all written out with great care . And the habits which he thus early acquired were , in a great measure , the foundation of those admirable business qualities which he afterwards so successfully brought to bear in the affairs of government . The man or woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is entitled to honour ,  --  it may be , to as much as the artist who paints a picture , or the author who writes a book , or the soldier who wins a battle . Their success may have been gained in the face of as great difficulties , and after as great struggles ; and where they have won their battle , it is at least a peaceful one , and there is no blood on their hands . The idea has been entertained by some , that business habits are incompatible with genius . In the Life of Richard Lovell Edgeworth , 1316 it is observed of a Mr. Bicknell  --  a respectable but ordinary man , of whom little is known but that he married Sabrina Sidney , the ELEVE of Thomas Day , author of ' Sandford and Merton '  --  that " he had some of the too usual faults of a man of genius : he detested the drudgery of business . " But there can not be a greater mistake . The greatest geniuses have , without exception , been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have not only worked harder than ordinary men , but brought to their work higher faculties and a more ardent spirit . Nothing great and durable was ever improvised . It is only by noble patience and noble labour that the masterpieces of genius have been achieved . Power belongs only to the workers ; the idlers are always powerless . It is the laborious and painstaking men who are the rulers of the world . There has not been a statesman of eminence but was a man of industry . " It is by toil , " said even Louis XIV. , " that kings govern . " When Clarendon described Hampden , he spoke of him as " of an industry and vigilance not to be tired out or wearied by the most laborious , and of parts not to be imposed on by the most subtle and sharp , and of a personal courage equal to his best parts . " While in the midst of his laborious though self-imposed duties , Hampden , on one occasion , wrote to his mother : " My lyfe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nowe to the Commonwealth , nowe to the Kinge .... Not so much tyme left as to doe my dutye to my deare parents , nor to sende to them . " Indeed , all the statesmen of the Commonwealth were great toilers ; and Clarendon himself , whether in office or out of it , was a man of indefatigable application and industry . The same energetic vitality , as displayed in the power of working , has distinguished all the eminent men in our own as well as in past times . During the Anti-Corn Law movement , Cobden , writing to a friend , described himself as " working like a horse , with not a moment to spare . " Lord Brougham was a remarkable instance of the indefatigably active and laborious man ; and it might be said of Lord Palmerston , that he worked harder for success in his extreme old age than he had ever done in the prime of his manhood  --  preserving his working faculty , his good-humour and BONHOMMIE , unimpaired to the end . 1317 He himself was accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of work , was good for his health . It rescued him from ENNUI . Helvetius even held , that it is man 's sense of ENNUI that is the chief cause of his superiority over the brute ,  --  that it is the necessity which he feels for escaping from its intolerable suffering that forces him to employ himself actively , and is hence the great stimulus to human progress . Indeed , this living principle of constant work , of abundant occupation , of practical contact with men in the affairs of life , has in all times been the best ripener of the energetic vitality of strong natures . Business habits , cultivated and disciplined , are found alike useful in every pursuit  --  whether in politics , literature , science , or art . Thus , a great deal of the best literary work has been done by men systematically trained in business pursuits . The same industry , application , economy of time and labour , which have rendered them useful in the one sphere of employment , have been found equally available in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affairs , trained to business ; for no literary class as yet existed , excepting it might be the priesthood . Chaucer , the father of English poetry , was first a soldier , and afterwards a comptroller of petty customs . The office was no sinecure either , for he had to write up all the records with his own hand ; and when he had done his " reckonings " at the custom-house , he returned with delight to his favourite studies at home  --  poring over his books until his eyes were " dazed " and dull . The great writers in the reign of Elizabeth , during which there was such a development of robust life in England , were not literary men according to the modern acceptation of the word , but men of action trained in business . Spenser acted as secretary to the Lord Deputy of Ireland ; Raleigh was , by turns , a courtier , soldier , sailor , and discoverer ; Sydney was a politician , diplomatist , and soldier ; Bacon was a laborious lawyer before he became Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician in country practice at Norwich ; Hooker was the hardworking pastor of a country parish ; Shakspeare was the manager of a theatre , in which he was himself but an indifferent actor , and he seems to have been even more careful of his money investments than he was of his intellectual offspring . Yet these , all men of active business habits , are among the greatest writers of any age : the period of Elizabeth and James I. standing out in the history of England as the era of its greatest literary activity and splendour . In the reign of Charles I. , Cowley held various offices of trust and confidence . He acted as private secretary to several of the royalist leaders , and was afterwards engaged as private secretary to the Queen , in ciphering and deciphering the correspondence which passed between her and Charles I. ; the work occupying all his days , and often his nights , during several years . And while Cowley was thus employed in the royal cause , Milton was employed by the Commonwealth , of which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protector . Yet , in the earlier part of his life , Milton was occupied in the humble vocation of a teacher . Dr. Johnson says , " that in his school , as in everything else which he undertook , he laboured with great diligence , there is no reason for doubting " It was after the Restoration , when his official employment ceased , that Milton entered upon the principal literary work of his life ; but before he undertook the writing of his great epic , he deemed it indispensable that to " industrious and select reading " he should add " steady observation " and " insight into all seemly and generous arts and affairs . " 1318 Locke held office in different reigns : first under Charles II . as Secretary to the Board of Trade and afterwards under William III . as Commissioner of Appeals and of Trade and Plantations . Many literary men of eminence held office in Queen Anne 's reign . Thus Addison was Secretary of State ; Steele , Commissioner of Stamps ; Prior , Under-Secretary of State , and afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Secretary to the Lords Justices of Ireland ; Congreve , Secretary of Jamaica ; , and Gay , Secretary of Legation at Hanover . Indeed , habits of business , instead of unfitting a cultivated mind for scientific or literary pursuits , are often the best training for them . Voltaire insisted with truth that the real spirit of business and literature are the same ; the perfection of each being the union of energy and thoughtfulness , of cultivated intelligence and practical wisdom , of the active and contemplative essence  --  a union commended by Lord Bacon as the concentrated excellence of man 's nature . It has been said that even the man of genius can write nothing worth reading in relation to human affairs , unless he has been in some way or other connected with the serious everyday business of life . Hence it has happened that many of the best books , extant have been written by men of business , with whom literature was a pastime rather than a profession . Gifford , the editor of the ' Quarterly , ' who knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a single hour of composition , won from the business of the day , is worth more than the whole day 's toil of him who works at the trade of literature : in the one case , the spirit comes joyfully to refresh itself , like a hart to the waterbrooks ; in the other , it pursues its miserable way , panting and jaded , with the dogs and hunger of necessity behind . " 1319 The first great men of letters in Italy were not mere men of letters ; they were men of business  --  merchants , statesmen , diplomatists , judges , and soldiers . Villani , the author of the best History of Florence , was a merchant ; Dante , Petrarch , and Boccacio , were all engaged in more or less important embassies ; and Dante , before becoming a diplomatist , was for some time occupied as a chemist and druggist . Galileo , Galvani , and Farini were physicians , and Goldoni a lawyer . Ariosto 's talent for affairs was as great as his genius for poetry . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage the family estate for the benefit of his younger brothers and sisters , which he did with ability and integrity . His genius for business having been recognised , he was employed by the Duke of Ferrara on important missions to Rome and elsewhere . Having afterwards been appointed governor of a turbulent mountain district , he succeeded , by firm and just governments in reducing it to a condition of comparative good order and security . Even the bandits of the country respected him . Being arrested one day in the mountains by a body of outlaws , he mentioned his name , when they at once offered to escort him in safety wherever he chose . It has been the same in other countries . Vattel , the author of the ' Rights of Nations , ' was a practical diplomatist , and a first-rate man of business . Rabelais was a physician , and a successful practitioner ; Schiller was a surgeon ; Cervantes , Lope de Vega , Calderon , Camoens , Descartes , Maupertius , La Rochefoucauld , Lacepede , Lamark , were soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own country , many men now known by their writings , earned their living by their trade . Lillo spent the greater part of his life as a working jeweller in the Poultry ; occupying the intervals of his leisure in the production of dramatic works , some of them of acknowledged power and merit . Izaak Walton was a linendraper in Fleet Street , reading much in his leisure hours , and storing his mind with facts for future use in his capacity of biographer . De Foe was by turns horse-factor , brick and tile maker , shopkeeper , author , and political agent . Samuel Richardson successfully combined literature , with business ; writing his novels in his back-shop in Salisbury Court , Fleet Street , and selling them over the counter in his front-shop . William Hutton , of Birmingham , also successfully combined the occupations of bookselling and authorship . He says , in his Autobiography , that a man may live half a century and not be acquainted with his own character . He did not know that he was an antiquary until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' History of Birmingham , ' and then , he said , he could see it himself . Benjamin Franklin was alike eminent as a printer and bookseller  --  an author , a philosopher and a statesman . Coming down to our own time , we find Ebenezer Elliott successfully carrying on the business of a bar-iron merchant in Sheffield , during which time he wrote and published the greater number of his poems ; and his success in business was such as to enable him to retire into the country and build a house of his own , in which he spent the remainder of his days . Isaac Taylor , the author of the ' Natural History of Enthusiasm , ' was an engraver of patterns for Manchester calico-printers ; and other members of this gifted family were followers of the same branch of art . The principal early works of John Stuart Mill were written in the intervals of official work , while he held the office of principal examiner in the East India House ,  --  in which Charles Lamb , Peacock the author of ' Headlong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also clerks . Macaulay wrote his ' Lays of Ancient Rome ' in the War Office , while holding the post of Secretary of War . It is well known that the thoughtful writings of Mr. Helps are literally " Essays written in the Intervals of Business . " Many of our best living authors are men holding important public offices  --  such as Sir Henry Taylor , Sir John Kaye , Anthony Trollope , Tom Taylor , Matthew Arnold , and Samuel Warren . Mr. Proctor the poet , better known as " Barry Cornwall , " was a barrister and commissioner in lunacy . Most probably he assumed the pseudonym for the same reason that Dr. Paris published his ' Philosophy in Sport made Science in Earnest ' anonymously  --  because he apprehended that , if known , it might compromise his professional position . For it is by no means an uncommon prejudice , still prevalent amongst City men , that a person who has written a book , and still more one who has written a poem , is good for nothing in the way of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no worse a solicitor on that account ; while the brothers Horace and James Smith , authors of ' The Rejected Addresses , ' were men of such eminence in their profession , that they were selected to fill the important and lucrative post of solicitors to the Admiralty , and they filled it admirably . It was while the late Mr. Broderip , the barrister , was acting as a London police magistrate , that he was attracted to the study of natural history , in which he occupied the greater part of his leisure . He wrote the principal articles on the subject for the ' Penny Cyclopaedia , ' besides several separate works of great merit , more particularly the ' Zoological Recreations , ' and ' Leaves from the Notebook of a Naturalist . ' It is recorded of him that , though he devoted so much of his time to the production of his works , as well as to the Zoological Society and their admirable establishment in Regent 's Park , of which he was one of the founders , his studies never interfered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it known that a single question was ever raised upon his conduct or his decisions . And while Mr. Broderip devoted himself to natural history , the late Lord Chief Baron Pollock devoted his leisure to natural science , recreating himself in the practice of photography and the study of mathematics , in both of which he was thoroughly proficient . Among literary bankers we find the names of Rogers , the poet ; Roscoe , of Liverpool , the biographer of Lorenzo de Medici ; Ricardo , the author of ' Political Economy and Taxation ; 1320 Grote , the author of the ' History of Greece ; ' Sir John Lubbock , the scientific antiquarian ; 1321 and Samuel Bailey , of Sheffield , the author of ' Essays on the Formation and Publication of Opinions , ' besides various important works on ethics , political economy , and philosophy . Nor , on the other hand , have thoroughly-trained men of science and learning proved themselves inefficient as first-rate men of business . Culture of the best sort trains the habit of application and industry , disciplines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and vigour of action  --  all of which are equally requisite in the successful conduct of business . Thus , in young men , education and scholarship usually indicate steadiness of character , for they imply continuous attention , diligence , and the ability and energy necessary to master knowledge ; and such persons will also usually be found possessed of more than average promptitude , address , resource , and dexterity . Montaigne has said of true philosophers , that " if they were great in science , they were yet much greater in action ; ... and whenever they have been put upon the proof , they have been seen to fly to so high a pitch , as made it very well appear their souls were strangely elevated and enriched with the knowledge of things . " 1322 At the same time , it must be acknowledged that too exclusive a devotion to imaginative and philosophical literature , especially if prolonged in life until the habits become formed , does to a great extent incapacitate a man for the business of practical life . Speculative ability is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who , in his study , or with his pen in hand , shows himself capable of forming large views of life and policy , may , in the outer world , be found altogether unfitted for carrying them into practical effect . Speculative ability depends on vigorous thinking  --  practical ability on vigorous acting ; and the two qualities are usually found combined in very unequal proportions . The speculative man is prone to indecision : he sees all the sides of a question , and his action becomes suspended in nicely weighing the pros and cons , which are often found pretty nearly to balance each other ; whereas the practical man overleaps logical preliminaries , arrives at certain definite convictions , and proceeds forthwith to carry his policy into action . 1323 Yet there have been many great men of science who have proved efficient men of business . We do not learn that Sir Isaac Newton made a worse Master of the Mint because he was the greatest of philosophers . Nor were there any complaints as to the efficiency of Sir John Herschel , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable men in all that they undertook  --  whether it was literature , philosophy , mining , philology , diplomacy , or statesmanship . Niebuhr , the historian , was distinguished for his energy and success as a man of business . He proved so efficient as secretary and accountant to the African consulate , to which he had been appointed by the Danish Government , that he was afterwards selected as one of the commissioners to manage the national finances ; and he quitted that office to undertake the joint directorship of a bank at Berlin . It was in the midst of his business occupations that he found time to study Roman history , to master the Arabic , Russian , and other Sclavonic languages , and to build up the great reputation as an author by which he is now chiefly remembered . Having regard to the views professed by the First Napoleon as to men of science , it was to have been expected that he would endeavour to strengthen his administration by calling them to his aid . Some of his appointments proved failures , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Interior ; but he had no sooner been appointed than it was seen that a mistake had been made . Napoleon afterwards said of him , that " Laplace looked at no question in its true point of view . He was always searching after subtleties ; all his ideas were problems , and he carried the spirit of the infinitesimal calculus into the management of business . " But Laplace 's habits had been formed in the study , and he was too old to adapt them to the purposes of practical life . With Darn it was different . But Darn had the advantage of some practical training in business , having served as an intendant of the army in Switzerland under Massena , during which he also distinguished himself as an author . When Napoleon proposed to appoint him a councillor of state and intendant of the Imperial Household , Darn hesitated to accept the office . " I have passed the greater part of my life , " he said , " among books , and have not had time to learn the functions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon , " I have plenty about me ; they will never fail . But I want a minister , at once enlightened , firm , and vigilant ; and it is for these qualities that I have selected you . " Darn complied with the Emperor 's wishes , and eventually became his Prime Minister , proving thoroughly efficient in that capacity , and remaining the same modest , honourable , and disinterested man that he had ever been through life . Men of trained working faculty so contract the habit of labour that idleness becomes intolerable to them ; and when driven by circumstances from their own special line of occupation , they find refuge in other pursuits . The diligent man is quick to find employment for his leisure ; and he is able to make leisure when the idle man finds none . " He hath no leisure , " says George Herbert , " who useth it not . " " The most active or busy man that hath been or can be , " says Bacon , " hath , no question , many vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns of business , except he be either tedious and of no despatch , or lightly and unworthily ambitious to meddle with things that may be better done by others . " Thus many great things have been done during such " vacant times of leisure , " by men to whom industry had become a second nature , and who found it easier to work than to be idle . Even hobbies are useful as educators of the working faculty . Hobbies evoke industry of a certain kind , and at least provide agreeable occupation . Not such hobbies as that of Domitian , who occupied himself in catching flies . The hobbies of the King of Macedon who made lanthorns , and of the King of France who made locks , were of a more respectable order . Even a routine mechanical employment is felt to be a relief by minds acting under high-pressure : it is an intermission of labour  --  a rest  --  a relaxation , the pleasure consisting in the work itself rather than in the result . But the best of hobbies are intellectual ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business to find recreation in other pursuits  --  some in science , some in art , and the greater number in literature . Such recreations are among the best preservatives against selfishness and vulgar worldliness . We believe it was Lord Brougham who said , " Blessed is the man that hath a hobby ! " and in the abundant versatility of his nature , he himself had many , ranging from literature to optics , from history and biography to social science . Lord Brougham is even said to have written a novel ; and the remarkable story of the ' Man in the Bell , ' which appeared many years ago in ' Blackwood , ' is reputed to have been from his pen . Intellectual hobbies , however , must not be ridden too hard  --  else , instead of recreating , refreshing , and invigorating a man 's nature , they may only have the effect of sending him back to his business exhausted , enervated , and depressed . Many laborious statesmen besides Lord Brougham have occupied their leisure , or consoled themselves in retirement from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the standard literature of the world . Thus ' Caesar 's Commentaries ' still survive as a classic ; the perspicuous and forcible style in which they are written placing him in the same rank with Xenophon , who also successfully combined the pursuit of letters with the business of active life . When the great Sully was disgraced as a minister , and driven into retirement , he occupied his leisure in writing out his ' Memoirs , ' in anticipation of the judgment of posterity upon his career as a statesman . Besides these , he also composed part of a romance after the manner of the Scuderi school , the manuscript of which was found amongst his papers at his death . Turgot found a solace for the loss of office , from which he had been driven by the intrigues of his enemies , in the study of physical science . He also reverted to his early taste for classical literature . During his long journeys , and at nights when tortured by the gout , he amused himself by making Latin verses ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that intended to designate the portrait of Benjamin Franklin : " Eripuit caelo fulmen , sceptrumque tyrannis . " Among more recent French statesmen  --  with whom , however , literature has been their profession as much as politics  --  may be mentioned De Tocqueville , Thiers , Guizot , and Lamartine , while Napoleon III . challenged a place in the Academy by his ' Life of Caesar . ' Literature has also been the chief solace of our greatest English statesmen . When Pitt retired from office , like his great contemporary Fox , he reverted with delight to the study of the Greek and Roman classics . Indeed , Grenville considered Pitt the best Greek scholar he had ever known . Canning and Wellesley , when in retirement , occupied themselves in translating the odes and satires of Horace . Canning 's passion for literature entered into all his pursuits , and gave a colour to his whole life . His biographer says of him , that after a dinner at Pitt 's , while the rest of the company were dispersed in conversation , he and Pitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the drawing-room . Fox also was a diligent student of the Greek authors , and , like Pitt , read Lycophron . He was also the author of a History of James II. , though the book is only a fragment , and , it must be confessed , is rather a disappointing work . One of the most able and laborious of our recent statesmen  --  with whom literature was a hobby as well as a pursuit  --  was the late Sir George Cornewall Lewis . He was an excellent man of business  --  diligent , exact , and painstaking . He filled by turns the offices of President of the Poor Law Board  --  the machinery of which he created ,  --  Chancellor of the Exchequer , Home Secretary , and Secretary at War ; and in each he achieved the reputation of a thoroughly successful administrator . In the intervals of his official labours , he occupied himself with inquiries into a wide range of subjects  --  history , politics , philology , anthropology , and antiquarianism . His works on ' The Astronomy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Romanic Languages , ' might have been written by the profoundest of German SAVANS . He took especial delight in pursuing the abstruser branches of learning , and found in them his chief pleasure and recreation . Lord Palmerston sometimes remonstrated with him , telling him he was " taking too much out of himself " by laying aside official papers after office-hours in order to study books ; Palmerston himself declaring that he had no time to read books  --  that the reading of manuscript was quite enough for him . Doubtless Sir George Lewis rode his hobby too hard , and but for his devotion to study , his useful life would probably have been prolonged . Whether in or out of office , he read , wrote , and studied . He relinquished the editorship of the ' Edinburgh Review ' to become Chancellor of the Exchequer ; and when no longer occupied in preparing budgets , he proceeded to copy out a mass of Greek manuscripts at the British Museum . He took particular delight in pursuing any difficult inquiry in classical antiquity . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination into the truth of reported cases of longevity , which , according to his custom , he doubted or disbelieved . This subject was uppermost in his mind while pursuing his canvass of Herefordshire in 1852 . On applying to a voter one day for his support , he was met by a decided refusal . " I am sorry , " was the candidate 's reply , " that you ca n't give me your vote ; but perhaps you can tell me whether anybody in your parish has died at an extraordinary age ! " The contemporaries of Sir George Lewis also furnish many striking instances of the consolations afforded by literature to statesmen wearied with the toils of public life . Though the door of office may be closed , that of literature stands always open , and men who are at daggers-drawn in politics , join hands over the poetry of Homer and Horace . The late Earl of Derby , on retiring from power , produced his noble version of ' The Iliad , ' which will probably continue to be read when his speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preparing for the press his ' Studies on Homer , ' 1324 and in editing a translation of ' Farini 's Roman State ; ' while Mr. Disraeli signalised his retirement from office by the production of his ' Lothair . ' Among statesmen who have figured as novelists , besides Mr. Disraeli , are Lord Russell , who has also contributed largely to history and biography ; the Marquis of Normandy , and the veteran novelist , Lord Lytton , with whom , indeed , politics may be said to have been his recreation , and literature the chief employment of his life . To conclude : a fair measure of work is good for mind as well as body . Man is an intelligence sustained and preserved by bodily organs , and their active exercise is necessary to the enjoyment of health . It is not work , but overwork , that is hurtful ; and it is not hard work that is injurious so much as monotonous work , fagging work , hopeless work . All hopeful work is healthful ; and to be usefully and hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brain-work , in moderation , is no more wearing than any other kind of work . Duly regulated , it is as promotive of health as bodily exercise ; and , where due attention is paid to the physical system , it seems difficult to put more upon a man than he can bear . Merely to eat and drink and sleep one 's way idly through life is vastly more injurious . The wear-and-tear of rust is even faster than the tear-and-wear of work . But overwork is always bad economy . It is , in fact , great waste , especially if conjoined with worry . Indeed , worry kills far more than work does . It frets , it excites , it consumes the body  --  as sand and grit , which occasion excessive friction , wear out the wheels of a machine . Overwork and worry have both to be guarded against . For over-brain-work is strain-work ; and it is exhausting and destructive according as it is in excess of nature . And the brain-worker may exhaust and overbalance his mind by excess , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by attempting feats beyond the strength of his physical system . CHAPTER V.  --  COURAGE . " It is not but the tempest that doth show The seaman 's cunning ; but the field that tries The captain 's courage ; and we come to know Best what men are , in their worst jeopardies. "  --  DANIEL . " If thou canst plan a noble deed , And never flag till it succeed , Though in the strife thy heart should bleed , Whatever obstacles control , Thine hour will come  --  go on , true soul ! Thou'lt win the prize , thou'lt reach the goal . "  --  C. MACKAY . " The heroic example of other days is in great part the source of the courage of each generation ; and men walk up composedly to the most perilous enterprises , beckoned onwards by the shades of the brave that were . "  --  HELPS . " That which we are , we are , One equal temper of heroic hearts , Made weak by time and fate , but strong in will To strive , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  TENNYSON . THE world owes much to its men and women of courage . We do not mean physical courage , in which man is at least equalled by the bulldog ; nor is the bulldog considered the wisest of his species . The courage that displays itself in silent effort and endeavour  --  that dares to endure all and suffer all for truth and duty  --  is more truly heroic than the achievements of physical valour , which are rewarded by honours and titles , or by laurels sometimes steeped in blood . It is moral courage that characterises the highest order of manhood and womanhood  --  the courage to seek and to speak the truth ; the courage to be just ; the courage to be honest ; the courage to resist temptation ; the courage to do one 's duty . If men and women do not possess this virtue , they have no security whatever for the preservation of any other . Every step of progress in the history of our race has been made in the face of opposition and difficulty , and been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by leaders in the van of thought  --  by great discoverers , great patriots , and great workers in all walks of life . There is scarcely a great truth or doctrine but has had to fight its way to public recognition in the face of detraction , calumny , and persecution . " Everywhere , " says Heine , " that a great soul gives utterance to its thoughts , there also is a Golgotha . " " Many loved Truth and lavished life 's best oil , Amid the dust of books to find her , Content at last , for guerdon of their toil , With the cast mantle she had left behind her . Many in sad faith sought for her , Many with crossed hands sighed for her , But these , our brothers , fought for her , At life 's dear peril wrought for her , So loved her that they died for her , Tasting the raptured fleetness Of her divine completeness . " 141 Socrates was condemned to drink the hemlock at Athens in his seventy-second year , because his lofty teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was charged by his accusers with corrupting the youth of Athens by inciting them to despise the tutelary deities of the state . He had the moral courage to brave not only the tyranny of the judges who condemned him , but of the mob who could not understand him . He died discoursing of the doctrine of the immortality of the soul ; his last words to his judges being , " It is now time that we depart  --  I to die , you to live ; but which has the better destiny is unknown to all , except to the God . " How many great men and thinkers have been persecuted in the name of religion ! Bruno was burnt alive at Rome , because of his exposure of the fashionable but false philosophy of his time . When the judges of the Inquisition condemned him , to die , Bruno said proudly : " You are more afraid to pronounce my sentence than I am to receive it . " To him succeeded Galileo , whose character as a man of science is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests from the pulpit , because of the views he taught as to the motion of the earth , he was summoned to Rome , in his seventieth year , to answer for his heterodoxy . And he was imprisoned in the Inquisition , if he was not actually put to the torture there . He was pursued by persecution even when dead , the Pope refusing a tomb for his body . Roger Bacon , the Franciscan monk , was persecuted on account of his studies in natural philosophy , and he was charged with , dealing in magic , because of his investigations in chemistry . His writings were condemned , and he was thrown into prison , where he lay for ten years , during the lives of four successive Popes . It is even averred that he died in prison . Ockham , the early English speculative philosopher , was excommunicated by the Pope , and died in exile at Munich , where he was protected by the friendship of the then Emperor of Germany . The Inquisition branded Vesalius as a heretic for revealing man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for revealing the heavens to man . Vesalius had the boldness to study the structure of the human body by actual dissection , a practice until then almost entirely forbidden . He laid the foundations of a science , but he paid for it with his life . Condemned by the Inquisition , his penalty was commuted , by the intercession of the Spanish king , into a pilgrimage to the Holy Land ; and when on his way back , while still in the prime of life , he died miserably at Zante , of fever and want  --  a martyr to his love of science . When the ' Novum Organon ' appeared , a hue-and-cry was raised against it , because of its alleged tendency to produce " dangerous revolutions , " to " subvert governments , " and to " overturn the authority of religion ; " 142 and one Dr. Henry Stubbe 14whose name would otherwise have been forgotten wrote a book against the new philosophy , denouncing the whole tribe of experimentalists as " a Bacon-faced generation . " Even the establishment of the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy is subversive of the Christian faith . " While the followers of Copernicus were persecuted as infidels , Kepler was branded with the stigma of heresy , " because , " said he , " I take that side which seems to me to be consonant with the Word of God . " Even the pure and simpleminded Newton , of whom Bishop Burnet said that he had the WHITEST SOUL he ever knew  --  who was a very infant in the purity of his mind  --  even Newton was accused of " dethroning the Deity " by his sublime discovery of the law of gravitation ; and a similar charge was made against Franklin for explaining the nature of the thunderbolt . Spinoza was excommunicated by the Jews , to whom he belonged , because of his views of philosophy , which were supposed to be adverse to religion ; and his life was afterwards attempted by an assassin for the same reason . Spinoza remained courageous and self-reliant to the last , dying in obscurity and poverty . The philosophy of Descartes was denounced as leading to irreligion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in our own day , Dr. Buckland , Mr. Sedgwick , and other leading geologists , have been accused of overturning revelation with regard to the constitution and history of the earth . Indeed , there has scarcely been a discovery in astronomy , in natural history , or in physical science , that has not been attacked by the bigoted and narrow-minded as leading to infidelity . Other great discoverers , though they may not have been charged with irreligion , have had not less obloquy of a professional and public nature to encounter . When Dr. Harvey published his theory of the circulation of the blood , his practice fell off , 143 and the medical profession stigmatised him as a fool . " The few good things I have been able to do , " said John Hunter , " have been accomplished with the greatest difficulty , and encountered the greatest opposition . " Sir Charles Bell , while employed in his important investigations as to the nervous system , which issued in one of the greatest of physiological discoveries , wrote to a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not so many vexations to encounter , how happy would I be ! " But he himself observed that his practice sensibly fell off after the publication of each successive stage of his discovery . Thus , nearly every enlargement of the domain of knowledge , which has made us better acquainted with the heavens , with the earth , and with ourselves , has been established by the energy , the devotion , the self-sacrifice , and the courage of the great spirits of past times , who , however much they have been opposed or reviled by their contemporaries , now rank amongst those whom the enlightened of the human race most delight to honour . Nor is the unjust intolerance displayed towards men of science in the past , without its lesson for the present . It teaches us to be forbearant towards those who differ from us , provided they observe patiently , think honestly , and utter their convictions freely and truthfully . It was a remark of Plato , that " the world is God 's epistle to mankind ; " and to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true meaning , can have no other effect on a well-ordered mind than to lead to a deeper impression of His power , a clearer perception of His wisdom , and a more grateful sense of His goodness . While such has been the courage of the martyrs of science , not less glorious has been the courage of the martyrs of faith . The passive endurance of the man or woman who , for conscience sake , is found ready to suffer and to endure in solitude , without so much as the encouragement of even a single sympathising voice , is an exhibition of courage of a far higher kind than that displayed in the roar of battle , where even the weakest feels encouraged and inspired by the enthusiasm of sympathy and the power of numbers . Time would fail to tell of the deathless names of those who through faith in principles , and in the face of difficulty , danger , and suffering , " have wrought righteousness and waxed valiant " in the moral warfare of the world , and been content to lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truth . Men of this stamp , inspired by a high sense of duty , have in past times exhibited character in its most heroic aspects , and continue to present to us some of the noblest spectacles to be seen in history . Even women , full of tenderness and gentleness , not less than men , have in this cause been found capable of exhibiting the most unflinching courage . Such , for instance , as that of Anne Askew , who , when racked until her bones were dislocated , uttered no cry , moved no muscle , but looked her tormentors calmly in the face , and refused either to confess or to recant ; or such as that of Latimer and Ridley , who , instead of bewailing their hard fate and beating their breasts , went as cheerfully to their death as a bridegroom to the altar  --  the one bidding the other to " be of good comfort , " for that " we shall this day light such a candle in England , by God 's grace , as shall never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of Mary Dyer , the Quakeress , hanged by the Puritans of New England for preaching to the people , who ascended the scaffold with a willing step , and , after calmly addressing those who stood about , resigned herself into the hands of her persecutors , and died in peace and joy . Not less courageous was the behaviour of the good Sir Thomas More , who marched willingly to the scaffold , and died cheerfully there , rather than prove false to his conscience . When More had made his final decision to stand upon his principles , he felt as if he had won a victory , and said to his son-in-law Roper : " Son Roper , I thank Our Lord , the field is won ! " The Duke of Norfolk told him of his danger , saying : " By the mass , Master More , it is perilous striving with princes ; the anger of a prince brings death ! " . " Is that all , my lord ? " said More ; " then the difference between you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you to-morrow . " While it has been the lot of many great men , in times of difficulty and danger , to be cheered and supported by their wives , More had no such consolation . His helpmate did anything but console him during his imprisonment in the Tower . 144 She could not conceive that there was any sufficient reason for his continuing to lie there , when by merely doing what the King required of him , he might at once enjoy his liberty , together with his fine house at Chelsea , his library , his orchard , his gallery , and the society of his wife and children . " I marvel , " said she to him one day , " that you , who have been alway hitherto taken for wise , should now so play the fool as to lie here in this close filthy prison , and be content to be shut up amongst mice and rats , when you might be abroad at your liberty , if you would but do as the bishops have done ? " But More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not a mere matter of personal comfort with him ; and the expostulations of his wife were of no avail . He gently put her aside , saying cheerfully , " Is not this house as nigh heaven as my own ? "  --  to which she contemptuously rejoined : " Tilly vally  --  tilly vally ! " More 's daughter , Margaret Roper , on the contrary , encouraged her father to stand firm in his principles , and dutifully consoled and cheered him during his long confinement . Deprived of pen-and-ink , he wrote his letters to her with a piece of coal , saying in one of them : " If I were to declare in writing how much pleasure your daughterly loving letters gave me , a PECK OF COALS would not suffice to make the pens . " More was a martyr to veracity : he would not swear a false oath ; and he perished because he was sincere . When his head had been struck off , it was placed on London Bridge , in accordance with the barbarous practice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head to be taken down and given to her , and , carrying her affection for her father beyond the grave , she desired that it might be buried with her when she died ; and long after , when Margaret Roper 's tomb was opened , the precious relic was observed lying on the dust of what had been her bosom . Martin Luther was not called upon to lay down his life for his faith ; but , from the day that he declared himself against the Pope , he daily ran the risk of losing it . At the beginning of his great struggle , he stood almost entirely alone . The odds against him were tremendous . " On one side , " said he himself , " are learning , genius , numbers , grandeur , rank , power , sanctity , miracles ; on the other Wycliffe , Lorenzo Valla , Augustine , and Luther  --  a poor creature , a man of yesterday , standing wellnigh alone with a few friends . " Summoned by the Emperor to appear at Worms ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to answer in person . Those about him told him that he would lose his life if he went , and they urged him to fly . " No , " said he , " I will repair thither , though I should find there thrice as many devils as there are tiles upon the housetops ! " Warned against the bitter enmity of a certain Duke George , he said  --  " I will go there , though for nine whole days running it rained Duke Georges . " Luther was as good as his word ; and he set forth upon his perilous journey . When he came in sight of the old bell-towers of Worms , he stood up in his chariot and sang , " EIN FESTE BURG IST UNSER GOTT . "  --  the ' Marseillaise ' of the Reformation  --  the words and music of which he is said to have improvised only two days before . Shortly before the meeting of the Diet , an old soldier , George Freundesberg , put his hand upon Luther 's shoulder , and said to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what thou doest ; thou art going into a harder fight than any of us have ever yet been in . " But Luther 's only answer to the veteran was , that he had " determined to stand upon the Bible and his conscience . " Luther 's courageous defence before the Diet is on record , and forms one of the most glorious pages in history . When finally urged by the Emperor to retract , he said firmly : " Sire , unless I am convinced of my error by the testimony of Scripture , or by manifest evidence , I can not and will not retract , for we must never act contrary to our conscience . Such is my profession of faith , and you must expect none other from me . HIER STEHE ICH : ICH KANN NICHT ANDERS : GOTT HELFE MIR ! " 14Here stand I : I can not do otherwise : God help me ! . He had to do his duty  --  to obey the orders of a Power higher than that of kings ; and he did it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies at Augsburg , Luther said that " if he had five hundred heads , he would lose them all rather than recant his article concerning faith . " Like all courageous men , his strength only seemed to grow in proportion to the difficulties he had to encounter and overcome . " There is no man in Germany , " said Hutten , " who more utterly despises death than does Luther . " And to his moral courage , perhaps more than to that of any other single man , do we owe the liberation of modern thought , and the vindication of the great rights of the human understanding . The honourable and brave man does not fear death compared with ignominy . It is said of the Royalist Earl of Strafford that , as he walked to the scaffold on Tower Hill , his step and manner were those of a general marching at the head of an army to secure victory , rather than of a condemned man to undergo sentence of death . So the Commonwealth 's man , Sir John Eliot , went alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Ten thousand deaths rather than defile my conscience , the chastity and purity of which I value beyond all this world . " Eliot 's greatest tribulation was on account of his wife , whom he had to leave behind . When he saw her looking down upon him from the Tower window , he stood up in the cart , waved his hat , and cried : " To heaven , my love !  --  to heaven !  --  and leave you in the storm ! " As he went on his way , one in the crowd called out , " That is the most glorious seat you ever sat on ; " to which he replied : " It is so , indeed ! " and rejoiced exceedingly . 145 Although success is the guerdon for which all men toil , they have nevertheless often to labour on perseveringly , without any glimmer of success in sight . They have to live , meanwhile , upon their courage  --  sowing their seed , it may be , in the dark , in the hope that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best of causes have had to fight their way to triumph through a long succession of failures , and many of the assailants have died in the breach before the fortress has been won . The heroism they have displayed is to be measured , not so much by their immediate success , as by the opposition they have encountered , and the courage with which they have maintained the struggle . The patriot who fights an always-losing battle  --  the martyr who goes to death amidst the triumphant shouts of his enemies  --  the discoverer , like Columbus , whose heart remains undaunted through the bitter years of his " long wandering woe "  --  are examples of the moral sublime which excite a profounder interest in the hearts of men than even the most complete and conspicuous success . By the side of such instances as these , how small by comparison seem the greatest deeds of valour , inciting men to rush upon death and die amidst the frenzied excitement of physical warfare ! But the greater part of the courage that is needed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be displayed in everyday life as well as in historic fields of action . There needs , for example , the common courage to be honest  --  the courage to resist temptation  --  the courage to speak the truth  --  the courage to be what we really are , and not to pretend to be what we are not  --  the courage to live honestly within our own means , and not dishonestly upon the means of others . A great deal of the unhappiness , and much of the vice , of the world is owing to weakness and indecision of purpose  --  in other words , to lack of courage . Men may know what is right , and yet fail to exercise the courage to do it ; they may understand the duty they have to do , but will not summon up the requisite resolution to perform it . The weak and undisciplined man is at the mercy of every temptation ; he can not say " No , " but falls before it . And if his companionship be bad , he will be all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be more certain than that the character can only be sustained and strengthened by its own energetic action . The will , which is the central force of character , must be trained to habits of decision  --  otherwise it will neither be able to resist evil nor to follow good . Decision gives the power of standing firmly , when to yield , however slightly , might be only the first step in a downhill course to ruin . Calling upon others for help in forming a decision is worse than useless . A man must so train his habits as to rely upon his own powers and depend upon his own courage in moments of emergency . Plutarch tells of a King of Macedon who , in the midst of an action , withdrew into the adjoining town under pretence of sacrificing to Hercules ; whilst his opponent Emilius , at the same time that he implored the Divine aid , sought for victory sword in hand , and won the battle . And so it ever is in the actions of daily life . Many are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds intended , that are never done ; designs projected , that are never begun ; and all for want of a little courageous decision . Better far the silent tongue but the eloquent deed . For in life and in business , despatch is better than discourse ; and the shortest answer of all is , DOING . " In matters of great concern , and which must be done , " says Tillotson , " there is no surer argument of a weak mind than irresolution  --  to be undetermined when the case is so plain and the necessity so urgent . To be always intending to live a new life , but never to find time to set about it ,  --  this is as if a man should put off eating and drinking and sleeping from one day to another , until he is starved and destroyed . " There needs also the exercise of no small degree of moral courage to resist the corrupting influences of what is called " Society . " Although " Mrs. Grundy " may be a very vulgar and commonplace personage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but especially women , are the moral slaves of the class or caste to which they belong . There is a sort of unconscious conspiracy existing amongst them against each other 's individuality . Each circle and section , each rank and class , has its respective customs and observances , to which conformity is required at the risk of being tabooed . Some are immured within a bastile of fashion , others of custom , others of opinion ; and few there are who have the courage to think outside their sect , to act outside their party , and to step out into the free air of individual thought and action . We dress , and eat , and follow fashion , though it may be at the risk of debt , ruin , and misery ; living not so much according to our means , as according to the superstitious observances of our class . Though we may speak contemptuously of the Indians who flatten their heads , and of the Chinese who cramp their toes , we have only to look at the deformities of fashion amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grundy " is universal . But moral cowardice is exhibited quite as much in public as in private life . Snobbism is not confined to the toadying of the rich , but is quite as often displayed in the toadying of the poor . Formerly , sycophancy showed itself in not daring to speak the truth to those in high places ; but in these days it rather shows itself in not daring to speak the truth to those in low places . Now that " the masses " 146 exercise political power , there is a growing tendency to fawn upon them , to flatter them , and to speak nothing but smooth words to them . They are credited with virtues which they themselves know they do not possess . The public enunciation of wholesome because disagreeable truths is avoided ; and , to win their favour , sympathy is often pretended for views , the carrying out of which in practice is known to be hopeless . It is not the man of the noblest character  --  the highest-cultured and best-conditioned man  --  whose favour is now sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least-cultured and worst-conditioned man , because his vote is usually that of the majority . Even men of rank , wealth , and education , are seen prostrating themselves before the ignorant , whose votes are thus to be got . They are ready to be unprincipled and unjust rather than unpopular . It is so much easier for some men to stoop , to bow , and to flatter , than to be manly , resolute , and magnanimous ; and to yield to prejudices than run counter to them . It requires strength and courage to swim against the stream , while any dead fish can float with it . This servile pandering to popularity has been rapidly on the increase of late years , and its tendency has been to lower and degrade the character of public men . Consciences have become more elastic . There is now one opinion for the chamber , and another for the platform . Prejudices are pandered to in public , which in private are despised . Pretended conversions  --  which invariably jump with party interests are more sudden ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same moral cowardice extends downwards as well as upwards . The action and reaction are equal . Hypocrisy and timeserving above are accompanied by hypocrisy and timeserving below . Where men of high standing have not the courage of their opinions , what is to be expected from men of low standing ? They will only follow such examples as are set before them . They too will skulk , and dodge , and prevaricate  --  be ready to speak one way and act another  --  just like their betters . Give them but a sealed box , or some hole-and-corner to hide their act in , and they will then enjoy their " liberty ! " Popularity , as won in these days , is by no means a presumption in a man 's favour , but is quite as often a presumption against him . " No man , " says the Russian proverb , " can rise to honour who is cursed with a stiff backbone . " But the backbone of the popularity-hunter is of gristle ; and he has no difficulty in stooping and bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause . Where popularity is won by fawning upon the people , by withholding the truth from them , by writing and speaking down to the lowest tastes , and still worse by appeals to class-hatred , 147 such a popularity must be simply contemptible in the sight of all honest men . Jeremy Bentham , speaking of a well-known public character , said : " His creed of politics results less from love of the many than from hatred of the few ; it is too much under the influence of selfish and dissocial affection . " To how many men in our own day might not the same description apply ? Men of sterling character have the courage to speak the truth , even when it is unpopular . It was said of Colonel Hutchinson by his wife , that he never sought after popular applause , or prided himself on it : " He more delighted to do well than to be praised , and never set vulgar commendations at such a rate as to act contrary to his own conscience or reason for the obtaining them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to , though all the world disliked it ; for he ever looked on things as they were in themselves , not through the dim spectacles of vulgar estimation . " 148 " Popularity , in the lowest and most common sense , " said Sir John Pakington , on a recent occasion , 149 " is not worth the having . Do your duty to the best of your power , win the approbation of your own conscience , and popularity , in its best and highest sense , is sure to follow . " When Richard Lovell Edgeworth , towards the close of his life , became very popular in his neighbourhood , he said one day to his daughter : " Maria , I am growing dreadfully popular ; I shall be good for nothing soon ; a man can not be good for anything who is very popular . " Probably he had in his mind at the time the Gospel curse of the popular man , " Woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vital conditions of independence and self-reliance of character . A man must have the courage to be himself , and not the shadow or the echo of another . He must exercise his own powers , think his own thoughts , and speak his own sentiments . He must elaborate his own opinions , and form his own convictions . It has been said that he who dare not form an opinion , must be a coward ; he who will not , must be an idler ; he who can not , must be a fool . But it is precisely in this element of intrepidity that so many persons of promise fall short , and disappoint the expectations of their friends . They march up to the scene of action , but at every step their courage oozes out . They want the requisite decision , courage , and perseverance . They calculate the risks , and weigh the chances , until the opportunity for effective effort has passed , it may be never to return . Men are bound to speak the truth in the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said John Pym , the Commonwealth man , " for speaking the truth , than that the truth should suffer for want of my speaking . " When a man 's convictions are honestly formed , after fair and full consideration , he is justified in striving by all fair means to bring them into action . There are certain states of society and conditions of affairs in which a man is bound to speak out , and be antagonistic  --  when conformity is not only a weakness , but a sin . Great evils are in some cases only to be met by resistance ; they can not be wept down , but must be battled down . The honest man is naturally antagonistic to fraud , the truthful man to lying , the justice-loving man to oppression , the pureminded man to vice and iniquity . They have to do battle with these conditions , and if possible overcome them . Such men have in all ages represented the moral force of the world . Inspired by benevolence and sustained by courage , they have been the mainstays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonism to evil conditions , the world were for the most part given over to the dominion of selfishness and vice . All the great reformers and martyrs were antagonistic men  --  enemies to falsehood and evildoing . The Apostles themselves were an organised band of social antagonists , who contended with pride , selfishness , superstition , and irreligion . And in our own time the lives of such men as Clarkson and Granville Sharpe , Father Mathew and Richard Cobden , inspired by singleness of purpose , have shown what highminded social antagonism can effect . It is the strong and courageous men who lead and guide and rule the world . The weak and timid leave no trace behind them ; whilst the life of a single upright and energetic man is like a track of light . His example is remembered and appealed to ; and his thoughts , his spirit , and his courage continue to be the inspiration of succeeding generations . It is energy  --  the central element of which is will  --  that produces the miracles of enthusiasm in all ages . Everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , and the sustaining power of all great action . In a righteous cause the determined man stands upon his courage as upon a granite block ; and , like David , he will go forth to meet Goliath , strong in heart though an host be encamped against him . Men often conquer difficulties because they feel they can . Their confidence in themselves inspires the confidence of others . When Caesar was at sea , and a storm began to rage , the captain of the ship which carried him became unmanned by fear . " What art thou afraid of ? " cried the great captain ; " thy vessel carries Caesar ! " The courage of the brave man is contagious , and carries others along with it . His stronger nature awes weaker natures into silence , or inspires them with his own will and purpose . The persistent man will not be baffled or repulsed by opposition . Diogenes , desirous of becoming the disciple of Antisthenes , went and offered himself to the cynic . He was refused . Diogenes still persisting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike him if he did not depart . " Strike ! " said Diogenes ; " you will not find a stick hard enough to conquer my perseverance . " Antisthenes , overcome , had not another word to say , but forthwith accepted him as his pupil . Energy of temperament , with a moderate degree of wisdom , will carry a man further than any amount of intellect without it . Energy makes the man of practical ability . It gives him VIS , force , MOMENTUM . It is the active motive power of character ; and if combined with sagacity and self-possession , will enable a man to employ his powers to the best advantage in all the affairs of life . Hence it is that , inspired by energy of purpose , men of comparatively mediocre powers have often been enabled to accomplish such extraordinary results . For the men who have most powerfully influenced the world have not been so much men of genius as men of strong convictions and enduring capacity for work , impelled by irresistible energy and invincible determination : such men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knox , Calvin , Loyola , and Wesley . Courage , combined with energy and perseverance , will overcome difficulties apparently insurmountable . It gives force and impulse to effort , and does not permit it to retreat . Tyndall said of Faraday , that " in his warm moments he formed a resolution , and in his cool ones he made that resolution good . " Perseverance , working in the right direction , grows with time , and when steadily practised , even by the most humble , will rarely fail of its reward . Trusting in the help of others is of comparatively little use . When one of Michael Angelo 's principal patrons died , he said : " I begin to understand that the promises of the world are for the most part vain phantoms , and that to confide in one 's self , and become something of worth and value , is the best and safest course . " Courage is by no means incompatible with tenderness . On the contrary , gentleness and tenderness have been found to characterise the men , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courageous deeds . Sir Charles Napier gave up sporting , because he could not bear to hurt dumb creatures . The same gentleness and tenderness characterised his brother , Sir William , the historian of the Peninsular War . 1410 Such also was the character of Sir James Outram , pronounced by Sir Charles Napier to be " the Bayard of India , SANS PEUR ET SANS REPROCHE "  --  one of the bravest and yet gentlest of men ; respectful and reverent to women , tender to children , helpful of the weak , stern to the corrupt , but kindly as summer to the honest and deserving . Moreover , he was himself as honest as day , and as pure as virtue . Of him it might be said with truth , what Fulke Greville said of Sidney : " He was a true model of worth  --  a man fit for conquest , reformation , plantation , or what action soever is the greatest and hardest among men ; his chief ends withal being above all things the good of his fellows , and the service of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince won the Battle of Poictiers , in which he took prisoner the French king and his son , he entertained them in the evening at a banquet , when he insisted on waiting upon and serving them at table . The gallant prince 's knightly courtesy and demeanour won the hearts of his captives as completely as his valour had won their persons ; for , notwithstanding his youth , Edward was a true knight , the first and bravest of his time  --  a noble pattern and example of chivalry ; his two mottoes , ' Hochmuth ' and ' Ich dien ' 14high spirit and reverent service not inaptly expressing his prominent and pervading qualities . It is the courageous man who can best afford to be generous ; or rather , it is his nature to be so . When Fairfax , at the Battle of Naseby , seized the colours from an ensign whom he had struck down in the fight , he handed them to a common soldier to take care of . The soldier , unable to resist the temptation , boasted to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boast was repeated to Fairfax . " Let him retain the honour , " said the commander ; " I have enough beside . " So when Douglas , at the Battle of Bannockburn , saw Randolph , his rival , outnumbered and apparently overpowered by the enemy , he prepared to hasten to his assistance ; but , seeing that Randolph was already driving them back , he cried out , " Hold and halt ! We are come too late to aid them ; let us not lessen the victory they have won by affecting to claim a share in it . " Quite as chivalrous , though in a very different field of action , was the conduct of Laplace to the young philosopher Biot , when the latter had read to the French Academy his paper , " SUR LES EQUATIONS AUX DIFFERENCE MELEES . " The assembled SAVANS , at its close , felicitated the reader of the paper on his originality . Monge was delighted at his success . Laplace also praised him for the clearness of his demonstrations , and invited Biot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closet in his study a paper , yellow with age , and handed it to the young philosopher . To Biot 's surprise , he found that it contained the solutions , all worked out , for which he had just gained so much applause . With rare magnanimity , Laplace withheld all knowledge of the circumstance from Biot until the latter had initiated his reputation before the Academy ; moreover , he enjoined him to silence ; and the incident would have remained a secret had not Biot himself published it , some fifty years afterwards . An incident is related of a French artisan , exhibiting the same characteristic of self-sacrifice in another form . In front of a lofty house in course of erection at Paris was the usual scaffold , loaded with men and materials . The scaffold , being too weak , suddenly broke down , and the men upon it were precipitated to the ground  --  all except two , a young man and a middle-aged one , who hung on to a narrow ledge , which trembled under their weight , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " cried the elder of the two , " let go ; I am the father of a family . " " C'EST JUSTE ! " said Pierre ; and , instantly letting go his hold , he fell and was killed on the spot . The father of the family was saved . The brave man is magnanimous as well as gentle . He does not take even an enemy at a disadvantage , nor strike a man when he is down and unable to defend himself . Even in the midst of deadly strife such instances of generosity have not been uncommon . Thus , at the Battle of Dettingen , during the heat of the action , a squadron of French cavalry charged an English regiment ; but when the young French officer who led them , and was about to attack the English leader , observed that he had only one arm , with which he held his bridle , the Frenchman saluted him courteously with his sword , and passed on . 1411 It is related of Charles V. , that after the siege and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to see the tomb of Luther . While reading the inscription on it , one of the servile courtiers who accompanied him proposed to open the grave , and give the ashes of the " heretic " to the winds . The monarch 's cheek flushed with honest indignation : " I war not with the dead , " said he ; " let this place be respected . " The portrait which the great heathen , Aristotle , drew of the Magnanimous Man , in other words the True Gentleman , more than two thousand years ago , is as faithful now as it was then . " The magnanimous man , " he said , " will behave with moderation under both good fortune and bad . He will know how to be exalted and how to be abased . He will neither be delighted with success nor grieved by failure . He will neither shun danger nor seek it , for there are few things which he cares for . He is reticent , and somewhat slow of speech , but speaks his mind openly and boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire , for nothing is great to him . He overlooks injuries . He is not given to talk about himself or about others ; for he does not care that he himself should be praised , or that other people should be blamed . He does not cry out about trifles , and craves help from none . " On the other hand , mean men admire meanly . They have neither modesty , generosity , nor magnanimity . They are ready to take advantage of the weakness or defencelessness of others , especially where they have themselves succeeded , by unscrupulous methods , in climbing to positions of authority . Snobs in high places are always much less tolerable than snobs of low degree , because they have more frequent opportunities of making their want of manliness felt . They assume greater airs , and are pretentious in all that they do ; and the higher their elevation , the more conspicuous is the incongruity of their position . " The higher the monkey climbs , " says the proverb , " the more he shows his tail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done . An act which might be taken as a kindness if done in a generous spirit , when done in a grudging spirit , may be felt as stingy , if not harsh and even cruel . When Ben Jonson lay sick and in poverty , the king sent him a paltry message , accompanied by a gratuity . The sturdy plainspoken poet 's reply was : " I suppose he sends me this because I live in an alley ; tell him his soul lives in an alley . " From what we have said , it will be obvious that to be of an enduring and courageous spirit , is of great importance in the formation of character . It is a source not only of usefulness in life , but of happiness . On the other hand , to be of a timid and , still more , of a cowardly nature is one of the greatest misfortunes . A. wise man was accustomed to say that one of the principal objects he aimed at in the education of his sons and daughters was to train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . And the habit of avoiding fear is , doubtless , capable of being trained like any other habit , such as the habit of attention , of diligence , of study , or of cheerfulness . Much of the fear that exists is the offspring of imagination , which creates the images of evils which MAY happen , but perhaps rarely do ; and thus many persons who are capable of summoning up courage to grapple with and overcome real dangers , are paralysed or thrown into consternation by those which are imaginary . Hence , unless the imagination be held under strict discipline , we are prone to meet evils more than halfway  --  to suffer them by forestalment , and to assume the burdens which we ourselves create . Education in courage is not usually included amongst the branches of female training , and yet it is really of greater importance than either music , French , or the use of the globes . Contrary to the view of Sir Richard Steele , that women should be characterised by a " tender fear , " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have women educated in resolution and courage , as a means of rendering them more helpful , more self-reliant , and vastly more useful and happy . There is , indeed , nothing attractive in timidity , nothing loveable in fear . All weakness , whether of mind or body , is equivalent to deformity , and the reverse of interesting . Courage is graceful and dignified , whilst fear , in any form , is mean and repulsive . Yet the utmost tenderness and gentleness are consistent with courage . Ary Scheffer , the artist , once wrote to his daughter : - " Dear daughter , strive to be of good courage , to be gentle-hearted ; these are the true qualities for woman . ' Troubles ' everybody must expect . There is but one way of looking at fate  --  whatever that be , whether blessings or afflictions  --  to behave with dignity under both . We must not lose heart , or it will be the worse both for ourselves and for those whom we love . To struggle , and again and again to renew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1412 In sickness and sorrow , none are braver and less complaining sufferers than women . Their courage , where their hearts are concerned , is indeed proverbial : " Oh ! femmes c'est a tort qu'on vous nommes timides , A la voix de vos coeurs vous etes intrepides . " Experience has proved that women can be as enduring as men , under the heaviest trials and calamities ; but too little pains are taken to teach them to endure petty terrors and frivolous vexations with fortitude . Such little miseries , if petted and indulged , quickly run into sickly sensibility , and become the bane of their life , keeping themselves and those about them in a state of chronic discomfort . The best corrective of this condition of mind is wholesome moral and mental discipline . Mental strength is as necessary for the development of woman 's character as of man 's . It gives her capacity to deal with the affairs of life , and presence of mind , which enable her to act with vigour and effect in moments of emergency . Character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be found the best safeguard of virtue , the best nurse of religion , the best corrective of Time . Personal beauty soon passes ; but beauty of mind and character increases in attractiveness the older it grows . Ben Jonson gives a striking portraiture of a noble woman in these lines :  --  " I meant she should be courteous , facile , sweet , Free from that solemn vice of greatness , pride ; I meant each softed virtue there should meet , Fit in that softer bosom to abide . Only a learned and a manly soul , I purposed her , that should with even powers , The rock , the spindle , and the shears control Of destiny , and spin her own free hours . " The courage of woman is not the less true because it is for the most part passive . It is not encouraged by the cheers of the world , for it is mostly exhibited in the recesses of private life . Yet there are cases of heroic patience and endurance on the part of women which occasionally come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated instances in history is that of Gertrude Von der Wart . Her husband , falsely accused of being an accomplice in the murder of the Emperor Albert , was condemned to the most frightful of all punishments  --  to be broken alive on the wheel . With most profound conviction of her husband 's innocence the faithful woman stood by his side to the last , watching over him during two days and nights , braving the empress 's anger and the inclemency of the weather , in the hope of contributing to soothe his dying agonies. 1413 But women have not only distinguished themselves for their passive courage : impelled by affection , or the sense of duty , they have occasionally become heroic . When the band of conspirators , who sought the life of James II . of Scotland , burst into his lodgings at Perth , the king called to the ladies , who were in the chamber outside his room , to keep the door as well as they could , and give him time to escape . The conspirators had previously destroyed the locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be turned ; and when they reached the ladies ' apartment , it was found that the bar also had been removed . But , on hearing them approach , the brave Catherine Douglas , with the hereditary courage of her family , boldly thrust her arm across the door instead of the bar ; and held it there until , her arm being broken , the conspirators burst into the room with drawn swords and daggers , overthrowing the ladies , who , though unarmed , still endeavoured to resist them . The defence of Lathom House by Charlotte de la Tremouille , the worthy descendant of William of Nassau and Admiral Coligny , was another striking instance of heroic bravery on the part of a noble woman . When summoned by the Parliamentary forces to surrender , she declared that she had been entrusted by her husband with the defence of the house , and that she could not give it up without her dear lord 's orders , but trusted in God for protection and deliverance . In her arrangements for the defence , she is described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards by fortune or negligence , and added to her former patience a most resolved fortitude . " The brave lady held her house and home good against the enemy for a whole year  --  during three months of which the place was strictly besieged and bombarded  --  until at length the siege was raised , after a most gallant defence , by the advance of the Royalist army . Nor can we forget the courage of Lady Franklin , who persevered to the last , when the hopes of all others had died out , in prosecuting the search after the Franklin Expedition . On the occasion of the Royal Geographical Society determining to award the Founder 's Medal to Lady Franklin , Sir Roderick Murchison observed , that in the course of a long friendship with her , he had abundant opportunities of observing and testing the sterling qualities of a woman who had proved herself worthy of the admiration of mankind . " Nothing daunted by failure after failure , through twelve long years of hope deferred , she had persevered , with a singleness of purpose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her one last expedition of the FOX , under the gallant M'Clintock , had realised the two great facts  --  that her husband had traversed wide seas unknown to former navigators , and died in discovering a north-west passage  --  then , surely , the adjudication of the medal would be hailed by the nation as one of the many recompences to which the widow of the illustrious Franklin was so eminently entitled . " But that devotion to duty which marks the heroic character has more often been exhibited by women in deeds of charity and mercy . The greater part of these are never known , for they are done in private , out of the public sight , and for the mere love of doing good . Where fame has come to them , because of the success which has attended their labours in a more general sphere , it has come unsought and unexpected , and is often felt as a burden . Who has not heard of Mrs. Fry and Miss Carpenter as prison visitors and reformers ; of Mrs. Chisholm and Miss Rye as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrett as apostles of hospital nursing ? That these women should have emerged from the sphere of private and domestic life to become leaders in philanthropy , indicates no small , degree of moral courage on their part ; for to women , above all others , quiet and ease and retirement are most natural and welcome . Very few women step beyond the boundaries of home in search of a larger field of usefulness . But when they have desired one , they have had no difficulty in finding it . The ways in which men and women can help their neighbours are innumerable . It needs but the willing heart and ready hand . Most of the philanthropic workers we have named , however , have scarcely been influenced by choice . The duty lay in their way  --  it seemed to be the nearest to them  --  and they set about doing it without desire for fame , or any other reward but the approval of their own conscience . Among prison-visitors , the name of Sarah Martin is much less known than that of Mrs. Fry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was led to undertake it , furnishes at the same time an illustration of womanly trueheartedness and earnest womanly courage . Sarah Martin was the daughter of poor parents , and was left an orphan at an early age . She was brought up by her grandmother , at Caistor , near Yarmouth , and earned her living by going out to families as assistant-dressmaker , at a shilling a day . In 1819 , a woman was tried and sentenced to imprisonment in Yarmouth Gaol , for cruelly beating and illusing her child , and her crime became the talk of the town . The young dressmaker was much impressed by the report of the trial , and the desire entered her mind of visiting the woman in gaol , and trying to reclaim her . She had often before , on passing the walls of the borough gaol , felt impelled to seek admission , with the object of visiting the inmates , reading the Scriptures to them , and endeavouring to lead them back to the society whose laws they had violated . At length she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gaol-porch , lifted the knocker , and asked the gaoler for admission . For some reason or other she was refused ; but she returned , repeated her request , and this time she was admitted . The culprit mother shortly stood before her . When Sarah Martin told the motive of her visit , the criminal burst into tears , and thanked her . Those tears and thanks shaped the whole course of Sarah Martin 's after-life ; and the poor seamstress , while maintaining herself by her needle , continued to spend her leisure hours in visiting the prisoners , and endeavouring to alleviate their condition . She constituted herself their chaplain and schoolmistress , for at that time they had neither ; she read to them from the Scriptures , and taught them to read and write . She gave up an entire day in the week for this purpose , besides Sundays , as well as other intervals of spare time , " feeling , " she says , " that the blessing of God was upon her . " She taught the women to knit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of the articles enabling her to buy other materials , and to continue the industrial education thus begun . She also taught the men to make straw hats , men 's and boys ' caps , gray cotton shirts , and even patchwork  --  anything to keep them out of idleness , and from preying on their own thoughts . Out of the earnings of the prisoners in this way , she formed a fund , which she applied to furnishing them with work on their discharge ; thus enabling them again to begin the world honestly , and at the same time affording her , as she herself says , " the advantage of observing their conduct . " By attending too exclusively to this prison-work , however , Sarah Martin 's dressmaking business fell off ; and the question arose with her , whether in order to recover her business she was to suspend her prison-work . But her decision had already been made . " I had counted the cost , " she said , " and my mind , was made up . If , whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , the privations so momentary to an individual would not admit of comparison with following the Lord , in thus administering to others . " She now devoted six or seven hours every day to the prisoners , converting what would otherwise have been a scene of dissolute idleness into a hive of orderly industry . Newly-admitted prisoners were sometimes refractory , but her persistent gentleness eventually won their respect and co-operation . Men old in years and crime , pert London pickpockets , depraved boys and dissolute sailors , profligate women , smugglers , poachers , and the promiscuous horde of criminals which usually fill the gaol of a seaport and county town , all submitted to the benign influence of this good woman ; and under her eyes they might be seen , for the first time in their lives , striving to hold a pen , or to master the characters in a penny primer . She entered into their confidences  --  watched , wept , prayed , and felt for all by turns . She strengthened their good resolutions , cheered the hopeless and despairing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right road of amendment . For more than twenty years this good and truehearted woman pursued her noble course , with little encouragement , and not much help ; almost her only means of subsistence consisting in an annual income of ten or twelve pounds left by her grandmother , eked out by her little earnings at dressmaking . During the last two years of her ministrations , the borough magistrates of Yarmouth , knowing that her self-imposed labours saved them the expense of a schoolmaster and chaplain 14which they had become bound by law to appoint , made a proposal to her of an annual salary of 12L. a year ; but they did it in so indelicate a manner as greatly to wound her sensitive feelings . She shrank from becoming the salaried official of the corporation , and bartering for money those serviced which had throughout been labours of love . But the Gaol Committee coarsely informed her , " that if they permitted her to visit the prison she must submit to their terms , or be excluded . " For two years , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acknowledgment of the Yarmouth corporation for her services as gaol chaplain and schoolmistress ! She was now , however , becoming old and infirm , and the unhealthy atmosphere of the gaol did much towards finally disabling her . While she lay on her deathbed , she resumed the exercise of a talent she had occasionally practised before in her moments of leisure  --  the composition of sacred poetry . As works of art , they may not excite admiration ; yet never were verses written truer in spirit , or fuller of Christian love . But her own life was a nobler poem than any she ever wrote  --  full of true courage , perseverance , charity , and wisdom . It was indeed a commentary upon her own words : " The high desire that others may be blest Savours of heaven . " CHAPTER VI .  --  SELF-CONTROL . " Honour and profit do not always lie in the same sack . "  - -  GEORGE HERBERT . " The government of one 's self is the only true freedom for the Individual . "  --  FREDERICK PERTHES . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and forbearance , that so much of what is good in mankind and womankind is shown . "  --  ARTHUR HELPS . " Temperance , proof Against all trials ; industry severe And constant as the motion of the day ; Stern self-denial round him spread , with shade That might be deemed forbidding , did not there All generous feelings flourish and rejoice ; Forbearance , charity indeed and thought , And resolution competent to take Out of the bosom of simplicity All that her holy customs recommend . "  --  WORDSWORTH . Self-control is only courage under another form . It may almost be regarded as the primary essence of character . It is in virtue of this quality that Shakspeare defines man as a being " looking before and after . " It forms the chief distinction between man and the mere animal ; and , indeed , there can be no true manhood without it . Self-control is at the root of all the virtues . Let a man give the reins to his impulses and passions , and from that moment he yields up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and becomes the slave of his strongest desire for the time being . To be morally free  --  to be more than an animal  --  man must be able to resist instinctive impulse , and this can only be done by the exercise of self-control . Thus it is this power which constitutes the real distinction between a physical and a moral life , and that forms the primary basis of individual character . In the Bible praise is given , not to the strong man who " taketh a city , " but to the stronger man who " ruleth his own spirit . " This stronger man is he who , by discipline , exercises a constant control over his thoughts , his speech , and his acts . Nine-tenths of the vicious desires that degrade society , and which , when indulged , swell into the crimes that disgrace it , would shrink into insignificance before the advance of valiant self-discipline , self-respect , and self-control . By the watchful exercise of these virtues , purity of heart and mind become habitual , and the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best support of character will always be found in habit , which , according as the will is directed rightly or wrongly , as the case may be , will prove either a benignant ruler or a cruel despot . We may be its willing subject on the one hand , or its servile slave on the other . It may help us on the road to good , or it may hurry us on the road to ruin . Habit is formed by careful training . And it is astonishing how much can be accomplished by systematic discipline and drill . See how , for instance , out of the most unpromising materials  --  such as roughs picked up in the streets , or raw unkempt country lads taken from the plough  --  steady discipline and drill will bring out the unsuspected qualities of courage , endurance , and self-sacrifice ; and how , in the field of battle , or even on the more trying occasions of perils by sea  --  such as the burning of the SARAH SANDS or the wreck of the BIRKENHEAD  --  such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true bravery and heroism ! Nor is moral discipline and drill less influential in the formation of character . Without it , there will be no proper system and order in the regulation of the life . Upon it depends the cultivation of the sense of self-respect , the education of the habit of obedience , the development of the idea of duty . The most self-reliant , self-governing man is always under discipline : and the more perfect the discipline , the higher will be his moral condition . He has to drill his desires , and keep them in subjection to the higher powers of his nature . They must obey the word of command of the internal monitor , the conscience  --  otherwise they will be but the mere slaves of their inclinations , the sport of feeling and impulse . " In the supremacy of self-control , " says Herbert Spencer , " consists one of the perfections of the ideal man . Not to be impulsive  --  not to be spurred hither and thither by each desire that in turn comes uppermost  --  but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feelings in council assembled , before whom every action shall have been fully debated and calmly determined  --  that it is which education , moral education at least , strives to produce . " 151 The first seminary of moral discipline , and the best , as we have already shown , is the home ; next comes the school , and after that the world , the great school of practical life . Each is preparatory to the other , and what the man or woman becomes , depends for the most part upon what has gone before . If they have enjoyed the advantage of neither the home nor the school , but have been allowed to grow up untrained , untaught , and undisciplined , then woe to themselves  --  woe to the society of which they form part ! The best-regulated home is always that in which the discipline is the most perfect , and yet where it is the least felt . Moral discipline acts with the force of a law of nature . Those subject to it yield themselves to it unconsciously ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the life becomes crystallized in habit , the influence thus exercised is for the most part unseen and almost unfelt . The importance of strict domestic discipline is curiously illustrated by a fact mentioned in Mrs. Schimmelpenninck 's Memoirs , to the following effect : that a lady who , with her husband , had inspected most of the lunatic asylums of England and the Continent , found the most numerous class of patients was almost always composed of those who had been only children , and whose wills had therefore rarely been thwarted or disciplined in early life ; whilst those who were members of large families , and who had been trained in self-discipline , were far less frequent victims to the malady . Although the moral character depends in a great degree on temperament and on physical health , as well as on domestic and early training and the example of companions , it is also in the power of each individual to regulate , to restrain , and to discipline it by watchful and persevering self-control . A competent teacher has said of the propensities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek , while they are much more essential to happiness . Dr. Johnson , though himself constitutionally prone to melancholy , and afflicted by it as few have been from his earliest years , said that " a man 's being in a good or bad humour very much depends upon his will . " We may train ourselves in a habit of patience and contentment on the one hand , or of grumbling and discontent on the other . We may accustom ourselves to exaggerate small evils , and to underestimate great blessings . We may even become the victim of petty miseries by giving way to them . Thus , we may educate ourselves in a happy disposition , as well as in a morbid one . Indeed , the habit of viewing things cheerfully , and of thinking about life hopefully , may be made to grow up in us like any other habit . 152 It was not an exaggerated estimate of Dr. Johnson to say , that the habit of looking at the best side of any event is worth far more than a thousand pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rigid self-discipline and self-restraint . He is to be sober and vigilant , to eschew evil and do good , to walk in the spirit , to be obedient unto death , to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand ; to wrestle against spiritual wickedness , and against the rulers of the darkness of this world ; to be rooted and built up in faith , and not to be weary of well-doing ; for in due season he shall reap , if he faint not . The man of business also must needs be subject to strict rule and system . Business , like life , is managed by moral leverage ; success in both depending in no small degree upon that regulation of temper and careful self-discipline , which give a wise man not only a command over himself , but over others . Forbearance and self-control smooth the road of life , and open many ways which would otherwise remain closed . And so does self-respect : for as men respect themselves , so will they usually respect the personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in business . Success in that sphere of life is achieved less by talent than by temper , less by genius than by character . If a man have not self-control , he will lack patience , be wanting in tact , and have neither the power of governing himself nor of managing others . When the quality most needed in a Prime Minister was the subject of conversation in the presence of Mr. Pitt , one of the speakers said it was " Eloquence ; " another said it was " Knowledge ; " and a third said it was " Toil , " " No , " said Pitt , " it is Patience ! " And patience means self-control , a quality in which he himself was superb . His friend George Rose has said of him that he never once saw Pitt out of temper . 153 Yet , although patience is usually regarded as a " slow " virtue , Pitt combined with it the most extraordinary readiness , vigour , and rapidity of thought as well as action . It is by patience and self-control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the most prominent characteristics of the great Hampden , whose noble qualities were generously acknowledged even by his political enemies . Thus Clarendon described him as a man of rare temper and modesty , naturally cheerful and vivacious , and above all , of a flowing courtesy . He was kind and intrepid , yet gentle , of unblameable conversation , and his heart glowed with love to all men . He was not a man of many words , but , being of unimpeachable character , every word he uttered carried weight . " No man had ever a greater power over himself .... He was very temperate in diet , and a supreme governor over all his passions and affections ; and he had thereby great power over other men 's . " Sir Philip Warwick , another of his political opponents , incidentally describes his great influence in a certain debate : " We had catched at each other 's locks , and sheathed our swords in each other 's bowels , had not the sagacity and great calmness of Mr. Hampden , by a short speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry debate until the next morning . " A strong temper is not necessarily a bad temper . But the stronger the temper , the greater is the need of self-discipline and self-control . Dr. Johnson says men grow better as they grow older , and improve with experience ; but this depends upon the width , and depth , and generousness of their nature . It is not men 's faults that ruin them so much as the manner in which they conduct themselves after the faults have been committed . The wise will profit by the suffering they cause , and eschew them for the future ; but there are those on whom experience exerts no ripening influence , and who only grow narrower and bitterer and more vicious with time . What is called strong temper in a young man , often indicates a large amount of unripe energy , which will expend itself in useful work if the road be fairly opened to it . It is said of Stephen Gerard , a Frenchman , who pursued a remarkably successful career in the United States , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would readily take him into his employment , and set him to work in a room by himself ; Gerard being of opinion that such persons were the best workers , and that their energy would expend itself in work if removed from the temptation to quarrel . Strong temper may only mean a strong and excitable will . Uncontrolled , it displays itself in fitful outbreaks of passion ; but controlled and held in subjection  --  like steam pent-up within the organised mechanism of a steam-engine , the use of which is regulated and controlled by slide-valves and governors and levers  --  it may become a source of energetic power and usefulness . Hence , some of the greatest characters in history have been men of strong temper , but of equally strong determination to hold their motive power under strict regulation and control . The famous Earl of Strafford was of an extremely choleric and passionate nature , and had great struggles with himself in his endeavours to control his temper . Referring to the advice of one of his friends , old Secretary Cooke , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to caution him against indulging it , he wrote : " You gave me a good lesson to be patient ; and , indeed , my years and natural inclinations give me heat more than enough , which , however , I trust more experience shall cool , and a watch over myself in time altogether overcome ; in the meantime , in this at least it will set forth itself more pardonable , because my earnestness shall ever be for the honour , justice , and profit of my master ; and it is not always anger , but the misapplying of it , that is the vice so blameable , and of disadvantage to those that let themselves loose there-unto. " 154 Cromwell , also , is described as having been of a wayward and violent temper in his youth  --  cross , untractable , and masterless  --  with a vast quantity of youthful energy , which exploded in a variety of youthful mischiefs . He even obtained the reputation of a roysterer in his native town , and seemed to be rapidly going to the bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laid hold upon his strong nature , and subjected it to the iron discipline of Calvinism . An entirely new direction was thus given to his energy of temperament , which forced an outlet for itself into public life , and eventually became the dominating influence in England for a period of nearly twenty years . The heroic princes of the House of Nassau were all distinguished for the same qualities of self-control , self-denial , and determination of purpose . William the Silent was so called , not because he was a taciturn man  --  for he was an eloquent and powerful speaker where eloquence was necessary  --  but because he was a man who could hold his tongue when it was wisdom not to speak , and because he carefully kept his own counsel when to have revealed it might have been dangerous to the liberties of his country . He was so gentle and conciliatory in his manner that his enemies even described him as timid and pusillanimous . Yet , when the time for action came , his courage was heroic , his determination unconquerable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motley , the historian of the Netherlands , " tranquil amid raging billows , was the favourite emblem by which his friends expressed their sense of his firmness . " Mr. Motley compares William the Silent to Washington , whom he in many respects resembled . The American , like the Dutch patriot , stands out in history as the very impersonation of dignity , bravery , purity , and personal excellence . His command over his feelings , even in moments of great difficulty and danger , was such as to convey the impression , to those who did not know him intimately , that he was a man of inborn calmness and almost impassiveness of disposition . Yet Washington was by nature ardent and impetuous ; his mildness , gentleness , politeness , and consideration for others , were the result of rigid self-control and unwearied self-discipline , which he diligently practised even from his boyhood . His biographer says of him , that " his temperament was ardent , his passions strong , and amidst the multiplied scenes of temptation and excitement through which he passed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check the one and subdue the other . " And again : " His passions were strong , and sometimes they broke out with vehemence , but he had the power of checking them in an instant . Perhaps self-control was the most remarkable trait of his character . It was in part the effect of discipline ; yet he seems by nature to have possessed this power in a degree which has been denied to other men . " 15*5 The Duke of Wellington 's natural temper , like that of Napoleon , was irritable in the extreme ; and it was only by watchful self-control that he was enabled to restrain it . He studied calmness and coolness in the midst of danger , like any Indian chief . At Waterloo , and elsewhere , he gave his orders in the most critical moments , without the slightest excitement , and in a tone of voice almost more than usually subdued . 156 Wordsworth the poet was , in his childhood , " of a stiff , moody , and violent temper , " and " perverse and obstinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplined his temper , he learnt to exercise greater self-control ; but , at the same time , the qualities which distinguished him as a child were afterwards useful in enabling him to defy the criticism of his enemies . Nothing was more marked than Wordsworth 's self-respect and self-determination , as well as his self-consciousness of power , at all periods of his history . Henry Martyn , the missionary , was another instance of a man in whom strength of temper was only so much pent-up , unripe energy . As a boy he was impatient , petulant , and perverse ; but by constant wrestling against his tendency to wrongheadedness , he gradually gained the requisite strength , so as to entirely overcome it , and to acquire what he so greatly coveted  --  the gift of patience . A man may be feeble in organization , but , blessed with a happy temperament , his soul may be great , active , noble , and sovereign . Professor Tyndall has given us a fine picture of the character of Faraday , and of his self-denying labours in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strong , original , and even fiery nature , and yet of extreme tenderness and sensibility . " Underneath his sweetness and gentleness , " he says , " was the heat of a volcano . He was a man of excitable and fiery nature ; but , through high self-discipline , he had converted the fire into a central glow and motive power of life , instead of permitting it to waste itself in useless passion . " There was one fine feature in Faraday 's character which is worthy of notice  --  one closely akin to self-control : it was his self-denial . By devoting himself to analytical chemistry , he might have speedily realised a large fortune ; but he nobly resisted the temptation , and preferred to follow the path of pure science . " Taking the duration of his life into account , " says Mr. Tyndall , " this son of a blacksmith and apprentice to a bookbinder had to decide between a fortune of L.150,000 on the one side , and his undowered science on the other . He chose the latter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory of holding aloft among the nations the scientific name of England for a period of forty years . " 157 Take a like instance of the self-denial of a Frenchman . The historian Anquetil was one of the small number of literary men in France who refused to bow to the Napoleonic yoke . He sank into great poverty , living on bread-and-milk , and limiting his expenditure to only three sous a day . " I have still two sous a day left , " said he , " for the conqueror of Marengo and Austerlitz . " " But if you fall sick , " said a friend to him , " you will need the help of a pension . Why not do as others do ? Pay court to the Emperor  --  you have need of him to live . " " I do not need him to die , " was the historian 's reply . But Anquetil did not die of poverty ; he lived to the age of ninety-four , saying to a friend , on the eve of his death , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ! " Sir James Outram exhibited the same characteristic of noble self-denial , though in an altogether different sphere of life . Like the great King Arthur , he was emphatically a man who " forbore his own advantage . " He was characterised throughout his whole career by his noble unselfishness . Though he might personally disapprove of the policy he was occasionally ordered to carry out , he never once faltered in the path of duty . Thus he did not approve of the policy of invading Scinde ; yet his services throughout the campaign were acknowledged by General Sir C. Napier to have been of the most brilliant character . But when the war was over , and the rich spoils of Scinde lay at the conqueror 's feet , Outram said : " I disapprove of the policy of this war  --  I will accept no share of the prize-money ! " Not less marked was his generous self-denial when despatched with a strong force to aid Havelock in fighting his way to Lucknow . As superior officer , he was entitled to take upon himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already done , with rare disinterestedness , he left to his junior officer the glory of completing the campaign , offering to serve under him as a volunteer . " With such reputation , " said Lord Clyde , " as Major-General Outram has won for himself , he can afford to share glory and honour with others . But that does not lessen the value of the sacrifice he has made with such disinterested generosity . " If a man would get through life honourably and peaceably , he must necessarily learn to practise self-denial in small things as well as great . Men have to bear as well as forbear . The temper has to be held in subjection to the judgment ; and the little demons of ill-humour , petulance , and sarcasm , kept resolutely at a distance . If once they find an entrance to the mind , they are very apt to return , and to establish for themselves a permanent occupation there . It is necessary to one 's personal happiness , to exercise control over one 's words as well as acts : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and men may " speak daggers , " though they use none . " UN COUP DE LANGUE , " says the French proverb , " EST PIRE QU'UN COUP DE LANCE . " The stinging repartee that rises to the lips , and which , if uttered , might cover an adversary with confusion , how difficult it sometimes is to resist saying it ! " Heaven keep us , " says Miss Bremer in her ' Home , ' " from the destroying power of words ! There are words which sever hearts more than sharp swords do ; there are words the point of which sting the heart through the course of a whole life . " Thus character exhibits itself in self-control of speech as much as in anything else . The wise and forbearant man will restrain his desire to say a smart or severe thing at the expense of another 's feelings ; while the fool blurts out what he thinks , and will sacrifice his friend rather than his joke . " The mouth of a wise man , " said Solomon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool is in his mouth . " There are , however , men who are no fools , that are headlong in their language as in their acts , because of their want of forbearance and self-restraining patience . The impulsive genius , gifted with quick thought and incisive speech  --  perhaps carried away by the cheers of the moment  --  lets fly a sarcastic sentence which may return upon him to his own infinite damage . Even statesmen might be named , who have failed through their inability to resist the temptation of saying clever and spiteful things at their adversary 's expense . " The turn of a sentence , " says Bentham , " has decided the fate of many a friendship , and , for aught that we know , the fate of many a kingdom . " So , when one is tempted to write a clever but harsh thing , though it may be difficult to restrain it , it is always better to leave it in the inkstand . " A goose 's quill , " says the Spanish proverb , " often hurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when speaking of Oliver Cromwell , " He that can not withal keep his mind to himself , can not practise any considerable thing whatsoever . " It was said of William the Silent , by one of his greatest enemies , that an arrogant or indiscreet word was never known to fall from his lips . Like him , Washington was discretion itself in the use of speech , never taking advantage of an opponent , or seeking a shortlived triumph in a debate . And it is said that in the long run , the world comes round to and supports the wise man who knows when and how to be silent . We have heard men of great experience say that they have often regretted having spoken , but never once regretted holding their tongue . " Be silent , " says Pythagoras , " or say something better than silence . " " Speak fitly , " says George Herbert , " or be silent wisely . " St. Francis de Sales , whom Leigh Hunt styled " the Gentleman Saint , " has said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth ill-humouredly , and so spoil an excellent dish by covering it with bad sauce . " Another Frenchman , Lacordaire , characteristically puts speech first , and silence next . " After speech , " he says , " silence is the greatest power in the world . " Yet a word spoken in season , how powerful it may be ! As the old Welsh proverb has it , " A golden tongue is in the mouth of the blessed . " It is related , as a remarkable instance of self-control on the part of De Leon , a distinguished Spanish poet of the sixteenth century , who lay for years in the dungeons of the Inquisition without light or society , because of his having translated a part of the Scriptures into his native tongue , that on being liberated and restored to his professorship , an immense crowd attended his first lecture , expecting some account of his long imprisonment ; but Do Leon was too wise and too gentle to indulge in recrimination . He merely resumed the lecture which , five years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula " HERI DICEBAMUS , " and went directly into his subject . There are , of course , times and occasions when the expression of indignation is not only justifiable but necessary . We are bound to be indignant at falsehood , selfishness , and cruelty . A man of true feeling fires up naturally at baseness or meanness of any sort , even in cases where he may be under no obligation to speak out . " I would have nothing to do , " said Perthes , " with the man who can not be moved to indignation . There are more good people than bad in the world , and the bad get the upper hand merely because they are bolder . We can not help being pleased with a man who uses his powers with decision ; and we often take his side for no other reason than because he does so use them . No doubt , I have often repented speaking ; but not less often have I repented keeping silence . " 158 One who loves right can not be indifferent to wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will speak warmly , out of the fulness of his heart . As a noble lady 159 has written : " A noble heart doth teach a virtuous scorn  - -  To scorn to owe a duty overlong , To scorn to be for benefits forborne , To scorn to lie , to scorn to do a wrong , To scorn to bear an injury in mind , To scorn a freeborn heart slave-like to bind . " We have , however , to be on our guard against impatient scorn . The best people are apt to have their impatient side ; and often , the very temper which makes men earnest , makes them also intolerant . 1510 " Of all mental gifts , " says Miss Julia Wedgwood , " the rarest is intellectual patience ; and the last lesson of culture is to believe in difficulties which are invisible to ourselves . " The best corrective of intolerance in disposition , is increase of wisdom and enlarged experience of life . Cultivated good sense will usually save men from the entanglements in which moral impatience is apt to involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind which enables its possessor to deal with the practical affairs of life with justice , judgment , discretion , and charity . Hence men of culture and experience are invariably , found the most forbearant and tolerant , as ignorant and narrowminded persons are found the most unforgiving and intolerant . Men of large and generous natures , in proportion to their practical wisdom , are disposed to make allowance for the defects and disadvantages of others  --  allowance for the controlling power of circumstances in the formation of character , and the limited power of resistance of weak and fallible natures to temptation and error . " I see no fault committed , " said Goethe , " which I also might not have committed . " So a wise and good man exclaimed , when he saw a criminal drawn on his hurdle to Tyburn : " There goes Jonathan Bradford  --  but for the grace of God ! " Life will always be , to a great extent , what we ourselves make it . The cheerful man makes a cheerful world , the gloomy man a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected in the dispositions of those about us . If we are ourselves querulous , we will find them so ; if we are unforgiving and uncharitable to them , they will be the same to us . A person returning from an evening party not long ago , complained to a policeman on his beat that an ill-looking fellow was following him : it turned out to be only his own shadow ! And such usually is human life to each of us ; it is , for the most part , but the reflection of ourselves . If we would be at peace with others , and ensure their respect , we must have regard for their personality . Every man has his peculiarities of manner and character , as he has peculiarities of form and feature ; and we must have forbearance in dealing with them , as we expect them to have forbearance in dealing with us . We may not be conscious of our own peculiarities , yet they exist nevertheless . There is a village in South America where gotos or goitres are so common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day a party of Englishmen passed through the place , when quite a crowd collected to jeer them , shouting : " See , see these people  --  they have got NO GOTOS ! " Many persons give themselves a great deal of fidget concerning what other people think of them and their peculiarities . Some are too much disposed to take the illnatured side , and , judging by themselves , infer the worst . But it is very often the case that the uncharitableness of others , where it really exists , is but the reflection of our own want of charity and want of temper . It still oftener happens , that the worry we subject ourselves to , has its source in our own imagination . And even though those about us may think of us uncharitably , we shall not mend matters by exasperating ourselves against them . We may thereby only expose ourselves unnecessarily to their illnature or caprice . " The ill that comes out of our mouth , " says Herbert , " ofttimes falls into our bosom . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable advice , full of practical wisdom , the result of a rich experience of life , in a letter to his friend Professor Tyndall : - " Let me , as an old man , who ought by this time to have profited by experience , say that when I was younger I found I often misrepresented the intentions of people , and that they did not mean what at the time I supposed they meant ; and further , that , as a general rule , it was better to be a little dull of apprehension where phrases seemed to imply pique , and quick in perception when , on the contrary , they seemed to imply kindly feeling . The real truth never fails ultimately to appear ; and opposing parties , if wrong , are sooner convinced when replied to forbearingly , than when overwhelmed . All I mean to say is , that it is better to be blind to the results of partisanship , and quick to see goodwill . One has more happiness in one 's self in endeavouring to follow the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been heated in private when opposed , as I have thought unjustly and superciliously , and yet I have striven , and succeeded , I hope , in keeping down replies of the like kind . And I know I have never lost by it . " 1511 While the painter Barry was at Rome , he involved himself , as was his wont , in furious quarrels with the artists and dilettanti , about picture-painting and picture-dealing , upon which his friend and countryman , Edmund Burke  --  always the generous friend of struggling merit  --  wrote to him kindly and sensibly : " Believe me , dear Barry , that the arms with which the ill-dispositions of the world are to be combated , and the qualities by which it is to be reconciled to us , and we reconciled to it , are moderation , gentleness , a little indulgence to others , and a great deal of distrust of ourselves ; which are not qualities of a mean spirit , as some may possibly think them , but virtues of a great and noble kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they contribute to our repose and fortune ; for nothing can be so unworthy of a well-composed soul as to pass away life in bickerings and litigations  --  in snarling and scuffling with every one about us . We must be at peace with our species , if not for their sakes , at least very much for our own . " 1512 No one knew the value of self-control better than the poet Burns , and no one could teach it more eloquently to others ; but when it came to practice , Burns was as weak as the weakest . He could not deny himself the pleasure of uttering a harsh and clever sarcasm at another 's expense . One of his biographers observes of him , that it was no extravagant arithmetic to say that for every ten jokes he made himself a hundred enemies . But this was not all . Poor Burns exercised no control over his appetites , but freely gave them rein : " Thus thoughtless follies laid him low And stained his name . " Nor had he the self-denial to resist giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap-room , but which continue secretly to sow pollution broadcast in the minds of youth . Indeed , notwithstanding the many exquisite poems of this writer , it is not saying too much to aver that his immoral writings have done far more harm than his purer writings have done good ; and that it would be better that all his writings should be destroyed and forgotten provided his indecent songs could be destroyed with them . The remark applies alike to Beranger , who has been styled " The Burns of France . " Beranger was of the same bright incisive genius ; he had the same love of pleasure , the same love of popularity ; and while he flattered French vanity to the top of its bent , he also painted the vices most loved by his countrymen with the pen of a master . Beranger 's songs and Thiers ' History probably did more than anything else to reestablish the Napoleonic dynasty in France . But that was a small evil compared with the moral mischief which many of Beranger 's songs are calculated to produce ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they exhibit pictures of nastiness and vice , which are enough to pollute and destroy a nation . One of Burns 's finest poems , written , in his twenty-eighth year , is entitled ' A Bard 's Epitaph . ' It is a description , by anticipation , of his own life . Wordsworth has said of it : " Here is a sincere and solemn avowal ; a public declaration from his own will ; a confession at once devout , poetical and human ; a history in the shape of a prophecy . " It concludes with these lines :  --  " Reader , attend  --  whether thy soul Soars fancy 's flights beyond the pole , Or darkling grubs this earthly hole In low pursuit ; Know  --  prudent , cautious self-control , Is Wisdom 's root . " One of the vices before which Burns fell  --  and it may be said to be a master-vice , because it is productive of so many other vices  --  was drinking . Not that he was a drunkard , but because he yielded to the temptations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depraved his whole nature . 1513 But poor Burns did not stand alone ; for , alas ! of all vices , the unrestrained appetite for drink was in his time , as it continues to be now , the most prevalent , popular , degrading , and destructive . Were it possible to conceive the existence of a tyrant who should compel his people to give up to him one-third or more of their earnings , and require them at the same time to consume a commodity that should brutalise and degrade them , destroy the peace and comfort of their families , and sow in themselves the seeds of disease and premature death  --  what indignation meetings , what monster processions there would be ! ' What eloquent speeches and apostrophes to the spirit of liberty !  --  what appeals against a despotism so monstrous and so unnatural ! And yet such a tyrant really exists amongst us  --  the tyrant of unrestrained appetite , whom no force of arms , or voices , or votes can resist , while men are willing to be his slaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral means  --  by self-discipline , self-respect , and self-control . There is no other way of withstanding the despotism of appetite in any of its forms . No reform of institutions , no extended power of voting , no improved form of government , no amount of scholastic instruction , can possibly elevate the character of a people who voluntarily abandon themselves to sensual indulgence . The pursuit of ignoble pleasure is the degradation of true happiness ; it saps the morals , destroys the energies , and degrades the manliness and robustness of individuals as of nations . The courage of self-control exhibits itself in many ways , but in none more clearly than in honest living . Men without the virtue of self-denial are not only subject to their own selfish desires , but they are usually in bondage to others who are likeminded with themselves . What others do , they do . They must live according to the artificial standard of their class , spending like their neighbours , regardless of the consequences , at the same time that all are , perhaps , aspiring after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries the others along with him , and they have not the moral courage to stop . They can not resist the temptation of living high , though it may be at the expense of others ; and they gradually become reckless of debt , until it enthrals them . In all this there is great moral cowardice , pusillanimity , and want of manly independence of character . A right-minded man will shrink from seeming to be what he is not , or pretending to be richer than he really is , or assuming a style of living that his circumstances will not justify . He will have the courage to live honestly within his own means , rather than dishonestly upon the means of other people ; for he who incurs debts in striving to maintain a style of living beyond his income , is in spirit as dishonest as the man who openly picks your pocket . To many , this may seem an extreme view , but it will bear the strictest test . Living at the cost of others is not only dishonesty , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The proverb of George Herbert , that " debtors are liars , " is justified by experience . Shaftesbury somewhere says that a restlessness to have something which we have not , and to be something which we are not , is the root of all immorality. 1514 No reliance is to be placed on the saying  --  a very dangerous one  --  of Mirabeau , that " LA PETITE MORALE ETAIT L'ENNEMIE DE LA GRANDE . " On the contrary , strict adherence to even the smallest details of morality is the foundation of all manly and noble character . The honourable man is frugal of his means , and pays his way honestly . He does not seek to pass himself off as richer than he is , or , by running into debt , open an account with ruin . As that man is not poor whose means are small , but whose desires are uncontrolled , so that man is rich whose means are more than sufficient for his wants . When Socrates saw a great quantity of riches , jewels , and furniture of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Now do I see how many things I do NOT desire . " " I can forgive everything but selfishness , " said Perthes . " Even the narrowest circumstances admit of greatness with reference to ' mine and thine ' ; and none but the very poorest need fill their daily life with thoughts of money , if they have but prudence to arrange their housekeeping within the limits of their income . " A man may be indifferent to money because of higher considerations , as Faraday was , who sacrificed wealth to pursue science ; but if he would have the enjoyments that money can purchase , he must honestly earn it , and not live upon the earnings of others , as those do who habitually incur debts which they have no means of paying . When Maginn , always drowned in debt , was asked what he paid for his wine , he replied that he did not know , but he believed they " put something down in a book . " 1515 This " putting-down in a book " has proved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not resist the temptation of taking things upon credit which they have not the present means of paying for ; and it would probably prove of great social benefit if the law which enables creditors to recover debts contracted under certain circumstances were altogether abolished . But , in the competition for trade , every encouragement is given to the incurring of debt , the creditor relying upon the law to aid him in the last extremity . When Sydney Smith once went into a new neighbourhood , it was given out in the local papers that he was a man of high connections , and he was besought on all sides for his " custom . " But he speedily undeceived his new neighbours . " We are not great people at all , " he said : " we are only common honest people  --  people that pay our debts . " Hazlitt , who was a thoroughly honest though rather thriftless man , speaks of two classes of persons , not unlike each other  --  those who can not keep their own money in their hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . The former are always in want of money , for they throw it away on any object that first presents itself , as if to get rid of it ; the latter make away with what they have of their own , and are perpetual borrowers from all who will lend to them ; and their genius for borrowing , in the long run , usually proves their ruin . Sheridan was one of such eminent unfortunates . He was impulsive and careless in his expenditure , borrowing money , and running into debt with everybody who would trust him . When he stood for Westminster , his unpopularity arose chiefly from his general indebtedness . " Numbers of poor people , " says Lord Palmerston in one of his letters , " crowded round the hustings , demanding payment for the bills he owed them . " In the midst of all his difficulties , Sheridan was as lighthearted as ever , and cracked many a good joke at his creditors ' expense . Lord Palmerston was actually present at the dinner given by him , at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as waiters Yet however loose Sheridan 's morality may have been as regarded his private creditors , he was honest so far as the public money was concerned . Once , at dinner , at which Lord Byron happened to be present , an observation happened to be made as to the sturdiness of the Whigs in resisting office , and keeping to their principles  --  on which Sheridan turned sharply and said : " Sir , it is easy for my Lord this , or Earl that , or the Marquis of t' other , with thousands upon thousands a year , some of it either presently derived or inherited in sinecure or acquisitions from the public money , to boast of their patriotism , and keep aloof from temptation ; but they do not know from what temptation those have kept aloof who had equal pride , at least equal talents , and not unequal passions , and nevertheless knew not , in the course of their lives , what it was to have a shilling of their own . " And Lord Byron adds , that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public morality in money-matters was very low in those days . Political peculation was not thought discreditable ; and heads of parties did not hesitate to secure the adhesion of their followers by a free use of the public money . They were generous , but at the expense of others  --  like that great local magnate , who , " Out of his great bounty , Built a bridge at the expense of the county . " When Lord Cornwallis was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland , he pressed upon Colonel Napier , the father of THE Napiers , the comptrollership of army accounts . " I want , " said his Lordship , " AN HONEST MAN , and this is the only thing I have been able to wrest from the harpies around me . " It is said that Lord Chatham was the first to set the example of disdaining to govern by petty larceny ; and his great son was alike honest in his administration . While millions of money were passing through Pitt 's hands , he himself was never otherwise than poor ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ever ventured to call in question his honesty . In former times , the profits of office were sometimes enormous . When Audley , the famous annuity-monger of the sixteenth century , was asked the value of an office which he had purchased in the Court of Wards , he replied :  --  " Some thousands to any one who wishes to get to heaven immediately ; twice as much to him who does not mind being in purgatory ; and nobody knows what to him who is not afraid of the devil . " Sir Walter Scott was a man who was honest to the core of his nature and his strenuous and determined efforts to pay his debts , or rather the debts of the firm with which he had become involved , has always appeared to us one of the grandest things in biography . When his publisher and printer broke down , ruin seemed to stare him in the face . There was no want of sympathy for him in his great misfortune , and friends came forward who offered to raise money enough to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said he , proudly ; " this right hand shall work it all off ! " " If we lose everything else , " he wrote to a friend , " we will at least keep our honour unblemished. " 1517 While his health was already becoming undermined by overwork , he went on " writing like a tiger , " as he himself expressed it , until no longer able to wield a pen ; and though he paid the penalty of his supreme efforts with his life , he nevertheless saved his honour and his self-respect . Everybody knows bow Scott threw off ' Woodstock , ' the ' Life of Napoleon ' 15which he thought would be his death 1518 , articles for the ' Quarterly , ' ' Chronicles of the Canongate , ' ' Prose Miscellanies , ' and ' Tales of a Grandfather '  --  all written in the midst of pain , sorrow , and ruin . The proceeds of those various works went to his creditors . " I could not have slept sound , " he wrote , " as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks of my creditors , and the conscious feeling of discharging my duty as a man of honour and honesty . I see before me a long , tedious , and dark path , but it leads to stainless reputation . If I die in the harrows , as is very likely , I shall die with honour . If I achieve my task , I shall have the thanks of all concerned , and the approbation of my own conscience . " 1519 And then followed more articles , memoirs , and even sermons  --  ' The Fair Maid of Perth , ' a completely revised edition of his novels , ' Anne of Geierstein , ' and more ' Tales of a Grandfather '  --  until he was suddenly struck down by paralysis . But he had no sooner recovered sufficient strength to be able to hold a pen , than we find him again at his desk writing the ' Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft , ' a volume of Scottish History for ' Lardner 's Cyclopaedia , ' and a fourth series of ' Tales of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors told him to give up work ; he would not be dissuaded . " As for bidding me not work , " he said to Dr. Abercrombie , " Molly might just as well put the kettle on the fire and say , ' Now , kettle , do n't boil ; ' " to which he added , " If I were to be idle I should go mad ! " By means of the profits realised by these tremendous efforts , Scott saw his debts in course of rapid diminution , and he trusted that , after a few more years ' work , he would again be a free man . But it was not to be . He went on turning out such works as his ' Count Robert of Paris ' with greatly impaired skill , until he was prostrated by another and severer attack of palsy . He now felt that the plough was nearing the end of the furrow ; his physical strength was gone ; he was " not quite himself in all things , " and yet his courage and perseverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote in his Diary , " though rather in body than in mind , and I often wish I could lie down and sleep without waking . But I WILL FIGHT IT OUT IF I CAN . " He again recovered sufficiently to be able to write ' Castle Dangerous , ' though the cunning of the workman 's hand had departed . And then there was his last tour to Italy in search of rest and health , during which , while at Naples , in spite of all remonstrances , he gave several hours every morning to the composition of a new novel , which , however , has not seen the light . Scott returned to Abbotsford to die . " I have seen much , " he said on his return , " but nothing like my own house  --  give me one turn more . " One of the last things he uttered , in one of his lucid intervals , was worthy of him . " I have been , " he said , " perhaps the most voluminous author of my day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have tried to unsettle no man 's faith , to corrupt no man 's principles , and that I have written nothing which on my deathbed I should wish blotted out . " His last injunction to his son-in-law was : " Lockhart , I may have but a minute to speak to you . My dear , be virtuous  --  be religious  --  be a good man . Nothing else will give you any comfort when you come to lie here . " The devoted conduct of Lockhart himself was worthy of his great relative . The ' Life of Scott , ' which he afterwards wrote , occupied him several years , and was a remarkably successful work . Yet he himself derived no pecuniary advantage from it ; handing over the profits of the whole undertaking to Sir Walter 's creditors in payment of debts which he was in no way responsible , but influenced entirely by a spirit of honour , of regard for the memory of the illustrious dead . CHAPTER VII .  --  DUTY  --  TRUTHFULNESS . " I slept , and dreamt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was Duty . " " Duty ! wondrous thought , that workest neither by fond insinuation , flattery , nor by any threat , but merely by holding up thy naked law in the soul , and so extorting for thyself always reverence , if not always obedience ; before whom all appetites are dumb , however secretly they rebel "  - -  KANT . " How happy is he born and taught , That serveth not another 's will ! Whose armour is his honest thought , And simple truth his utmost skill ! " Whose passions not his masters are , Whose soul is still prepared for death ; Unti 'd unto the world by care Of public fame , or private breath . " This man is freed from servile bands , Of hope to rise , or fear to fall : Lord of himself , though not of land ; And having nothing , yet hath all . "  --  WOTTON . " His nay was nay without recall ; His yea was yea , and powerful all ; He gave his yea with careful heed , His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bond and seal . " INSCRIPTION ON BARON STEIN 'S TOMB . DUTY is a thing that is due , and must be paid by every man who would avoid present discredit and eventual moral insolvency . It is an obligation  --  a debt  --  which can only be discharged by voluntary effort and resolute action in the affairs of life . Duty embraces man 's whole existence . It begins in the home , where there is the duty which children owe to their parents on the one hand , and the duty which parents owe to their children on the other . There are , in like manner , the respective duties of husbands and wives , of masters and servants ; while outside the home there are the duties which men and women owe to each other as friends and neighbours , as employers and employed , as governors and governed . " Render , therefore , " says St. Paul , " to all their dues : tribute to whom tribute is due ; custom to whom custom ; fear to whom fear ; honour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love one another ; for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law , " Thus duty rounds the whole of life , from our entrance into it until our exit from it  --  duty to superiors , duty to inferiors , and duty to equals  --  duty to man , and duty to God . Wherever there is power to use or to direct , there is duty . For we are but as stewards , appointed to employ the means entrusted to us for our own and for others ' good . The abiding sense of duty is the very crown of character . It is the upholding law of man in his highest attitudes . Without it , the individual totters and falls before the first puff of adversity or temptation ; whereas , inspired by it , the weakest becomes strong and full of courage . " Duty , " says Mrs. Jameson , " is the cement which binds the whole moral edifice together ; without which , all power , goodness , intellect , truth , happiness , love itself , can have no permanence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under us , and leaves us at last sitting in the midst of a ruin , astonished at our own desolation . " Duty is based upon a sense of justice  --  justice inspired by love , which is the most perfect form of goodness . Duty is not a sentiment , but a principle pervading the life : and it exhibits itself in conduct and in acts , which are mainly determined by man 's conscience and freewill . The voice of conscience speaks in duty done ; and without its regulating and controlling influence , the brightest and greatest intellect may be merely as a light that leads astray . Conscience sets a man upon his feet , while his will holds him upright . Conscience is the moral governor of the heart  --  the governor of right action , of right thought , of right faith , of right life  --  and only through its dominating influence can the noble and upright character be fully developed . The conscience , however , may speak never so loudly , but without energetic will it may speak in vain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wrong one , but the choice is nothing unless followed by immediate and decisive action . If the sense of duty be strong , and the course of action clear , the courageous will , upheld by the conscience , enables a man to proceed on his course bravely , and to accomplish his purposes in the face of all opposition and difficulty . And should failure be the issue , there will remain at least this satisfaction , that it has been in the cause of duty . " Be and continue poor , young man , " said Heinzelmann , " while others around you grow rich by fraud and disloyalty ; be without place or power while others beg their way upwards ; bear the pain of disappointed hopes , while others gain the accomplishment of theirs by flattery ; forego the gracious pressure of the hand , for which others cringe and crawl . Wrap yourself in your own virtue , and seek a friend and your daily bread . If you have in your own cause grown gray with unbleached honour , bless God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often required to sacrifice all that they esteem and love rather than fail in their duty . The old English idea of this sublime devotion to duty was expressed by the loyalist poet to his sweetheart , on taking up arms for his sovereign :  --  " I could love thee , dear , so much , Loved I not honour more . " 161 And Sertorius has said : " The man who has any dignity of character , should conquer with honour , and not use any base means even to save his life . " So St. Paul , inspired by duty and faith , declared himself as not only " ready to be bound , but to die at Jerusalem . " When the Marquis of Pescara was entreated by the princes of Italy to desert the Spanish cause , to which he was in honour bound , his noble wife , Vittoria Colonna , reminded him of his duty . She wrote to him : " Remember your honour , which raises you above fortune and above kings ; by that alone , and not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory which it will be your happiness and pride to transmit unspotted to your posterity . " Such was the dignified view which she took of her husband 's honour ; and when he fell at Pavia , though young and beautiful , and besought by many admirers , she betook herself to solitude , that she might lament over her husband 's loss and celebrate his exploits . 162 To live really , is to act energetically . Life is a battle to be fought valiantly . Inspired by high and honourable resolve , a man must stand to his post , and die there , if need be . Like the old Danish hero , his determination should be , " to dare nobly , to will strongly , and never to falter in the path of duty . " The power of will , be it great or small , which God has given us , is a Divine gift ; and we ought neither to let it perish for want of using on the one hand , nor profane it by employing it for ignoble purposes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , that man 's real greatness consists not in seeking his own pleasure , or fame , or advancement  --  " not that every one shall save his own life , not that every man shall seek his own glory  --  but that every man shall do his own duty . " What most stands in the way of the performance of duty , is irresolution , weakness of purpose , and indecision . On the one side are conscience and the knowledge of good and evil ; on the other are indolence , selfishness , love of pleasure , or passion . The weak and ill-disciplined will may remain suspended for a time between these influences ; but at length the balance inclines one way or the other , according as the will is called into action or otherwise . If it be allowed to remain passive , the lower influence of selfishness or passion will prevail ; and thus manhood suffers abdication , individuality is renounced , character is degraded , and the man permits himself to become the mere passive slave of his senses . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dictates of conscience , and thereby resisting the impulses of the lower nature , is of essential importance in moral discipline , and absolutely necessary for the development of character in its best forms . To acquire the habit of well-doing , to resist evil propensities , to fight against sensual desires , to overcome inborn selfishness , may require a long and persevering discipline ; but when once the practice of duty is learnt , it becomes consolidated in habit , and thence-forward is comparatively easy . The valiant good man is he who , by the resolute exercise of his freewill , has so disciplined himself as to have acquired the habit of virtue ; as the bad man is he who , by allowing his freewill to remain inactive , and giving the bridle to his desires and passions , has acquired the habit of vice , by which he becomes , at last , bound as by chains of iron . A man can only achieve strength of purpose by the action of his own freewill . If he is to stand erect , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be kept propped up by the help of others . He is master of himself and of his actions . He can avoid falsehood , and be truthful ; he can shun sensualism , and be continent ; he can turn aside from doing a cruel thing , and be benevolent and forgiving . All these lie within the sphere of individual efforts , and come within the range of self-discipline . And it depends upon men themselves whether in these respects they will be free , pure , and good on the one hand ; or enslaved , impure , and miserable on the other . Among the wise sayings of Epictetus we find the following : " We do not choose our own parts in life , and have nothing to do with those parts : our simple duty is confined to playing them well . The slave may be as free as the consul ; and freedom is the chief of blessings ; it dwarfs all others ; beside it all others are insignificant ; with it all others are needless ; without it no others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , in their blindness and misery , they seek it . It is not in strength , for Myro and Ofellius were not happy ; not in wealth , for Croesus was not happy ; not in power , for the Consuls were not happy ; not in all these together , for Nero and Sardanapulus and Agamemnon sighed and wept and tore their hair , and were the slaves of circumstances and the dupes of semblances . It lies in yourselves ; in true freedom , in the absence or conquest of every ignoble fear ; in perfect self-government ; and in a power of contentment and peace , and the even flow of life amid poverty , exile , disease , and the very valley of the shadow of death . " 163 The sense of duty is a sustaining power even to a courageous man . It holds him upright , and makes him strong . It was a noble saying of Pompey , when his friends tried to dissuade him from embarking for Rome in a storm , telling him that he did so at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to go , " he said ; " it is not necessary for me to live . " What it was right that he should do , he would do , in the face of danger and in defiance of storms . As might be expected of the great Washington , the chief motive power in his life was the spirit of duty . It was the regal and commanding element in his character which gave it unity , compactness , and vigour . When he clearly saw his duty before him , he did it at all hazards , and with inflexible integrity . He did not do it for effect ; nor did he think of glory , or of fame and its rewards ; but of the right thing to be done , and the best way of doing it . Yet Washington had a most modest opinion of himself ; and when offered the chief command of the American patriot army , he hesitated to accept it until it was pressed upon him . When acknowledging in Congress the honour which had been done him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the execution of which the future of his country in a great measure depended , Washington said : " I beg it may be remembered , lest some unlucky event should happen unfavourable to my reputation , that I this day declare , with the utmost sincerity , I do not think myself equal to the command I am honoured with . " And in his letter to his wife , communicating to her his appointment as Commander-in-Chief , he said : " I have used every endeavour in my power to avoid it , not only from my unwillingness to part with you and the family , but from a consciousness of its being a trust too great for my capacity ; and that I should enjoy more real happiness in one month with you at home , than I have the most distant prospect of finding abroad , if my stay were to be seven times seven years . But , as it has been a kind of destiny that has thrown me upon this service , I shall hope that my undertaking it is designed for some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse the appointment , without exposing my character to such censures as would have reflected dishonour upon myself , and given pain to my friends . This , I am sure , could not , and ought not , to be pleasing to you , and must have lessened me considerably in my own esteem . " 164 Washington pursued his upright course through life , first as Commander-in-Chief , and afterwards as President , never faltering in the path of duty . He had no regard for popularity , but held to his purpose , through good and through evil report , often at the risk of his power and influence . Thus , on one occasion , when the ratification of a treaty , arranged by Mr. Jay with Great Britain , was in question , Washington was urged to reject it . But his honour , and the honour of his country , was committed , and he refused to do so . A great outcry was raised against the treaty , and for a time Washington was so unpopular that he is said to have been actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it to be his duty to ratify the treaty ; and it was carried out , in despite of petitions and remonstrances from all quarters . " While I feel , " he said , in answer to the remonstrants , " the most lively gratitude for the many instances of approbation from my country , I can no otherwise deserve it than by obeying the dictates of my conscience . " Wellington 's watchword , like Washington 's , was duty ; and no man could be more loyal to it than he was . 165 " There is little or nothing , " he once said , " in this life worth living for ; but we can all of us go straight forward and do our duty . " None recognised more cheerfully than he did the duty of obedience and willing service ; for unless men can serve faithfully , they will not rule others wisely . There is no motto that becomes the wise man better than ICH DIEN , " I serve ; " and " They also serve who only stand and wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his being appointed to a command inferior to what he considered to be his merits , was communicated to the Duke , he said : " In the course of my military career , I have gone from the command of a brigade to that of my regiment , and from the command of an army to that of a brigade or a division , as I was ordered , and without any feeling of mortification . " Whilst commanding the allied army in Portugal , the conduct of the native population did not seem to Wellington to be either becoming or dutiful . " We have enthusiasm in plenty , " he said , " and plenty of cries of ' VIVA ! ' We have illuminations , patriotic songs , and FETES everywhere . But what we want is , that each in his own station should do his duty faithfully , and pay implicit obedience to legal authority . " This abiding ideal of duty seemed to be the governing principle of Wellington 's character . It was always uppermost in his mind , and directed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to communicate itself to those under him , who served him in the like spirit . When he rode into one of his infantry squares at Waterloo , as its diminished numbers closed up to receive a charge of French cavalry , he said to the men , " Stand steady , lads ; think of what they will say of us in England ; " to which the men replied , " Never fear , sir  --  we know our duty . " Duty was also the dominant idea in Nelson 's mind . The spirit in which he served his country was expressed in the famous watchword , " England expects every man to do his duty , " signalled by him to the fleet before going into action at Trafalgar , as well as in the last words that passed his lips ,  --  " I have done my duty ; I praise God for it ! " And Nelson 's companion and friend  --  the brave , sensible , homely-minded Collingwood  --  he who , as his ship bore down into the great sea-fight , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives are going to church in England , "  --  Collingwood too was , like his commander , an ardent devotee of duty . " Do your duty to the best of your ability , " was the maxim which he urged upon many young men starting on the voyage of life . To a midshipman he once gave the following manly and sensible advice : - " You may depend upon it , that it is more in your own power than in anybody else 's to promote both your comfort and advancement . A strict and unwearied attention to your duty , and a complacent and respectful behaviour , not only to your superiors but to everybody , will ensure you their regard , and the reward will surely come ; but if it should not , I am convinced you have too much good sense to let disappointment sour you . Guard carefully against letting discontent appear in you . It will be sorrow to your friends , a triumph to your competitors , and can not be productive of any good . Conduct yourself so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consciousness of your own proper behaviour will keep you in spirits if it should not come . Let it be your ambition to be foremost in all duty . Do not be a nice observer of turns , but ever present yourself ready for everything , and , unless your officers are very inattentive men , they will not allow others to impose more duty on you than they should . " This devotion to duty is said to be peculiar to the English nation ; and it has certainly more or less characterised our greatest public men . Probably no commander of any other nation ever went into action with such a signal flying as Nelson at Trafalgar  --  not " Glory , " or " Victory , " or " Honour , " or " Country "  --  but simply " Duty ! " How few are the nations willing to rally to such a battle-cry ! Shortly after the wreck of the BIRKENHEAD off the coast of Africa , in which the officers and men went down firing a FEU-DE-JOIE after seeing the women and children safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to the circumstance in one of his letters , said : " Yes ! Goodness , Duty , Sacrifice ,  --  these are the qualities that England honours . She gapes and wonders every now and then , like an awkward peasant , at some other things  --  railway kings , electro-biology , and other trumperies ; but nothing stirs her grand old heart down to its central deeps universally and long , except the Right . She puts on her shawl very badly , and she is awkward enough in a concert-room , scarce knowing a Swedish nightingale from a jackdaw ; but  --  blessings large and long upon her !  --  she knows how to teach her sons to sink like men amidst sharks and billows , without parade , without display , as if Duty were the most natural thing in the world ; and she never mistakes long an actor for a hero , or a hero for an actor . " 166 It is a grand thing , after all , this pervading spirit of Duty in a nation ; and so long as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when it has departed , or become deadened , and been supplanted by thirst for pleasure , or selfish aggrandisement , or " glory "  --  then woe to that nation , for its dissolution is near at hand ! If there be one point on which intelligent observers are agreed more than another as to the cause of the late deplorable collapse of France as a nation , it was the utter absence of this feeling of duty , as well as of truthfulness , from the mind , not only of the men , but of the leaders of the French people . The unprejudiced testimony of Baron Stoffel , French military attache at Berlin , before the war , is conclusive on this point . In his private report to the Emperor , found at the Tuileries , which was written in August , 1869 , about a year before the outbreak of the war , Baron Stoffel pointed out that the highly-educated and disciplined German people were pervaded by an ardent sense of duty , and did not think it beneath them to reverence sincerely what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , France presented a melancholy contrast . There the people , having sneered at everything , had lost the faculty of respecting anything , and virtue , family life , patriotism , honour , and religion , were represented to a frivolous generation as only fitting subjects for ridicule. 167 Alas ! how terribly has France been punished for her sins against truth and duty ! Yet the time was , when France possessed many great men inspired by duty ; but they were all men of a comparatively remote past . The race of Bayard , Duguesclin , Coligny , Duquesne , Turenne , Colbert , and Sully , seems to have died out and left no lineage . There has been an occasional great Frenchman of modern times who has raised the cry of Duty ; but his voice has been as that of one crying in the wilderness . De Tocqueville was one of such ; but , like all men of his stamp , he was proscribed , imprisoned , and driven from public life . Writing on one occasion to his friend Kergorlay , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive to the happiness which consists in the fulfilment of Duty . I believe there is no other so deep and so real . There is only one great object in the world which deserves our efforts , and that is the good of mankind . " 168 Although France has been the unquiet spirit among the nations of Europe since the reign of Louis XIV. , there have from time to time been honest and faithful men who have lifted up their voices against the turbulent warlike tendencies of the people , and not only preached , but endeavoured to carry into practice , a gospel of peace . Of these , the Abbe de St.-Pierre was one of the most courageous . He had even the boldness to denounce the wars of Louis XIV. , and to deny that monarch 's right to the epithet of ' Great , ' for which he was punished by expulsion from the Academy . The Abbe was as enthusiastic an agitator for a system of international peace as any member of the modern Society of Friends . As Joseph Sturge went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views , so the Abbe went to Utrecht to convert the Conference sitting there , to his project for a Diet ; to secure perpetual peace . Of course he was regarded as an enthusiast , Cardinal Dubois characterising his scheme as " the dream of an honest man . " Yet the Abbe had found his dream in the Gospel ; and in what better way could he exemplify the spirit of the Master he served than by endeavouring to abate the horrors and abominations of war ? The Conference was an assemblage of men representing Christian States : and the Abbe merely called upon them to put in practice the doctrines they professed to believe . It was of no use : the potentates and their representatives turned to him a deaf ear . The Abbe de St.-Pierre lived several hundred years too soon . But he determined that his idea should not be lost , and in 1713 he published his ' Project of Perpetual Peace . ' He there proposed the formation of a European Diet , or Senate , to be composed of representatives of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorting to arms , to state their grievances and require redress . Writing about eighty years after the publication of this project , Volney asked : " What is a people ?  --  an individual of the society at large . What a war ?  --  a duel between two individual people . In what manner ought a society to act when two of its members fight ?  --  Interfere , and reconcile or repress them . In the days of the Abbe de St.-Pierre , this was treated as a dream ; but , happily for the human race , it begins to be realised . " Alas for the prediction of Volney ! The twenty-five years that followed the date at which this passage was written , were distinguished by more devastating and furious wars on the part of France than had ever been known in the world before . The Abbe was not , however , a mere dreamer . He was an active practical philanthropist and anticipated many social improvements which have since become generally adopted . He was the original founder of industrial schools for poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but learned some useful trade , by which they might earn an honest living when they grew up to manhood . He advocated the revision and simplification of the whole code of laws  --  an idea afterwards carried out by the First Napoleon . He wrote against duelling , against luxury , against gambling , against monasticism , quoting the remark of Segrais , that " the mania for a monastic life is the smallpox of the mind . " He spent his whole income in acts of charity  --  not in almsgiving , but in helping poor children , and poor men and women , to help themselves . His object always was to benefit permanently those whom he assisted . He continued his love of truth and his freedom of speech to the last . At the age of eighty he said : " If life is a lottery for happiness , my lot has been one of the best . " When on his deathbed , Voltaire asked him how he felt , to which he answered , " As about to make a journey into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died . But so outspoken had St.-Pierre been against corruption in high places , that Maupertius , his Successor at the Academy , was not permitted to pronounce his ELOGE ; nor was it until thirty-two years after his death that this honour was done to his memory by D'Alembert . The true and emphatic epitaph of the good , truth-loving , truth-speaking Abbe was this  --  " HE LOVED MUCH ! " Duty is closely allied to truthfulness of character ; and the dutiful man is , above all things , truthful in his words as in his actions . He says and he does the right thing , in the right way , and at the right time . There is probably no saying of Lord Chesterfield that commends itself more strongly to the approval of manly-minded men , than that it is truth that makes the success of the gentleman . Clarendon , speaking of one of the noblest and purest gentlemen of his age , says of Falkland , that he " was so severe an adorer of truth that he could as easily have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the finest things that Mrs. Hutchinson could say of her husband , that he was a thoroughly truthful and reliable man : " He never professed the thing he intended not , nor promised what he believed out of his power , nor failed in the performance of anything that was in his power to fulfil . " Wellington was a severe admirer of truth . An illustration may be given . When afflicted by deafness he consulted a celebrated aurist , who , after trying all remedies in vain , determined , as a last resource , to inject into the ear a strong solution of caustic . It caused the most intense pain , but the patient bore it with his usual equanimity . The family physician accidentally calling one day , found the Duke with flushed cheeks and bloodshot eyes , and when he rose he staggered about like a drunken man . The doctor asked to be permitted to look at his ear , and then he found that a furious inflammation was going on , which , if not immediately checked , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at once applied , and the inflammation was checked . But the hearing of that ear was completely destroyed . When the aurist heard of the danger his patient had run , through the violence of the remedy he had employed , he hastened to Apsley House to express his grief and mortification ; but the Duke merely said : " Do not say a word more about it  --  you did all for the best . " The aurist said it would be his ruin when it became known that he had been the cause of so much suffering and danger to his Grace . " But nobody need know anything about it : keep your own counsel , and , depend upon it , I wo n't say a word to any one . " " Then your Grace will allow me to attend you as usual , which will show the public that you have not withdrawn your confidence from me ? " " No , " replied the Duke , kindly but firmly ; " I ca n't do that , for that would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than he would speak one . 169 Another illustration of duty and truthfulness , as exhibited in the fulfilment of a promise , may be added from the life of Blucher . When he was hastening with his army over bad roads to the help of Wellington , on the 18th of June , 1815 , he encouraged his troops by words and gestures . " Forwards , children  --  forwards ! " " It is impossible ; it ca n't be done , " was the answer . Again and again he urged them . " Children , we must get on ; you may say it ca n't be done , but it MUST be done ! I have promised my brother Wellington  --  PROMISED , do you hear ? You would n't have me BREAK MY WORD ! " And it was done . Truth is the very bond of society , without which it must cease to exist , and dissolve into anarchy and chaos . A household can not be governed by lying ; nor can a nation . Sir Thomas Browne once asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was his answer ; " for then even hell could not subsist . " No considerations can justify the sacrifice of truth , which ought to be sovereign in all the relations of life . Of all mean vices , perhaps lying is the meanest . It is in some cases the offspring of perversity and vice , and in many others of sheer moral cowardice . Yet many persons think so lightly of it that they will order their servants to lie for them ; nor can they feel surprised if , after such ignoble instruction , they find their servants lying for themselves . Sir Harry Wotton 's description of an ambassador as " an honest man sent to lie abroad for the benefit of his country , " though meant as a satire , brought him into disfavour with James I. when it became published ; for an adversary quoted it as a principle of the king 's religion . That it was not Wotton 's real view of the duty of an honest man , is obvious from the lines quoted at the head of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' in which he eulogises the man " Whose armour is his honest thought , And simple truth his utmost skill . " But lying assumes many forms  --  such as diplomacy , expediency , and moral reservation ; and , under one guise or another , it is found more or less pervading all classes of society . Sometimes it assumes the form of equivocation or moral dodging  --  twisting and so stating the things said as to convey a false impression  --  a kind of lying which a Frenchman once described as " walking round about the truth . " There are even men of narrow minds and dishonest natures , who pride themselves upon their jesuitical cleverness in equivocation , in their serpent-wise shirking of the truth and getting out of moral back-doors , in order to hide their real opinions and evade the consequences of holding and openly professing them . Institutions or systems based upon any such expedients must necessarily prove false and hollow . " Though a lie be ever so well dressed , " says George Herbert , " it is ever overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is even less contemptible than such kind of shuffling and equivocation . Untruthfulness exhibits itself in many other forms : in reticency on the one hand , or exaggeration on the other ; in disguise or concealment ; in pretended concurrence in others opinions ; in assuming an attitude of conformity which is deceptive ; in making promises , or allowing them to be implied , which are never intended to be performed ; or even in refraining from speaking the truth when to do so is a duty . There are also those who are all things to all men , who say one thing and do another , like Bunyan 's Mr. Facing-both-ways ; only deceiving themselves when they think they are deceiving others  --  and who , being essentially insincere , fail to evoke confidence , and invariably in the end turn out failures , if not impostors . Others are untruthful in their pretentiousness , and in assuming merits which they do not really possess . The truthful man is , on the contrary , modest , and makes no parade of himself and his deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news reached England of the great deeds of Wellington in India . " The more I hear of his exploits , " said Pitt , " the more I admire the modesty with which he receives the praises he merits for them . He is the only man I ever knew that was not vain of what he had done , and yet had so much reason to be so . " So it is said of Faraday by Professor Tyndall , that " pretence of all kinds , whether in life or in philosophy , was hateful to him . " Dr. Marshall Hall was a man of like spirit  --  courageously truthful , dutiful , and manly . One of his most intimate friends has said of him that , wherever he met with untruthfulness or sinister motive , he would expose it , saying  --  " I neither will , nor can , give my consent to a lie . " The question , " right or wrong , " once decided in his own mind , the right was followed , no matter what the sacrifice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the balance . There was no virtue that Dr. Arnold laboured more sedulously to instil into young men than the virtue of truthfulness , as being the manliest of virtues , as indeed the very basis of all true manliness . He designated truthfulness as " moral transparency , " and he valued it more highly than any other quality . When lying was detected , he treated it as a great moral offence ; but when a pupil made an assertion , he accepted it with confidence . " If you say so , that is quite enough ; OF COURSE I believe your word . " By thus trusting and believing them , he educated the young in truthfulness ; the boys at length coming to say to one another : " It 's a shame to tell Arnold a lie  --  he always believes one . " 1610 One of the most striking instances that could be given of the character of the dutiful , truthful , laborious man , is presented in the life of the late George Wilson , Professor of Technology in the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of Duty , it might equally have stood under that of Courage , Cheerfulness , or Industry , for it is alike illustrative of these several qualities . Wilson 's life was , indeed , a marvel of cheerful laboriousness ; exhibiting the power of the soul to triumph over the body , and almost to set it at defiance . It might be taken as an illustration of the saying of the whaling-captain to Dr. Kane , as to the power of moral force over physical : " Bless you , sir , the soul will any day lift the body out of its boots ! " A fragile but bright and lively boy , he had scarcely entered manhood ere his constitution began to exhibit signs of disease . As early , indeed , as his seventeenth year , he began to complain of melancholy and sleeplessness , supposed to be the effects of bile . " I do n't think I shall live long , " he then said to a friend ; " my mind will  --  must work itself out , and the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy to make ! But he gave his physical health no fair chance . His life was all brain-work , study , and competition . When he took exercise it was in sudden bursts , which did him more harm than good . Long walks in the Highlands jaded and exhausted him ; and he returned to his brain-work unrested and unrefreshed . It was during one of his forced walks of some twenty-four miles in the neighbourhood of Stirling , that he injured one of his feet , and he returned home seriously ill . The result was an abscess , disease of the ankle-joint , and long agony , which ended in the amputation of the right foot . But he never relaxed in his labours . He was now writing , lecturing , and teaching chemistry . Rheumatism and acute inflammation of the eye next attacked him ; and were treated by cupping , blisetring , and colchicum . Unable himself to write , he went on preparing his lectures , which he dictated to his sister . Pain haunted him day and night , and sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of general prostration , symptoms of pulmonary disease began to show themselves . Yet he continued to give the weekly lectures to which he stood committed to the Edinburgh School of Arts . Not one was shirked , though their delivery , before a large audience , was a most exhausting duty . " Well , there 's another nail put into my coffin , " was the remark made on throwing off his top-coat on returning home ; and a sleepless night almost invariably followed . At twenty-seven , Wilson was lecturing ten , eleven , or more hours weekly , usually with setons or open blister-wounds upon him  --  his " bosom friends , " he used to call them . He felt the shadow of death upon him ; and he worked as if his days were numbered . " Do n't be surprised , " he wrote to a friend , " if any morning at breakfast you hear that I am gone . " But while he said so , he did not in the least degree indulge in the feeling of sickly sentimentality . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fulness of his strength . " To none , " said he , " is life so sweet as to those who have lost all fear to die . " Sometimes he was compelled to desist from his labours by sheer debility , occasioned by loss of blood from the lungs ; but after a few weeks ' rest and change of air , he would return to his work , saying , " The water is rising in the well again ! " Though disease had fastened on his lungs , and was spreading there , and though suffering from a distressing cough , he went on lecturing as usual . To add to his troubles , when one day endeavouring to recover himself from a stumble occasioned by his lameness , he overstrained his arm , and broke the bone near the shoulder . But he recovered from his successive accidents and illnesses in the most extraordinary way . The reed bent , but did not break : the storm passed , and it stood erect as before . There was no worry , nor fever , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unfailing perseverance . His mind , amidst all his sufferings , remained perfectly calm and serene . He went about his daily work with an apparently charmed life , as if he had the strength of many men in him . Yet all the while he knew he was dying , his chief anxiety being to conceal his state from those about him at home , to whom the knowledge of his actual condition would have been inexpressibly distressing . " I am cheerful among strangers , " he said , " and try to live day by day as a dying man . " 1612 He went on teaching as before  --  lecturing to the Architectural Institute and to the School of Arts . One day , after a lecture before the latter institute , he lay down to rest , and was shortly awakened by the rupture of a bloodvessel , which occasioned him the loss of a considerable quantity of blood . He did not experience the despair and agony that Keats did on a like occasion ; 1613 though he equally knew that the messenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He appeared at the family meals as usual , and next day he lectured twice , punctually fulfilling his engagements ; but the exertion of speaking was followed by a second attack of haemorrhage . He now became seriously ill , and it was doubted whether he would survive the night . But he did survive ; and during his convalescence he was appointed to an important public office  --  that of Director of the Scottish Industrial Museum , which involved a great amount of labour , as well as lecturing , in his capacity of Professor of Technology , which he held in connection with the office . From this time forward , his " dear museum , " as he called it , absorbed all his surplus energies . While busily occupied in collecting models and specimens for the museum , he filled up his odds-and-ends of time in lecturing to Ragged Schools , Ragged Kirks , and Medical Missionary Societies . He gave himself no rest , either of mind or body ; and " to die working " was the fate he envied . His mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to yield , and a severe attack of haemorrhage  --  bleeding from both lungs and stomach 1614  --  compelled him to relax in his labours . " For a month , or some forty days , " he wrote  --  " a dreadful Lent  --  the mind has blown geographically from ' Araby the blest , ' but thermometrically from Iceland the accursed . I have been made a prisoner of war , hit by an icicle in the lungs , and have shivered and burned alternately for a large portion of the last month , and spat blood till I grew pale with coughing . Now I am better , and to-morrow I give my concluding lecture 16on Technology , thankful that I have contrived , notwithstanding all my troubles , to carry on without missing a lecture to the last day of the Faculty of Arts , to which I belong . " 1615 How long was it to last ? He himself began to wonder , for he had long felt his life as if ebbing away . At length he became languid , weary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost him a painful effort , and . he felt " as if to lie down and sleep were the only things worth doing . " Yet shortly after , to help a Sunday-school , he wrote his ' Five Gateways of Knowledge , ' as a lecture , and afterwards expanded it into a book . He also recovered strength sufficient to enable him to proceed with his lectures to the institutions to which he belonged , besides on various occasions undertaking to do other people 's work . " I am looked upon as good as mad , " he wrote to his brother , " because , on a hasty notice , I took a defaulting lecturer 's place at the Philosophical Institution , and discoursed on the Polarization of Light .... But I like work : it is a family weakness . " Then followed chronic malaise  --  sleepless nights , days of pain , and more spitting of blood . " My only painless moments , " he says , " were when lecturing . " In this state of prostration and disease , the indefatigable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; and he did it , like everything he undertook , with admirable ability . He proceeded with his lectures as usual . To an association of teachers he delivered a discourse on the educational value of industrial science . After he had spoken to his audience for an hour , he left them to say whether he should go on or not , and they cheered him on to another half-hour 's address . " It is curious , " he wrote , " the feeling of having an audience , like clay in your hands , to mould for a season as you please . It is a terribly responsible power .... I do not mean for a moment to imply that I am indifferent to the good opinion of others  --  far otherwise ; but to gain this is much less a concern with me than to deserve it . It was not so once . I had no wish for unmerited praise , but I was too ready to settle that I did merit it . Now , the word DUTY seems to me the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my serious doings . " This was written only about four months before his death . A little later he wrote , " I spin my thread of life from week to week , rather than from year to year . " Constant attacks of bleeding from the lungs sapped his little remaining strength , but did not altogether disable him from lecturing . He was amused by one of his friends proposing to put him under trustees for the purpose of looking after his health . But he would not be restrained from working , so long as a vestige of strength remained . One day , in the autumn of 1859 , he returned from his customary lecture in the University of Edinburgh with a severe pain in his side . He was scarcely able to crawl upstairs . Medical aid was sent for , and he was pronounced to be suffering from pleurisy and inflammation of the lungs . His enfeebled frame was ill able to resist so severe a disease , and he sank peacefully to the rest he so longed for , after a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A glorious bright to-morrow Endeth a weary life of pain and sorrow . " The life of George Wilson  --  so admirably and affectionately related by his sister  --  is probably one of the most marvellous records of pain and longsuffering , and yet of persistent , noble , and useful work , that is to be found in the whole history of literature . His entire career was indeed but a prolonged illustration of the lines which he himself addressed to his deceased friend , Dr. John Reid , a likeminded man , whose memoir he wrote :  --  " Thou wert a daily lesson Of courage , hope , and faith ; We wondered at thee living , We envy thee thy death . Thou wert so meek and reverent , So resolute of will , So bold to bear the uttermost , And yet so calm and still . " CHAPTER VIII .  --  TEMPER . " Temper is nine-tenths of Christianity . "  --  BISHOP WILSON . " Heaven is a temper , not a place . "  --  DR . CHALMERS . " And should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some harshness show ; All vain asperities I day by day Would wear away , Till the smooth temper of my age should be Like the high leaves upon the Holly Tree "  --  SOUTHEY . " Even Power itself hath not one-half the might of Gentleness "  --  LEIGH HUNT . It has been said that men succeed in life quite as much by their temper as by their talents . However this may be , it is certain that their happiness in life depends mainly upon their equanimity of disposition , their patience and forbearance , and their kindness and thoughtfulness for those about them . It is really true what Plato says , that in seeking the good of others we find our own . There are some natures so happily constituted that they can find good in everything . There is no calamity so great but they can educe comfort or consolation from it  --  no sky so black but they can discover a gleam of sunshine issuing through it from some quarter or another ; and if the sun be not visible to their eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS there , though veiled from them for some good and wise purpose . Such happy natures are to be envied . They have a beam in the eye  --  a beam of pleasure , gladness , religious cheerfulness , philosophy , call it what you will . Sunshine is about their hearts , and their mind gilds with its own hues all that it looks upon . When they have burdens to bear , they bear them cheerfully  --  not repining , nor fretting , nor wasting their energies in useless lamentation , but struggling onward manfully , gathering up such flowers as lie along their path . Let it not for a moment be supposed that men such as those we speak of are weak and unreflective . The largest and most comprehensive natures are generally also the most cheerful , the most loving , the most hopeful , the most trustful . It is the wise man , of large vision , who is the quickest to discern the moral sunshine gleaming through the darkest cloud . In present evil he sees prospective good ; in pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trials , he finds correction and discipline ; and in sorrow and suffering , he gathers courage , knowledge , and the best practical wisdom . When Jeremy Taylor had lost all  --  when his house had been plundered , and his family driven out-of-doors , and all his worldly estate had been sequestrated  --  he could still write thus : " I am fallen into the hands of publicans and sequestrators , and they have taken all from me ; what now ? Let me look about me . They have left me the sun and moon , a loving wife , and many friends to pity me , and some to relieve me ; and I can still discourse , and , unless I list , they have not taken away my merry countenance and my cheerful spirit , and a good conscience ; they have still left me the providence of God , and all the promises of the Gospel , and my religion , and my hopes of heaven , and my charity to them , too ; and still I sleep and digest , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he that hath so many causes of joy , and so great , is very much in love with sorrow and peevishness , who loves all these pleasures , and chooses to sit down upon his little handful of thorns . " 171 Although cheerfulness of disposition is very much a matter of inborn temperament , it is also capable of being trained and cultivated like any other habit . We may make the best of life , or we may make the worst of it ; and it depends very much upon ourselves whether we extract joy or misery from it . There are always two sides of life on which we can look , according as we choose  --  the bright side or the gloomy . We can bring the power of the will to bear in making the choice , and thus cultivate the habit of being happy or the reverse . We can encourage the disposition of looking at the brightest side of things , instead of the darkest . And while we see the cloud , let us not shut our eyes to the silver lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and joy upon life in all its phases . It shines upon coldness , and warms it ; upon suffering , and comforts it ; upon ignorance , and enlightens it ; upon sorrow , and cheers it . The beam in the eye gives lustre to intellect , and brightens beauty itself . Without it the sunshine of life is not felt , flowers bloom in vain , the marvels of heaven and earth are not seen or acknowledged , and creation is but a dreary , lifeless , soulless blank . While cheerfulness of disposition is a great source of enjoyment in life , it is also a great safeguard of character . A devotional writer of the present day , in answer to the question , How are we to overcome temptations ? says : " Cheerfulness is the first thing , cheerfulness is the second , and cheerfulness is the third . " It furnishes the best soil for the growth of goodness and virtue . It gives brightness of heart and elasticity of spirit . It is the companion of charity , the nurse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of moral and mental tonics . " The best cordial of all , " said Dr. Marshall Hall to one of his patients , " is cheerfulness . " And Solomon has said that " a merry heart doeth good like a medicine . " When Luther was once applied to for a remedy against melancholy , his advice was : " Gaiety and courage  --  innocent gaiety , and rational honourable courage  --  are the best medicine for young men , and for old men , too ; for all men against sad thoughts . " 172 Next to music , if not before it , Luther loved children and flowers . The great gnarled man had a heart as tender as a woman 's . Cheerfulness is also an excellent wearing quality . It has been called the bright weather of the heart . It gives harmony of soul , and is a perpetual song without words . It is tantamount to repose . It enables nature to recruit its strength ; whereas worry and discontent debilitate it , involving constant wear-and-tear . How is it that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working on vigorously to the end ? Mainly through equanimity of temper and habitual cheerfulness . They have educated themselves in the habit of endurance , of not being easily provoked , of bearing and forbearing , of hearing harsh and even unjust things said of them without indulging in undue resentment , and avoiding worreting , petty , and self-tormenting cares . An intimate friend of Lord Palmerston , who observed him closely for twenty years , has said that he never saw him angry , with perhaps one exception ; and that was when the ministry responsible for the calamity in Affghanistan , of which he was one , were unjustly accused by their opponents of falsehood , perjury , and wilful mutilation of public documents . So far as can be learnt from biography , men of the greatest genius have been for the most part cheerful , contented men  --  not eager for reputation , money , or power  --  but relishing life , and keenly susceptible of enjoyment , as we find reflected in their works . Such seem to have been Homer , Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serene cheerfulness is apparent in their great creations . Among the same class of cheerful-minded men may also be mentioned Luther , More , Bacon , Leonardo da Vinci , Raphael , and Michael Angelo . Perhaps they were happy because constantly occupied , and in the pleasantest of all work  --  that of creating out of the fulness and richness of their great minds . Milton , too , though a man of many trials and sufferings , must have been a man of great cheerfulness and elasticity of nature . Though overtaken by blindness , deserted by friends , and fallen upon evil days  --  " darkness before and danger 's voice behind "  --  yet did he not bate heart or hope , but " still bore up and steered right onward . " Henry Fielding was a man borne down through life by debt , and difficulty , and bodily suffering ; and yet Lady Mary Wortley Montague has said of him that , by virtue of his cheerful disposition , she was persuaded he " had known more happy moments than any person on earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard fights with fortune , was a courageous and cheerful-natured man . He manfully made the best of life , and tried to be glad in it . Once , when a clergyman was complaining of the dulness of society in the country , saying " they only talk of runts " 17young cows , Johnson felt flattered by the observation of Mrs. Thrale 's mother , who said , " Sir , Dr. Johnson would learn to talk of runts "  --  meaning that he was a man who would make the most of his situation , whatever it was . Johnson was of opinion that a man grew better as he grew older , and that his nature mellowed with age . This is certainly a much more cheerful view of human nature than that of Lord Chesterfield , who saw life through the eyes of a cynic , and held that " the heart never grows better by age : it only grows harder . " But both sayings may be true according to the point from which life is viewed , and the temper by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profiting by experience , and disciplining themselves by self-control , will grow better , the ill-conditioned , uninfluenced by experience , will only grow worse . Sir Walter Scott was a man full of the milk of human kindness . Everybody loved him . He was never five minutes in a room ere the little pets of the family , whether dumb or lisping , had found out his kindness for all their generation . Scott related to Captain Basil Hall an incident of his boyhood which showed the tenderness of his nature . One day , a dog coming towards him , he took up a big stone , threw it , and hit the dog . The poor creature had strength enough left to crawl up to him and lick his feet , although he saw its leg was broken . The incident , he said , had given him the bitterest remorse in his after-life ; but he added , " An early circumstance of that kind , properly reflected on , is calculated to have the best effect on one 's character throughout life . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he himself laughed the heart 's laugh . He had a kind word for everybody , and his kindness acted all round him like a contagion , dispelling the reserve and awe which his great name was calculated to inspire . " He 'll come here , " said the keeper of the ruins of Melrose Abbey to Washington Irving  --  " he 'll come here some-times , wi ' great folks in his company , and the first I 'll know of it is hearing his voice calling out , ' Johnny ! Johnny Bower ! ' And when I go out I 'm sure to be greeted wi ' a joke or a pleasant word . He 'll stand and crack and laugh wi ' me , just like an auld wife ; and to think that of a man that has SUCH AN AWFU ' KNOWLEDGE O ' HISTORY ! " Dr. Arnold was a man of the same hearty cordiality of manner  --  full of human sympathy . There was not a particle of affectation or pretence of condescension about him . " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the parish clerk at Laleham ; " he comes and shakes us by the hand as if he was one of us . " " He used to come into my house , " said an old woman near Fox How , " and talk to me as if I were a lady . " Sydney Smith was another illustration of the power of cheerfulness . He was ever ready to look on the bright side of things ; the darkest cloud had to him its silver lining . Whether working as country curate , or as parish rector , he was always kind , laborious , patient , and exemplary ; exhibiting in every sphere of life the spirit of a Christian , the kindness of a pastor , and the honour of a gentleman . In his leisure he employed his pen on the side of justice , freedom , education , toleration , emancipation ; and his writings , though full of common-sense and bright humour , are never vulgar ; nor did he ever pander to popularity or prejudice . His good spirits , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; and in his old age , when borne down by disease , he wrote to a friend : " I have gout , asthma , and seven other maladies , but am otherwise very well . " In one of the last letters he wrote to Lady Carlisle , he said : " If you hear of sixteen or eighteen pounds of flesh wanting an owner , they belong to me . I look as if a curate had been taken out of me . " Great men of science have for the most part been patient , laborious , cheerful-minded men . Such were Galileo , Descartes , Newton , and Laplace . Euler the mathematician , one of the greatest of natural philosophers , was a distinguished instance . Towards the close of his life he became completely blind ; but he went on writing as cheerfully as before , supplying the want of sight by various ingenious mechanical devices , and by the increased cultivation of his memory , which became exceedingly tenacious . His chief pleasure was in the society of his grandchildren , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his severer studies . In like manner , Professor Robison of Edinburgh , the first editor of the ' Encyclopaedia Britannica , ' when disabled from work by a lingering and painful disorder , found his chief pleasure in the society of his grandchild . " I am infinitely delighted , " he wrote to James Watt , " with observing the growth of its little soul , and particularly with its numberless instincts , which formerly passed unheeded . I thank the French theorists for more forcibly directing my attention to the finger of God , which I discern in every awkward movement and every wayward whim . They are all guardians of his life and growth and power . I regret indeed that I have not time to make infancy and the development of its powers my sole study . " One of the sorest trials of a man 's temper and patience was that which befell Abauzit , the natural philosopher , while residing at Geneva ; resembling in many respects a similar calamity which occurred to Newton , and which he bore with equal resignation . Amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its variations , with the object of deducing the general laws which regulated atmospheric pressure . During twenty-seven years he made numerous observations daily , recording them on sheets prepared for the purpose . One day , when a new servant was installed in the house , she immediately proceeded to display her zeal by " putting things to-rights . " Abauzit 's study , amongst other rooms , was made tidy and set in order . When he entered it , he asked of the servant , " What have you done with the paper that was round the barometer ? " " Oh , sir , " was the reply , " it was so dirty that I burnt it , and put in its place this paper , which you will see is quite new . " Abauzit crossed his arms , and after some moments of internal struggle , he said , in a tone of calmness and resignation : " You have destroyed the results of twenty-seven years labour ; in future touch nothing whatever in this room . " The study of natural history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be accompanied by unusual cheerfulness and equanimity of temper on the part of its votaries ; the result of which is , that the life of naturalists is on the whole more prolonged than that of any other class of men of science . A member of the Linnaean Society has informed us that of fourteen members who died in 1870 , two were over ninety , five were over eighty , and two were over seventy . The average age of all the members who died in that year was seventy-five . Adanson , the French botanist , was about seventy years old when the Revolution broke out , and amidst the shock he lost everything  --  his fortune , his places , and his gardens . But his patience , courage , and resignation never forsook him . He became reduced to the greatest straits , and even wanted food and clothing ; yet his ardour of investigation remained the same . Once , when the Institute invited him , as being one of its oldest members , to assist at a SEANCE , his answer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . " It was a touching sight , " says Cuvier , " to see the poor old man , bent over the embers of a decaying fire , trying to trace characters with a feeble hand on the little bit of paper which he held , forgetting all the pains of life in some new idea in natural history , which came to him like some beneficent fairy to cheer him in his loneliness . " The Directory eventually gave him a small pension , which Napoleon doubled ; and at length , easeful death came to his relief in his seventy-ninth year . A clause in his will , as to the manner of his funeral , illustrates the character of the man . He directed that a garland of flowers , provided by fifty-eight families whom he had established in life , should be the only decoration of his coffin  --  a slight but touching image of the more durable monument which he had erected for himself in his works . Such are only a few instances , of the cheerful-working-ness of great men , which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large healthy natures are cheerful as well as hopeful . Their example is also contagious and diffusive , brightening and cheering all who come within reach of their influence . It was said of Sir John Malcolm , when he appeared in a saddened camp in India , that " it was like a gleam of sunlight , .... no man left him without a smile on his face . He was ' boy Malcolm ' still . It was impossible to resist the fascination of his genial presence . " 173 There was the same joyousness of nature about Edmund Burke . Once at a dinner at Sir Joshua Reynolds 's , when the conversation turned upon the suitability of liquors for particular temperaments , Johnson said , " Claret is for boys , port for men , and brandy for heroes . " " Then , " said Burke , " let me have claret : I love to be a boy , and to have the careless gaiety of boyish days . " And so it is , that there are old young men , and young old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys in their old age , and others who are as morose and cheerless as saddened old men while still in their boyhood . In the presence of some priggish youths , we have heard a cheerful old man declare that , apparently , there would soon be nothing but " old boys " left . Cheerfulness , being generous and genial , joyous and hearty , is never the characteristic of prigs . Goethe used to exclaim of goody-goody persons , " Oh ! if they had but the heart to commit an absurdity ! " This was when he thought they wanted heartiness and nature . " Pretty dolls ! " was his expression when speaking of them , and turning away . The true basis of cheerfulness is love , hope , and patience . Love evokes love , and begets loving kindness . Love cherishes hopeful and generous thoughts of others . It is charitable , gentle , and truthful . It is a discerner of good . It turns to the brightest side of things , and its face is ever directed towards happiness . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the flower . " It encourages happy thoughts , and lives in an atmosphere of cheerfulness . It costs nothing , and yet is invaluable ; for it blesses its possessor , and grows up in abundant happiness in the bosoms of others . Even its sorrows are linked with pleasures , and its very tears are sweet . Bentham lays it down as a principle , that a man becomes rich in his own stock of pleasures in proportion to the amount he distributes to others . His kindness will evoke kindness , and his happiness be increased by his own benevolence . " Kind words , " he says , " cost no more than unkind ones . Kind words produce kind actions , not only on the part of him to whom they are addressed , but on the part of him by whom they are employed ; and this not incidentally only , but habitually , in virtue of the principle of association . " .... " It may indeed happen , that the effort of beneficence may not benefit those for whom it was intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person from whom it emanates . Good and friendly conduct may meet with an unworthy and ungrateful return ; but the absence of gratitude on the part of the receiver can not destroy the self-approbation which recompenses the giver , and we may scatter the seeds of courtesy and kindliness around us at so little expense . Some of them will inevitably fall on good ground , and grow up into benevolence in the minds of others ; and all of them will bear fruit of happiness in the bosom whence they spring . Once blest are all the virtues always ; twice blest sometimes . " 174 The poet Rogers used to tell a story of a little girl , a great favourite with every one who knew her . Some one said to her , " Why does everybody love you so much ? " She answered , " I think it is because I love everybody so much . " This little story is capable of a very wide application ; for our happiness as human beings , generally speaking , will be found to be very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the number of things that love us . And the greatest worldly success , however honestly achieved , will contribute comparatively little to happiness , unless it be accompanied by a lively benevolence towards every human being . Kindness is indeed a great power in the world . Leigh Hunt has truly said that " Power itself hath not one half the might of gentleness . " Men are always best governed through their affections . There is a French proverb which says that , " LES HOMMES SE PRENNENT PAR LA DOUCEUR , " and a coarser English one , to the effect that " More wasps are caught by honey than by vinegar . " " Every act of kindness , " says Bentham , " is in fact an exercise of power , and a stock of friendship laid up ; and why should not power exercise itself in the production of pleasure as of pain ? " Kindness does not consist in gifts , but in gentleness and generosity of spirit . Men may give their money which comes from the purse , and withhold their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays itself in giving money , does not amount to much , and often does quite as much harm as good ; but the kindness of true sympathy , of thoughtful help , is never without beneficent results . The good temper that displays itself in kindness must not be confounded with softness or silliness . In its best form , it is not a merely passive but an active condition of being . It is not by any means indifferent , but largely sympathetic . It does not characterise the lowest and most gelatinous forms of human life , but those that are the most highly organized . True kindness cherishes and actively promotes all reasonable instrumentalities for doing practical good in its own time ; and , looking into futurity , sees the same spirit working on for the eventual elevation and happiness of the race . It is the kindly-dispositioned men who are the active men of the world , while the selfish and the sceptical , who have no love but for themselves , are its idlers . Buffon used to say , that he would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an enthusiasm of some sort . It showed that at least he had faith in something good , lofty , and generous , even if unattainable . Egotism , scepticism , and selfishness are always miserable companions in life , and they are especially unnatural in youth . The egotist is next-door to a fanatic . Constantly occupied with self , he has no thought to spare for others . He refers to himself in all things , thinks of himself , and studies himself , until his own little self becomes his own little god . Worst of all are the grumblers and growlers at fortune  --  who find that " whatever is is wrong , " and will do nothing to set matters right  --  who declare all to be barren " from Dan even to Beersheba . " These grumblers are invariably found the least efficient helpers in the school of life . As the worst workmen are usually the readiest to " strike , " so the least industrious members of society are the readiest to complain . The worst wheel of all is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherishing of discontent until the feeling becomes morbid . The jaundiced see everything about them yellow . The ill-conditioned think all things awry , and the whole world out-of-joint . All is vanity and vexation of spirit . The little girl in PUNCH , who found her doll stuffed with bran , and forthwith declared everything to be hollow and wanted to " go into a nunnery , " had her counterpart in real life . Many full-grown people are quite as morbidly unreasonable . There are those who may be said to " enjoy bad health ; " they regard it as a sort of property . They can speak of " MY headache "  --  " MY backache , " and so forth , until in course of time it becomes their most cherished possession . But perhaps it is the source to them of much coveted sympathy , without which they might find themselves of comparatively little importance in the world . We have to be on our guard against small troubles , which , by encouraging , we are apt to magnify into great ones . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not real but imaginary evil  --  small vexations and trivial afflictions . In the presence of a great sorrow , all petty troubles disappear ; but we are too ready to take some cherished misery to our bosom , and to pet it there . Very often it is the child of our fancy ; and , forgetful of the many means of happiness which lie within our reach , we indulge this spoilt child of ours until it masters us . We shut the door against cheerfulness , and surround ourselves with gloom . The habit gives a colouring to our life . We grow querulous , moody , and unsympathetic . Our conversation becomes full of regrets . We are harsh in our judgment of others . We are unsociable , and think everybody else is so . We make our breast a storehouse of pain , which we inflict upon ourselves as well as upon others . This disposition is encouraged by selfishness : indeed , it is for the most part selfishness unmingled , without any admixture of sympathy or consideration for the feelings of those about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is wilful , because it might be avoided . Let the necessitarians argue as they may , freedom of will and action is the possession of every man and woman . It is sometimes our glory , and very often it is our shame : all depends upon the manner in which it is used . We can choose to look at the bright side of things , or at the dark . We can follow good and eschew evil thoughts . We can be wrongheaded and wronghearted , or the reverse , as we ourselves determine . The world will be to each one of us very much what we make it . The cheerful are its real possessors , for the world belongs to those who enjoy it . It must , however , be admitted that there are cases beyond the reach of the moralist . Once , when a miserable-looking dyspeptic called upon a leading physician and laid his case before him , " Oh ! " said the doctor , " you only want a good hearty laugh : go and see Grimaldi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am Grimaldi ! " So , when Smollett , oppressed by disease , travelled over Europe in the hope of finding health , he saw everything through his own jaundiced eyes . " I 'll tell it , " said Smellfungus , " to the world . " " You had better tell it , " said Sterne , " to your physician . " The restless , anxious , dissatisfied temper , that is ever ready to run and meet care half-way , is fatal to all happiness and peace of mind . How often do we see men and women set themselves about as if with stiff bristles , so that one dare scarcely approach them without fear of being pricked ! For want of a little occasional command over one 's temper , an amount of misery is occasioned in society which is positively frightful . Thus enjoyment is turned into bitterness , and life becomes like a journey barefooted amongst thorns and briers and prickles . " Though sometimes small evils , " says Richard Sharp , " like invisible insects , inflict great pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet the chief secret of comfort lies in not suffering trifles to vex us ; and in prudently cultivating an undergrowth of small pleasures , since very few great ones , alas ! are let on long leases . " 175 St. Francis de Sales treats the same topic from the Christian 's point of view . " How carefully , " he says , " we should cherish the little virtues which spring up at the foot of the Cross ! " When the saint was asked , " What virtues do you mean ? " he replied : " Humility , patience , meekness , benignity , bearing one another 's burden , condescension , softness of heart , cheerfulness , cordiality , compassion , forgiving injuries , simplicity , candour  --  all , in short of that sort of little virtues . They , like unobtrusive violets , love the shade ; like them are sustained by dew ; and though , like them , they make little show , they shed a sweet odour on all around . " 176 And again he said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the side of gentleness . The human mind is so constructed that it resists rigour , and yields to softness . A mild word quenches anger , as water quenches the rage of fire ; and by benignity any soil may be rendered fruitful . Truth , uttered with courtesy , is heaping coals of fire on the head  --  or rather , throwing roses in the face . How can we resist a foe whose weapons are pearls and diamonds ? " 177 Meeting evils by anticipation is not the way to overcome them . If we perpetually carry our burdens about with us , they will soon bear us down under their load . When evil comes , we must deal with it bravely and hopefully . What Perthes wrote to a young man , who seemed to him inclined to take trifles as well as sorrows too much to heart , was doubtless good advice : " Go forward with hope and confidence . This is the advice given thee by an old man , who has had a full share of the burden and heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happen what may , and for this end we must cheerfully resign ourselves to the varied influences of this many-coloured life . You may call this levity , and you are partly right ; for flowers and colours are but trifles light as air , but such levity is a constituent portion of our human nature , without which it would sink under the weight of time . While on earth we must still play with earth , and with that which blooms and fades upon its breast . The consciousness of this mortal life being but the way to a higher goal , by no means precludes our playing with it cheerfully ; and , indeed , we must do so , otherwise our energy in action will entirely fail . " 178 Cheerfulness also accompanies patience , which is one of the main conditions of happiness and success in life . " He that will be served , " says George Herbert , " must be patient . " It was said of the cheerful and patient King Alfred , that " good fortune accompanied him like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , and a principal secret of his success as a general . " Patience will overcome all things , " he wrote to Godolphin , in 1702 . In the midst of a great emergency , while baffled and opposed by his allies , he said , " Having done all that is possible , we should submit with patience . " Last and chiefest of blessings is Hope , the most common of possessions ; for , as Thales the philosopher said , " Even those who have nothing else have hope . " Hope is the great helper of the poor . It has even been styled " the poor man 's bread . " It is also the sustainer and inspirer of great deeds . It is recorded of Alexander the Great , that when he succeeded to the throne of Macedon , he gave away amongst his friends the greater part of the estates which his father had left him ; and when Perdiccas asked him what he reserved for himself , Alexander answered , " The greatest possession of all ,  --  Hope ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with those of hope ; for hope is the parent of all effort and endeavour ; and " every gift of noble origin is breathed upon by Hope 's perpetual breath . " It may be said to be the moral engine that moves the world , and keeps it in action ; and at the end of all there stands before us what Robertson of Ellon styled " The Great Hope . " " If it were not for Hope , " said Byron , " where would the Future be ?  --  in hell ! It is useless to say where the Present is , for most of us know ; and as for the Past , WHAT predominates in memory ?  --  Hope baffled . ERGO , in all human affairs it is Hope , Hope , Hope ! " 179 CHAPTER IX .  --  MANNER  --  ART . " We must be gentle , now we are gentlemen . "  --  SHAKSPEARE . " Manners are not idle , but the fruit Of noble nature and of loyal mind . "  --  TENNYSON . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a higher pleasure than statues and pictures ; it is the finest of the fine arts . "  --  EMERSON . " Manners are often too much neglected ; they are most important to men , no less than to women .... Life is too short to get over a bad manner ; besides , manners are the shadows of virtues . "  --  THE REV . SIDNEY SMITH . Manner is one of the principal external graces of character . It is the ornament of action , and often makes the commonest offices beautiful by the way in which it performs them . It is a happy way of doing things , adorning even the smallest details of life , and contributing to render it , as a whole , agreeable and pleasant . Manner is not so frivolous or unimportant as some may think it to be ; for it tends greatly to facilitate the business of life , as well as to sweeten and soften social intercourse . " Virtue itself , " says Bishop Middleton , " offends , when coupled with a forbidding manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimation in which men are held by the world ; and it has often more influence in the government of others than qualities of much greater depth and substance . A manner at once gracious and cordial is among the greatest aids to success , and many there are who fail for want of it . 181 For a great deal depends upon first impressions ; and these are usually favourable or otherwise according to a man 's courteousness and civility . While rudeness and gruffness bar doors and shut hearts , kindness and propriety of behaviour , in which good manners consist , act as an " open sesame " everywhere . Doors unbar before them , and they are a passport to the hearts of everybody , young and old . There is a common saying that " Manners make the man ; " but this is not so true as that " Man makes the manners . " A man may be gruff , and even rude , and yet be good at heart and of sterling character ; yet he would doubtless be a much more agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he to exhibit that suavity of disposition and courtesy of manner which always gives a finish to the true gentleman . Mrs. Hutchinson , in the noble portraiture of her husband , to which we have already had occasion to refer , thus describes his manly courteousness and affability of disposition :  --  " I can not say whether he were more truly magnanimous or less proud ; he never disdained the meanest person , nor flattered the greatest ; he had a loving and sweet courtesy to the poorest , and would often employ many spare hours with the commonest soldiers and poorest labourers ; but still so ordering his familiarity , that it never raised them to a contempt , but entertained still at the same time a reverence and love of him . " 182 A man 's manner , to a certain extent , indicates his character . It is the external exponent of his inner nature . It indicates his taste , his feelings , and his temper , as well as the society to which he has been accustomed . There is a conventional manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural manner , the outcome of natural gifts , improved by careful self-culture , signifies a great deal . Grace of manner is inspired by sentiment , which is a source of no slight enjoyment to a cultivated mind . Viewed in this light , sentiment is of almost as much importance as talents and acquirements , while it is even more influential in giving the direction to a man s tastes and character . Sympathy is the golden key that unlocks the hearts of others . It not only teaches politeness and courtesy , but gives insight and unfolds wisdom , and may almost be regarded as the crowning grace of humanity . Artificial rules of politeness are of very little use . What passes by the name of " Etiquette " is often of the essence of unpoliteness and untruthfulness . It consists in a great measure of posture-making , and is easily seen through . Even at best , etiquette is but a substitute for good manners , though it is often but their mere counterfeit . Good manners consist , for the most part , in courteousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of showing , by external signs , the internal regard we have for others . But one may be perfectly polite to another without necessarily having a special regard for him . Good manners are neither more nor less than beautiful behaviour . It has been well said , that " a beautiful form is better than a beautiful face , and a beautiful behaviour is better than a beautiful form ; it gives a higher pleasure than statues or pictures  --  it is the finest of the fine arts . " The truest politeness comes of sincerity . It must be the outcome of the heart , or it will make no lasting impression ; for no amount of polish can dispense with truthfulness . The natural character must be allowed to appear , freed of its angularities and asperities . Though politeness , in its best form , should 18as St. Francis de Sales says resemble water  --  " best when clearest , most simple , and without taste , "  --  yet genius in a man will always cover many defects of manner , and much will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and individuality , human life would lose much of its interest and variety , as well as its manliness and robustness of character . True courtesy is kind . It exhibits itself in the disposition to contribute to the happiness of others , and in refraining from all that may annoy them . It is grateful as well as kind , and readily acknowledges kind actions . Curiously enough , Captain Speke found this quality of character recognised even by the natives of Uganda on the shores of Lake Nyanza , in the heart of Africa , where , he says . " Ingratitude , or neglecting to thank a person for a benefit conferred , is punishable . " True politeness especially exhibits itself in regard for the personality of others . A man will respect the individuality of another if he wishes to be respected himself . He will have due regard for his views and opinions , even though they differ from his own . The well-mannered man pays a compliment to another , and sometimes even secures his respect , by patiently listening to him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harshly ; and harsh judgments of others will almost invariably provoke harsh judgments of ourselves . The unpolite impulsive man will , however , sometimes rather lose his friend than his joke . He may surely be pronounced a very foolish person who secures another 's hatred at the price of a moment 's gratification . It was a saying of Brunel the engineer  --  himself one of the kindest-natured of men  --  that " spite and ill-nature are among the most expensive luxuries in life . " Dr. Johnson once said : " Sir , a man has no more right to SAY an uncivil thing than to ACT one  --  no more right to say a rude thing to another than to knock him down . " A sensible polite person does not assume to be better or wiser or richer than his neighbour . He does not boast of his rank , or his birth , or his country ; or look down upon others because they have not been born to like privileges with himself . He does not brag of his achievements or of his calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . On the contrary , in all that he says or does , he will be modest , unpretentious , unassuming ; exhibiting his true character in performing rather than in boasting , in doing rather than in talking . Want of respect for the feelings of others usually originates in selfishness , and issues in hardness and repulsiveness of manner . It may not proceed from malignity so much as from want of sympathy and want of delicacy  --  a want of that perception of , and attention to , those little and apparently trifling things by which pleasure is given or pain occasioned to others . Indeed , it may be said that in self-sacrificingness , so to speak , in the ordinary intercourse of life , mainly consists the difference between being well and ill bred . Without some degree of self-restraint in society , a man may be found almost insufferable . No one has pleasure in holding intercourse with such a person , and he is a constant source of annoyance to those about him . For want of self-restraint , many men are engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making , and rendering success impossible by their own crossgrained ungentleness ; whilst others , it may be much less gifted , make their way and achieve success by simple patience , equanimity , and self-control . It has been said that men succeed in life quite as much by their temper as by their talents . However this may be , it is certain that their happiness depends mainly on their temperament , especially upon their disposition to be cheerful ; upon their complaisance , kindliness of manner , and willingness to oblige others  --  details of conduct which are like the small-change in the intercourse of life , and are always in request . Men may show their disregard of others in various unpolite ways  --  as , for instance , by neglect of propriety in dress , by the absence of cleanliness , or by indulging in repulsive habits . The slovenly dirty person , by rendering himself physically disagreeable , sets the tastes and feelings of others at defiance , and is rude and uncivil only under another form . David Ancillon , a Huguenot preacher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest care , was accustomed to say " that it was showing too little esteem for the public to take no pains in preparation , and that a man who should appear on a ceremonial-day in his nightcap and dressing-gown , could not commit a greater breach of civility . " The perfection of manner is ease  --  that it attracts no man 's notice as such , but is natural and unaffected . Artifice is incompatible with courteous frankness of manner . Rochefoucauld has said that " nothing so much prevents our being natural as the desire of appearing so . " Thus we come round again to sincerity and truthfulness , which find their outward expression in graciousness , urbanity , kindliness , and consideration for the feelings of others . The frank and cordial man sets those about him at their ease . He warms and elevates them by his presence , and wins all hearts . Thus manner , in its highest form , like character , becomes a genuine motive power . " The love and admiration , " says Canon Kingsley , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , won from every one , rich and poor , with whom he came in contact seems to have arisen from the one fact , that without , perhaps , having any such conscious intention , he treated rich and poor , his own servants and the noblemen his guests , alike , and alike courteously , considerately , cheerfully , affectionately  --  so leaving a blessing , and reaping a blessing , wherever he went . " Good manners are usually supposed to be the peculiar characteristic of persons gently born and bred , and of persons moving in the higher rather than in the lower spheres of society . And this is no doubt to a great extent true , because of the more favourable surroundings of the former in early life . But there is no reason why the poorest classes should not practise good manners towards each other as well as the richest . Men who toil with their hands , equally with those who do not , may respect themselves and respect one another ; and it is by their demeanour to each other  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as mutual respect are indicated . There is scarcely a moment in their lives , the enjoyment of which might not be enhanced by kindliness of this sort  --  in the workshop , in the street , or at home . The civil workman will exercise increased power amongst his class , and gradually induce them to imitate him by his persistent steadiness , civility , and kindness . Thus Benjamin Franklin , when a working-man , is said to have reformed the habits of an entire workshop . One may be polite and gentle with very little money in his purse . Politeness goes far , yet costs nothing . It is the cheapest of all commodities . It is the humblest of the fine arts , yet it is so useful and so pleasure-giving , that it might almost be ranked amongst the humanities . Every nation may learn something of others ; and if there be one thing more than another that the English working-class might afford to copy with advantage from their Continental neighbours , it is their politeness . The French and Germans , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaisant , cordial , and well-bred . The foreign workman lifts his cap and respectfully salutes his fellow-workman in passing . There is no sacrifice of manliness in this , but grace and dignity . Even the lowest poverty of the foreign workpeople is not misery , simply because it is cheerful . Though not receiving one-half the income which our working-classes do , they do not sink into wretchedness and drown their troubles in drink ; but contrive to make the best of life , and to enjoy it even amidst poverty . Good taste is a true economist . It may be practised on small means , and sweeten the lot of labour as well as of ease . It is all the more enjoyed , indeed , when associated with industry and the performance of duty . Even the lot of poverty is elevated by taste . It exhibits itself in the economies of the household . It gives brightness and grace to the humblest dwelling . It produces refinement , it engenders goodwill , and creates an atmosphere of cheerfulness . Thus good taste , associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorn even the lowliest lot . The first and best school of manners , as of character , is always the Home , where woman is the teacher . The manners of society at large are but the reflex of the manners of our collective homes , neither better nor worse . Yet , with all the disadvantages of ungenial homes , men may practise self-culture of manner as of intellect , and learn by good examples to cultivate a graceful and agreeable behaviour towards others . Most men are like so many gems in the rough , which need polishing by contact with other and better natures , to bring out their full beauty and lustre . Some have but one side polished , sufficient only to show the delicate graining of the interior ; but to bring out the full qualities of the gem needs the discipline of experience , and contact with the best examples of character in the intercourse of daily life . A good deal of the success of manner consists in tact , and it is because women , on the whole , have greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers . They have more self-restraint than men , and are naturally more gracious and polite . They possess an intuitive quickness and readiness of action , have a keener insight into character , and exhibit greater discrimination and address . In matters of social detail , aptness and dexterity come to them like nature ; and hence well-mannered men usually receive their best culture by mixing in the society of gentle and adroit women . Tact is an intuitive art of manner , which carries one through a difficulty better than either talent or knowledge . " Talent , " says a public writer , " is power : tact is skill . Talent is weight : tact is momentum . Talent knows what to do : tact knows how to do it . Talent makes a man respectable : tact makes him respected . Talent is wealth : tact is ready-money . " The difference between a man of quick tact and of no tact whatever was exemplified in an interview which once took place between Lord Palmerston and Mr. Behnes , the sculptor . At the last sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  --  " Any news , my Lord , from France ? How do we stand with Louis Napoleon ? " The Foreign Secretary raised his eyebrows for an instant , and quietly replied , " Really , Mr. Behnes , I do n't know : I have not seen the newspapers ! " Poor Behnes , with many excellent qualities and much real talent , was one of the many men who entirely missed their way in life through want of tact . Such is the power of manner , combined with tact , that Wilkes , one of the ugliest of men , used to say , that in winning the graces of a lady , there was not more than three days ' difference between him and the handsomest man in England . But this reference to Wilkes reminds us that too much importance must not be attached to manner , for it does not afford any genuine test of character . The well-mannered man may , like Wilkes , be merely acting a part , and that for an immoral purpose . Manner , like other fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon ; but it may be assumed as a disguise , as men " assume a virtue though they have it not . " It is but the exterior sign of good conduct , but may be no more than skin-deep . The most highly-polished person may be thoroughly depraved in heart ; and his superfine manners may , after all , only consist in pleasing gestures and in fine phrases . On the other hand , it must be acknowledged that some of the richest and most generous natures have been wanting in the graces of courtesy and politeness . As a rough rind sometimes covers the sweetest fruit , so a rough exterior often conceals a kindly and hearty nature . The blunt man may seem even rude in manner , and yet , at heart , be honest , kind , and gentle . John Knox and Martin Luther were by no means distinguished for their urbanity . They had work to do which needed strong and determined rather than well-mannered men . Indeed , they were both thought to be unnecessarily harsh and violent in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Queen of Scots to Knox , " that presumest to school the nobles and sovereign of this realm ? "  --  " Madam , " replied Knox , " a subject born within the same . " It is said that his boldness , or roughness , more than once made Queen Mary weep . When Regent Morton heard of this , he said , " Well , ' t is better that women should weep than bearded men . " As Knox was retiring from the Queen 's presence on one occasion , he overheard one of the royal attendants say to another , " He is not afraid ! " Turning round upon them , he said : " And why should the pleasing face of a gentleman frighten me ? I have looked on the faces of angry men , and yet have not been afraid beyond measure . " When the Reformer , worn-out by excess of labour and anxiety , was at length laid to his rest , the Regent , looking down into the open grave , exclaimed , in words which made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies he who never feared the face of man ! " Luther also was thought by some to be a mere compound of violence and ruggedness . But , as in the case of Knox , the times in which he lived were rude and violent ; and the work he had to do could scarcely have been accomplished with gentleness and suavity . To rouse Europe from its lethargy , he had to speak and to write with force , and even vehemence . Yet Luther 's vehemence was only in words . His apparently rude exterior covered a warm heart . In private life he was gentle , loving , and affectionate . He was simple and homely , even to commonness . Fond of all common pleasures and enjoyments , he was anything but an austere man , or a bigot ; for he was hearty , genial , and even " jolly . " Luther was the common people 's hero in his lifetime , and he remains so in Germany to this day . Samuel Johnson was rude and often gruff in manner . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in early life had made him acquainted with strange companions . He had wandered in the streets with Savage for nights together , unable between them to raise money enough to pay for a bed . When his indomitable courage and industry at length secured for him a footing in society , he still bore upon him the scars of his early sorrows and struggles . He was by nature strong and robust , and his experience made him unaccommodating and self-asserting . When he was once asked why he was not invited to dine out as Garrick was , he answered , " Because great lords and ladies did not like to have their mouths stopped ; " and Johnson was a notorious mouth-stopper , though what he said was always worth listening to . Johnson 's companions spoke of him as " Ursa Major ; " but , as Goldsmith generously said of him , " No man alive has a more tender heart ; he has nothing of the bear about him but his skin . " The kindliness of Johnson 's nature was shown on one occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crossing Fleet Street . He gave her his arm , and led her across , not observing that she was in liquor at the time . But the spirit of the act was not the less kind on that account . On the other hand , the conduct of the bookseller on whom Johnson once called to solicit employment , and who , regarding his athletic but uncouth person , told him he had better " go buy a porter 's knot and carry trunks , " in howsoever bland tones the advice might have been communicated , was simply brutal . While captiousness of manner , and the habit of disputing and contradicting everything said , is chilling and repulsive , the opposite habit of assenting to , and sympathising with , every statement made , or emotion expressed , is almost equally disagreeable . It is unmanly , and is felt to be dishonest . " It may seem difficult , " says Richard Sharp , " to steer always between bluntness and plain-dealing , between giving merited praise and lavishing indiscriminate flattery ; but it is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being all that are requisite to do what is right in the right way . " 183 At the same time , many are unpolite  --  not because they mean to be so , but because they are awkward , and perhaps know no better . Thus , when Gibbon had published the second and third volumes of his ' Decline and Fall , ' the Duke of Cumberland met him one day , and accosted him with , " How do you do , Mr. Gibbon ? I see you are always AT IT in the old way  --  SCRIBBLE , SCRIBBLE , SCRIBBLE ! " The Duke probably intended to pay the author a compliment , but did not know how better to do it , than in this blunt and apparently rude way . Again , many persons are thought to be stiff , reserved , and proud , when they are only shy . Shyness is characteristic of most people of Teutonic race . It has been styled " the English mania , " but it pervades , to a greater or less degree , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , carries his shyness with him . He is stiff , awkward , ungraceful , undemonstrative , and apparently unsympathetic ; and though he may assume a brusqueness of manner , the shyness is there , and can not be wholly concealed . The naturally graceful and intensely social French can not understand such a character ; and the Englishman is their standing joke  --  the subject of their most ludicrous caricatures . George Sand attributes the rigidity of the natives of Albion to a stock of FLUIDE BRITANNIQUE which they carry about with them , that renders them impassive under all circumstances , and " as impervious to the atmosphere of the regions they traverse as a mouse in the centre of an exhausted receiver . " 184 The average Frenchman or Irishman excels the average Englishman , German , or American in courtesy and ease of manner , simply because it is his nature . They are more social and less self-dependent than men of Teutonic origin , more demonstrative and less reticent ; they are more communicative , conversational , and freer in their intercourse with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are comparatively stiff , reserved , shy , and awkward . At the same time , a people may exhibit ease , gaiety , and sprightliness of character , and yet possess no deeper qualities calculated to inspire respect . They may have every grace of manner , and yet be heartless , frivolous , selfish . The character may be on the surface only , and without any solid qualities for a foundation . There can be no doubt as to which of the two sorts of people  --  the easy and graceful , or the stiff and awkward  --  it is most agreeable to meet , either in business , in society , or in the casual intercourse of life . Which make the fastest friends , the truest men of their word , the most conscientious performers of their duty , is an entirely different matter . The dry GAUCHE Englishman  --  to use the French phrase , L'ANGLAIS EMPETRE  --  is certainly a somewhat disagreeable person to meet at first . He looks as if he had swallowed a poker . He is shy himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because he is proud , but because he is shy ; and he can not shake it off , even if he would . Indeed , we should not be surprised to find that even the clever writer who describes the English Philistine in all his enormity of awkward manner and absence of grace , were himself as shy as a bat . When two shy men meet , they seem like a couple of icicles . They sidle away and turn their backs on each other in a room , or when travelling creep into the opposite corners of a railway-carriage . When shy Englishmen are about to start on a journey by railway , they walk along the train , to discover an empty compartment in which to bestow themselves ; and when once ensconced , they inwardly hate the next man who comes in . So ; on entering the dining-room of their club , each shy man looks out for an unoccupied table , until sometimes  --  all the tables in the room are occupied by single diners . All this apparent unsociableness is merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The disciples of Confucius , " observes Mr. Arthur Helps , " say that when in the presence of the prince , his manner displayed RESPECTFUL UNEASINESS . There could hardly be given any two words which more fitly describe the manner of most Englishmen when in society . " Perhaps it is due to this feeling that Sir Henry Taylor , in his ' Statesman , ' recommends that , in the management of interviews , the minister should be as " near to the door " as possible ; and , instead of bowing his visitor out , that he should take refuge , at the end of an interview , in the adjoining room . " Timid and embarrassed men , " he says , " will sit as if they were rooted to the spot , when they are conscious that they have to traverse the length of a room in their retreat . In every case , an interview will find a more easy and pleasing termination WHEN THE DOOR IS AT HAND as the last words are spoken . " 185 The late Prince Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also one of the most retiring of men . He struggled much against his sense of shyness , but was never able either to conquer or conceal it . His biographer , in explaining its causes , says : " It was the shyness of a very delicate nature , that is not sure it will please , and is without the confidence and the vanity which often go to form characters that are outwardly more genial . " 186 But the Prince shared this defect with some of the greatest of Englishmen . Sir Isaac Newton was probably the shyest man of his age . He kept secret for a time some of his greatest discoveries , for fear of the notoriety they might bring him . His discovery of the Binomial Theorem and its most important applications , as well as his still greater discovery of the Law of Gravitation , were not published for years after they were made ; and when he communicated to Collins his solution of the theory of the moon 's rotation round the earth , he forbade him to insert his name in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : " It would , perhaps , increase my acquaintance  --  the thing which I chiefly study to decline . " From all that can be learnt of Shakspeare , it is to be inferred that he was an exceedingly shy man . The manner in which his plays were sent into the world  --  for it is not known that he edited or authorized the publication of a single one of them  --  and the dates at which they respectively appeared , are mere matters of conjecture . His appearance in his own plays in second and even third-rate parts  --  his indifference to reputation , and even his apparent aversion to be held in repute by his contemporaries  --  his disappearance from London 18the seat and centre of English histrionic art so soon as he had realised a moderate competency  --  and his retirement about the age of forty , for the remainder of his days , to a life of obscurity in a small town in the midland counties  --  all seem to unite in proving the shrinking nature of the man , and his unconquerable shyness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and his shyness may , like that of Byron , have been increased by his limp  --  Shakspeare did not possess in any high degree the gift of hope . It is a remarkable circumstance , that whilst the great dramatist has , in the course of his writings , copiously illustrated all other gifts , affections , and virtues , the passages are very rare in which Hope is mentioned , and then it is usually in a desponding and despairing tone , as when he says : " The miserable hath no other medicine , But only Hope . " Many of his sonnets breathe the spirit of despair and hopelessness . 187 He laments his lameness ; 188 apologizes for his profession as an actor ; 189 expresses his " fear of trust " in himself , and his hopeless , perhaps misplaced , affection ; 1810 anticipates a " coffin 'd doom ; " and utters his profoundly pathetic cry " for restful death . " It might naturally be supposed that Shakspeare 's profession of an actor , and his repeated appearances in public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But inborn shyness , when strong , is not so easily conquered . 1811 Who could have believed that the late Charles Mathews , who entertained crowded houses night after night , was naturally one of the shyest of men ? He would even make long circuits 18lame though he was along the byelanes of London to avoid recognition . His wife says of him , that he looked " sheepish " and confused if recognised ; and that his eyes would fall , and his colour would mount , if he heard his name even whispered in passing along the streets . 1812 Nor would it at first sight have been supposed that Lord Byron was affected with shyness , and yet he was a victim to it ; his biographer relating that , while on a visit to Mrs. Pigot , at Southwell , when he saw strangers approaching , he would instantly jump out of the window , and escape on to the lawn to avoid them . But a still more recent and striking instance is that of the late Archbishop Whately , who , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of shyness . When at Oxford , his white rough coat and white hat obtained for him the soubriquet of " The White Bear ; " and his manners , according to his own account of himself , corresponded with the appellation . He was directed , by way of remedy , to copy the example of the best-mannered men he met in society ; but the attempt to do this only increased his shyness , and he failed . He found that he was all the while thinking of himself , rather than of others ; whereas thinking of others , rather than of one 's self , is of the true essence of politeness . Finding that he was making no progress , Whately was driven to utter despair ; and then he said to himself : " Why should I endure this torture all my life to no purpose ? I would bear it still if there was any success to be hoped for ; but since there is not , I will die quietly , without taking any more doses . I have tried my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward as a bear all my life , in spite of it . I will endeavour to think as little about it as a bear , and make up my mind to endure what ca n't be cured . " From this time forth he struggled to shake off all consciousness as to manner , and to disregard censure as much as possible . In adopting this course , he says : " I succeeded beyond my expectations ; for I not only got rid of the personal suffering of shyness , but also of most of those faults of manner which consciousness produces ; and acquired at once an easy and natural manner  --  careless , indeed , in the extreme , from its originating in a stern defiance of opinion , which I had convinced myself must be ever against me ; rough and awkward , for smoothness and grace are quite out of my way , and , of course , tutorially pedantic ; but unconscious , and therefore giving expression to that goodwill towards men which I really feel ; and these , I believe , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Englishman in his lineage , was also one in his shyness . He is described incidentally by Mr. Josiah Quincy , as " a little stiff in his person , not a little formal in his manner , and not particularly at ease in the presence of strangers . He had the air of a country gentleman not accustomed to mix much in society , perfectly polite , but not easy in his address and conversation , and not graceful in his movements . " Although we are not accustomed to think of modern Americans as shy , the most distinguished American author of our time was probably the shyest of men . Nathaniel Hawthorne was shy to the extent of morbidity . We have observed him , when a stranger entered the room where he was , turn his back for the purpose of avoiding recognition . And yet , when the crust of his shyness was broken , no man could be more cordial and genial than Hawthorne . We observe a remark in one of Hawthorne 's lately-published ' Notebooks , ' 1814 that on one occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cold . " And doubtless Mr. Helps thought the same of him . It was only the case of two shy men meeting , each thinking the other stiff and reserved , and parting before their mutual film of shyness had been removed by a little friendly intercourse . Before pronouncing a hasty judgment in such cases , it would be well to bear in mind the motto of Helvetius , which Bentham says proved such a real treasure to him : " POUR AIMER LES HOMMES , IL FAUT ATTENDRE PEU . " We have thus far spoken of shyness as a defect . But there is another way of looking at it ; for even shyness has its bright side , and contains an element of good . Shy men and shy races are ungraceful and undemonstrative , because , as regards society at large , they are comparatively unsociable . They do not possess those elegances of manner , acquired by free intercourse , which distinguish the social races , because their tendency is to shun society rather than to seek it . They are shy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own families . They hide their affections under a robe of reserve , and when they do give way to their feelings , it is only in some very hidden inner-chamber . And yet the feelings ARE there , and not the less healthy and genuine that they are not made the subject of exhibition to others . It was not a little characteristic of the ancient Germans , that the more social and demonstrative peoples by whom they were surrounded should have characterised them as the NIEMEC , or Dumb men . And the same designation might equally apply to the modern English , as compared , for example , with their nimbler , more communicative and vocal , and in all respects more social neighbours , the modern French and Irish . But there is one characteristic which marks the English people , as it did the races from which they have mainly sprung , and that is their intense love of Home . Give the Englishman a home , and he is comparatively indifferent to society . For the sake of a holding which he can call his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the prairie or amidst the primeval forest , and make for himself a home . The solitude of the wilderness has no fears for him ; the society of his wife and family is sufficient , and he cares for no other . Hence it is that the people of Germanic origin , from whom the English and Americans have alike sprung , make the best of colonizers , and are now rapidly extending themselves as emigrants and settlers in all parts of the habitable globe . The French have never made any progress as colonizers , mainly because of their intense social instincts  --  the secret of their graces of manner ,  --  and because they can never forget that they are Frenchmen . 1815 It seemed at one time within the limits of probability that the French would occupy the greater part of the North American continent . From Lower Canada their line of forts extended up the St. Lawrence , and from Fond du Lac on Lake Superior , along the River St. Croix , all down the Mississippi , to its mouth at New Orleans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from a fringe of settlements along the seacoast , silently extended westward , settling and planting themselves everywhere solidly upon the soil ; and nearly all that now remains of the original French occupation of America , is the French colony of Acadia , in Lower Canada . And even there we find one of the most striking illustrations of that intense sociability of the French which keeps them together , and prevents their spreading over and planting themselves firmly in a new country , as it is the instinct of the men of Teutonic race to do . While , in Upper Canada , the colonists of English and Scotch descent penetrate the forest and the wilderness , each settler living , it may be , miles apart from his nearest neighbour , the Lower Canadians of French descent continue clustered together in villages , usually consisting of a line of houses on either side of the road , behind which extend their long strips of farm-land , divided and subdivided to an extreme tenuity . They willingly submit to all the inconveniences of this method of farming for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betake themselves to the solitary backwoods , as English , Germans , and Americans so readily do . Indeed , not only does the American backwoodsman become accustomed to solitude , but he prefers it . And in the Western States , when settlers come too near him , and the country seems to become " overcrowded , " he retreats before the advance of society , and , packing up his " things " in a waggon , he sets out cheerfully , with his wife and family , to found for himself a new home in the Far West . Thus the Teuton , because of his very shyness , is the true colonizer . English , Scotch , Germans , and Americans are alike ready to accept solitude , provided they can but establish a home and maintain a family . Thus their comparative indifference to society has tended to spread this race over the earth , to till and to subdue it ; while the intense social instincts of the French , though issuing in much greater gracefulness of manner , has stood in their way as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have planted themselves  --  as in Algiers and elsewhere  --  they have remained little more than garrisons . 1816 There are other qualities besides these , which grow out of the comparative unsociableness of the Englishman . His shyness throws him back upon himself , and renders him self-reliant and self-dependent . Society not being essential to his happiness , he takes refuge in reading , in study , in invention ; or he finds pleasure in industrial work , and becomes the best of mechanics . He does not fear to entrust himself to the solitude of the ocean , and he becomes a fisherman , a sailor , a discoverer . Since the early Northmen scoured the northern seas , discovered America , and sent their fleets along the shores of Europe and up the Mediterranean , the seamanship of the men of Teutonic race has always been in the ascendant . The English are inartistic for the same reason that they are unsociable . They may make good colonists , sailors , and mechanics ; but they do not make good singers , dancers , actors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act well , speak well , nor write well . They want style  --  they want elegance . What they have to do they do in a straightforward manner , but without grace . This was strikingly exhibited at an International Cattle Exhibition held at Paris a few years ago . At the close of the Exhibition , the competitors came up with the prize animals to receive the prizes . First came a gay and gallant Spaniard , a magnificent man , beautifully dressed , who received a prize of the lowest class with an air and attitude that would have become a grandee of the highest order . Then came Frenchmen and Italians , full of grace , politeness , and CHIC  --  themselves elegantly dressed , and their animals decorated to the horns with flowers and coloured ribbons harmoniously blended . And last of all came the exhibitor who was to receive the first prize  --  a slouching man , plainly dressed , with a pair of farmer 's gaiters on , and without even a flower in his buttonhole . " Who is he ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was the reply . " The Englishman !  --  that the representative of a great country ! " was the general exclamation . But it was the Englishman all over . He was sent there , not to exhibit himself , but to show " the best beast , " and he did it , carrying away the first prize . Yet he would have been nothing the worse for the flower in his buttonhole . To remedy this admitted defect of grace and want of artistic taste in the English people , a school has sprung up amongst us for the more general diffusion of fine art . The Beautiful has now its teachers and preachers , and by some it is almost regarded in the light of a religion . " The Beautiful is the Good "  --  " The Beautiful is the True "  --  " The Beautiful is the priest of the Benevolent , " are among their texts . It is believed that by the study of art the tastes of the people may be improved ; that by contemplating objects of beauty their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn from sensual enjoyments , their character will//
