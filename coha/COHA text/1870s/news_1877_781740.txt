txt None of the official or semi-official organs of Controller KELLY have attempted to explain why he reduced the sum appropriated for the repaving and repair of down-town streets from $700,000 to $350,000 , and why the sum thus cut off from a very necessary appropriation should have been partly expended in increasing the salaries of " TOM " DUNLAP , " ED " GALE , " BILLY " Dom , and other City officials closely confleeted with Tammany Hall . We observe that the Sun has taken the trouble to find out on behalf of the laborers who have been discharged because of the insufficiency of the appropriation for street repairs , why two Brooklyn laborers had been retained , while 200 New-Yorkers were discharged . It is strange that our enterprising contemporary should have limited its inquiries to this point . Au explanation of why the appropriation was insufficient would have been more to the purpose , and would have enabled the discharged 200 , as well as the others who were likely to follow them , to find out whether they are the victims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud which sustains itself by their votes and pays its favorites out of their pockets . We have already explained that JOHN KELLY was primarily responsible for reducing by one-half the appropriation for the repair of down-town streets asked for by Commissioner CAMPBELL and inserted in the City budget by Controller GREEN . An attempt was made to supply the deficit thus created by a bill appropriating $200,000 for the purpose in question . The bill passed both houses , and , as is shown by the following letter , the Governor was appealed to by Commissioner CAMPBELL and Mayor ELY to allow it to become law : NE  --  Yor.x , May 24 , 1877 . To Iron . Lucius Robinson , Governor : Slit : Permit me to commend to your favorable consideration Assembly bill No. 520 , now before you for approval , providing for an expenditure of $200,000 in two years in repaving and repairing the streets south of Fourteenth  --  streetiu this City . 3Iany or thesd streets are now in such condition as to seriously impede traffic , thus injuring commerce to a considerable extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the necessary improvements . The benefits to commerce , public health , and public interests generally to be derived from a judicious expenditure of the proposed appropriation fro so great as to make the bill a measure of true economy , and I trust , therefore , that it will meet your approval . I am , Sir , very respectfully yours , ALLAN CAMPBELL , . Commissioner of Public works . I cordially concur with the above recommendation . SMITH ELY , JR. , Mayor . The assertion is made , with what justice we are unable to say , that the Governor disregarded these appeals at the express demand of Jolts KELLY . It is certain that KELLY did not favor the passage of the law , and it is equally certain that it is now pretended by Tammany politicians that he did . This is clearly a ease in which the City laborers should have some explanation from their alleged " friends , " and in which the people at large who are interested in redeeming down-town thoroughfares from their present disgraceful condition , may fitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at all times subsidiary to the interests of Tansmany office-holders.
