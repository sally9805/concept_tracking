txt A question is now agitating the Board . of Aldermen which ought to be promptly settled , were it for no other reason than to allow our City fathers to give their - undisturbed attention to matters more closely affecting the public interests . The question is , Are the Aldermen entitled to an extra 82,009 a year for their services as Supervisors 7 The legal points bearing on the case are the following : A. week after the passage of the charter of 1870 a law was passed ( chapter 190 ) constituting a new Board of Supervisors in lieu of the old one of infamous memory . That sot constituted . the Mayor , Recorder , and . the Aldermen who should be elected under the provisions of the charter , the Board of Supervisors for the County of New-York . Section 4 of this act prohibited the payment to the members of the board of any extra compensation for their services , This was , however , amended by chapter 583 , laws of 1871 , in the following section : " Each member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excepting the Mayor , shall hereafter receive an annual salary of $2,000 . " The title of the bill , of which the above is a part , is , " An act to make provision for pie local government of the City and County of New-York . " So far as it relates to the City it is expressly repealed in the charter of 1873 . The clause quoted refers to the County , and . could not , whether excepted or not , be repealed Wider a City law , as the new charter avowedly is . Sa far , the claim of the Aldermen to receive extra compensation as Supervisors seems to be a perfectly valid one . But the new charter contains a provision forbidding any officer under the City Government to draw a salary for any service rendered ex officio to the County Government . Both in the new charter and in the County law of 1870 , from which the Board of Supervisors , as now constituted . draws its authority , it is simply stated that " the Aldermen " shall discharge the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed Supervisors by name , it is simply as Aldermen . e. , ex officio. that they are constituted a county board . The same statement applies to the Recorder , who is obviously a member of the Board of Supervisors , ex officio . Under the provisions of the new charter , therefore , it would appear that the Controller can not legally pay , nor can the Aldermen and Recorder legally receive , the $2,000 a year voted to them by the super-serviceable Tweed Legislature of 1871 . Even if fa technical loophole remain through which can be wriggled a claim for some $32,000 a year for the Board of Supervisors , it seems to us that the members would do well to refuse to take advantage of it . A City groaning under a debt of $108 , - . 000,000 needs to be economical , and a body of men professing to be just and honorable public servants should not take a mean advantage of hasty legislation . It was undoubtedly the intention of the framers of the charter to make $4,000 a year the full recompense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aldermen . In the public estimation , and relatively to the salaries of other officials , the remuneration is quite sufficient . The people will be disposed to make a note of the members of the board who are most anxious to grab a salary to which equitably , at least , they are not entitled . Greed of this kind appeals very powerfully to the understanding of the mass of voters , as those who are chargeable with it will find to their cost at the proper time .
