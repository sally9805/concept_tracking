txt M. DE BROGLIE and his friends believe that France can not do without them , but the people , whenever they go to the polls , persist in declaring a contrary opinion . Since 1871 they have returned 118 Republican members of the Assembly , at 138 partial elections . This appears like a strong expression of teeling . Their would-be rulers , however , do not regard it as conclusive . They look upon all Republican tendencies as symptoms of an alarming distemper . Honesty , they say , is represented exclusively by themselves . To them has been intrusted the task of establishing the reign of " moral order . " What they mean by " moral order " is not exactly known , but it is evidently something which does not seem to agree with the wishes of the people , or with the principles of selfgovernment . But do doctors consult the wishes of their patients ? When so formidable a disease as Republicanism breaks out among Frenchmen , measures must be taken to check it before the people are beyond hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently it has recourse to all sorts of ingenious devices . The one most recently started is a measure for depriving the people of the right to elect to the office of Maire , and . to transfer that privilege to M. DE BROGLIE and his friends . Centralization is their present object . But it was not always so . When M. TRIERS was at the head of the Executive , they had other notions about the blessings of centralization . In April , 1871 , they denied hint the right to appoint Maim in cities which ' contained more than twenty thousand inhabitants . It is true the measure was only required for the purpose of aiding in the work of pacification then in progress , and with the view of promoting a conservative but Republican organization of the Government ; but they did not think this was a sufficient reason . To-day it is quite different . They have power ; they want to retain it for special purposes , and unless they are authorized to change or appoint , , the 2faire8 and Aldermen of tko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep that power . They refused to grant to another , under the heaviest pressure of circumstances , a power much smaller than they ask for themselves , and for no better reason than the desire to gratify an unscrupulous ambition . If M. Minna could do without any fundamental restrictions on municipal franchises , when he had . to contend . against so many difficulties , it seems as if M. DE BROGLIE ought to be able to do without them now , when France is tranquil and restored to herself . But the difference is this . M. TRIERS gov- erned France for the sake of the people , and they govern it , under a provisional lease , tor themselves . There are in France about . sixteen thousand communes with less than five hundred inhabitants ; over eleven thousand with from five to ten hundred ; about six thousand three hundred with from one to two thousand ; twenty-two hundred with from two to five thousand ; three hundred with from five to ten thousand ; and one hundred with from ten to twenty thousand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government think it necessary to install their own officials . The communes which have not more than one thousand inhabitants are simply rural settlements , but these , of which there are twenty-seven thousand , are so.many centres of rebellion , and , according to the Minister of the Interior , they are therefore a source of danger which must be dealt with without delay . That there is peril we admit . But it does not appear to threaten social order . If social order were endangered , why should not the laws tested by M. TRIERS be sufficient to protect it ? Other interests are at issue . The truth is that rural electors , as well as the electors of towns and cities , seem to be resolved upon making as short as possible the parliamentary career of those men who aim at keeping themselves indefinitely at the helm , but whose patronage and services are not desired ; and it is here that lies " the moral disorder " which , according to M. le Ministre de ** needs to be corrected without delay . The measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , it will prove the ruin of French municipal franchises , which were respected even by the Imperial Government . But will it change the disposition of six or seven millions of Republican electors ? It will much more probably exasperate them , and thereby hasten the downfall of a party which seems by its own follies to be fast drifting to self-destruction .
