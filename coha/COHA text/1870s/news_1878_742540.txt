txt Perhaps we ought to be grateful to the Senators who stand by " the machine " in polities because they are such vigorous supporters of the national credit . Mr. Coxxpod , we observe , is continually praised as one " who can be relied on to maintain the honor of the nation " ? provided this service does not interfere with his share of the public plunder . It is thought to be sufficient , nowadays , for a Congressman that he shall oppose repudiation and inflation . So long as he keeps up a prodigious clatter about his devotion to the financial credit of the Republic , his position on other questions must not be criticised . More than this , whenever the Administration has made one of its spasmodic attempts to recall rules intended to purify the civil service , there is an instant outcry that nobody must meddle with " the machine " now . The duty of the hour is to defend the faith of the nation against the insidious attacks of repudiationists . In the furtherance of this scheme the degraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing at a time , Mr. HAYES ! " The President is shrilly reminded that he must not interfere with official brokerage while the question of financial honor is at stake . In like manner Senator DAWES loftily informed a reporter the other day , in effect , that he really had not time to consider the disputes which had arisen between the Executive and the Senate concerning official patronage . He was terribly busy maintaining the national credit . Senator DAWES has a happy faculty for looking the other way when something doubtful is under his nose . But of all the Senators and Representatives who are busiest with their little personal schemes , it can be said that they " Uphold the national honor and credit . " We are invited to contemplate the spectacle of a cohort of noble-minded statesmen bearing on their shoulders the plighted faith of the nation , while bad men are reviling them as trading politicians who keep themselves in power by peddling official pap . There was something very much like this during the late civil war . A Congressman who panted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hordes of secession might be subsequently found selline cadetship , or drawing back pay and mileage , in consideration of his services to a distressed country . A public officer , elbow deep in the public Treasury , might escape the Penitentiary , and even receive a popular verdict of applause , if it could be said of him that he was devoted to the flag and that his heart yearned over the brave boys in the field . Loyalty covered a multitude of sins , and ' of all the harpies gathered in Washington none were so greedy as those who were incessantly clamorous for an opportunity to serve the distressed Republic  --  the Quartermaster 's Department preferred . The biggest thieves hurrahed the loudest ; and so long as a man was true to the Union , " in this hour of our country 's peril , " he might be excusedif his hand occasionally went into the public Treasury , where it had no lawful business . And , by some curious idiosyncrasy of mind , no disgraced Congressman or cashiered officer ever failed to take the gloomiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel , detected in the most shameful frauds , and sent out of the Army covered with obloquy , covered the whole case when he said : " The country has gone to the dogs , Sir . The rebellion is bound to succeed . Patriotism has no chance in these days , Sir . " Loyalty and patriotism were very good in those days . ' Without them , the nation would have been wtecked . Nor wore all loyal and patriotic men dishonest . Nor are all hard-money men now selfishly struggling to save " the machine " from destruction . But now , as then , a very valuable public service is held to be an equivalent for anything which the defender of the faith chooses to demand . The cry that the purification of politics must be put off until the financial question is settled is very much as if dishonest army Contractors should not have been punished until the rebellion was crushed . " One thing at a time , Mr. LINCOLN ! " some journalistic prostitute might have cried , if the President had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is even threatened that if President HAYES really desires to have the public credit maintained he must be particularly careful how he treats Republican Senators who stand by the machine . Unlimited run of official patronage is'te be the price of their fidelity to a policy which includes resumption of specie payments and a general maintenance of the national credit . If the Senate is not to be allowed to retain its unconstitutional prerogatives in the dispensing of the offices , the President must look elsewhere for men to vote against inflation and repudiation . Statesmen of the Conkling school can not do two things at once . If they are to defend the Custom-houses and Post Offices against the insidious advances of the Administration , how are they to find leisure to study finance and save the credit of the nation 7 This is the style of argument now in vogue among the machine men . The great CONKLING sulks in his tent , and his obsequious followers ask with indignation if his variety of loyalty to the national honor is to be treated with ingratitude . Give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though the State be dishonored.
