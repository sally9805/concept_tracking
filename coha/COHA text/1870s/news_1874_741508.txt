txt When the London accountants returned to their homes , after having made au extended investigation into the affairs of the Erie Railway Company , their report fell under the criticism of Mr. Anrnua CRUMP , the city , or financial writer of the London Times . The report was not flattering to the company , and if it had been more full and specific it would have been still less so . Such as it was it confirmed some remarks which nearly a year before we had occasion to make concerning the company . At that time Mr. SAMPSON was the city writer of the Timex , and he thought it worth his while to defend Mr. WATSON , the then President of Erie , aril to intimate that any testimony against t h t I genticm:in was " suborned . " He has 6111 ( 2e been allowed to resign his own position heron:Jo lie had betrayed . the trust reposed in him , and Mr. CIII:31P is his successor . Mr. CRUMP is one of the most careful , accurate , and discerning students of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse of that which Mr. SAMPSON acquired . He takes naturally a very different view of Erie to that taken by his predecessor . On the 13th of October the Times city article contained the following : " The simple course is , as we say , to lend no more money , and so to force affairs to au issue . The bonds recently put on the market to raise money to clear the floating debt off , which are , we believe , the residue of an abortive issue , ought not to be bought . It would be better to allow creditors to foreclose than that things should go on as they have done . " This we regard as au entirely sensible view to take of the matter . Erie has long been an injury to sound American securities abroad , and especially in the London market , and every renewed attempt to make the affairs of the company better seems to end by making them worse . The effect of this is shown by the course of the stock . A year ago , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New-York for 59% . The panic affected it but little , because very little is held here , yet by Oct , 14 it had fallen to 443 . Although rallying during the Winter months to something like 47 to 48 , it fell during the Summer to 32 ) ( 1 , and after reaching 3754 at the close of September , has again gone down as follows : Oct. 1 , 351% ; 8th , 33X ; 15th , 29% ; 22d , 29% ; 29th , 29 ; and yesterday to 2814 , or less than one-half what it was Sept. 1 , 1873 . The condition of affairs shown by the report of the London accountants is very severely criticised in England . The accountants were commissioned on the 29th of April last by the London Banking Association , Limited , to discover the truth in regard to three questions : Whether the published accounts of the company are correct ; whether the expenses chargeable against earnings have been so charged , or have been charged to construction or capital account ; and whether the dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these inquiries , the report of the accountants furnishes material enough for judgment upon them . That of the London Times , which has special reasons for being strictly unprejudiced and impartial in this regard , is very unfavorable . That paper says : " According to it ( the report ) the difference between the actual profit earned and the profit credited in the company 's report was $4 , - 343,898 . In other words , the profit actually earned by the company in the two years ending Sept. 30 , 1873 , was really about a million dollars , and they claim to have earned over five and a quarter millions . " This is conclusive as to the correctness of the accounts , which was the first  --  point to be investigated , and which , to a considerable extent , carries with it both the others . If the Directors of a company can represent themselves as having made five millions and a quarter for their shareholders , when they have made only-a million , then they are quite capable of charging current expenses to construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends out of borrowed money . When , as the Times remarks , " the accounts have apparently been kept in a slovenly , if not reckless , fashion since JAY GOULD 'S time just as much as before , " it can make little difference what I form the accounts may take . The report of the accountants , as We have said , is not flattering to the company or to its management , and offers but little encouragement to the unfortunate shareholder . And the accountants intimate that the balance sheet which they are enabled to make out by taking the books of the company and making such corrections as they have discovered the necessity of , is by no means complete or to be relied upon . " This balance sheet , " they say , " presents a general view of the position of the company as on the 30th September , 1873 , according to the books and inclusive of our corrections ; but an authoritative examination and determination of the many questions both of law and fact which affect the nature , extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished before a complete elucidation of its present financial position can be effected . " It would seem from this that the affairs of the company are incapable of any systematic and correct statement from the light . afforded by the books of the company . It follows necessarily that , if this be the case , the shareholder can not expect much . A company that can not tell the real condition of its liabilities and assets is not likely to pay dividends regularly , however small , or to afford any guarantee of actual value for its shares , however low the nominal price of these may be . And if i t be true that the company has been compelled , as is alleged , to raise money on its bonds to pay its floating debt , ( of this there is no question , ) and to pay such dividends in part as it has declared ; and if there is doubt as to whether it is even earning money enough to pay its coupons as they accrue , then , as the London Times suggests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that things should go on as they have done .
