txt The American small boy early develops a taste for mercantile pursuits . Beginning with the simple process of barter and exchange , ho soon adopts the use of a recognized currency , and opens a shop for the sale of articles of juvenile necessity and luxury  --  such as tops and stale candy . Xis a remarkable fact that the process of barter among small boys leads to a direct diminution of the amount of juvenile wealth in the world . When the small boy exchanges something for something else , he always receives much loss than he gives . This fact may be at variance with political economy and mathematics , but it is nevertheless true . Instances have been known of the successive exchange by a series of small boys of a bird-cage in good condition , with the result that the last boy exchanges it for a knife-handle without any blades , after which the bird-cage vanished utterly from human view . There is a mystery here into which philosophers have vainly sought to pry , but it is as yet dense and impenetrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys consists of pins .. When an enterprising small boy opens a juvenile shop , or organizes a juvenile circus , the price of goods and . of admission tickets is calculated in pins . A remarkable steadiness of prices prevails . Ton pins usually secure admission to the best juvenile circus , and an extra charge of five pins is generally made for admission within the circle of reserved ash-boxes . For five pins a small boy can buy a dozen chestnuts , while as many as five grains of blasting powder are sold for fifty pins . From time immemorial this pin currency has circulated in schools , and it is rare that the volume of pins is found to be inadequate to the necessities of trade and the annual moving of the chestnut crop . The readers of THE TIMES may remember that about a year ago a now teacher assinned charge of the public school at Woodside , Ohio . Ho brought with him a new scholar named Matthew Stanley , of whom lie expressed the highest possible opinion . When any one asked him his opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to Master Stanley , remarking at the same time that lie did not know exactly what his own opinion was , but that Master Stanley undoubtedly did know . If a boy had boon particularly disorderly , the teacher always sent his favorite pupil to beg the boy to bo conciliated , and to overlook any failure to meet his views on the part of previous teachers . Titus , it came to pass that the now boy obtained an exceptionally prominent place in the school , although many of the boys insisted that ho was a conceited , intriguing , and generally objectionable " little fraud , " as they coarsely . expressed it . Now , it so happened that the Woodside school-boys wore none of them under 12 - years of ago , and had consequently outgrown the pin currency . They conducted business solely upon the basis of a nickel currency , and to obtain admission to a juvenile Woodside show , or to buy last year 's chestnuts at a juvenile Woodside store , sums calculated exclusively in the one-cent coins of our happy country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wore not in all respects such as the writers of Sunday-school books delight to glorify , and they exhibited an abnormal thirst for pie and lemonade . These delicacies were procured from the shopkeepers of the town , and , in many instances , upon credit . Unquostionably , the boys ought not to have received credit , but they promised so solemnly that they would pay their debts as soon as they obtained money from home , that the shopkeepers . unwisely trusted them , and when Master Stanley ? entered the school , many of the boys were deeply in debt . As they worn obliged to pay a heavy rate of interest , they suffered from a scarcity of money , and were compelled to play with last year 's tops and balls , to their great disgust . Ono day a largo fat boy named Jones , together with two or three companions , discovered half a dozen fullpapors of pins on the sidewalk , whore some unknown person had dropped them . Having in their possession this bonanza of pins , they lamented that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they could pay their debts in pins , they would be relieved from an embarrassments , and this groat truth so filled their minds that they sought out Matthew Stanley , knowing his influence with the totteher , and ' proposed to him the scheme of remonetizing the pins of their earlier boyhood . The next day Master Stanley called the boys together at recess and made them a speech . He said that they had agreed to pay their debts , but he reminded thorn that they had omitted to pledge themselves at tiro tine of contracting their debts that they would . not pay them in pins . Hence , he argued that they had a perfect right to resolve that pins should once more be the recognized currency of the school , and that the shopkeepers should be paid in that currency only . It must bo confessed that he used language that was far froni nice . When a conscientious small boy suggested that grown-up people would call it cheating to pay the shopkeepers in pins , ho - exclaimed : " Who cares what the grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone : " Darn the grown folks anyhow ! " This forei- ble argument had a great effect , and it is now understood . that a large majority of tho boys . ' are in , favor of the remonotization of pins , and'that unless the teacher interferes* , they will carry their project into execution . While no one supposes that the teacher will permit the boys to do such a foolish and rascally thing , there is a general feeling among all intelligent parents that Master Stanley ought to be suppressed . That he is a nuisance is universally conceded . He not only makes more trouble by his meddlesome habits than any other boy , but the conceited air with which ho constantly pretends that ho can make the teacher do precisely what ho wishes , and that , in fact , ho furnishes the latter with all his ideas and opinions , is really insufferable . It is full time for the teacher to cause it to be understood that he can teach school without Master Stanley 's assistance , and to send that objectionable boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate need of a severe spanking.
