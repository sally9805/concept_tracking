ARTICLE VII . - THE SECT SYSTEM* THE phrase which stands at the head of this Article is not original with us . It first attracted our attention in Dr. Philip Schaff s " Religion in America , " reviewed in this journal several years ago . It seemed to us at that time an absurd form of expression , little short of a contradiction in terms . Sect , thought we , as it exists among us , is not a system , but the negation of system , rendering , by its prevalence , system impossible . But there are men among us that profess to think , who take a very different view of this matter-Christian teachers in whose thought the division of the Church of Christ into so many separate organizations and governments as at present is not confusion and anarchy , but harmony  --  a normal order of the Church of God , which is to last as long as the mediatorial reign of Christ-an order into which the Church , when governed wisely and faithfully , grows and develops itself as naturally as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject has high claims upon our respectful consideration . If diversity of sects springs from false conceptions of the nature of the Church , from unwarrantable usurpations of powers which the Founder never conferred , and which are contradictory to the spirit of the gospel , then the prevalence of such divisions is anarchy and confusion . It is to be regarded as a symptom of a morbid social condition , which calls on us to apply appropriate spiritual remedies in cheerful hope of a cure . Apologies for sect are in that case no more respectable than apologies for any other form of social error and wrong . But if , on the contrary , religious sect has its foundation in the established laws of God and human nature , if it rests on clear and definite principles , which are capable of being definitely ascertained , formulated , and proven , principles without the reverential observance of which the soundness of the faith and // the purity of the Church can not be preserved , then are we bound respectfully to hear and weigh the words of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian ages , at a time when its foundations are a good deal shaken , or certainly put to a severe test , by the blows of many earnest and powerful assailants . lit was for this reason , we presume , space was given in the last number of this journal to the able Article on " Sectarism , Alliance , and the Basis of Fellowship . " Its very worthy author , Rev. S. B. Goodenow , has , with a hearty good will , undertaken the task of reducing religious sect as it exists in Protestant Christendom to a system . This , the author rightly judges , is exactly what must be done , if the existing condition of things is to be defended and conserved . If sect is to live and be perpetuated , it must be as a system and not as an anarchy . He therefore rightly begins , as all system-makers must , by laying down the definitions and axioms , out of which system must grow , as the plant grows from its germ . He manifests a confidence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these days of doubt and unbelieg by exhibiting these fundamental elements of his system , in the way of naked statements , as possessing such self-evidencing power as to require no confirmation either from Scripture or reason . He will , however , pardon us for reminding him that it is hardly reasonable to expect that they will be accepted as self-evident by all his readers . We must ourselves call some of them in question , in the very outset . We are really unable to see that all his definitions are truly descriptive of the fundamental conceptions of the Church , as we receive them from its Founder , or that all his assumed axioms are really self-evident truths . We admit that if sect , as it exists among us , is to be constructed into a permanent system , that system must be built of the very materials which he assumes . But this can not hinder our inquiring whether those assumptions rest on any substantial foundation . If not , the structure which is built of them is but a cloud castle , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up . // honoring Christ and advancing his cause , " This definition is evidently quite too broad . No one would think of calling a local woman 's board of foreign missions a church , and yet it agrees in every particular with the author 's definition . In like manner , the definition includes a multitude of other religious societies , actual or possible , which could never be thought of as churches . There must be in our conception of the church some characteristic feature , which distinguishes it from all other organizations , religious or secular . Our author gives us no information at all , as to what that feature is . His definition is , therefore , an entire failure . It distinguishes nothing . There is uo definition of the word church in the Scriptures . We must derive our conception of it from what we learn of the nature aud constitution of the churches founded by the Apostles , and from the intimations given by our Lord himself ; of the nature of his kingdom on earth . A careful consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seems to us to point directly to the one characteristic feature which distinguishes the church , whether universal or local , from all other societies . That feature is , that it is a brotherhood of Christian disciples , united together simply and only by the one bond of faith in Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the world . Its foundation ever standeth sure , having this seal , " The Lord knoweth them that are his . " In God 's unerring view they , and they only , are members of it in whom this faith is vital and genuine . To our view , appearances must be accepted , and all lovingly recognized as belonging to it , who make a profession of such faith , with lives that do not contradict such a profession . Whether this is the conception of the church which pervades the New Testament , we submit to every candid reader of that book . 2 . Our author not only furnishes a definition of the church which is utterly indeterminate and latitudinarian , but in perfect consistency with such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches according to their taste or their judgments of the fittest way of promoting the spread and prevalence of the gospel in the world . One limitation only does he distinctly recognize to the right of multiplying separate organizations , and that is " where there is room for them . " Of how // much value this limitation is in practice , may be seen from the fact that , in nearly every village of our country , outside of New England , churches have been multiplied till there is generally more than one church to every five hundred people . To Paul it was utterly shocking that , at Corinth , men should say , I am of Paul , and I am of Apollo , and I of Cephas , and I of Christ , though they had as yet made no organic division . But many of our modern doctors of the church , instead of rebuking the first manifestations of such a partizan spirit , as a sure symptom of carnality , instruef such partizans not to think of living to gether in the same church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own , aid that to do so " is not sectarian . " It is " not sectarian for each person to prefer his own church method , if only this be kept subservient to charity and the interests of the iRedeemer 's kingdom . " To Paul , the very manifestation of such partizanship as threatened such a division , seemed destructive of charity , and a decisive proof of a carnal spirit . How do our brethren who are rallying to the defense of our denominationalism reconcile Paul 's view of the matter with that which they defend ? Why could not Paul see that such a partizan spirit is inseparable from human nature , and that to repress it was not only unwise but impossible ? Why did he not at once settle all those troubles as we do , by advising to organize the Pauline Church , and the Church of the Apollosites , and the Church of the Cephasites , and the Church of Christ . Then matters might have been arranged as satisfactorily and wisely at Corinth , eighteen centuries ago , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , and St. Louis . Blessed discovery of these modem ages ! Why could not Paul see it ? Must it not have been on account of his Jewish prejudices ? Let us not deceive ourselves . Nothing could have been more shocking to one imbued with such a conception of the church as Paul held and fervently cherished , than such a factious condition of Christendom as that on which we look out . From whatever quarter this idea c me , that it is not sectarian to multiply separate churches " where there is room for them , ** it did not come from the New Testament . In the estimation of Paul , there is no " room for them ' within the limits of Christian charity . // * . Our author still further maintains that no credible evidence of being ma " regenerate state " is any reason why one should not be rejected when applying for membership in a particular church , or why he should not be excluded from it , if ; in the judgment of its members , that person will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have constructed their church after their own taste or fancy ; they have a perfect right to do so according to the assumption on which we have just remarked ; and if this fellow disciple does not like their way , he must pass on and find some other church that is constructed after his fancy . If he can not find such an one , he must stay without till he can make a sufficient number of proselytes to his peculiar views to form another church according to his taste . Then we may be sure he will have no difficulty in finding that there is " room enough for it . " The author is perfectly right in regarding this principle as fundamental to the sect system , and yet it is of very recent origin . There is no trace of its recognition in the Apostolic age , or , so far as our information extends , in any other age previous to the Reformation . The reformers themselves were very reluctant to give it any countenance . It is still resisted by the Roman Catholic Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant communions have never assented to it as a doctrine of Scripture , but only as a necessity of their position . The various Protestant organizations exist , and have been multiplied , and they meet each other face to face on the same territory . Each asserts its own right to be , and in doing so is forced to concede the same right to other organizations . Thus the right of any company of believers to organize a church for themselves , and according to such constitutions and laws as they may choose to adopt , has become recognized as a necessity of our present condition , and to a great extent accepted as an axiom . No one pretends to prove it from Scripture , or to reconcile it with Apostolic teaching and practice . It is purely the result of an effort of the various Protestant denominations to vindicate their own right to be . But its adoption has opened all the flood-gates , and while it is retained and acted on , to form a new Church of Christ will be regarded as a thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will // swarm through Christendom in ever increasing numbers , so long as there is room for them ; and when at last there is no longer room for them , the sustaining of any organized church will be an impossibility . We can , within our personal knowledge , point to places where this consummation has already been reached . We say this assumption has no support from Scripture . Who ever heard in Apostolic times of two churches organized on the same territory , or even on different territories , to represent different phases of religious belief or practice ? To ask the question is to answer it . What did Paul mean when he said " Him that is weak in the faith receive ye ? " Why was not the question about eating things sacrificed to idols solved by organizing churches of two denominations , representing this diversity of views and practices ? Why did not those who thought it wrong to eat such things , when in the majority , make rules shutting out those that thought and practiced differently ? Why did not the Apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those churches to tolerate and recognize one another , instead of insisting on toleration of individuals in the same church ? Why was not the same course pursued as to the differences between the Judaising and the Gentile Christians ? When these questions can be satisfactorily answered , we shall see some possibility of engrafting the sect system upon the churches of the Apostles . But we venture to predict , not only that this will never be done , but that it will never be attempted . Till this can be done , the assumption of which we are speaking must be regarded as a sad necessity , created by the sect system itself in its hopeless struggle to defend its own right to be , and as resting on no other foundation whatever . 4 . Though our author admits the existence of the Church Universal , and that all its members have a right to all the privileges which God has given to his people , he still assumes that local churches alone possess the " power of the keys ; " and that consequently no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to Baptism and the Lord 's Supper , except by the action of some particular church . When one has thus gained admission through the door of a particular church , he becomes entitled to communion , not only in the particular // church which has admitted him , hut in all other churches . If a particular church excludes one who is in " a regenerate state , " as it may with propriety do , when in the judgment of a majority of its members he will not " honor Christ in their body , " he is out of the Church Universal , till he can find some other particular church that will open its doors to him , and to whose laws he is willing to submit . If he is unsuccessful in this search , he must stay out of the fold , till he can persuade others to unite with him in organizing a new church which , as soon as organized , will possess the mysterious power of the keys as fully as those that previously existed . One Christian disciple , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church Universal and cut off from its rights and privileges . But if he can find a handful of believers in Christ who are of the same mind with himself they can effect a new organization , and not only thereby open a door for themselves into the kingdom of heaven , hut obtain " the power of the keys , " and admit all others who accept the peculiar views which they wish to represent in a church organization , not only to communion with them , but with all other Christian churches . It is quite unnecessary to waste time in showing how utterly alien these assumptions are from that conception of the Church which is found in the New Testament No sane man will ever attempt to find any sanction for them in that book ; they are purely the results of the dire necessities to which sect has reduced us . We can not deny the blessed oneness of the Church Universal , or that every true disciple of Christ has a right to a place in that Church , and to the enjoyment of all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to frame its own constitution and its own laws , we can not deny to other Christians whom by those laws we exclude from our church , the right to organize a church for themselves , representing their own ideas , as our church represents ours . We can not disown the communion of saints . We therefore admit and maintain that all persons in regular membership with any particular church , " all members in good and regular standing with sister churches " are entitled to a seat at the Lord 's table whenever it is snread . Thus , though we have rent the Lord 's body into a thousand fragments , we seek to heal all those ghastly , bleeding // wounds , by the barren form of occasional communion together in the Lord 's Supper . Such is the " sect system " as it is accepted and explained by one of its most earnest and sincere defenders , and as we believe it is held and defended by thousands of devout Christians and zealous ministers of Christ at the present time . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly false and untenable are its principles , and how utterly indefensible it is as a system . When it is distinctly contemplated as a whole , and with a clear statement of the assumptions on which it rests , its own intrinsic hideousness is not only apparent , but very shocking to every mind that is accustomed to contemplate with affectionate reverence the moral scenery of the New Testament . But though it seems to us that fairly to state these assumptions is to refute them , there are other relations of the subject more or less distinctly brought into view in the Article on which we are commenting , which require a little further consideration . We have here definitions of " Schism " and " Sectarism " - sectarianism we prefer to say . " He only is a schismatic who encourages separation into distinct churches where they are not needed ; where there are not members enough to warrant the outlay . " And who is to judge whether they are needed ? What numbers would warrant the outlay ? Every one must , in the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when a brother has answered them conscientiously , what right has another to arraign him for his decision , and call him a schismatic ? If all the churches in the community in which one lives impose creeds to which he can not sincerely subscribe , or governments to which he can not conscientiously submit , and make the acceptance of their creeds or governments a condition of admission to the privileges of the household of God , it will surely not require much time to decide , that in that community there is room for a church to which one can be welcomed , without receiving any yoke on his neck which Christ has not imposed . A Christian disciple in such circumstances would not long hesitate to accept any number of fellow disciples willing to join with him in such an organization , as a " sufficient // number to justify the outlay . " If he was charged with schism , if he was told there were too many churches already , his sufficient answer would be , that the fault lay not with him but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges of the church by arbitrary rules of their own devising ; that theirs were the churches for which there was not room enough , not that church whose doors were always open to all the Lord 's dear people . The guilt of schism always does lie with those who exclude from the privileges of the church persons who make a credible profession of discipleship . If such exclusion is not schism , then there can be no schism . The very same principle that sanctions the exclusion , authorizes the excluded to make for themselves such a religious home as their tastes and consciences require . The limitation , " where there is room enough , " becomes utterly futile , and the sin of schism impossible . If this principle is admitted and acted on , sect will not only be as lasting as Christianity , but the number of sects , not only where there is room for them but where there is not , will go on increasing with ever accelerated rapidity , and the only end will be , when they are so multiplied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor is the day distant when that end will be reached . So of sectarianism , he is the sectarian who necessitates sectarian separation , and not he who favors the formation of another church where the number of churches is already inconveniently large , provided he is excluded from the churches that are there , by creeds , forms , and governments , to which he can not submit with good conscience . This can easily be tested by a case . For a community of one thousand souls one church is much better than two . Suppose , then , that in such a community there is already a Baptist church embracing a majority of all the Christian people , in which all is right and Christian , except that close communion is rigidly enforced . A minority of the Christian people are conscientiously opposed to close communion . What shall they do ? There is not room for another church . If this minority organizes a church in which the privileges of the Christian household are free to all true disciples , are they guilty of schism ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exclusive majority ? Or shall we adopt the fundamental prin // ciple of sect , that the majority have a right to organize the church according to their fancy , and the minority have the same right ? We can not escape the conclusion . Either the sin of schism and the charge of sectarianism lie at the door of the exelusive majority , or they lie nowhere . The same considerations apply with equal force to any other condition of full membership than credible evidence of true discipleship , in any church whatever . This position is not a novelty . It is as old as the Church of Christ . It is the doctrine especially of the fathers of Congregationalism from the beginning . Our fathers of the early New England churches did not impose their creeds as denominational tests to ascertain the fitness of the candidate to honor Christ in that particular church , but as tests and evidences of genuine faith in Christ . In no part of the history of the Con. gregational churches has the acceptance of a creed been regarded in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candidate 's faith in Christ . Mr. Goodenow 's conception of a basis of Congregational fellowship as distinct from Christian fellowship is a very recent novelty among us , and we suppose that few of our leading minds have to this day adopted it . We believe the accepted doctrine of Congregationalism to day is , that credible evidence of discipleship is the only proper condition of membership in the church , " credible discipleship , " not " creditable , " as Mr. Goodenow has it . We never set ourselves up as searchers of hearts , or represented our fathers of New England as having attempted any " system of judging hearts and destinies . " As our author proceeds , he warms with the friction of his own argument , and points out " the fatal result . " " This system " ( that is , the doctrine that there should be no condition of church membership but credible evidence of discipleship ) " must do away with all church discipline , all law and order in the household of God  --  and must introduce complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we paused to wonder what the writer 's ideas of church discipline might be . If the design of church discipline is , as set forth in Christ 's own words , to reclaim and restore our erring brother , and , in case of a failure of all effort to persuade him to return to obedience to // the laws of Christ , to separate him from the company of the believers , we are quite unable to perceive that the sect system which our brother has constructed , has any tendency to encourage and facilitate the exercise of it . No enactment of any new law is necessary ; the very words of our Lord referred to above are law enough , and any addition to it by our enactment is an impertinent usurpation which , in practice , can only be vexatious to the " household of God . " If credible evidence of discipleship is the one only term of admission , then the lack of such credible evidence is the only j ustifiable ground of exclusion . This , rind this only , is the discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to have quite another notion of discipline . With him it is the right to enforce , by exclusion from the supper of the Lord , any constitutions , rules , and laws which a particular church may choose to adopt . This is the church discipline of the sect system , which every sectarian and schismatic church adopts . To our author 's mind sect is not only a system , but the only possible system - The absence of it is anarchy and confusion . Anarchy indeed ! How the moral order of the universe will come to an end , when neither close communion nor any particular mode of applying water in baptism , nor submission to the authority of bishops , nor to the jurisdiction of Presbyterian Church courts , nor subjection of any other laws of man 's enactment over the house of God , can be any longer enforced by church discipline and exclusion from Christian rights and privileges ! No wonder he shrinks away with horror from the prospect , and hastens to take refuge in the admirable " law and order " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these later years , the Church has enjoyed such charming tranquility . How peaceful the Church has been during the last half century ! Our soul hath in remembrance the trial of Dr. Lyman Beecher and Mr. Albert Barnes for heresy , the " Act and Testimony , " the disruption of the Presbyterian Church , the trial and condemnation of Stephen II . Tyng , Jr. , the Cheney case , the disruption of the Protestant Episcopal Church now going on , and many other incidents of our church life , too numerous to mention . No wonder our brother is appalled at the prospect that this blessed tranquility may one day end in the destruction of all church discipline , except what Jesus enjoined in the eighteenth chapter of Matthew . // Are we asked if the Church can make no laws and regulations for herself ? We answer , the regulations which a particular church needs for its own convenience are uot properly laws . They do not form a basis for the exclusion of members . They are in no sense conditions of membership or terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general convenience . They are not matters of conscience , but of taste . A very moderate share of the Christian temper will always suffice for arranging them in a spirit of concession and harmony . And they can rarely , if ever , be the basis of a church division . Difficulties of this sort are in no way relieved , but greatly aggravated , by the presence of the sect system . If in the arrangement of these details , any ill feeling has been occasioned , a permanent rupture of fraternal ties , a removal of church relations to the " church of another denomination , " may be expected . As easy divorce fosters conjugal discontents and alienations , so the facility of rupturing church relations afforded by the proximity of other denominational churches aggravates all tendencies to broils and contentions in the family of Christ . As already intimated , the recognition of the oneness of the Christian brotherhood , which is provided for in the " sect system , " is utterly inadequate to the necessities of the Christian cause , * an ( l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded this subject in a practical and not merely in a theoretical and sentimental light , knows well that the unity which is needed is unity in action , cooperation in Christian work . This is precisely what the sect system renders , for the most part , impossible . However united in formal acts of communion , the practical aspect we present to each other and to the world is one of separation and rivalry , often of antagonism . We do not unite to b nilci so many houses for the worship of God , and of such costliness , as the common cause , in our united judgment , demands , but such and so many as our separation and our mutual rivalries render necessary . These lines are written in a city of about ten thousand people with twenty church edifices , and it is expected the twenty-first will soon be erected . The number of churches we build depends not at all upon the wants // of the common cause , but upon our ideas of denominational necessities . The same necessities of the sect system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simply Christian interests of the community could be better served , in the judgment of all intelligent men , by five pastors than by twenty . The same necessities of sect render it impossible for us to unite in founding colleges and other seminaries of learning , and compel us to fritter away our resources and our personal energies in many feeble and starveling institutions , where a few only are needed , or can be sustained . When sensible , practical men outside of the Church ask us why we commit all this wasteful extravagance and folly , our only answer is , the necessities of sect compel us . The sect system renders it impossible that we should be united in these practical works of patriotism and Christian munificence . This is practical schism-practical sectarianism , and while it remains , it will be the weakness of the Christian cause , and the reproach of the Christian name , however we may seek to throw over it a covering of sentimentalism by our occasional acts of inter-communion . The gospel is not sentimentalism , but love and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitual lives of separation and rivalry . With what fervid enthusiasm have millions of hearts been filled in reading of that ever memorable communion season at the Madison Square Presbyterian Church , during the sessions of the Evangelical Alliance in the fall of 1873 . In the joy inspired by that grand occasion , we could almost believe that the Church had escaped at last from the wilderness , and crossed the Jordan into the Promised Land . But how momentary ! It was only a glimpse of the " gate of the celestial city " from the " Delectable . Mountains . " Those great and good men of many communious only a few hours afterwards left those high places of the Church of God , to return to that wilderness of practical sectarianism from which they had only for a brief hour escaped , there to struggle and toil in weakness and sorrow till God shall call them home . One thing only was wanting to have made that scene perfectly satisfactory to the longings of every devout soul . It was that on that holy mount of realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole Church of // God , into which she should enter and go no more out ; that the oneness of the Christian brotherhood should hereafter be as completely realized in all the details of Christian work and practical beneficence , as in the holy fervors of that reunion of the dispersed tribes of Israel around the cross . No other " communion of saints " can satisfy the longings of Christian hearts , or the exigencies of the Christian cause . Till such a blessed consummation can be realized , such seasons ofjoyful communion will bear no real fruit , except as they revive the hopes and the courage of God 's people , while they are making their journey through this wilderness of spiritual barrenness and drought . The sentimental fellowship of this formal communion can never be any substitute for the practical fellowship of united labor and sacrifice in the cause of the Master . The feeling widely pervading the religious world which gave rise to the Evangelical Alliance is eminently fraternal and Christlike , and the influence exerted by the institution has been powerful and beneficent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the American continent . But the conception of the Church of God which is expressed in its name is yet narrow and inadequate . The perfect manifestation of the oneness of the Christian brotherhood can never be accom* plished by " alliance " between separate and independent powers , , which , because exercising jurisdiction over the same territory and seeking indefinite territorial and numerical enlargements , are rivals to each other . The only true conception of the Church of Christ is not that of many kingdoms in alliance with each other , but still retaining many rival interests , to stimulate - their ambitions and their jealousies ; but one kingdom in harmonious subjection to their one only Lord . Each of the innumerable local assemblies of disciples is a household of God .. They are not rivals to each other , they are not exercising jurisdiction over the same territory , and anxious to extend it , but they are loving helpers of each other 's faith and joy , and all together run up into the General Assembly and Church of the First-born . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , of which Christ is the Head . The Evangelical Alliance has done good in the past and will continue to do good in the future . But it will be only by filling the Christian workt // with such a conception of the peculiar oneness of the Christian brotherhood as will render the whole sect system odious and intolerable . Perhaps we shall be asked if we would go back to the idea of an organic unity of the whole Church ou earth . That is the one fatal error which for so many ages crushed so large a portion of Christendom under the iron heel of the Papacy , and since the IReformation has entailed on Protestantism all the auarchies and confusious of sect . The Church Universal is one ; but its unity has no organic representative but that of the Hierarchy of Heaven , and no Head but Christ . On earth this oueness is purely moral and spiritual , made visible to the world by the external rites of baptism and the Lord 's Supper , and by a common faith and a common aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradicted and its impression nullified by organic arrangements of human devising , which divide the whole multitude of the Lord 's people into rival camps , with rival banners displayed over against each other , and render union in plan and work impossible . Precisely such are the arrangements necessitated by the sect system . They do not represent unity , but are always and everywhere contradictory to it . Mr. Goodenow speaks much and well , towards the close of his Article , of toleration of that in other men and in other churches than our own , from which we dissent , provided it is not inconsistent with a credible confession of Christ before men . He seems to suppose , that in some way we are proposing to set aside this great law of Christian charity . We think that for some reason he misunderstands us and the other brethren whom he criticises . We hold to all which he has said on that subject . But why not carry this beautiful doctrine of Christ back to the place of beginning , and apply it to the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church some of whose principles and practices we disapprove , why not fellowship the members of that church in our own , and thus make the boundary lines which divide the two churches unnecessary and impossible ? Let us again take an example from our Baptist brethren . Many of them do not practice close communion at present , but fellowship churches // which do not practice immersion . Why is it not just as consistent with good conscience and fidelity to Christ to fellowship an unimmersed brother in the same particular church as in the Church Universal ? Why is it not as Christian to forbear with the errors of an individual brother as with the same errors in a whole church ? In principle we can see no difference , while in practical tendencies and results the difference is exceedingly palpable and importaut . If we compel all individuals who hold a given error , as we think it , though not such an error as discredits a profession of Christ , to go out from us , and form a separate organization to represent that error for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can to render that error as lasting as the Church militant If we had begun our toleration in our own church , we should have held the whole question open to candid argument . No partizan passions would have been excited , and the truth would have had a fair chance . After those sect lines are drawn , it never can have a fair chance . The question has been withdrawn from the dominion of argument and given over to the domain of passion . Could the contest about Psalmody in the Scotch churches have lasted till this time , if it had not been made a dividing line between churches of different denominations ? As things are , it is likely to last till the millennium at least . Mr. Goodenow has fallen into the mistake of charging upon those from whom he dissents the design of eliminating from the creeds of our chnrcbes all doctrines from which any Christians dissent . He quotes some one , we know not whom , as saying , " The way to form a church is for the professing Christians in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects . " If he will turn to the sermon before the Boston Council in 1865 , page 50 , he will find the following paragraph : " For myselg I must frankly declare , that , to me , the whole beauty and preciousness of the Congregational system lies in this : that it is a method by which the whole Church of God under heaven may stand in blessed moral unity , on the basis of the gospel , the whole gospel , and nothing but the gospel , divided and distracted by no forms , or cerenionies , or governments which man hath devised . And I think , in such a scene of religious anarchy as that in which I have lived , such a // polity is worthy of being explained , defended , and adhered to till God shall call me hence . " This brother should begin anew ; he should go back and try to understand his brethren before he undertakes to represent to the public those who are quite as competent to represent them - selves as he is to represent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even of arresting the process of dispersion now so rapidly going on , is not , as he represents , in giving up all Christian truth which any body denies , but in so separating that truth of God which is the only basis on which the Church of Christ can rest from all those additions which human ingenuity has devised , that the recognized basis of this Church may be " The gospel , the whole gospel , and nothing but the gospel . " It is not the truth of Christ which divides the Church and multiplies sects , but the inventions of men usurping a place among the laws of Christ . The gospel , the truth of Christ is the only cement which binds the spiritual temple of God together , and we have never yet been left to such a degree of spiritual blindness as to forget or deny this precious truth . Our only hope is and has been to unite men in Christ and not out of him . Our brother speaks of the writer of this Article as " one who has long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " theory of church membership . The quotation marks around the word liberal are his . If by them he means to be understood as quoting the word from us , it is a great injustice . We shall never belong to the self-styled liberal party in religion . Nothing can be liberal but the candid and loving reception of all the truth which God hath revealed . Nothing can be illiberal but the bigoted rejection of revealed truth , or the no less bigoted adherence to falsehood as though it were sacred truth . We have never claimed anything for what we teach , but that in our judgment it is true ; and if it is , then it is liberal enough for us . The wounds of the Church of Christ are not to be healed by disregarding the everlasting distinctions of truth and falsehood in a spirit of false and sickly liberality , but by courageously proving all things , and holding fast that which is good . Why we should be charged with this sickly liberalism , we really can not tell . We advise our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will be more just . // And yet there is nothing in all this inconsistent with our maintaining , as we do , that it is absurd and monstrous to require of every little one in Christ who knocks at the door of his fold , the knowledge and belief of a whole completed system of Christian theology . We must construct all our arrangements for church door-keeping , so as to receive him , though weak in the faith , and nourish him , not with " doubtful disputations , " but with such " milk for babes " as he can digest . Our only question is whether his profession of faith in Christ is credible ; if it is , we must gladly receive him , and not tell him " our church is not meant for such fbeble folk ' as he ; he must go to such a church as is precisely fitted for the nurture of feebleminded children . " If we will persist in requiring at the door of our churches assent to a creed which contains in brief a whole system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who assent to propositions the terms of which they do not understand , simply because the church requires it ; while we shall exclude many who would not only " honor Christ in this particular church " but in any Christian church with which they might unite . We are very sorry that we are not yet quite done with the errors into which this brother falls in attempting to represent those whose views he opposes . He says the writer of this Article writing for the Congregational Qitarterly , Oct. , 1871 , " takes the ground of no church government . " The doctrine of that Article is that the Church is wholly under the invisible and spiritual government of God . Does our author mean to say that the invisible and spiritual government of God over the Church , which has been an article of Christian faith in all ages , is a delusion ? That such a government of God is no government at all ? and that a church only thus governed is " no church " ? If this is his faith , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthodox faith of all ages as best he can . But if he still holds that the government of God over the Church , though invisible and spiritual , is a solemn and blessed reality , and that the Church Universal considered as a perpetual society bound together only by faith in Christ and governed only by the Word and Spirit of God and the love of Christ , is yet the hope of humanity , then let him hasten to // retract his very unjust representations of the Article in the Qitarterly . We would respectfully suggest to the brother , that to teach that the government of God is no government , because it has no human representative , and that a society held together by so mighty a force as the love of Christ , and pervaded by the ever present power of the spirit of God , is no society , because its only Head is Christ , its only laws the laws of God , and its only judiciary the judgment of the great day , is rather a grave matter , and should be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is entered on . We are by no means sorry for the publication of the Article on which we have commented . We think Mr. Goodenow has rer1dered a valuable service to the cause of Christian freedom and unity , by stating thus clearly and definitely the assumptions on which the sect system must rest . We think he has done this accurately and thoroughly . He was qualified to do this by the implicitness of his faith in them and in the superstructure which rests upon them . We think such a statement of principles is very timely , for thousands think the system a necessity of Christian faith and freedom , without ever having thought out its fundamental principles . When they come distinctly to discern them , they are by no means prepared to accept them . We think Pope 's couplet may , with the utmost propriety , be applied to this subject , with the change of only a single word : Sect " is a monster of so frightful mien , As to be dreaded needs but to be seen . " // ARTICLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songht by all systems of minority representation is this : Every vote east at the polls for a member of a law-making assembly should count in every vote taken in that assembly , whether or not the particular person voted for is elected . The object of this Article is to show wherein the five systems hitherto proposed  --  the Proxy , Limited , and Cumulative Yote , the Free List or iRegistered Ballot , and Mr. Hare 's Scheme-fail and must fail to compass this end , and to suggest a sixth system , which seems to promise its accomplishment . First , however , the necessity of some change in our present method must be made clear . We subjoin a few of the proofs of that necessity . About 2,650,000 of the 6,500,000 voters who cast their ballots for members of the Foiky-third Congress have no representatives whatever in that body. * That is , our system practically disfranchises forty out of every hundred men to whom our laws give the snifrage . If we take the votes for Grant and Greeley in November , 1872 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in question , we find that a successful iRepublican candidate required , on an average , 18,076 votes , while a Liberal , to ensure success , had to get 30,474 . That is , our system made one Republican vote worth on c  --  and - three- quarter Liberal votes . The administration received 55.93 per cent . of the popular vote ; the opposition 44.07 per cent . But the respective strengths of the two parties in the Forty-third Congress are 68.15 and 31.85 per cent . That is , our system has added nearly 44 per cent to the just congressional power of the majority . Some interesting tables in Mr. Salem IDutcher 's recent work on minority representation in America , may be condensed into the following : * The figures in this Article , except when referred to other sources , are copied or calculated from the New York Tribune Almanac for 18*3 . The especial figures here quoted are obtained by adding the votes for the defeated candidates for the Forty-third Congress .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
