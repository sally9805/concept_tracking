txt The report of the Bureau of Vital Statistics for the year just closed , of which we have already given our readers a full summary , presents some facts of which it is very important that there should be a more systematic and scientific examination , and as to which we shall venture to offer some suggestions . The diminution of eleven per cent , in the number of deaths as compared with those of the previous year is encouraging . It may be attributed partly to the efforts of the Board of Health and partly to the temperate heat of the last Summer . But accompanying this gratifying statement is another , which , if it were altogether new , would be startling ; we refer to that as to the monstrous disproportion between the deaths of children of foreigners on the one hand , and on the other of those for whom we have no other name than the misleading one , " natives . " Aceording to this report , our losses by premature and preternatural births during the past ; ear , G34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among " natives ; " there being not a , single case reported as having occurred among our foreign population . And we are tad that the losses from the same causes in 1872 were likewise all . without exception , among the " native " population . This in itself , if well established , according to its superficial significance , would be a surprising fact , and one quite unaccountable according to reason and the statistics of obstetric medicine . For it is well known that losses to population  --  they can hardly be called deaths ? from those causes do occur in very considerable numbers in the countries ( Ireland , Germany , and England , ) from which we receive almost the whole of our immigrant or foreign population . Now , is it to be believed that Irish , German , and English women by coming to this country secure an absolute immunity from such accidents , to which they would have been exposed if they had remained at home , while the women who are born here , and who are thus at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these reports , in a very marked degree ? Such a conclusion implies so extraordinary and abnormal a physical change that it can not be admitted , except as the result of the minute:A- and most thoroughlysifted scientific investigation . Again , we are told in this report that of the deaths by eleven diseases to which children are chiefly liable  --  whooping-cough , croup , inanition , scarlatina , diphtheria , diarrhea , meningitis , convulsions , measles , hydrocephalus , and marasmus , a little more than ninety per cent . are of those styled " natives . " Here is another statement equally alarming and extraordinary . For as the deaths of children under five years of age are about one-half of those recorded upon our bills of mortality , and ae our foreign population is about as four to five of the native , if these statements be true in their seeming significance , the native population of the City of New-York must be recruited ( outside of the immigration from abroad and from other parts of the Union ) almost altogether by the children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to adolescent years must bear a very small proportion to those which are the offspring of foreigners . Add to this the alleged fact that the losses by premature and preternatural births are all , without a single exception , among the native population , and the inference is unavoidable that , what with immigration and healthy productiveness on one side , and failure in productiveness , or the production of children doomed to early death , on the other , we must ere long be , in the main , a community of foreigners and the children of foreigners . But , again , before we admit this conclusion , there must be further investigation and comparison . We must consider the proportion of deaths by the diseases in question in the countries from which our immigrants come , and compare it with the alleged proportion of deaths by those diseases among our foreign population ; and if the former is much the larger , as without a doubt it is , we shall be driven to the conclusion either that emigration to this country is a protection against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason  --  or that there is some fallacy concealed in the apparently inevitable inference from the facts presented in this department of our vital statistics . This apparent dilemma , however , we believe is one that does not really exist ; and we suspect that while our Bureau of Vital Statistics is singularly trustworthy , and the facts which it professes to give are to be relied upon in their minutest details , the dreadful conclusions upon this point which seem inevitaide from its reports would bo much modified , if not almost done away , by carrying the investigations as to nativity one step further than they are carried at present , Our " native " population is , of course , that which is composed or persons born in this ' country . If an immigrant and his wife arrive here with one child . the three in all statistical records must appear as of foreign birth ; but the half dozen other children which may , and probably will , be born to the same pair , must . appear on the same record as " natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have migrated to this emu-. try marry and . have children , the father and mother are foreigners , while their children are natives . To the public officer the case on this point is closed when to the inquiry put as to the place of birth the reply is " the United States . " And yet , manifestly , the children in the cases that we have supposed are in no way fair repre7 sentative examples of the effects of the - climate and the mode of life in this country upon the vital and reproductive forces . What that effect is in the long run , yet remains to be clearly established , and an examination of the vital records of families who have been for some generations  --  at least three  --  of American birth and breeding , will , we suspect , upset some of the conclusions which have been rather too hastily adopted on that point . Such an examination at least is obviously necessary to the formation of a sound scientific opinion upon this important subject . On the other hand , we venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign parents , in the first generation , are , in a very considerable proportion , strangely deficient in that vital force which it would seem that they should inherit . This observation , however , applies chiefly to such children born and brought up in our large cities , and again , chiefly to those of Irish blood . It will be found , upon investigation , that the children of Irish pareuts , born and bred in our cities , are not only lacking , in a very marked degree , in the robustness and vitality which the Irish man and woman seem to possess when they land here , but that , as a rule , they are much inferior iu those respects to the children of families which have been " native " for some generations . Of the causes of this sudden lapse of vitality , it . is not our present purpose to inquire . But here , we suggest  --  and only suggest  --  is the key to the mystery and the anomaly set forth in the first part of our article . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose limited powers of reproduction and lack of vital force our statistics present so lamentable a picture , a very large proportion are hi no proper sense representatives of the effect of American birth and breeding . They are the children of Irish emigrants , born and brought up ender very different circumstances from those in which their parents acquired their bloom and vigor . If the officers of the Bureau of Vital Statistics , and the physicians who furnish most of the facts which the reports of that bureau embody , will push their inquiries as to the nativity of their " eases " one step farther than they have done heretofore , it is at least not improbable that the word " native " in those reports will lose some of its dreadful significance , and that the monstrous and anomalous disproportion of losses by premature birth and the diseases of children on the " native " side will be seen no longer to threaten us with an extinction of the real American stock , even in our great cities .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
