txt Apart from the interest felt in the fate of Mr. A. H. STEPHENS , the contest in which he is engaged derives significance from its bearing upon the question of independence in Southern politics . Mr. STEPHENS , perhaps , is not the man to test this question fairly , because of the peculiar personal strength of his position . The ties that bind him to his constituency and they to him are rarely found in election controversies . If , with these to help him , he succeed in the effort to obtain a re-election , in spite of the opposition of Democratic managers , the circumstance must not be regarded as proof of what independence might be expected to achieve on a large scale . On the other hand , if the command of exceptional advantages , including the active support of influential and devoted friends , does not enable him to overcome the opposition of the party " machine , " only one inference will be possible . It will be quite clear that so far as Georgia exemplifies the South , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be broken with impunity . The insolence of party management , where it exists unchecked by the operations of a reasonably strong opposition , could not be more strikingly displayed than in the proposal to set Mr. STEPHENS aside , and practically to read him out of the Democracy , for no other reason than that he dared to dissent from the decree of the caucus in the matter of the Potter resolution . There is no pretense that Mr. STEPHENS has abandoned the principles of his party , or entertains any feeling toward the Administration which is not shared by Senators HILL , GORDON , LAMAR , and by other Democrats not less conspicuous . Try him by any of the received tests of partisan orthodoxy , one only excepted , ' and no trace of heresy can be found . Ho is sound on the fraud question as applied to Mr. HAYES ' election . There were " huge , enormous , hideous frauds , " he declares , in connection with that event . His reverence for the Jeffersonian dogmas is about equal to his faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he does not regard the Democratic Party as of Divine origin , and its mission as supplementary to that of the Apostles . To round off his character and render his Democracy perfect , he is an advocate of subsidies , from that of the Texas Pacific downward . In truth , his purity and greatness shine with a strange and suggestive glory in his reminiscences of labor with the appropriation committees during the recent session . Did he not , as he reminds his audience , obtain a promise of $100,000 for the Augusta Post Office ? and if a large sum be spent in vain endeavors to improve the Savannah River , to him belongs the honor of having got the.appropriation without which the waste etiuld not happen . Altogether , it would be difficult to find a ** who upon these points more completely meets the requirements of the Democratic inquisition . Yet he is proscribed in obedience to orders from head-quarters . He has a crotchet which the caucus will not tolerate . And a lot of brawling , bigoted Georgians , following the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout him dowv , and to substitute for him a piece , of human putty , bearing the party image and superscription , and warranted not to prove troublesome on any occasion . The single sin which may cost Mr. STEPHENS his seat is his refusal to recognize the right of a party caucus to overrule the judgment of individual members of the party . Upon this subject his views coincide with those many times expressed by inan , whose brains and.renutations nave to Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . F the Democratic Party nearly all the respectability it possesses . " The idea that a caucus was to control his vote , " he said the other night at Augusta , " he never would entertain . A caucus was merely for consultation . To bind its members by a rope and force them to vote as the caucus dictated , was the worst sort of Ja.cobinism . " Every word of this is true . Whether the caucus be Republican or Democratic , . its usefulness is consultative ; as an agency for binding men to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is intolerable , and the oftener its mandates are disregarded the better . Mr. STEPHENS did disregard the action of the caucus which enabled a little knot of extremists , with Mr. POTTER at their head , to force through the House the one-sided resolution which indicates the scope of the investigation now going ' on . He wanted the resolution amended in two ways , ? first , to disavow an intention to assail Mr. HAYES ' title , and , next , to so enlarge the range of the inquiry as to embrace all allegations of fraud , irrespective of partisanship . The Democratic hooting which silenced Mr. STEPHENS and drove him from the House would seem to have been punishment enough . It was a lesson which party men having less force of character are not likely to forget . The caucus power , however , demands a more signal vindication of its supremacy . Mr. STEPHENS must repent in sackcloth and ashes or a renomination will be denied him , notwithstanding the fact that the Democratic Representatives who would have muzzled Mr. STEPHENS as a mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Burehard resolution , affirming what he in .. the first instance desired to propose . We do not adduce Mr. STEPHENS as the model of an independent candidate . The concessions he makes to the party whose arrogance and greed render it a curse to the South detract from the significance of his canvass . He is not the leader of a revolt that will satisfactorily test the relative strength of moderation and ultraism within the party , and form the nucleus of a movement that would be fraught with benefit to both South and North . Come it must some day , and the wisest course for Republicans in a State like Georgia is to watch for it , work for it , and at the proper time help it by all the means in their power . There are liberal men in all the Southern States who chafe under the bitter dictation of the local Democratic leaders , who are tired of the sectionalism which is the stock-in-trade of demagogues , and wait for the opportunity when au independent spirit may be cultivated with some hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States will have much to do with hastening or hindering the growth of that undercurrent of opinion which will separate the Conservatives , and the friends of conciliation generally , from the violent partisans who are clamoring for the sacrifice of Mr. STEPHENS as testimony to their right to rule . Results are wanted , ? not the multiplication of proofs of a zeal that irritates and a policy that brings nothing but defeat .
