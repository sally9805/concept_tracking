txt One of the Western journals which is opposing the silver craze with a groat deal of vigor recently argued that if Congress should pass a law authorizing the unlimited issue of silver legal-tender dollars , the debtors who are now crying out for such a measure would not be any better off for its passage . It stated what was true , as far as it went , that the first effect of the law would be to permit the silver-mine owners  --  the shareholders and active managers in that informal but powerful association , the Silver Ring  --  to send their silver to the mint and get it coined . When it came from the mint it would be legal tender for its face value , and would be used as such by the Ring , who would for the time being ab sorb all the profit from the transaction . Of course , this could not last long , for as soon as the coin became so plentiful that the supply exceeded the demand it would fall in actual value , and would go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper legal-tender dollars did whop they were used in excessive amounts . But the Silver Ring soo this phase of the question also . They are shrewd calculators , and they understand that it is necessary to make a positive and effective demand for their product if they expect to handle it with profit . It is with this view that they have undertaken to spread the doctrine that the bonds , of all kinds , of the United States , are payable , principal and interest , in silver , at the option of the Government , and that all that is necessary is to get authority from Congress to issue the coin . The famous resolution of 1869 , for the protection of the public faith , declared the bonds payable in coin . The funding laws , as they are called , or , more accurately speaking , tile laws providing for the refunding of the six per cont. bonds , used the same term , " coin , " in designating in what the now bonds , principal and interest , should be payable , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most serious facts in connection with the movement for depreciating the currency and discrediting the public faith , that the conditions we have named exist , and that all the silver party has to accomplish is a removal of the interdict upon coinage contained in the act of February , 1873 . If they can attain this they will have got nearly all they seek . Certainly , they will have got enough to endanger the public credit , to further confuse the business situation , and to make resumption a delusion and a snare . But we do not think that they intend to stop at this point . We have reason to Alley ? that they aim at still other ends , which , it ' we are not greatly mistaken , will be pushed with great energy , and the mere pursuit of which will be a grave misfortune for the country . The chief . of those is the authorization of au indefinite issue of legal-tender notes payable in silver . The plan has not yet taken shape sufficiently to enable us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if tho Secretary of the Treasury continues in good faith his preparations for resumption at the close of next year , as we have no doubt thatlme will , the silver men will seize every occasion to embarrass the Government in obtaining the legal-tender notes necessary for the constant expenditures of the Government . If ho undertakes to accumulate the gold which he receives in exchange for that portion of the new loan devoted to resumption purposes , the immediate consequence will probably be to decrease the difference between gold and paper , and this effect will be aggravated in every possible manner by those whose interest it is to create an artificial demand for currency . Nor will the means be lacking . A half dozen national banks , out of the 2,000 , if they fell under the control of unscrupulous persons , could , by the continued process of takingout currency and withdrawing it , very strongly indiums the demand for legal tenders , since , by the letter of the law , every time they took out a million of notes they would compel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law could check this movement until the limit of $300,000,000 was reached . Under the influence of the feeling which such a state or things would produce throughout the country , the silver party would move for a new issue of legal tenders payable in silver . We call attention to this , not as necessarily the course which the silver moll will take , nor as the only one which is open to them , but as one which there is every reason to think would be feasible for them , and would tend to accomplish their ends . What we desire to emphasize is that one of the purposes which the Silver Ring keeps in sight , and one which it will do everything that it can to bring about , is the complete identification of silver with the currency of the country by not only making it a legal tender for all debts , including the demand notes of the Government , but by increasing the issue of these notes , with the distinct understanding that they shall be payable in silver . Ultimately , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is temporarily successful , because there is absolutely no safety or prosperity for the country except in a currency recognized by all commercial countries . Through whatever trials and difficulties we may pass , it is to this that we must come at last . But meanwhile every movement in ally other direction only adds to the confusion and danger by Which business is at present surrounded .
