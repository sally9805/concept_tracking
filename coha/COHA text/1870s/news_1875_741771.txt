txt To-day will either see a new " Boss " firmly established in New-York , or will witness the utter defeat of the system which periodically throws New-York into its present state of confusion . The merits of the controversy must by this time be familiar to all our readers . ' They have seen for themselves the result of handing over all power to Tammany Hall . They are not asked to subject themselves to a new and untried experiment . When the citizens of this community relinquish everything into the hands of an autocracy , they know that misgovernment and wholesale robbery will be the result . They remember how they were plundered by the old Tammany Ring  --  and they must be aware that under the new one they would fare no better . It would require years of labor to destroy the power which seeks to obtain the popular suffrages to-day . The wisest and safest course is to destroy it at once , and this can only be done by every decent citizen going to the polls this mornings : , and voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks past been recommending to them . ? There is not a man on this ticket who is not thoroughly worthy of public confidence . The loss of Recorder HacKErr and District Attorney PHIMPS would be a very serious one to the City .. Every othtr candidate on the ticket has been subjected to searching criticism , and nothing can be found against one of them . The Surrogate 's office is a prize much coveted by . Tammany Hall , and it ought never to be allowed to fall into its hands . Mr. VAN SCHAICK , our candidate for that position , is admitted to be more familiar with its duties and responsibilities than any man in the City . For City Judge we offer the people a thoroughly honest and capable man in Col. GILDERSLEEVE , while JOHN KELLY would force upon them a Judge whose only claim to consideration is that ho subscribed $500 toward the Tweed statue . Our candidates for the Marine Court , the Superior Court , and the Common Pleas are also men against whom even Tammany has not been able to trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our duty if we did not strongly recommend the people to vote for them all . Wherever the Republicans have made a nomination for the A seinbly or Senate we believe it to LO a wood qne . In some localities  --  as in the Fourth Senatorial District  --  the contest is being fought out between two Democrats . JO1IN MORRISSEY has been put up by the Anti-Tammany party , and JOHN Fox by KELLY and Tammany Hall . The Republicans have made no nomination , for as a party they have little power in that district . But it is generally conceded that at least JOHN Fox ought never again to be entitled to raise his voice anywhere as a representative of the people of New-York . Our State ticket has passed through this bitter canvass absolutely unchallenged . It is not pretended that either Mr. FREDERICK SEWARD or Gen. SPINNER Would be less energetic in prosecuting the canal thieves than JOHN BIGELOW , who made use of the the press for abetting the gold panic of 1809 , or than Luctus RCRINSON . The most abject of KELLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better man before the people to-dily:thIM FREDERICK SEwAnn . We hope , therefore , that our readers will have no hesitation a in voting the State ticket as it stands . About that , as about the County ticket , there can be no room for doubt . The only thing we have to ask is that every man who is entitled to vote will go to the polls this morning and deposit . his ballots for both State and County tickets as they appear in our columns this morning . The Tammany journals have sought to create the impression that there will be disorder at the polls . Of this , however , there is not the slightest probability . The Police will be everywhere represented in full force , and Superintendent WALLING may be thoroughly trusted to preserve order . He is a most energetic and efficient officer , and he will recognize no distinction of polities in the discharge of his duty . Even in 1871 , when a powerful Ringwas being broken to pieces , there was no attempt at violence . There is far less probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt , have a peaceable election , and it is not too much to say that the result of it will depend . largely with our own readers . We have at least 10,000 regular subscribers who do not make a rule of voting at City elections . We earnestly entreat them to come forward this year and break down the organization of freebooters which is known under the general name of Tammany Hall . Let them decide the election early in the day . They can do it without the slightest risk or trouble , and they certainly never have cause to repent of their action . But if they allow JOHN KELLY and his crew to gain the mastery , they can expect no other consequences than a eonstant and rapid depreciation of their property , the subversion of justice , and the beginning of another era of profligate government and unlimited oppression . Such is the simple issue before the people . We leave it in their hands without the shadow of a misgiving .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
