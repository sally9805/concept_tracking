txt It is not many months since the world was enlightened as to the aims and prospects of the " Dawn Valcour Community . " Glowing accounts were published of a fertile island iu the middle of Lake Champlain ; and it was announced that this " earthly paradise " had been generously transferred to a community of persons whose advanced . ideas of social reform would render them free from all the ills and embarrassments which more worldly society is heir to . " Valcour " was represented as worth an immense sum , and deluded enthusiasts in all parts of the country were led to believe that an investment in the island Arcadia was not only an imperative duty which they owed their souls , but a speculation which would result in increasing their fortunes . People who , after years of toil and privation , had succeeded in founding small homes in the West , sold them at great sacrifices , and hurried to the communistic estate , freely giving their small savings for the support of the new enterprise . Many persons who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who had a vague idea that a charming existence , free from dull toil , and full of leisure for reveries and experiments , might be paseLed in the colony , came forward with alacrity and ready money . The island , upon examination , did not prove to be quite so enchanting or flowery as the more enthusiastic had fancied it ; but it did not occur to any of the settlers that the whole affair was a swindle until they found themselves likely to be sold out to a mortgagee in the Spring , and turned adrift penniless . Winter showed them that the island was a desolate and dreary place , where it would be impossible to be happy under any circumstances ; and they finally discovered that the supposed philanthropist , who was said to have generously given them Valcour Island , was nothing more than a clever speculator , who expected to get possession of their money , and who would remorselessly sacrifice them the moment that the enterprise did not pay to his satisfaction . The swindled enthusiasts have had the courage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community " transaction as a " stupendous fraud . " But that does not give them back their homes and fortunes , madly sacrificed in pursuit of an absurd ideal . The natives around Valcour think it astonishing that any one should have been so willfully blind as not to find out that the project was a swindle , since those who organized it were publicly known as tricksters . When the madness was on the new-comers , however , it was of no use to offer them advice . Now they have to begin the world anew ; and the speculators who originated the Valcour swindle will probably have many ruined lives to answer for . A great many innocent yolk , in their search after the " ideal life , " come to their senses much later and get scorched more severely than the settlers at Valcour . The " Peculiar People " in England furnish an instance in point . These " Peculiar " ones were evicted from their singularly-constituted community by a legal process , whereupon , from that time , some months since , until now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have now and then taken . shelter in barns offered them by pitying neighbors . They fancy that the profane agencies which dared to meddle with their community will be compelled by Divine interposition to do penance for it by re-establishing everything as it was . Some of them show signs of discouragement , and hint that unless the expected supernatural interference comes soon , they shall return to the homes and trades which they once solemnly abjured forever ; but the majority are as fanatical as the East Indian dervishes , who persist in holding up their right arms for ten years at a time . The passion for some strange and new social life  --  something utterly at variance with everything experienced before , and free from the usual restraints , is one of the most singular of the abnormal developments of the human mind . This passion takes a firm hold of thousands of people who are healthy , prosperous , seemingly happy , and who would never be suspected of sentimentalism . They have no occasion to hate society as ordinarily regulated , nor to fly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives within its bounds . They are not actuated by any contempt for political tyranny , or by anything save morbid imaginings and desires which are not definitely expressed in their own minds , and which , in many cases , need only careful and insidious prompting to break out into license and . abomination . They are always on the lookout for an apostle , or a leader , in the service of some new hair-brained scheme for rendering life more delightful , and they fall an easy prey to impostors . For those who owe the facility with which they are deceived to their ignorance , all honest people have a profound pity ; but as to the conduct of those who lose their homes and fortunes in unsuccessful endeavors to found communities because they hope to make them nurseries of social disorganization , there can be but one verdict ? " Served them right ! " It is to be hoped that there are none of the latter class among the duped settlers at Valcour.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
