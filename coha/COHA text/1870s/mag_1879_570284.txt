ARTiCLE IV. - THE FORMAL AND THE VITAL IN THE BIBLE . THE object of this Article is to furnish a contribution towards a review of the Scriptures which shall be a common ground on which those who accept the results of sound advanced criticism and those who wish to retain the whole Bible in their confidence may stand . From the necessity of the case , if there was to be a revelation from God to man in a book , and if that revelation is in the Bible , there must be in the Bible an ideal , authoritative , vital element , and a structural , formal element . Tf in any proper sense the book had a supernatural origin , the Divine Author , in bringing it into being , must have caused his agency to enter as really into the structural element as into the vital ; as the care of a painter is as really directed to the means by which he expresses his idea as to the idea itself . But now that the book has been long written and passed among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , it becomes an important question to discriminate between the two elements . It is the want of this discrimination which leads to not a little mistake and confusion . Many look on the Bible as a crystallized whole , solid , inflexible , all its parts and elements inseparable in authority and claims , and not rather as a spiritual power , a divine message , made up of principles , truths , duties , vital facts and forces , lodged in a structural , formal support . Its enemies , by this misapprehension , assuming that all its parts are equally authoritative and valuable , or equally worthless , and finding that some things in it are obviously not pertinent to our times , pronounce it all outgrown , and have no faith in ih If they realized that the formal parts , even the portions now apparently obsolete , existed necessarily at first for the purpose of putting the vital part into the world of thought and action , and may be necessary now for the purpose of retaining it there , and that , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can not have that without having that on which it rests , also , most of their objections would cease . In like // manner , a class of semi-believers in Scripture , not understanding the interdependent relations of the formal and the vital elements , are led to treat the volume with disparagement . They go through it as an expert through a collection of brilliants , saying nothing of the diamonds but decrying the less valuable stones as paste . They adopt a harsh tone towards the book , as if it were guilty of practicing deception and making an unnatural alliance between the good and the bad , and needed to be thoroughly exposed . So they ruthlessly attempt to tear asunder the two parts , accept the one , and reject the other . If they took a deeper and juster view , they would see that the two parts are structurally and necessarily interwoven , and that a book revelation could not be made or perpetuated without such a union . And the friends of the Bible , not consciously recognizing the two elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bewildered , sometimes trying to give to the one the importance and faith due only to the other , and sometimes questioning if even the ideal and vital element may not , after all , be more or less struck with the imperfection and weakness of the more unimportant things associated with it . If they understood the natllre of revelation , and how the supernatural things in it rest necessarily on a basis of common human things , while these common human things by this use are taken up into a divine service and become sacred , they would be saved from much anxious thought and perplexity . Thus , the sooner we come up out of the bewildering notion that the Bible in all its aspects is equally full of divine meaning and authoritative to us , the better it will be for all parties ; and the sooner we apprehend that the formal and structural and seemingly transient elements were all necessary in bringing the vital part into efiective use and retaining it there , the better also . All parties need to grasp the fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , a spiritual , ever-living Bible in the visible , tangible , outward Bible ,  --  and both of God ,  --  the one as really as the other , though in different senses and with different uses . In both God 's thought is passed into the human mould ,  --  he using the spirit , conceptions , and inspirational faculty of man , in putting the inner Bible in the human intelligence , in the first place , and then using human // language , human facts and personality , in giving the inner Bible form , and so shaping the outer Bible . The former , the ideal parts , however , were no more truly chosen by him than the latter , the formal , by which they were expressed . In every portion of Scripture from Genesis to Revelation , we find timemarks , race-marks , human personality-marks , betraying its human relationship ; but none the less there are God-marks there also , showing that in both elements , the formal and the vital , it is the Book of God . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to put it in a living union with man at the time . His thought seemed to lay itself down on an elect mind , here and there , now and then , during the inspirational ages , grasp it , qualify it , co-work with it , enter into vital oneness with it ; and so these two agencies , the divine and the human , took together the desired step in advance in giving that section of revelation to mankind . Thus man is in the inner and outer Bible ; God also is there , from center to circumference . Dual as the book is in its nature , its duality is not mechanical but vital , like that of other vital things . The two portions are not joined together like dead branches and a living tree , but more as soul and body . You can not travel through it , and mechanically toss asunder the two interblended elements , any more than you can pass through it and say these portions are put here by inspiration and those without it . We like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having been present and active when all the parts , all the sentences and words , too , if you please , were born into the record , - God 's and man 's ,  --  in dynamic union , each in its freedom and integrity , neither overlaid and crushed nor crowded out by the other . So , in the blending of the formal and the vital in Scripture , each in a sense rests on the other , yet neither overcrowds the other , and neither can be spared from the other . They hold each other up , and so constitute the indivisible and *mperishable Word to mankind - the letter and the spirit . Such is the intimacy of the union in the one creative work that the problem of their exact demarcation , analytically and critically , is one of great delicacy and difficulty , perhaps never to be fully solved ,  --  needful as it is to recognize the distinction in thought , and hold the book on this basis theoretically . // This difficulty is greatly increased by the fact that God had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later portions , a double object ,  --  to give mankind religious instruction suitable to their wants at the time , and prepare their successors for higher instruction . He was sighting at the same moment the existing good and the future education of the race . He blended ends and means . He was giving man a revelation and getting him ready to receive a revelation . And these two processes went on simultaneously . The Bible , in form , in one view of it , may be regarded as a record of the educational system God adopted for the religious instruction of the race , beginning at the alphabet and going on to the end of the course , embracing the temporary illustrations and applications and rough sketches adapted to rude learners , as well as the interblended or supplementary principles , ideas , and fundamental facts , designed for permanent use . Of course , it can be no easy matter to feel out and detect the permanent thus running in a sliding scale for many centuries through such an educational course , to disentangle the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible out of the Bible . Indeed , this never can be perfectly done ; and though it is important to have the conception and to hold and defend Scripture on this basis , it is doubtful whether , for educational and moral reasons , its author would ever have it actually done . But while , from the nature of the case , the boundaries of these two elements are subtle and evasive , there is something in experience that points , in a general way , to the reality of this distinction . A large part of the living truths of the word seem to have a special fitness for the conscience , moral nature , and spirit of man , so that when welcomed and practiced they maintain their position in the faith by a self-evidencing light and authority . The vital in them and the vital in the soul recognize each other , in the act of spiritual experience , as if they were old acquaintances , and the two consent together in a divine wedlock . The living things from above have come to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the will of God know of the doctrine . They inwardly test it , measure it , feel it , and know it to be of God . Thus in experience the soul recognizes portions of the higher elements of // Scripture-as many as it comes in actual spiritual contact with and can appropriate ,  --  and holds them ; as quicksilver agitated among crushed ore seeks out the particles of gold , seizes and holds them , till the limit of its capacity is reached or there is no more gold accessible . The formal , on the other hand , finds no such inward recognition . It remains something outside and foreign . It may be a support around which spiritual experience crystallizes ; it is not a part of it . It may furnish the arena of the race , not the elements which enter into the spirit and mettle of the race itself . The soul can not test the formal by its own powers and know it to be true or divine , or feel , if it were varied , it would itself suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unconsciously feeling out portions of these distinctive elements , the formal and the vital , and finding in the mass of Scripture the inlaid divine meanings specially adapted to them . They are ever seeking , under the guidance of the IDivine Spirit , portions of the living waters needed by their souls , and are not content to linger at channels of revelation whose streams have dried up or whose waters are not now suited to their needs . This does not imply that some of the overlooked or neglected portions may not be equally significant in themselves or precious to others . By no means ; but it shows that spiritual instincts lead them , the mcment they begin to read and welcome Scripture , to discriminate between the portions which enter into their experience and become a part of it , and those which remain outside . In like manner , the Church , acting on a larger scale and taking a broader survey , is ever feeling out , under the guidance of the Spirit , the special living truths , most needful for it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life crystallizes . It goes through the book , and leaves it with illuminated and unilluminated portions , just as it has an eye to see and a heart to feel the divine message . In different ages the volume lights up differently under its gaze and use . But it may require all the different ages , all the varied circumstances , conditions , and wants of the centuries , for the Church to slowly spell out all the vital meanings in the book . How absurd , then , for an individual to make his spiritual consciousness the test of all of it ! individual // experience only points in the direction of the truth for which we plead , it does not exhanst it . How foolish for any class of Christians to presnme on recognizing all of it ! Their aggregated experience only goes a little farther . How foreign from the fact to suppose that even the whole Chnrch of Christ in any one age can have an experience broad enough and deep enongh to compass all the truth of revelation ! We must look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtake and use all the vital things stored away in the wondrous volume , capable of the test of experience . Now this nnconscious process , which goes on in the experience of individual Christians and of the Chnrch , points to the deeper and more real and extended distinction between the formal and the vital , which exists in the very substance of the book itself . This does not depend on personal or ecclesiastical moods or wants , or on localities , circumstances , or ages . It enters into the very nature and structure of the word . It places on the side of the vital all the principles , trnths , facts , instructions , requirements , and warnings , which are intended to abide through the Christian ages , whether they are all in any one age consciously felt out and welcomed , or not , or whether they are all ever grasped in experience , or not , and which are packed away in the word for the furnishing of the Church in the different exigencies of its history . Some of these may remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied by a master mind with tools and articles for any emergency in the voyage , the use of some of which may not be known to those on board till the occasion arises when they are needed and are brought ont . On the side of the formal it classes those elements which are simply structnral , and those parts which , after the completion of the canon , fall into subordinate and relatively unimportant positions , and are valuable rather for their relation to the other parts than their own sake . But the two are blended in a living inseparable union . The vital has grown np into the formal , and brings out its bloom and fruit from it ; and the formal upholds and embodies the vital . The formal is for the sake of the vital , and the vital touches , hallows , glorifies , the formal . The Bible , made up of the two , is thns a vital whole  --  a creation of divine genius , in // which it is impossible to draw out the soul and have it live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of worthless matter-as impossible as to tear asunder a statue and separate the idea from the marble , and yet retain the idea as an expressed fact . Both perish from the world of reality by the reckless attempt . After this general survey of the two elements of revelation , - their necessity , nature , and interrelation ,  --  let us now approach them more closely , as we find them side by side or blended , in the Bible . Of course , as already stated , we do not expect to reach positive and final results . We do not expect to untwist the threads of light and shade which God has woven together , and place each color by itself . All we hope to do is to point in a general way to the direction in which they may be found and distinguished . And this we deem necessary , in order that the Scriptures may not be undervalued , on the one hand , by those who think that if they are of supernatural origin no apparently imperfect or unimportant matters shall have place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by those who encumber their faith by overtaxing and misdirecting it in trying to honor equally all their contents . Looking at the formal and beginning at the exterior of this , we find that human langua*ye itself , employed by the sacred writers , falls into this class . The words as words are not the revelation or the message . They are human ; that floats around them , lies back of them , and comes out into them only more or less imperfectly . Christ says : " The words that I speak unto you , they are spirit and they are life . " Back of the poor human words he was compelled to use was a wreath of spiritual truth and life which could only imperfectly be expressed in them , and he points to that as the real aim of his utterance . So human language in the Bible is extraneous to the ideas which God caused to be lodged in it for man 's use , and is itself a part of the structural element . Little significance , also , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted . No spiritual importance lies in the fact that particular writers used words of Hebrew , Greek , Latin , Chaldaic , Aramaic , or Persian ; or wrote // in prose or poetry ; or used parable , simile , apostrophe , assertion , interrogation , alliteration , or acrostic ; or indulged , occasionally , in playfulness , irony , or sarcasm . All this belongs to the costume , and not to the vitalities ; and yet this or similar costume is necessary for the vitalities . We find , also , more or less of the formal in the common modes of speech and thought on common suh*ects , which the sacred writers adopted from those around them . There must always be something assumed as a basis of instruction , intellectual tools to work with . A teacher finding these tools , language and popular conceptions on ordinary subjects , will not stop to create new ones , but will adopt those at hand , as far as consistent with his object , and go right on with his special instructions . Inspired men stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters , and use the popular conceptions of their age on common subjects as the only tools they have to work with for their special object . These conceptions , right or wrong , belong to the formal part of revelation ; and no importance is to be attached to them . Assumed from the necessities of the higher instruction , they are no more a vital part of the authoritative revelation to us , than the kind of writing materials that were used by them in doing the work . If a sculptor had poor tools to work with , and he left them scattered about the statue he had carved , we should not think of criticising the statue or his workmanship , if in other respects it was good , for the imperfection of the tools . A writer employed in giving a revelation must leave his tools-his language and the popular conceptions he is compelled to use-in his work ; but if he selects the best of his country and age , the creation , which rises in beauty and grandeur about them , ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear in mind the distinction between these two elements of Scripture , moreover , when we come to side-thoughts , 8ulsidiary expressions , quotations . There is a sense in which these are a part of the vital word ; but taken out of their connection , interpreted absolutely , and not in harmony with the main thought of the writer in giving them , they are certain to lead astray . In literal aspect they are formal . We must look beyond that to find their significance . They must be put in // their setting , to have them give light . The sentences of the Bible are not made to be torn out of place , and held up separately as a light for mankind . The permanent , coniplete , divine thing , when we get it , in any part of the word of God , is the blended light , the resultant light , that comes from the consensus of the whole connected passage ; nay , more , the agreeing light of all the related passages that should enter into its interpretation , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much of this element , further , in the hi8torical record8 . Of course , there are in the sacred history , both national and individual , great living principles , permanent lessons , revelations of God 's methods , gleams of the divine government ; and there are vital central facts designed to enter into human faith and control it through all the ages . Bnt enclosing these are portions of narrative , essential to the existence of a historical revelation-i. e. , a revelation interblended with the historical development of a people-which are not freighted with special meaning for mankind . They are a part of the framework on which the higher truth rests . Hence in the use of these portions of Scripture we instinctively distinguish between what is merely frame-work and the higher truth , and seek to have the latter stand out in the record to our faith . This we may appropriate , and it will be our help . Yet we must not despise that which is merely frame-work ; for that is necessary , is there by the will of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction , it will not trouble us if we find that , in the blending of the two forces  --  the divine and the human-which make up the narrative , the formal part is tinged , now and then , with the predominance of the human factor , even to the extent , sometimes , of possible imperfections of statement . The stains in such cases , if stains there be , are found in the drapery , not in the body , of revelation , or if even on the body , not on the soul . They do not touch the part intended to be a permanent light to men , and to shape the living faith of the world . They are not spots on the sun , but spots on the observatory supporting the glass , by means of which we see the sun . There are , besides , instructions , designed and applied to conditions // of society and life no longer existing , which are now obsolete . They are a part of the great record of the religious training of the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called them forth are entirely changed . The instructions , accordingly , retire , henceforth , to a subordinate place . Among these may be placed the requirements relating to the rites and ceremonial of the temple service under the old economy ; the special directions to the Jews for the treatment of particular cities , tribes , and individuals , for reasons and under circumstances peculiar and never to recur ; the requirements of Judaism , as distinct from Christianity , which ceased with the changed condition of the world when Christianity came in ; and even certain rules given by Christ and the Apostles , growing out of social conditions existing in their day but existing no longer ,  --  as those relating to washing the disciples ' feet , and where slavery no longer exists , the duties of masters and slaves to one another . These instructions , having their whole force in the peculiar circumstances which called them forth , and which can never recur , now drop down to a secondary plane . If we still find , back of them , as we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or warning , or wisdom , or hints in relation to God 's educational methods , that is another matter ; and their value in these respects must be fully recognized . But the instructions themselves in their direct use have faded with their opportunity , like the directions of the head of a fire department to those under him when the fire is put out . Yet while these are now , compared with their original use , retired Scriptures , they are still monumental Scriptures ,  --  monumental of a former vitality ; and we can not spare them from the book as in their time a necessary part of the training of the race . Again , there is another portion of the Bible containing adaptations of truth and duty to the race when on a lower moral plane , which the world has since outgrown , that falls into this class . To understand this , we must remember that there are in the divine teachings , especially in the earlier portions , traces of two great distinct moral systems , not so much different in kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal morality , gleaming out here and there all through the Bible , // even in the Old Testament , and revealing the absolute requirement , the perfect law ; the other an educational system adapted to the practical wants of men at the time , expressing the best moral regimen for that day , and designed to prepare the way for a higher every-day standard . The one is like the rays and flashes of sunlight which might here and there find their way through cracks and fissures into the dark abode of the cave dwellers before they came up into the regions of day ; the other like the smoking and flickering light of the fagots and lamps which , meanwhile , might admirably serve their turn till they had worked their way out or were prepared for something better . The ideal morality , wherever we find it , is , of course , a part of the perennial light ; but the educational morality , taking its tone from the moral culture of those on whom it was enjoined as the regulative precept , is liable to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place at a later age to a higher practical ethical standard . Accordingly , it is to be expected that we should find , now and then , as we go through the Bible , stubs of fagots and exhausted lamps which gave light when the race was back in that historical period , but are now gone out . Christ formally put the extinguisher on several of these lights that were waning in his day , saying " It hath been said by them of old time , ** 80 and co " but I say unto you , " Thie henceforth i8 the ethical rule . And may it not be that there are instances , now going on , of a slow retirement of some of the educational requisitions made by the inspired writers in the New Testainent on those of their age , who were just emerging from paganism , and a gradual introduction , under the teachings of the divine Spirit , of a higher application of the ideal law as the practical standard for Christians in our day ? This admission would not disparage God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , nor the worth of the gift to us . Rather , it would emphasize both ; for God did not give the book to be used mechanically but to be an instrument of moral training , and at the same time a record of that training . Besides , the same principle of educational adaptation which led him to adopt , throughout the whole period covered by the Scriptures , a progressive system of morals with the advancing standard of // practical requirements , raising it from time to time himself in the written word , would lead his Spirit , whose office it is to bring the ideal things in the teachings of Christ to the minds of his disciples , to suggest to them , as they were prepared to hear it and as they needed it , a higher rule of daily living , and lead them up to it . All recognize the fact of the advancement of the current code when we pass from the Old to the New Testament times , whether they recognize the principle that it was because the religious world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher , or not . There was a " disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unproiltableness thereof . " Among the things then left behind was the toleration of polygamy , of voluntary divorce , of the lex talione8 , of private oaths and the obligation to perform them , it was thought , even when ethically wrong , the practical restriction of love to one 's own notiQn , the centralization of the most acceptable worship about the temple , and the prieetiy office of the ministry . Now , as the earlier regulations in relation to these things are , in our day , deserted mile-posts marking the moral progress of those trained under revelation , so may there not be some things in the New Testament which were shaped and phrased to meet immature and crnde moral conditions , and which the more advanced state of Christianity in modern times is slowly making obsolescent , because the Holy Spirit is bringing down more of the high ideal teachings of the word into practical supremacy ? For example , may there not be some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the use of wine and the rule of temperance , and the duties and privileges of women in the church , which suited the moral cultus and circumstances of the first century , but do not suit so exactly those of the nineteenth , and were not designed so expressly for those of the nineteenth ? Are we to consider that the Palestinian Jews , and the Greeks and IRomans , when just converted and rising from the night-mare of their old religions , were necessarily ripe for the highest moral teachings on such topics , and that they received them in the instructions shaped to their current wants ? What presumption is there in supposing that what inspired men said to voluptuous Corinthians , heady Hebrews , arrogant Italians , in their urgent condi // tions , were not in all cases designed to be a Procrustean code in its very letter for all time , in very different practical urgencies ; and that the color of those early times still lingers on their words in some cases ? If we must , in order to be true and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures , what goes with the concession does not lessen their value or make them less instructive to us . It simply shows that we need to look more closely into those instructions which had a special application to earlier times , to find the divine meaning in them for us , and must make allowance for the changed conditions . They are valuable , also , as marking the educational stages up which the Divine Love has carried those accepting his training . Moreover , they often suggest the sublime principles of ideal goodness , righteousness , and justice lying back of them , seeking to announce themselves , as it were , only the times were not ready for them . Here the question may arise as to the position of miraclee in our classification . Miracles are not the suspension or the breaking of the laws of nature , but the incoming of God 's interposition along the laws of nature , fresh from his own personality , revealing his presence , and bearing a testimony from him . In working miracles we may suppose God uses nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with immeasurably greater skill and success , bringing it into entire obedience to his will through its own laws . Hence miracles have , primarily , a moral aspect ; they are " signs . " They are used for a purpose . They are designed , first of all , to be helps to put revelation in position . Hence when Christian people were educated up to the revelation and the revelation was fairly lodged in human acceptance , there was no further call for the performance of miracles . In this sense the world has now passed beyond the need of them , and the record of them belongs to the past . To the unbelieving and skeptical they rather strain than help the book ; for to persons in that state of mind it is the witnessing of miracles , and not the record of them , that is a " sign . " To such persons the signs of Christianity are now the miracles of its history , its truth , its spirit , and the transformations of character wrought under its infin // ence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in another sense , to all sympathetic and believing minds , the miracles recorded in the word are a part of its living power . They are the natural symptoms , the expected pulses and heartbeats , in the narrative , of the presence of that Higher Mind with which they are holding companionship , faith changes the narration to them from records to deeds , and they become " signs " once more . Here , also , we meet the question whether there may not be something of the formal in the doctrinal teachings of Scripture . May not some of the announced doctrines be due to the doctrinal prepossessions of the time , or the sluggishness and weakness of the early learners to grasp the pure truth ? To answer this question we must recur to the distinction which we have already made , between what the writers intended to teach , and what they incidentally took up to aid their teachings . We must , also , distinguish between the final doctrines and the previous approximations , the anticipative symbols , the forecast stammering statements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary importance and derive their interest from the light of the developed doctrine thrown back on them . There may , also , be germs of doctrine dimly stated in the New Testament which the Holy Spirit may have since caused to open out to Christian consciousness in full bloom , and we now rejoice in the bloom , not in the germs . So far , there may be something of the formal in the doctrinal teachings . But the doctrinal teachings themselves , when they reach full statement , must be regarded as a part of the living word , for , in relation to doctrine , which appeals to the spiritual understanding , there is no need of a halting , progressive , educational method , such as is necessary in legislating morals . In training man morally , absolute morality can not be the practical standard enjoined by the law-giver . God said , in reference to the best system he could give the Jews in the wilderness : " I gave them statutes that were not good . " In instructing men doctrinally , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his pupils unable to receive at once the full blaze of his message , and he may be obliged to instruct them gradually , as Christ at one time said to his disciples : " I have yet many things to say // unto you , but ye can not hear them now ; " but as far as he does teach , the law and method of doctrinal teaching require that the quality of his doctrine should be , as far as their intellectual and spiritual faculties will allow , in the direction of the full truth . It must look towards that though it do not express it . It may dally in symbols and prefigurations and clumsy draughts and imperfect sketches , adapted to slow intellects . But the attempts must be aimed at the truth ; and as far as they reach dogma , doctrine , and take settled statements , they must not be contrary to it . Unless we admit this , the distinction between inspired and uninspired writings falls to the ground , and we take our position outside of revelation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . the incarnation and lodge it in human faith , it may be necessary first to familiarize the mind to a series of theophonies , manifestations of the Angel of the Covenant , and Messianic prophecies , continued through many generations ; but when the doctrine fairly blossoms out in the record of the coming and mission of Christ as given and interpreted by the sacred writers , this must be regarded as the consummate truth . So it may take a long time to develop the sacrificial principle . The attempt may lead through centuries of training by the use of the blood of beasts , costly offerings , and sacrificial symbols ; but when it ripens in the teachings of Christ and the Apostles in the doctrine of the atonement by the offering of the Son of God , this must be accepted as the ultimate truth , the impregnable reality . The figurative , the symbolical , the educational , may precede , but the full and final doctrine is the rounded New Testament statement , and from this there is no appeal . In like manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . faith , the first statement may be one requiring simple trust in God , with an obedient spirit . This may be followed by one adding the use of propitiatory rites ; and this , after centuries of training , may be crowned by the designation of Christ as the one specific object of faith . But after the doctrine has received its announcement , it must be regarded as final , and the prefigurations of the earlier economy take their place under it . So , in reference to retribution , the full principle may be announced after a long preliminary training // under the earthly government of God with earthly penalties alone , without any distinct statement of immortalit*y and future awards , but when the broader and larger announcement is made in the New Testament , and the range of retributions is lifted up and shown to extend to the other world and have its principal seat there , this must be accepted as a finality , and the previous teachings be regarded as preparations . It may be a slow process , also , to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one passes from the Old to the New Testament , he may find a transference and enlargement of the idea from an elect nationality to an elect disposition and character in all nationalities . But when the idea of a godly people is reached in Scripture , it stands for all coming time , and the anticipations are to be interpreted under it . The same is true of the priestly office , which had its foreshadowings in the Levitical priesthood , and its fulfillment in the priesthood of Christ , in which it ends , or rather , continues till there is no further need of intercession . So , in respect to the doctrines of the Holy Spirit , the Trinity , regeneration , worship , prayer , the prevalence of the kingdom of Christ , the last things , heaven , hell , the Christian exposition , which we find in the New Testament , is the regulative exposition , and must control faith , while the approaches to it take a subordinate place . On no other theory can we suppose that God had any purpose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that there was any continuous development of doctrine among God 's people recorded in Scripture . We have had occasion , while considering the formal element , to indicate more or less of the vital , so that , in now proceeding to the latter , our examination may be more rapid . We shall consider the more obvious groups here also , first . Certainly , then , the revelation which God makes of himself , his nature , character , and disposition towards man , in his word , must fall into this class This revelation is made through anthropomorphic , metaphoric and direct and explicit endeavor continued through long ages , but having been made , the Scriptures which help to give the high spiritual conception // are forever radiant with the light of God . Such passages shine throughout the Bible , and light up almost every page . We are to look for this element in the moral and sp'l//'l1tual prmc*ples which are announced . Principles are undying , and the Scriptures which reveal them are always fresh . Man can never progress beyond them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , in the religious and doctrinal instruction which God designs for man as man , not for man as a Jew or Greek or Roman , or man of a particular age , but timeless and raceless man . And we must not imagine , because much of this instruction was first given to particular persons , that its design was limited to them . In most cases , God sighted mankind through individuals* , and this fact lifts these Scriptures up in unfading luster . We find it in the portrayal of human nature and human need . What man is as a spiritual being , *  --  the light that flashes through this enigma of enigmas and makes it a transparency as to origin , character , possibilities , and wants-this makes a large luminous section of revelation , extending from Genesis to the Apocalypse . We find it in the record of the life , mission , and work of Christ , and the intertwined redemptive truth and history . This lifts up into prominence and permanent influence , around him who is " the Light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture , in prophecy , type , fulfillment , doctrine , and duty ; as , when one raises a net spread over a large area by lifting it at the middle , all the parts rise with it . We find it in the revealed conditions on which man is to come into possession of the blessings which Christ came to bring . These conditions are made for man as man , not for man as rich or poor or of one age or nation or color rather than another . These Scriptures are fixed stars in the biblical firmament . We find it in the elements and graces of Christian character made known as the standard of piety . God having prepared internal Christianity - or Christianity as a spiritual life - for the race and the race for Christianity , the expression of this remains in its essential spirit a part of the vital revelation and law for mankind . If Christ is the Light of the world , this is // the light-house in which the light shines , and it can never grow dim till that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises . These open a sight of the way in which God comes to the yearnings of his children . They reveal the gracious disposition of the unchangeable One . Hence they remain ever the same . It comes out in the expressions of representative ewperience . There are in the Bible experiences of struggling men , torn by the deepest passions , trials , sorrows , to which human nature is subject , who are yet trying to lead devout lives , and turn to God for help , and there are experiences of those lifted up to the highest joy and trust and faith . These are the song or chant or wail of the godly in similar moods in all ages . When needed and sought , they answer to the largest drafts of the desire of sympathy or utterance ; * as heart answers to heart , or face to face in water . To others not needing them or not seeking them , they may be no more than mirrors curtained behind thick folds , or mummies in whose wrappings are hidden living seeds . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those to live and come along who can recognize the supply of their wants in them . It is manifest in the lessons of sacred history . Through this run as lines of light principles and methods of the divine government which can never cease to be instructive to mankind . In one sense , history is special , once for all , and never repeats itself . But even in secular history , there is a philosophy of history , an undercurrent of principles rnnning through it which constitute its rationale ; and these principles live and repeat themselves in many forms and places and combinations . The discovery of them furnishes instruction and wisdom for after ages . In sacred history this philosophy of history is portrayed by inspired pens , and we can see its springs and principles on every page . Sacred history is live history , transparent history , a permanent fountain of wisdom . Even those portions of the narrative that fall into the category of the formal lead the way to the grand and significant portions , as the walls extending from ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is inlaid in the word of God a wealth of meaning that does not come specifically into sight in any of // these classes , and defies enumeration . There are latent meanings which spring out of their hiding places , and confront the devout . The Bible differs from other books in having unexpected adaptations , in being loaded , when supposed to be empty , with effective charges , which the Spirit discharges when the proper object is in range . It is pervaded as with a divine electricity ; and , ever and again , as one traverses it , led by the Spirit , he draws the spark and feels the effect . Exegetically , logically , in the letter , these meanings may not be there , any more than the light stored up in certain precious stones does not reveal its presence on previous examination , but when the stones are carried into a dark room they shine nevertheless . Shall we say that this effect , in either case-in the former more than in the latter-is accidental , or dependent on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine intent , no pan of a subtle divine inlay of use and possibility ? Very well ; say it . Nevertheless the fact remains ; and that is all that concerns us here . The fact is , the Bible is vital in many parts and places to susceptible spirits , where it appears merely formal . Such are the elements  --  the formal and the vital-which make up the wondrous word of God . We do not expect we have said anything to enable one to go through the Bible and label every passage with its appropriate designation . We have had no such object in view . The attempt would indicate an entire misapprehension of the nature and object of the book . It is given to furnish man light , but to furnish it in a way that shall make it an instrument of spiritual training . If it were capable of being thus at once and unmistakably separated into two parts ,  --  a fiery column of light , however grand , on the one hand , and a heap of ashes , however small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly confronting one with the living divine message , and at the same time disclosing the unimportant elements sifted away from it ,  --  it would cease to be the book of moral testing and education it was designed to be . As it is , it is a vast sacred region full of wondrous truths and disclosures for the seeking , sympathetic mind , but veiling its blessings from averted and repellant natures . Those who traverse it to find for themselves the good in it are put on their seekings . The divine help therein to them , like God // himself in nature , is near , but not an obtrusive presence . The law is , that they should seek , if haply they might feel after and find it , though it be not far from every one of us . In this way , the necessity of reaching the wealth of the vital through the formal , and feeling out the real divine meaning of the word , makes the book one of extreme educational value , morally . The difficulty is with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eyes and hearts are holden that we can not perceive them . We must be ever weighing , sifting , searching , to find the fulness of the divine thought . We are put to feeling after the deep spiritual teachings and aims . We must throw ourselves on the leadings of the gracious Spirit . We must use the helps of prayer , study , thought , to reach the significant depths . It is a question of spiritual discernment and sympathy , and ability to be led by the Spirit having guardianship over the mysteries recorded . It is not an affair of double senses in the sacred pages ; or of esoteric instruction for the initiated-save as the grace of God initiates or , prominently , of scholarship and learning-except as the devout learn of Jesus . But when we are in sympathy with the book , inwardly susceptible and responsive and led , messages flash from unexpected places-messages of light , duty , privilege , support , cheer . The Divine Spirit in us and the Divine Spirit in the word find each other in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abandoned ritualism , obsolete requirements-may be the scene of these glad surprises . It may be objected to the view we have presented , that it introduces an element of uncertainty and difficulty into the interpretation of Scripture , leaves us , in reference to some things , still in doubt whether they are authoritative to us , and compels us to search for the truth through labyrinthine retreats with great painstaking and mortal risks . But uncertainty and peril are incidents , perhaps conditions , of moral training everywhere . Doubtless it would save trouble if the Bible were to hand out to us its truth in a compact solid mass , like a sledge-hammer , with which instantly to strike down all doubt or gainsaying ; or if it caused it to rise before us in one exact definite column of light , with no intermingling of light and shade , no grada // tions towards darkness . But this would be contrary to all God 's methods of couducting moral training in other departments . It would save trouble if conscience always led us magisterially , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the street . Doubtless it would be easier for parents always to be told authoritatively the best way of dealing with their children . Doubtless it would greatly abridge our inquiries and anxieties if full divine intimations were flashed on all questions of social duty . But God nowhere trains us in that way , the way of spiritual dwarfage . He leads us along dizzy heights overhanging bottomless abysses , where we must be on the alert . His method is to provide enough light for those who seek and accept it , but in a measure to veil it from others . Is it strange , then , that we find the Bible in harmony with this style of training ? Is it strange that it must be studied and interpreted as from within itself , by a mind in sympathy with it ; that many of its meanings gradually dawn on the soul , as they are needed and welcomed ; and that , all the way along , it is at once a test and an instrument of moral training ? Is it strange that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , taking it as a book no one can put his mind on the exact living messages of God in it in their fulness , only as he is spiritually led and enlightened in a process of grand moral awakening and enlargement ? At any rate , whatever may be our theories on the subject , this , historically , is the nature of the book ; and it is not a question of choices with us what kind of a Bible we would like , but what kind we have , and of duty to recognize the fact , and harmonize our beliefs , habits , and defenses with it . It may be objected , further , that this view leaves the impression that the exterior and structural element is the prominent one , and that the valuable part lurks vaguely somewhere in diminutive and intangible places in the book . Just the opposite is true . It must be remembered that in products that spring up from an inner principle , giving it support and body , the formal is the prominent part , while the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , remains out of sight . It must be felt out and divined by the seeing spirit , rather than // seen by the bodily eye . Take the marvelous Divine Word himself . To many minds all that is to be seen of him is the outward man , the historic Jesus , the visible dweller in Palestine . The external details cover and exhaust the conception . But to a deeper insight there appears , back of that outward life , back of that phenomenal humanity , a fulness of Divine Energy , Love , Personality , that pervades , saturates , and overflows every step , act , and moment of the historic career and the visible personage . When we see the Being and the life , interiorly , not outwardly alone , we discover that the spiritual and Divine not only vitalizes the external in every part , but infinitely transcends it in worth and glory . So , at first sight , the outward element of Scripture may seem , to persons of little spiritual insight , as they make the distinction and glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when we come in true sympathy to weigh the permeating truths , relating to the wondrous redemption , God 's being and government , man 's nature , needs , possibilities , and perils ; the outlook into moral and spiritual principles ; the horoscope of the future of humanity here and beyond , in the volume ; when we take in the interior living element , the Bible within the Bible , and see these grand , wide-reaching , fadeless realities pervading and outreaching the book , as the Divine pervades and outreaches the apparent in the life of Christ ; when our vision is anointed to grasp and estimate the spiritual side ,  --  we realize that the formal retires to an obscure and inconsiderable position , and that the vital rises in a halo of glory above and crowns it .
