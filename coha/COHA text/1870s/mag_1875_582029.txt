qwq feel in everything that is written on the subjects of house-building and house-furnishing . There never was a time when so many books written for the purpose of bringing the subject of architecture-its history , its theories , its practice-down to the level of the popular understanding , were produced as in this time of ours . And , from the house itself , we are now set to thinking and VOL . X.-12. cerns everybody , everybody may know what is the latest word . When those who have attempted to instruct the public on so intimate and personal a subject have looked about for authorities and models , they have turned back with one consent to the past , and either adopted the usage of old times as a whole , or made it a basis for their suggestions , a text for FIG .

But , if we ask where the old-time people found their models , we certainly do not get for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , or that they sought the advice of this or that architect . Whatever they did , were it good or bad , came out of their own minds , and was suggested by their own wants , and represented their own taste and sense of fitness . Now , we have the same faculties that the men who lived before us had , just as we have the same desires and needs , and we have only to go to work in the same way in order to produce the same results . Just let us consult our own desires and needs , and refuse to be governed by those of other people . And let us refuse to take what is offered to us , if it does not suit our needs or our purses , and learn not to fear being sent to Coventry for our refusal . The best plan is to know first , as near as may be , how we ought to live externally , and then to surround ourselves with the things best suited for that mode of life , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounds , is so seldom done , that it must be thought a thing extremely difficult to do . Look about you , reader , and ask yourself , how many people you know who live as they really like to live and let the world go by . There are such people . I know such in my own circle , but there are not many of them , and it certainly is not the way of the world at large . But , whoever will try the experiment will find the reward in peace and serenity , and real comfort so abounding , that it will be no longer a query with him whether he shall continue it or not . And he will find that the question of furniture will disappear from the catalogue of vexations , because there is always provision in the world for every reasonable want . Every country , too , has its own models , and was at one time satisfied with its own-that is , the mass of the people were satisfied , though in every country , at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would give thilke Morpheus * * * * If he woll make me sleepe alite , Of downe of pure . doves white I woll give him a feather hed , Raied with gold , and right well cled In fine hlacke sattin d'outremere ; And many a pillow , and every here , Of cloth of raines to slepe on soft , Him there not need to turne oft . " Their satins must come from over seas , and homespun will not do , but they must go for FIG. 3 . A SETTLE , CONVERTIBLE INTO A TABLE . // cloth to some foreign town of Rennes , else they can not rest in their beds . But the charm of every house is to find the people in it self-contained , and taking their pleasure and their comfort where they can , in the things that come to them , rather in what they have had to seek painfully and far . Yet it is not worth while to ignore the fashion altogether nor to insist on having things entirely different from those our neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridicule expended upon people who follow the fashion ; but we ought to reflect that not to follow the fashion ( the question is now of ways of living , of dress , and of manners ) is found , in the long run , to be expensive , not only in money , but in time , and really takes away our attention too much from matters better worth while . The young man who gave his whole mind to the tying of his cravat could not , of course , give any of his mind to higher things ; and if we fuss too much , or fuss at all , for that matter , over our coats , and trousers , and gloves , and hats , we soon This is the good general rule , and the following it would help settle many difficulties that we hear people complaining of every day . Much of the trouble we have in getting furniture to suit us , comes from our wanting things that do not suit us . We must have something that somebody else has or has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fashion . The last thing we think of is to please ourselves . A young couple heroically determined that when they were married they would live as comfortably as they could on the smallest income that would be theirs ; and that for no fashion 's sake , nor for any fidgety conventional friend 's sake , would they go to any expense that would give them a minute 's uneasiness . The husband was a professional man , fond of books and pictures ; the wife was womanly , pleased in her own work , in her books and stitchery , and could touch the piano ; and when evening came was pleased with what pleased him . Flats had not yet peeped over the horizon of their daily life , and between a whole house find we are on the wrong road . It is no better to worry ourselves over our house furniture , and to insist upon having ideal and faultless surroundings . If we have things about us different from what the way of the world provides , it ought to be because we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were trying to be peculiar . and a boarding-house ( the latter the last resort of despairing young humans ) there seemed no middle ground , nor was any , until it occurred to one of them-they never could tell which one it was , to whom the happy thought was due  --  to take a whole house and live in the upper floors , and , reserving a corner of the cellar for coals , to FIG. 4 . THE SAME , AS A TABLE . 7 // let the rest of the house to somebody else . This they did , and straightway went to work to furnish their floor with the bestlooking furniture they could get without hunting too far . In the artist circle , and the circle of young lawyers and budding literary folk , and architects and the Utopians generally , this upper floor became a synonym for domestic paradise ; and , indeed , a prettier place had not then been seen in New York . But it soon became whispered abroad-that is , in the course of two years or so-. that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sadly missing the aid and comfort these two were to have brought to those benighted regions , had so fretted and worried these happy young people , and had teased them so about the world , and what it was saying , and what it was thinking about doing , that at last they wearily succumbed , and let a fine house be bought for them , as ugly and anti-domestic as a New York brown-stone front knows so well to be ; and there they went , and there a charming and successful experiment came to a commonplace ending . Suppose this an imaginary story ; but it is a type of the trouble everybody finds in living in an individual way of his own . Society does not notice with approval such departure from the common road , and the ruts are made so easy for us all to roll along in , there is small temptation for us to risk upsetting by trying unaccustomed paths . However , my purpose is not to recommend eccentricity , nor even a modified Bohemianism . I have no mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor have I a hope that anything I can say will bring back simplicity and good taste . I am not at all sure that my own taste is good , or that I can depend upon its being good at all times . If I am pushed to the wall with a question as to my right to be heard in this matter , I can only say that , after much tribulatiOn , I have reached a point where simplicity seems to me a good part of beauty , and utility only beauty in a mask ; and I have no prouder nor more pretending aim than to suggest how this truth may be expressed in the furniture and decoration of our homes . THE LIVING-ROOM . I USE the word " Living-Room " instead of " Parlor , " because I am not intending to have anything to say about parlors . As these chapters are not written for rich people 's reading , and as none but rich people can afford to have a room in their houses set apart for the pleasures of idleness , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should like to persuade a few young people who are just pushing their life-boat off shore to venture into deeper and more adventurous seas , that it will make their home a great deal more cheerful and homelike if they concentrate their leisure , in-door hours in one place , and do not attempt to keep up a room in which they themselves shall be strangers , and which will make a stranger of every friend who comes into it . Happily , the notion that such a room is absolutely necessary to every respectable family is no longer so prevalent , nor held so binding as it once was . A good many people who were children in New England fifty years ago will remember the disagreeable parlor of the period , into which they were only permitted to go on Sunday afternoons , though they often forgot to go there even on that grim holiday , but preferred the nursery or , may be , the kitchen , where there was nothing too good to use , and some comfort might be had . Of course the country towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had this advantage , that , besides the unused parlor , there was almost always a real living-room , and it was oftenest on the sunny side of the house , the shady side being chosen for the parlor , whose carpet must not be exposed to the danger of fading by the admission of the sun . In the country , then , one could easily forget the existence of the parlor , and the real life of the family went cheerily on without it . The parlor was opened on Sundays , FIG. 5 . A CRIBS-CROSS TABLE . // 73 on Thanksgiving day , for funerals , for weddings , and on the one or two occasions in the year when the awful solemnity of a formal " party " was gone through ; but it was carefully shunned on more cheerful and human occasions , such as tea-fights , candypulls , sleighing-parties , and other " good times . " But in the cities the living-room was sacrificed to the social necessities , and was generally up-stairs or down-stairs , the main floor being given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted , how much capital been kept idle in furnishing and keeping up these ceremonial deserts ! They are useless and out of place in the houses of nine-tenths of our Americans . They rigjltly belong to those houses where a great deal of merely formal social intercourse is carried on , where domestic life does not have time to exist , or where the position of the family is such that provision has to be made for a life apart from the domestic life . How few families among our people are in this last condition ! Yet I could fill all my chapter with illustrations of the absurd way in which the comfort and domestic happiness of families have been prevented and hindered by the supposed need of making provision for a social life outside the home life of the family . The best room in the house is taken for the use of strangers , furnished with articles that are avowedly too expensive to be used , and the cost of which makes a serious hole in the marriage-money , and a double interest has to be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much subtraction made from the sincerity and naturalness of daily life . Let us begin , then , with the frank abandonment of any formal parlor , but , taking the largest and pleasantest and most accessible room in the house , let us give it up to the wife and children in the daytime , and to the meeting pf the whole family when evening comes . There is not much need at the present time to emphasize this suggestion , for it is one which experience and necessity have already made to a good many people ; and now that the problem , " How to get a dwelling at a rent within moderate means " is being solved by the increase of " flats " and apartment houses , the " parlor " must be given up , there being no provision made for it in the common plans . But it is by no means my notion that the living-room should be a homely , matter-of-fact apartment , consecrated to the utilities , while the Muses and Graces are left to kick their heels in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living-room , for a foundation , that the furniture shall be the best designed and best made that we can afford , and all of it intended to be used and necessary to our - &lt;-&lt; -- - - FIG. 6 . FOR BOOKS , OR WORK , OR HEALTHFUL FLAY . FIG 7 . A FIARO-STOOL. // comfort ; not an article to be allowed that does n't earn its living , and can not prove its right to be there . These wants being provided for first , then we will admit the ornament of life-casts , pictures , engravings , bronzes , books , chief nourishers in life 's feast ; but in the beginning these are to be few , and of the choicest , and the greatest care is to be taken in admitting a newcomer . The room , from the very first , ought to represent the culture of the family ,  - -  what is their taste , what feeling they have for art ; it should represent themselves , and not other people ; and the troublesome fact is , that it will and must represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If young people , after they have secured the few pieces of furniture that must be had , and made sure that they are what they ought to be , have some money left to get a picture , an engraving , or a cast , they ought to go to work to supply this want as seriously as they would the other , which seems the more necessary , but in reality is not a bit more necessary . I look upon this ideal living-room of mine as an important agent in the education of life ; it will make a great difference to the children who grow up in it , and to all whose experience is associated with it , whether it be a beautiful and cheerful room , or only a homely and bare one , or a merely formal and conventional one . The relation of these things to education is all that gives any dignity or poetry to the subject , or makes it allowable for a reasonable man to give much thought to it . But it has a real vital relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deserves to be thought about a great deal more than it is . It is therefore no trifling matter whether we hang poor pictures on our walls or good ones , whether we select a fine cast or a second-rate one . We might almost as well say it makes no difference whether the people we live with are first-rate or secondrate . But we are not yet come to the pictures and casts . We must do with our imaginary room as we would do with the real oneget it furnished first ; provide it with limbs and members before we put a soul into it . Let us begin , then , with a word or two about carpets . The camp of young married people is divided into two factions on the question : " Whether to have carpets or rugs ? " Rugs have novelty on their side , and that is nine points in fashion 's law , but there is , I think , much more to be said for them than simply that " they are the latest thing out . " Carpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of comfort in early days ; the custom of having them came over from England , and was kept up here , partly because of inherited ideas of what was comfortable and cozy ; partly because the condition of domestic life that made them serviceable in England existed here as well as there ; and for another reason , apart from these , ifs , indeed , it were not rather the effect than the cause-I mean the poor way in which we make our floors of planks , too wide and badly joined . Even in our best New York houses the floors are meanly laid , and in the second and third class houses , they are so bad that they must be covered with carpets whether the occupants wish it or no . Parenthetically , I may state , that the carpenter 's trade in New York city is in a melancholy state , and the work that is put into the most costly houses here would not be accepted in second-class houses in Boston . But , then , I suppose houses are better built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anywhere else in the world . It is common to find , in very plain houses in that city , floors so evenly and tightly laid that it seems a pity to cover them with a carpet ; yet , until lately , it was rare to see there a room which was not completely covered with a carpet of some kind . I suppose the housekeeper 's argument for carpets is akin to her argument for " tidies " and " slips , " and the other expedients by which the great enemy , " dirt , " is imagined to be circumvented . Carpets are great hiders of dirt and dust , and a new broom easily restores them when too much dirt and dust is collected on their surface . But , then , they are great storers of dirt and dust as well , and apart from the waste of money in covering places that do not need covering , the question of health involved in the use of carpets is a very serious one . The large pieces of furniture that in all our rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sideboards , the book-cases , the bedsteads , the wardrobes , the wash-stands , the bureaus-do not need any carpet under them ; the carpet that is put under them stands for so much wasted money , and yet we go on putting down yards of carpet where they are never seen , where the dust collects , and is only attacked in weekly sweeping , and where it keeps a sort of color , while the rest changes color and fades . Let any one give a rug a fair trial , and observe for himself how much less dust will be made in the room , how much more easily the room // is kept clean , and how much more manageable the furniture is when the weekly sweeping , or the daily dusting , has to be got through with . The principal objection to rugs is their first cost , which for good ones is as yet considerable . I do not like to see several rugs in a room , but prefer one large one , large enough , that is to cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large pieces of furniture . In no case should any one of these large pieces rest upon the rug , for it ought to be an everyday or at least an any-day matter to turn it up and brush underneath it , or to roll it up and carry it out on a balcony to be shaken or swept , and this will never be if some heavy table or piano , or bookcase , has to be dislodged for the purpose . Where there are several smallish rugs in a room , or even several of good size , so long as in either case they do not cover the whole of the free floor , they are apt to prove impediments  --  to trip up children and old people , and they break up the unity of the room , give it a patchy look , which is the chief thing to be avoided . It is better on all accounts to buy a rug large enough to cover all of the floor we wish to cover , even if it strain our purse a little , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know rugs that are well on their way to last a second lifetime . The best Turkey , Persian , and Smyrna rugs are made by hand of pure wool , and are so thick that if a brazier of coals is upset on one of them , the charred portion , which , in the case of a Brussels carpet , could never be effaced , will disappear after a few days wear . After much using a good Eastern rug , walking on the best body Brussels is like walking on the wooden floor , to the feeling . To an artistic eye , too ( and how much of this writing must be content with the judgment and approval of artistic people ! ) , an Eastern rug that is handsome to begin with grows handsomer with time and use , and even one that was a little staring and pertinacious at first , gets toned down and subdued by being long walked over , just as if it were a human being . It may be remarked in passing that there are ugly Eastern rugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially , who sell a great many carpets to England , and nowadays to America , often ship a lot that are so bad , we must believe their rascally makers have learned of some French artist the phrase : " Anything is good enough for those Americans . " But the Turkey carpets proper are only good when the weavers confine themselves to *ds and blues , though they sometimes do a very successful thing in mustard-yellow , but the true shade of this is rare . Just a word more as to the color of the rugs to be employed . The Eastern designers know too much , or have too correct an instinct , to use much white in their designs ; they get all the light and brightness they want without it , and even when they use white it is not pure white , but gray , and used with extreme economy at that ; at least in all the successful carpets . It is true these Eastern carpets are sometimes found with what is called a white ground , and these are among the handsomest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , in the first place , is not white , but some color that only looks white by force of juxtaposition ( black it may be ) , and then what there is of it is used in so bold a way and so broken up , that all we feel , in looking at it , is , that it is cheerful and festive , whereas the Eastern rugs we are most used to seeing , and especially the Turkey rugs , are somber and rich rather than FIG. 8 . A PRINT-STAND FROM SOUTH-ICRNSIRGTON. // gay . However , a " white ground " carpet is rather a holiday friend , and is not to be recommended unless the room it is intended for be a darkish one , or the character of the household be such that it will not be subjected to the ravages of children and husbands with dirty boots . Otherwise choose a thick rug with a pattern a good deal broken , and with nothing very odd or noticeable in the design , and let it take its fortunes . If it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and outwear more than one Brussels carpet . If people object to rugs , there is at least the comfort left them of knowing that they can get carpets better made than ever carpets were before , and with designs that can only be matched for elegance and beauty with those of Persian rugs . These are English carpets , designed and made by the house of Morris &amp; Co. , or by the other equally excellent but not yet so widely known house of Cottier &amp; Co . In fact , these carpets are so handsome and so well made , that I am not sure but the true solu tion of the difficulty is to be found in employing squares made of them with the borders that always go with them , instead of hunting up Eastern rugs and having to buy them of the monopolists ; for only the common sort are fairly in the market as yet . There are , however , other and cheaper resources . They make in Philadelphia a pretty and serviceable rug out of the ravelings of fine carpets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is , of course , no set pattern , but a pleasant mingling of hues , and its texture makes it agreeable to the foot , though it is more comfortable as a rug over a matting in summer than as a sole dependence in winter . Still , it is something it is well to know of . They make in Scotland and in Holland a carpeting of a mixture of wool and jute , which is dyed a deep maroon , and is about the thickness of Brussels carpeting . A good way of using this is to make a square or parallelogram the size of the clear space of the floor when all the dowager and wall-flower pieces of furniture are in their places . This is laid down and held in its place by rings sewed to the under edge , and slippA over small brass-headed nails , driven down close to the floor . This makes a comfortable footing and is easily removed when necessary . Then in the center of the room , or before the fire , or in front of the sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose it is the cost of good rugs that keeps them so long from coming into general use . Yet , the gain of employing them is so considerable in healthiness and cleanliness alone , that I should think the time must come when they will be " your only wear . " But the reader will say : " The floor , the floor 's the thing . What are we to do with our floors ? " Of course if we are in Boston , and have a sound floor of narrow boards , each board well driven home to its neighbor , * and nailed through the edge as if it were an aristocratic hard-wood floor-if such luck as this ever fell to the unhappy hirer of a New York house , he would agree at once that with two or three good coats of dark paint and a shellac finish , any man with an eye ought to be satisfied ; but the case is n't as plain with the wide planks , varied with knots and flaws , and " joined " with gaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston carpenters in laying all floors , is a thing unknown in New York , even in laying the floors of the costliest houses . I have heard of its being laughed to scorn by some noble bosses . 7 7 // seams , that are the rule in New York . The handsomest thing to do is to lay down a parquet floor of what is called wood-carpetFIG. 10 . CHINESE CABINET . ing ; but this , with a rug afterward , is enough to give pause to nine young married couple out of every ten , and is only to be thought of by those unhappy " rich people , " in whom it is impossible for us to take any human interest . The best plan is to meekly accept the situation , and sending for a house-painter who knows his business ( and there are clever men in this business among us , their extreme skill having been developed by long practice in covering up the tracks of our miserable carpenters ) , sending for such a man , let him first fill up all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , with red putty ,  --  it will take a good deal ,  --  and then stain it ( not paint it ) carefully in a dark brown warmed with a little red , and over all a coat of shellac . If this be done well , and allowed to get thoroughly dried , it will last a long time ; but , I believe when it needs renewing it must be tainted ; as the shellac can not be removed so completely as to admit of restaining . This makes a handsome floor , but when the rug is down and the furniture in its place , but little of it is seen . The advantage of a hard-wood floor laid down originally , or of a common floor covered with wood-carpeting , is so great on the score of health and labor-saving , that it would seem as if only the prejudice that comes from old association could long keep up the fashion of carpets . But , however it may be in the case of a whole house , large or small , to be furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the desirableness of rugs for rooms in flats . One who has tried them will never want to use an ordinary carpet again . Our modern rooms , especially in our cities , are so small , and , as a rule , so ill-proportioned-too often long and narrow-that it is very puzzling to know how to furnish them so as to get in the things we need , and yet to have space left in which to move about . It is too much the fashion , especially here in New York , for the builders of houses ( and it is , of course , only once in *i thousand times that an architect designs a dwelling-house in New York ) to put in mantel-pieces , doors , cornices , and all the moldings that are about the doors and windows , by a system of contract supply that takes no account of the differences in size of different houses . Mantel-pieces are got out for all the principal rooms of about the same dimensions , the only difference between FIG . II . ITALIAN FIEE-SCEEEN. those for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main bedroom , being , that the bedroom mantel-pieces escape the overloading with badly designed and coarsely // qwq rial , and had been molded to its perfection by an owner of persistently sedentary habit . The seat sloped a little from the front to the back , as every chair seat ought ; was of ample depth , and was inclosed by a slightly sloping back and gently spreading arms . The back was composed of slender rods , and the flat arms were a little broadened and rounded at the ends , offering a pleasant and soothing object for the hands to play with . The legs of these 7 / chairs flared considerably , - but only so much as to give - the necessary stability , and FIG. 12 . OAK CHAIRS , EMBROIDERED IN SILK AND WORSTED ON they were connected by CANVAS . rungs . Now these chairs , proportioned to the room , and might be put once in common use all over our Eastern where they are needed , and where they will country , and then despised in the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the desire for stuffed furniture , are devoted . We might also see moldings come into favor again , and are bought up at // once wherever they are offered for sale . It is well known , too , what a prosperity the Wakefield manufacture of rattan furniture is enjoying , and it deserves it too . Whenever the designs obey the law of the material employed , and do not try to twist or bend it out of its own natural and handsome curves , they are sure to be pleasing to look at and serviceable to use . The Chinese make a picturesque and comfortable chair out of the large shoots of bamboo , and their reclining chairs , with a foot-rest that can be pushed out or in at pleasure , are almost indispensable to a house in the country . With such a chair and a good hammock a hermit might set up housekeeping . It would be hard for him to say what he wanted next . Diogenes would have said he wanted nothing but to throw away the hammock . And , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chair all in one . A sofa that seems to me to answer all one 's reasonable needs is shown in Figures i and 2 . It has been carefully studied , for comfort and elegance combined , by Mr. James S. Inglis , of Cottier &amp; Co. , who has made this very pretty drawing of it , which Mr. Henry Marsh has engraved . The sofa is long enough to lie upon and take a nap , and deep enough and low enough to sit upon with comfort . The cushions are all movable at need , and in summer , if we choose , we can stow them away and use the sofa as a settee . As for the coverings of the cushions , we need not be at a loss , for there has not been in the last fifty years such a varied supply of excellent materials for this purpose : the stuffs themselves of first-rate make , and the designs as good as ever were produced at any time . Cottier &amp; Co. have serges in colors whose delightfulness we all recognize in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burne-Jones and Rossetti paint , colors that have been turning all the plain girls to beauties of late , and making the beauties more dangerous than ever-the mistletoe green , the blue-green , the ducksegg , the rose-amber , the , pomegranate-flower , and so forth , and so on , colors which we owe to the English poet-artists who are oddly lumped together as the Pre-Raphaelites , and who made the new rainbow to confound the scientific decorators who were so sure of what colors would go together , and what colors would n't . Whoever would get a new sensation , and know for the first time what delicate or rich fancies of delightful color and softness of touch can be worked with silk and wool , must go to the Messrs . Cottiers ' shop and learn for himself . It may sometimes happen that a larger table than ordinary may be much needed when maps are to be consulted , or large books examined , or a collection of prints enjoyed by a company of amateurs . Yet , the room is not large enough to permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The common ironing table of our kitchens , the " settle " of the old days , has served as a model for a piece of furniture which may be used either as a sofa or as a table . " The bed contrived a double debt to pay : A bed by night , a chest of drawers by day . " Nos. 3 and 4 show this amphibian , though not exactly as I would have had it . This design was made by Mr. G. F. Babb , and was drawn by M. Alexandre Sandier , but the engraver has done scant justice to either of these accomplished gentlemen , and has made an uncomfortable botch of his work . This is one of the half-dozen blocks that were sent by us to France to be engraved , and put into the hands of the engraver who cut some of the best work in the " Dictionnaire du Mobilier , " etc. , of Viollet-le-Duc . But M. Guillaumot doubtless said to himself as all Frenchmen do : " Anything is good enough for those barbarians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boys to break their tools on , for practice in corpore viii , and at the same time asked full pay for the third-rate work . The only reason for sending the work abroad was that the designs themselves and the drawings had cost a good deal of money , and it was thought an engraver who had had a considerable practice in engraving the same FIG. 53. * PLUSH CUSHION . // class of subjects would do it better than our own engravers , who had had no practice . Some of the best of our men were glad to have the experiment tried , and it was tried as much in the interest of our own school of engravers as in any selfish interest of our own , but it proved an entire failure . All the work done for us by Mr. E. Guillaumot is unsatisfactory to us , and discreditable to him . Mr. Babb 's design is more suited to a hall or an office than to a living-room , for the reason that it does not look comfortable to sit on .

The round sticks at the sides could not be secured to the table-top , nor could the cushion be fastened to them , except by a fussy contrivance of a cord twisted about them . Both the cushion on the seat and that against the back are designed to be movable . The cushion on the seat does not need to be secured : its weight , and the depth of the seat will keep it always in place . It is made movable in order that the lid of the box beneath ( a good place for storing magazines , pamphlets , and newspapers ) can be opened . The cushion at the back should be held in place by three broad straps fixed at their lower ends , but attached at their other ends to the table-top by means of a button or a buckle .

It was all well enough for handsome Charles Brandon to have one side of his horse-cloth of cloth-of-gold , and the other of cloth-offrieze , with the motto on the former : " Cloth-of-gold , do not despise , Though thou'rt matched with cloth-of-frieze. ** and on the other , " Cloth-of-frieze , be not too bold , Though thou'rt matched with cloth-of-gold ; " but this was only a quip of the Renaissance time , to show his wit and veil his suit ; and , besides , he showed both sides of his punning horse-cloth in the broad daylight of the tournament . I am sure I shall be upheld by everybody who will try the experiment , in my advice to have no " best side , " and no belongings too good for daily use and service . When this apotheosized ironing-table is not wahted to play the desk or book-table , as it will only be wanted now and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should be supplied with a small cushion at either end . These cushions are omitted in the drawing , to show the construction of the sofa the better . So , in Figure 4 , the two cushions of the seat and of the back are omitted , but this was not intended , for they , of course , remain in their places when the back is lowered to make a table . In the next of these articles , it is hoped there will be another and more successful design than the present , which is FIO. i4 . SMALL TABLES FOR coSNESS. - USEFUL IN TEA-FIOHTS. // ings , and etchings one owns , and not enjoying them . Besides , it saves a great expense in framing , and it unites the advantages of frames and portfolios . When we want to see our possessions , we can see them framed , and see them without trouble , and when we do n't want to see them , we turn the printframe away , and forget for a while what it holds . Engraving No. 9 shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book-shelves , letter-pad , and cupboard , which Mr. Sandier has designed for me . His charming drawing of this has been , as usual , spoiled by the French cutter ; but the intelligent reader can see that it must have been charming at first if it looks so pretty still after the mauling it got at the hands of Mr. Guillaumot 's apprentices . The cupboard below is for books that are too valuable to be handled by everybody . It is capacious enough , however , to be found very useful for many purposes when one is in narrow quarters . Every artist will appreciate the Drawing No. 10 , made from an actual example by Mr. Francis Lathrop , and engraved by Mr. Henry Marsh . I do n't know how it is coming out in the printing , but if the blockprinter does any sort of justice to this , and also to the fire-screen , and the coffee-table and chairs ( Fig. is ) , the joint-work of the same artists , every wood-engraver who is an artist will recognize them as three little masterpieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether delightful , that I only introduced here from necessity . Two other tables are shown in Nos. 5 and 6 . The first was designed by Mr. Babb , and seems to me quite complete in its way . The little stool , No. 7 , a good piano-stool , by the way , was designed by Mr. Sandier to accompany the table , and both were drawn by Mr. Sandier on the wood , and engraved by Mr. Marsh . It does not require a very accomplished eye to see the superiority of the American engraving over the French ; yet the drawings were equally good to begin with , for Mr. Sandier can only draw one way , that is with exquisite delicacy and precision . Table No. * is intbnded for a center-table . No. 6 is rather a table to go against the wall , to write at , or hold the books and pamphlets that are being read , while the two shelves below will be found very convenient for folios and large printbooks , atlases , etc. , etc . A shelf at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this table are heavier than need be , and the lower shelf also much too heavy . This drawing was also one of Mr. Sandier 's , but you see what the French engraver did for it . The most troublesome member of the living-room ornaments , and yet the one we can least do without , is the portfolio of prints . It is always in the way , and if it is on a stand , the stand has to behave itself with great reticence and modesty ,  --  keeping its back straight to the wall and tuming its toes well in-not to be reckoned a perpetual marplot . As a rule , when the portfolio is introduced , all enjoyment of the prints it contains is at an end , for we are lazy creatures , the most of us , and , rather than drag out the portfolio stand or open the cumbersome book , we prefer to forego the pleasure of studying its contents . The print-stand No. 8 has been devised to help us in this emergency , and it certainly does help us effectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simplest way , by hooks fitting into rings ) as its circumference will permit , and each frame will hold two prints . Each frame is supplied with two pieces of glass , and the prints are fastened with drawing-pins to the sides of a panel that slips down between the glasses . If need be , the frames themselves can be locked to the supporting pole , and qwq been ingratitude not to have been made happy by such a combination as the house of Cottier &amp; Co. coming over to show us practically what beautiful furniture means ; Mr. Lathrop taking a flying vacation from the company of the young men who are bringing back the golden days of art in England , to draw these things for us ; and Mr. Marshwhose work is so precious , that it is no wonder he is hardly known out of a small circlepitching his tent in New York for a while for no other end apparently than to see that justice was done to Mr. Lathrop 's work . No. 10 is a double cupboard , with two drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper one , dividing it also into two . It is , I* believe , a Chinese piece ; the frame is made of a lighter wood than the panels , which , in the doors , are ornamented with ivory figures , fastened upon the wood . It is a little over a man 's height , and is of a comfortable depth . It will hold a great deal , and a piece of furniture modeled on it would be found most convenient in any house where there are books of prints , or old china , or curios , or anything of which it is not desired to make a display . It will be observed that it is of the simplest construction , and owes its picturesqueness greatly to the ornament upon the doors . But Sufficient richness and elegance could be obtained by a combination of two woods , or even by one wood alone if the panels were selected by a carpenter with an eye . I shall not be able to take up the subject of fire-places and mantel-pieces this month , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ii , before alluded to . This consists of three frames , enclosing panels covered with some dark cloth or plush , on which peacock 's feathers aie laid , and the whole protected by glass . The frames are loosely united to one another , which gives a pleasantly familiar air to the screen , as if it were standing at ease on its own hearth with its hands under its coat-tail . It is the only firescreen I ever saw that one could forgive for shutting out the fire . Nos. 12 and 13 are chairs which are plainly comfortable to sit on , though in the making of them they would bear being made somewhat less heavy in the wood-work.
