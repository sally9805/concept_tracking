txt Secretary Sherman arrived here this afternoon , and was met at the depot by members of the Republican State Central Committee and local delegations of Republicans . He spent the afternoon receiving friends at the Niel House . This evening a reception was given in his honor by ex-Gov . William Dennison , which was largely attended by members of the Legislature , State officers , and citizens of all political views . He was serenaded at his hotel at 11 o'clock tonight . After brief introductory remarks , he said : " A little over two years ago , when I assumed the office I now hold , the people of the United States were distracted with a very important question . For two years we had nothing in circulation except paper money issued by the Government and national banks . Three or four years before that time the people of this country had met with one of those financial revulsions which will occur in the history of all nations . Men then engaged in employment were suddenly thrown out of employment ; capital invested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly stopped by the panic ; the poor became poorer and the rich lost their possessions . Two years ago , when I assumed the office I now hold , the question came up , which is the best remedy for the . matter ? A law had been passed by Congress declaring that the best policy for us all was to come back to the specie standard , so that every dollar in money in the hands of the people would be represented by gold and silver coin . That was the law , and I was required to enforce it . I believe , honestly , that the best policy for all , rich and poor , capital and labor , was to bring our paper money up to the standard of gold coin . This , I believe , was the only method to bring us out of the panic . I believe that honestly , but I recognize some among you who believe that was not the right course , You believe the right course was to issue more paper money , and inflate currency to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law on my side , and a determination to carry out my ideas , and I believed it was best for you all . Applause . New , I did execute the law , and that is all the credit I am entitled to . My friends in Ohio are disposed to extol me beyond my merits for simply doing my duty . Now , fellow-citizens , what has been the result 4 Your money is all equal to gold coin . Your silver dollar is equal to gold coin , although its intrinsic value is less .. United States notes , and national bank-notes are always at par with each other . " The result is that all branches of industry are improving . I say to you that but for this resumption of specie payments you would still be traveling through the Slough of Despond . Laborers were out of employment ; capital was idle , and the keystone of the whole financial problem was to bring us back to specie payment . I was going to say back to a Democratic basis . I told a gentleman to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 6 per cent . bonds , money received from the sale of 4 per cent . bonds . Before resumption we would have had to pay it in gold coin but since resumption every dollar has been paid in United States notes . The whole transaction has been accomplished by the exchange of 4 per cent . for 6 per cent . bonds . This has been done without diminishing the circulation . We have as much United States notes and bank notes as we ever had . I believe in the near future the laboring man will have plenty to do and capital will he had for low rates of interest . This has been a long struggle , but all share - the benefit of it no matter what we bought before the result was accomplished . Since resumption our revenues have increased . Although the national taxes are not higher yet , the revenues have increased because business has increased . Our revenues have increased so that for the last year or two we ' have exported nearly $300,000,000 , which is now making our ' country richer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated that over $800,000,000 of bonds were held abroad , whereas we now believe that but $150,000,000 are now held abroad ; and we are now ready to pay these in coin . Applause . Since resumption our public debt has been reduced . In the year 1877 I tried hard to sell some 4 per cent . bonds , and people thought I was a fool for trying it . Yet I sold some $7*,000,000 . In 1878 I tried again , and , although there was difficulty in selling before resumption ? because it required coin to purchase and people had only currency  --  since the 1st of January this year $450,000,000 of 4 per cent . bonds have been disposed of , which means a saving of $11,000,000 in interest every year . " The advantage of our country is that every man has a chance to fill the highest offices in the land if he is but diligent . In this Republic there is no royal road to place . All law can do is to give all men an equal chance . Every man should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens . The black citizen who has a heart and wife has the same right to life and liberty as the haughtiest white man living . Every man who marches to the polls exercises the rights of a freeman , and should be protected in that right whether he lives in the swamps of Lousiana or the sand barrens of Carolina or in this beautiful city . Democrats , Republicans , and Nationals should see that the United States and not Louisiana , South Carolina , New-York City , or any city , make laws which secure every man in the free enjoyment of one vote at every election , and no more . What we want is a fair Election law , having additional barriers which will protect the purity of elections , and not the repeal of those we now have . It will be said , why not leave that matter for the States to settle for themselves ? My answer is this : States do regulate the election of State and municipal officers ; but members of Congress . who exercise your political power in the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that the Constitution has expressly said that Congress t may provide the mode of electing Congressmen . Now , the people elect the Electors who elect the President and the Legislatures which elect Senators , but Congress ought to provide laws to prevent any man from casting 40 or more tissue paper ballots at one election and then go quit of punishment . You must take nothing from the nation for the State , and nothing from the State for the nation . " The nation must prescribe the mode of electing members of Congress ; the State . of electing subordinate officers . You can do nothinf with local laws , and you must do it by national law . You have a national judiciary whom you could invest with enforcement of that law ; then we could punish violators of that law . Now , these are the ideas of the next few years , the ideas of the future of the country . We will have others , but the most important will be whether we shall have honest elections and honest money , and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one personal remark about myself . Some of my newspaper friends have tried to make me a candidate for Governor of Ohio , but I hope that none of you will vote for me in convention or before the people . I propose to stick to my present place until the question of resumption is settled beyond doubt . I want to convince everybody that the experiment of resumption is a success ; that we can resume , that the United States is not bound to have its notes hawked about at a discount , but that a note of the United States may travel about the world , everywhere received as equal to gold coin , and as good as any note ever issued by any nation either in ancient or modern times .
