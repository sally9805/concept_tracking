txt A Municipal Reform Nominating Convention met in Philadelphia on the 20th of this month . This action is none too early . The election will be on the 14th of October . The Rings which have hitherto considered not only the legitimate revenues of the principal offices , but an immense amount of extra pickings , their exclusive property , have long been actively at work . If they are . to be opposed with any efficiency by the Reform men , the latter  --  lone as the period before election may seem to some persons  --  have no time to lose . The difficulties to be surmounted by the Municipal Reformers are very great , and in some respects very unaccountable . In fact , it is not easy to see why they should meet with any serious difficulty at all . That a vast amount of fraud will be brought to bear against thorn is , indeed , to be expected . But entirely aside from these frauds. it is by no means certain that the Reform men will polls majority of the votes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to obtain not only a majority , but a very large one . The newspaper Press is , with a greater approximation to unanimity than the Press in almost any other city displays in regard to any political measure , in favor of the movement . The voters comprise , iifor so large a city , an uncommonly small proportion of the class which unprincipled demagogues usually find it most easy to influence . Large numbers of the working men hold , in their own names , the deeds of the houses they live in ; and . not a few hold these deeds entirely umncumbered . Not only are the great mass of the pepple interested  --  as the great mass of the people are everywhere  --  in low taxation , but the interest of a remarkably large part of them is of a kind which can at once , and without any mistake , be fully comprehended . The need of reform is as obvious and unquestioned as it'possibly could be under any circumstances . Unblushing and gigantic frauds in the execution of many kinds of public work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees are definitely fixed by statute , are things of which the existence is as well known and recognized by the citizens in general as the existence and situation of the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers , But , unaccountable as in some points of view the power of the Rings in Philadelphia is , it is a most serious and indisputable fact . To break down that power thoroughly is the object of the Reform movement . The people of that city have a fondness for thorough work in everything . They are seldom much interested in any undertaking until they see how it can be accomplished in such a manner that it will not need soon to be done over again . The object at which the Reform men are aiming is not merely to get the Rings out of power , but to get them out so that they will stay out . Nobody sees this more clearly than the Ring men themselves ; and it is one of the very reasons for the desperate character of the struggle they are making to maintain their position . As yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been accomplished against them . But although there is apparently so little effect from the Reform movement , there has , in reality , been a great deal accomplished . Frauds which were formerly only suspected , or the knowledge of which was , with most of the citizens , of a very indefinite kind , have now been put before the public in exact figures . Extortions by officials in the " State-house Row . " of which ' the victims had not the means of knowing the extent , have been brought to accurate comparison with legal fees . In a word , the community at large are beginning to know what they formerly only suspected , and to understand the details of what they have hitherto only had the general facts . But besides the diffusion of information , the Reform men have accomplished another object of perhaps fully as great consequence . They have severed in a great measure the connection between the Rings and a certain class of men who were giving them the countenance of respectability . It is far less easy now than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair appearance , and at the same time pocket a portion of the public plunder . A member of the Rings now must , to an extent which until lately was not necessary , be an undisguised member . The temporary effect of this is , perhaps , not beneficial to the tax-payers ; for it sometimes substitutes for men who are held in check by the desire of concealment , those who have no regard whatever for their reputation ; but the ultimate tendency is most materially to assist in breaking down the Rings entirely . tie can not believe that the Reform movement in Philadelphia will be ultimately unsuccessful . Apart from all other things , it is impossible for us seriously to think- that the inhabitants will be willing to show to the strangers that come there to the Centennial a city which in its paving , lighting , and the kind of attention given , to cleaning its streets is so discreditable- , as at present . It is very certain that if did Reform movement fails , foreigners who attend that celebration , whatever opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country , will not , from what they see in Philadelphia , be at all likely , when they return home , to hold up our cities as a model of municipal good management .
