txt No one of our readers who has even a superficial knowledge of the condition of the industrial classes in the two cities=-Philadelphia and New-York  --  can fail to see how far interior our City is in this important respect to the former . Though the Pennsylvania city is not far behind our ownin population , containing now more than seven hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants , and is especially a manufacturing town , and , therefore , exposed to all the evils of this branch of industry , yet none of the terrible problems of pauperism press upon that community which beset our own . The working classes are comparatively prosperous and . contented ; beggary and vagrancy are trifling evils compared to these curses in New-York ; there is no ill-feeling existing in one class against the other , and no possibility of riot or disturbance from want of bread and employment . In fact , all testimony shows that the working classes of Philadelphia are better off and accumulating property more rapidly than in any other American city , unless , possibly , San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our neighboring city 1 - The superiority to NewYork can be accounted for partially on many grounds : The fact that the poorest emigration has not poured its streams into Philadelphia , as here , and that the stock of the population is of a quiet , industrious race , and the site of the city permitted individual dwellings to the poorer classes . But with all these Boring advantages , we believe the great cause has been in a re ' makable economical experiment , tried successfully in Philadelphia and never attempted thoroughly in New-York . We refer to those " building associations " of which we have spoken frequently during the past few years . The evil and curse of New-York , both in sanitary and moral respects , is overcrowding . This degrades our working classes , and reduces them continually to a lower economical position . Unfortunately , this evil grows worse with us , while , in Philadelphia , the condition improves . In 1870 , New-York contained a population of nearly one million , distributed in 64,044 dwellings , or with nearly fifteen persons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Newyork , 365,000 persons were housed in only 17,110 dwellings , or an average of 2l to each dwelling . In Philadelphia , on the other hand , the average for the whole city is only six persons to each house , and in the worst wards , a , little over eight . Since 1870 , about twentyfour thousand dwellings have been built in that city , making the whole number of dwellings there nearly one hundred and thirty-five thousand , which , at an average of six to each house , will give a population this ' year of 810,000 , which is more than the estimated population , so that the inference is probable that less than six persons occupy each house in Philadelphia . If we compare the three cities of NewYork , Brooklyn , and Jersey City with this , we ishall find that about 1,700,000 persons live there now in less than 120,900 houses , or in fewer dwellings than the single city of Philadelphia , with its 750,000 population , occupies . This marked and important difference is dim , in the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed by the working men themselves in the Pennsylvania city . These societies date from the year 1831 , and number , in Philadelphia , more than 500 , and in all Pennsylvania , some 1,000 . It is stated on good . authority that more than 70,000 dwellings are now ' owned by mechanics and men of small means in that city , who have become fee holders through the aid of these associations . The amount of money loaned by them on this kind of property is estimated at from $40 , - 000,000 to $60,000,000 . In the first decade , some 5,000 persons became stockholders , and thus purchased and paid for houses ; during the ' second , the number reached probably 10,000 ; in the third 20,000 , and at present , there are some 50,000 members of these associations who either own or are paying for their own sod others ' houses through the help of these companies . Their monthly payments in the societies are estimated to average $1,000,000 . We have previously explained , in detail , the operations of these associations. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Having paid as tenant $15 per month or $180 per year for a house Worth $1,500 , in ten years his payments amount to $1,800 . But in a Building . deleted 8 lines building associations ailwell as everywhere else . The simple explanation is that the working man isjorcedil , to save by this scheme , and the association , from long experience , knows how to employ money more profitably and at the same time more securely , than the individual himself . If watchful and industrious , the man gains also by the neglect and idleness of his fellow-members , who ' are obliged to pay fines or to forfeit their stock . He pays very high interest , but he gets it back in his house . The principles which have caused the , wonderful success of these " Land Banks " or " Building Companies , " are economy among the members and borrowers , and the oversight and management ' of their own earnings by the workingmen themselves , under sound . methods of investment and . security . The probability is that Philadelphian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations of these successful co-operative societies . They are trained . to the business . We doubt much if our NewYork mechanics and laborers could at once carry on building associations so successfully . Still , it is remarkable that no leader of the working classes has yet attempted to try the scheme in this City .
