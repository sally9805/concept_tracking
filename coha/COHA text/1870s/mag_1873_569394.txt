ARTICLE I. - THE RELIGIOUS ELEMENT OF EDUCA TION AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM . TN Great Britain , on the continent of Europe , and in the various States of our own Union , those who are charged with the interests of edacation find themselves encompassed with difficulties in making provision for the religious element . The " good , old times , " if such they were , when all the inhabitants of a land were of one faith and of one ecclesiastical polity , have gone by , and there is no immediate prospect of their return . In countries which still cling to an established church , dissenting denominations are jealous of their rights , and are clamoring more and more earnestly for the overthrow of State patronage . Where , as in our land , this has been accomplished , and religious equality is constitutionally established , the rivalry of ' sects is eager , and they are properly jealous of governmental ' provisions which are more favorable to one than to another . The educational question can not be separated from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ' common by Church and State . If we enquire into the object of education , we find that it includes equally the culture of the intellect and of the moral // nature . The mind must be informed as to important facts and principles , and must be developed and disciplined in its powers . So also must the conscience be enlightened as to duty , and the heart be trained to love and obey the right . If this be not done , superior intelligence will often result only in more dangerous depravity , affording a higher and shrewder class of criminals . Mere intellectual acquirements are but so much power . To what use the power shall be put , in whose service it shall be employed , must be determined by the moral character of those who possess it . The greatest genius and the most finished scholarship have often been the allies of evil . It is impossible , therefore , to eliminate either of these elements , and they should go hand in hand in the process of education , from the first teachings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prof. J. S. Blackie well says , in his essay on " Christianity " ( " Four Phases of Morals , " p. 201 ) : " The analytic work of the mere understanding , even when practised by a Titan , like Aristotle , is an inadequate method of reaching the highest form of vital reality ; or , to use the words ofGrant , it forces even the greatest minds , at times , to degenerate into a sort of smallness. . . - Mere intellectual culture never can of itself produce a complete and healthy manhood-never can elaborate for a human soul that rich blood which then only appears when the watery element of the understanding is thoroughly permeated by the red particles of the moral and emotional nature . " But on whom rests the responsibility of providing this double education ? Some say on the State ; others , on the Church ; yet others , on both Church and State . Perhaps we should not err were we to affirm that originally it rests rather upon parents ; the family having plainly the precedence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they both are founded , and the individual child being born into the bosom of a family , and not laid down by its Creator at the door of a cathedral , or on the steps of a court-house . The child which God thus places in the hands of parents may not be who ly and unconditionally surrendered by them , either to the Church or to the State ; each of which has often advanced untenable claims in this respect . The family is a distinct and independent // institution , divine in its origin and sanction , and imposing its own duties upon its members . The parents are bound to provide the child with the best intellectual and moral education possible in their circumstances ; that it may pass from under their training into life , equipped for all its struggles . The Church may proffer help on the one side , and the State on the other , but neither may assume solely , or most responsibly , to represent the grand duty of education ; nor may either load the parent with such burdens as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruction to be given to his child . In this respect we would insist on the right of the parent , as against the monopolizing claims of an ecclesiastical corporation , such as the ilomish Church , seeking officially to control the whole education of children ; and as against any overbearing requirements of a civil government , in Prussia or in our own country , which might undertake so vast and expensive a system of instruction , supported by public tax , as to compel a parent to use that alone , even should he find it religiously so defective or erroneous as to be unwilling to entrust his children to it . There are original and reserved rights , in this respect , which parents may not alienate , and on which no other power may trample for its own convenience . Parents were earlier in the world than either priests or rulers . And yet the State can not be absolved from responsibility for general education . It is not , indeed , to act upon the false , " paternal " theory ,  --  in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the State must take everything possible into its own hands , and itself do whatever good thing is to be done ; as though it were only necessary to prove an object to be good , in order to prove , at the same time , that it must be secured by the agency of the State-which is a decided non sequitur . We hold to confining the State to a restricted sphere of necessary action , leaving as wide a range as possible to individual and social enterprise . But we see not how to exclude some educational provision from those limitations . It would seem that the life of a free State , at least , must depend upon an intelligent and moral citizenship . The civil State can not rise higher than the level of its own constituency . Ignorance and moral degradation pave the road for the coming // of despotism . If suffrage is to be universal , so education must be . Voters who can not read the Constitution and laws of their country , or even the ballots which they cast in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are an imminent periL Such a constituency of whites sustained the men who , through a secession in the defence of slave-holding , sought the ruin of our National Union ; and , if we do not take heed , a similar constituency of blacks will work but some other terrible disaster in the future . For self protection , then , to conserve order and obedience to law , and to train citizens able to elect good rulers , and to decide upon disputed questions with intelligence , a free State must , in some way , secure universal education . This might be done indirectly , to a certain extent , by stimulating education instead of providing its instrumentalities ; as , for instance , by requiring that every voter should be able to read and write . But this is not now practicable , and would only partially accomplish the desired end . The test would be loosely applied by the politicians in charge , while multitudes would not be induced by it to seek instruction for themselves and their children in private schools . Nor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church auspices would be found sufficient . It would be unjust to tax one denomination for the education of the children of another in Church schools , and so the schools would be left either to private support , or to a public tax on their own denominations respectively . This might be sufficient in certain communities , but would be quite insufficient in others , where a particular denomination was weak in numbers and in wealth . And the sparse , rural districts would thus be doomed to ignorance ; no denomination being able , it may be , to support a school , and certainly there being neither reason nor chance for three or four . It would then appear to be necessary for the State to provide a system of common schools for its own legitimate purposes . Precisely here the Church puts in a claim , and not without justice . By " the Church , " however , we do not mean the clergy , and by the claims of the Church upon education , we do not mean the claim put forth by the IRomish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools under priestly control . We // have no desire to see teaching made over to ecclesiastics , whether they be priests or ministers . But by the Church is to be understood religious , God-fearing men , organized under whatever forms to maintain Christian truth , support worship , and reclaim the sinful . It also , like the family and the State , is a divine institution . It , likewise , has the most precious interests at stake . Children throng its courts by millions . It seeks to prepare them ' for two worlds . To do this they must be made intelligent in all respects , and especially must they be trained in the principles of morals and religion . No doubt the Church possesses instrumentalities purely spiritual which may partly answer this end . Children may be taught religious truths and duties in the regular services of the sanctuary , in the Sunday School , in the course of parochial visitation by pastors , in special gatherings on Saturdays , when secular schools are not in session , and through parents at home . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's life , these will measurably suffice , if faithfully used ; though , if religion be confined to these opportunities of infusing itself into education , it will operate at a disadvantage , and the scheme must be confessedly imperfect . An ideal method would surely commingle the seeular and religious , every day , in the whole process of instruction ; thus securing unity of impression , correctness and comprehensiveness of thought , and fullness of effect . But we seldom can gain a complete good , or secure a perfect method ; and if the necessities of the State compel it to provide for universal education , by a system of common schools , in order to reach the whole population with certainty , the family and the Church may consent to the plan , provided nothing be taught in the public schools , directly or indirectly , which contravenes the religious faith , properly so called , of denominations and of the parents . We say religious faith properly so called , because it is conceivable that individuals might be found who would make a denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , civil society must assume and teach the fundamental principles of morals , without which it could not exist . To omit these would be suicidal ; for if they must be dropped from the schools , much more must they be dropped from legislation . The practical distinction is clear , however , between strch a case and that // of Christian denominations , or parents , who object to interference with ideas simply religious . But it is found to be difficult to harmonize views on this point , religious prepossessions and prejudices having remarkable power to color the light of mental vision . It would seem to be necessary , in order to impartial justice , that the school instruction should involve only such fundamental ideas of morals and religion as inhere in that Christian civilization which has been accepted , from the first , as the basis of our government Let it be denied that Christianity is the recognized religion of the land , and , on some test case , let the highest tribunals so decide , and all religious ideas , and for aught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting on any divine authority and sanction , must b* excluded from the schools . But that would be fatal to the schools ; as it would undermine the discipline , limit disastrously the studies , occasion endless local controversies , impair seriously the value of the schools to the State , and produce a general demand for the abolition of the system . Accepting Christianity , then , as the basis of our national morals and politics , it is conceivable that good morals may be taught as having the sanction of divine authority . Yet there must be nothing to which a Roman Catholic any more than a Protestant may object , as counter to his distinctive faith . Majorities have nothing to do with settling a point of principle and evenhanded justice . Besides , majorities vary with localities , and if a Protestant majority in one city or district may insist on exercises offensive to the Roman Catholics , in another city or district a Roman Catholic majority may insist on exercises offensive to Protestants . The public schools belong to neither , as such , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any " concession " to Roman Catholics to insist that they shall have this equality of rights . It is simple justice and honesty ) under the Constitution , and in view of the historic fact that if Protestants first settled New England and the Middle States in general , Roman Catholics first settled Maryland , Florida , Louisiana , Texas , Arkansas , Missouri , New Mexico , California , and leading points in all the Northwest . Now it would seem that the rudimental branches of learning , such as reading , writing , arithmetic , grammar , and geography , with a few outlines // of history , might be taught to young pupils without collision with any religious peculiarities . Add to this , simple iustruction in such moral duties as truthfulness , hQnesty , obedience to parents , teachers , and rulers , reverence for age and station , regard for the sacredness of an oath and of the name of God , industry , chastity , courtesy , and universal benevolence , and we have a plain education , sufficient for ordinary life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State demand . It is no doubt deficient on the religious side ; but as the children are of the age in which parents and the Church have them most fully under their influence , and within the reach of the spiritual instrumentalities before mentioned , the detriment need not be serious . We should have common schools supported by public tax , on just principles , while yet they would not be secularized to the extent of making them materialistic and liable to the charge of being godless and irreligious in tendency . Thus far our way seems to be tolerably plain ; at least , if such a scheme be impracticable , either as contravening the wishes of a large part of the people , or as inconsistent with constitutional provisions , then the whole system of common schools must be abandoned . But now our difficulty begins . How can the system of public education include schools of a higher grade than those thus far described , and even rise into colleges or universities ? How can it be thus extended , without failing to impart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without teaching that which is offensive , on properly religious grounds , to some portion of the tax-payers ? If the education be made imperfect and superficial , in order to avoid religious questions , there surely can be no right to tax the public in its behalf ; and especially if , by such tax , the ability of the community shall be seriously impaired to provide other instrumentalities for more thorough instruction . On the other hand , if , to make the instruction adequate , religious views are introduced which contradict the Christian faith of a part of the tax-payers , it is done in violation of justice and of the Constitution . How shall public education steer between this modern Scylla and Charybdis ? We wish it could do so , without striking on the rock , or being engulphed in the whirlpool ; // for the theory is attractive . One might well wish that it were possible to have a complete education , up to the highest limits of knowledge , provided for all who desire it by the united efforts and at the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception imply a state of things the reverse of that which now exists , and one too Utopian to be realized on earth ? What are , and what must be , the facts ? A careful examination will probably show , that , while the high schools and State universities come far short of introducing the religious element to the extent desirable in connection with many of the studies , and never so important as at the present day and for that class of pupils , they yet cross the line of impartiality between religious differences . It may be affirmed that they are on a Protestant basis , and conducted so as to favor Protestant views ; not avowedly , of course ; not consciously , it may be ; yet not the less really . The Roman Catholics so view it , and they ought to be judges of the fact whether their religious opinions are or are not contravened . Besides , it could hardly be otherwise , when the teachers are almost always Protestants , and the text-books are prepared by Protestant authors and compilers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction his fundamental religious conceptions , philosophical , theological , critical , and historicaL Let us consider , , for a moment , the studies pursued in high schools and colleges , that we may determine whether it be possible to teach them thoroughly , and yet favor the views of no religious party as against any other . We have assumed , for argument 's sake , that Christianity is legally recognized as the true religion , and as at the basis of our American civilization ; but we fear that this will not long be conceded . The rationalistic party among foreign immigrants is large , and possesses great political influence . To it must be added the infidel portion of the Spiritists , the ordinary Free Thinkers or Deists , the skeptical scientists and other miscellaneous rejecters of the Bible as an inspired and authoritative revelation . They must number , in all , two or three millions , counting their families ; and to them , so far as Christianity is concerned , we must add also the Jews . What now are their educational rights as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on an equality with those who have faith in the Christian religion ? If the Constitution and laws make no distinction in this regard , they will certainly have ground of complaint against the institutions in question ; and that they have not already demanded what they would call a " complete secularization " of all studies and exercises , is owing to the fact that , until within a few years , their numbers have been small , and the subject has not been up for radical discussions . It will not be so in the future , and soon they will call for such an ignoring of religious ideas as can be granted only at the expense of a false handling of the studies themselves . For , oftentimes , silence concerning truth , or the utterance of half truths , has the effect of positive error . Imagine , then , at the head of a high school , or in a professorship of a State university , an intelligent and skillful teacher , in full sympathy with the infidel and , in some cases , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , French , and German scientists , philosophers , and literati . Would it be possible for him to teach the classics , and explain ancient paganism ; to teach modern literature and civilization and trace them to their Christian sources ; to teach history , and account for the origin and progress of Christianity ; to teach science , and explain the relation of nature to God , in a manner which Christians would not think to be false and superficial ? And what kind of an instructor in those branches would he be who should overlook such topics ? IRe ! igious conceptions are fundamental to all deep thinking , true philosophizing , and intelligent explanation of human history . Well has Prof. John Stuart Blackie said , in his lecture on Socrates ( Four Phases of Morals , pp. 74. 75 ) : " To deny a First Cause , or not to assert it decidedly , is as if a man , professing to be a botanist , should describe only the character of the Rower and the fruit as what appears above ground , while either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seed , without which the whole beauty of the blossom and the utility of the fruit could not exist : or , to take another simile , it is as if a man should curiously describe the cylinders and the pistons and the wheels , the furnaces , the boilers , and the condensing chambers of a steam // engine , and , while doing so , studiously avoid mentioning the name of James Watt . One would say , in such a case , that while the describer deserved great praise for the clearness and consistency with which he had set forth the sequence of mechanical operations , that make up the engine , he had left an unsatisfactory impression on the mind , by omitting the grand fact which rendered the existence of such an engine possible , viz : a creative intellect . We should say that he was a good mechanician and an eloquent expounder of machinery , but we could not call him a philosopher ; he had stopped short , in fact , at the very point where philosophy finds its thrills of peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scientific man , in the same way , who is either a speculative atheist or who studiously avoids any allusion to an original plastic Intelligence as the Ultimate Cause of all things and the Primary Force of all forces , the universe is merely a vast and unexplained machine , performing a closely concatenated series of unintelligent operations , tabulated under the name of LAWS ; and to the moralist , who is only a moralist , society is a machine of another kind , whose wheels and pulleys and bands may be curiously described , and must be kept in nice order , but of whose genesis he can give no intelligible account . It follows , therefore , that a philosophical moralist must be a theist ; and that not only on speculative grounds , but from this practical consideration also , that from no source can the moral law derive the unity and the authority which is essential to it so efficiently as from the all-controlling and unifying primary fact , which we call GOD . " It needs no argument to show , that no skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in character , will bring out with fullness these fundamental relations of science and religion . The signs of the times indicate a conflict , in this respect , between those who believe only in nature , and those who also have faith in the supernatural . It will relate to science , nominally , but will really include religion . There will be no chance for neutrality . And as the combat shall thicken , it will extend to the institutions in question . The infidel scientists will obtain appointments from the politicians , will train pupils after their own heart , and will prepare // text-books in which materialistic and other obnoxious and false ideas will be boldly affirmed to be the teachings of science . Such teachers and text-books will make their way into high schools and State universities , and will there be used to carry out what will be called " a simply secular education . " Thus Christianity will be called sectarian , and will be excluded from State institutions , while infidelity will claim to be unsectarian and secular , and will be taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be unreal , he has not carefully studied the portents ; arid if any one supposes that Christian men would support the upper grades of public education under State auspices , in case of such an intrusion of skepticism , he little knows the stuff of which they are made . And yet a competent instructor iu the branches named must side with Christianity , or with infidelity , in the class room . lf it shall be judicially decided that the law knows no distinction between the two , then the success of either party in s*curing control of the public institutions would be in contravention of the rights of the other , and would lead , in the end , to the overthrow of the system . But the facts are as troublesome if the case be within the pale of Christianity ; for then comes the conflict between the various denominations , Roman Catholic and Protestant , evangelical and unevangelical . Doubtless something could be said by instructors in the higher branches which would be acceptable to all parties . Algebra and geometry , the Latin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ought not to be dangerous or obnoxious to any man 's religious faith . But granting this , there remain studies which can not be intelligently pursued without crossing the line of division between Christian parties . How can English literature be understood without attention to the religious element , which has so largely pervaded and characterized it , and by reason of which it has been so thoroughly Protestant in ideas and spirit ? And what , in such a connection , shall be said of the Bible , which in its received English version , and apart from its religious authority , is a literary classic , has been the almost universal household book and educator , and has influenced our literature more than any other single work , affecting ec*ually thought and style ? // Imagine the difference in the lectures of a Protestant and of a Roman Catholic professor , to a college class , on the prose and poetry of Milton , or even on the plays of Shakespeare ! When nine-tenths of the choicest works in English literature may be among the libri prohibiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , if he be the instructor , and Romish pupils be under his care ; or how is he to be satisfied with the commendation which will be uttered , if a Protestant be the instructor ? Mental and moral philosophy are taught in a widely different manner by these two classes of teachers , who disagree in important principles . Questions as to intuition , consciousness , freedom of the will , the sphere and authority of reason , the province of faith , will run into fundamental theological positions ; and yet they can not be avoided . No Protestant would be willing to have a Roman Catholic train his children in those studies , and as little would a Roman Catholic trust his children to a Protestant instructor . How , then , can a complete scheme of public instruction be made satisfactory to both sections of the Church ? History , unless reduced to a meaningless list of events and dates , involves a radical difference of view between these parties , as also between them both and such a historian as Buckle or Tame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in each case , would be thought to be written in the interest of one or the other rival churches ? All can see that what are called " the dark ages " present quite opposite characteristics to a Romish and to a Protestant mind . Nothing can be plainer than that the Reformation has affected the entire history of the world for three centuries , and yet how can Romanists and Protestants agree in their statements of that influence ? And what coincidence of view could there be as to the massacre of St. Bartholomew 's , or as to the character and influence of the Holy Inquisition ? Nor would Protestants agree more nearly among themselves in respect to other periods and events in history . Imagine the discrepancy between the statements of a High Church Episcopalian and a Congregationalist respecting the Puritan Non-Conformists and the Pilgrim Fathers ! These are but specimen cases of differences which would be perpetual . But no high school , no college , can have a complete course without including history . Yet it is not // unreasonable to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can teach religion ; and for the same reason . It would , in so doing , be necessitated to decide between the warring beliefs of its citizens , and would practise the inj ustice of compelling one or the other portion of them to pay for having their most cherished faith assaulted . Without multiplying illustrations further , it must be evident that , in exact proportion as pupils are advanced in their studies , do the religious difficulties multiply in the way of education at the public expense . The older the pupils become , the more exposed are they to error in connection with the new studies to which they are then introduced . Those studies ought not to be superficially pursued . They can not be taught thoroughly without entering upon questions which divide religioQs parties . If this be so , the fact will become more and more apparent , and will justly occasion a demand that the free school system shall be restricted to the primary branches , and that high schools and colleges shall be left to such voluntary provision as may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals , or as corporate bodies . It will be the more easy to make this distinction between the lower and the higher schools , because the latter are for the direct benefit of but a very small percentage of the youth of our land . In Boston itself but 4 per cent of the school attendance is in the high schools , while Chicago shows but 1* per cent . It might not be unreasonable to leave this small number to such other provision as might be made for their wants . That all children should be taught the rudiments of education at public expense is almost self-evident ; that the few  --  the one to four per cent. - who care to pursue higher studies should also be public beneficiaries is by no means as clear . That it is an advantage to those few directly , and to the rest of the community indirectly , does by no means prove the position . There is scarcely a benefit of any kind which might be bestowed at public expense upon a few , which could not be shown to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are properly jealous of allowing government to enter upon that road . It does not follow that because government carries letters to every man 's door , that , therefore , those who wish freight transported should find a government // express to carry their boxes and barrels . Industry is as essential as knowledge to the public welfare ; but that fact does not demonstrate the propriety of establishing , by general tax , government shops , in which every boy and girl may learn a trade , and every man and woman may find steady employment It is cheerfully granted that , if there were no other method of securing a higher education , the interests of the State would make it just to provide the facilities at the public expense . There must be competent teachers , leaders , and rulers . But the necessity of a State provision has not been proved . If once it were needed , in days of ignorance , the circumstances have now entirely changed , both in that respect , and in the relation of the higher education to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater currency , if it shall appear that the high schools , with all their expense , fail to accomplish those results of a liberal education which ought to be mauifest . It may be denied that such is the case , but one fact is attracting wide attention ; their failure , as compared with the old academy system of New England , to supply students to the colleges . The Chicago High School sometimes sends to college four or five students , from its graduating class , and sometimes none . The New Haven High School , under the very shadow of Yale , and with one of the finest buildings in the country , does not undertake to fit youth for college . Everywhere the State universities complain that their halls are unsupplied with students from the high schools , and that thus the system breaks in twain in the middle . Certainly more youth in humble circumstances , in proportion to the population , found their way to college through the old academies of New England , than do through the boasted aid of modern high schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The American High School : Its Claims and Its Work , " thus reasons on this relation of the high school : " Whether a high school shall fit students for college must be determined in each individual case upon principles of a wise economy . As a matter of fact , most towns could more economically send abroad for preparation those of their youth who display predilections for a college course than provide them with suitable instructors at home . The Boston Latin School , prob // ably the oldest and most popular , as well as the most favorably situated public preparatory school in the country , during the last sixty years has sent out an annual average of only about thirteen students fitted for college . Chicago and Cincinnati , each with from four to six hundred high school pupils , succeeds in getting off to college yearly a squad of from five to seven young men . The statistics of all the high schools of the West , were they accessible , would undoubtedly show but meager results in this direction . The lesson from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own work without reference to the college , in a few favorably-situated places , attaching the preparatory work to itself as an addendum . " The old academies and the preparatory schools of the colleges show very different results , and that owing , in part , to religious influences brought to bear upon the minds of young men by their instructors . And now , will not Christian people have occasion of just complaint , if the public system fails of imparting the necessary religious and thorough education , and yet by its taxation and rivalry prevents them from establishing their own institutions ? The case will seem to stand thus : The State does not and can not impart a full education , because it can not enter upon disputed religious points , which yet pertain to the most important branches of study ; neither can it connect with its discipline and general influence on character those directly religious instrumentalities , by which the young have ever been most favorably affected . Being thus , in a measure , impotent , it nevertheless insists on occupying the field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits or destroys the ability of Christian people to found and sustain more thorough educational institutions , in which they can carry out their own principles without invading the rights of others . For , although the tax to support a high school may be a very minute rate-one mill or even one-tenth of a mill on the hundred dollars-such a rate on the entire taxable property of the community will raise a sum which will put it out of the power of Christian people to rival it by their voluntary contributions . The State says , in effect , to Christian parents , that they must not look to it for the complete instruction which their sons and daughter* re // quire ; but yet they must pay taxes to support the deficient secular system , and to make it opulent above all possible rivals ; and then , if they choose to risk the costly experiment , they may establish other institutions under the shadow of those of the State , in confessed weakness and inferiority ! Does not the whole difficulty spring from an attempt to imitate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was only practicable in the old world , under a union of Church and State , and where all the people were of one professed religious faith ? We have no desire to substitute a mere sectarian scheme , with its petty rivalries and numerous weak institutions . With the present tendencies toward Christian union and codperation , we should hope , crc long , to see distinctively Christian institutions on a common basis ; not by the united efforts of two denominations , which always end in contention for the mastery , but of those of all denominations of Protestants who are in fundamental agreement . If the IRoman Catholics , the evangelical Protestants , and the " Liberal " Christians should choose to have their separate arrangements for higher education , so much of rivalry might be wholesome in effect . And then , if unbelievers wish for their sons and daughters an education which omits all religious truth , and is " purely secular , " from beginning to end , let them provide it at their own expense . Why should they expect the State to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian men to support a system to which they are in conscience opposed ? Is it an incredible or an unreasonable thing , that there should be a conscience against an irreligious system of higher public education ? May it not prove to be as strong and as enlightened as a conscience against a religious element in a public system ? These are questions which will be raised more frequently and earnestly in the future than in the past . They will be discussed in the religious denominations , and they will finally come up for settlement at the ballot-box . And this is the more certain to be , since the overthrow of slavery has taken out of our politics the question whether barbarism was to prevail in our land , and has left us face to face only with the topics which pertain to a Christian civilization .
