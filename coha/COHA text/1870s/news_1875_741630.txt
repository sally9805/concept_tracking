txt The charges incurred by grain in its long journey limn the principal producing States of the West to the sea-board constitute a subject in which the whole country is greatly interested . While the element of Lost transportation is bv us means the only one in the problem ofThred to the agricultural States , nor , perhaps , even the principal one , it is sufficiently important to make any contribution of clearly-established facts regarding it , interesting to tho mercantile community . on this ground the report of the Senate Committee on Terminal Charges , which we published yesterday morning , is well worth attention . It sets forth with considerable precision the various items in the cost of getting grain from the hold of a canal-boat , after its arrival in this port , to the bottom of a foreign-bound vessel . The sum of these items is , according to the committee , in I he close neighborhood of $5 fir each 100 bushels . This stun is made up as follows : Weighing , 75 cents ; elevating , 75 cents ; storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " charge to vessel , " 61 ! . ; cents to 80 cents ; clearing , 2.5 cents , and the remainder is set down to towing , wharfage and llarbor-master 's fees . Ou the other hand , the stone grain is subjected at Buffalo to a series of charges amounting , on the average , according to the committee , to $2 82 per 100 bushels . Tho soon , therefore , of terminal charges , at both ends of the canal route , is ; $1 " 82 per 100 bushels . The committee conclude that these charges are " unreasonably high ; " that in consequence of theta " new and competing routes have been opened , the commerce of the canals " has been " crippled , " and " the interests of the carriers seriously threatened . " If not checked , the committee believe that this state of things will result in the " destruction of the commerce of the State . " We are not inclined to dispute the coin- mittee 's conclusions touching the importance or probable consequences of the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that these should bo discussed , and if there is tiny way in which the charges can be reduced , without incurring risk of greater difficulties than these interpose , by all means let it be done . But the committee propose no such method . They content themselves with a vague and indefinite suggestion that " the Legislature should second any proposition that will consummate these results " ? tliat is , that will secure for the State the benefit of . reduced terminal charges . This is all very well , so far as it goes , but it obviously does not go far . Who is to make the proposition referred to by the committee 1 Whoever may undertake to do so will find an intricate and not very pleasant task on hand . So far as the Legislature is concerned , it has no clear power in the premises . The persons who make these charges and the persons who pay them are entirely beyond the jurisdiction of the Legislature , so far as that transaction goes . Both are free agents . The Legislature can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bo observed . It can not say what the contract shall be . That is not in its field , and it . witl be a sorry day for the interests of all concerned when such matters ale included in its field . It was very generally alleged , at the lime that this matter was referred to the Canal Committee of the Senate , that the reference was intended to secure in some way an offset to the canal investigation . That was supposed to be the motive of Mr. JARVIS Lout ) , its prime instigator . If any such intention existed , it has been brought to naught . We can not see how the utmost ingenuity even of a " boss " canal contractor could get out of this report any consolation for the exposure which tile canal thieves have strtlered both through the columns of THE TimEs and officially . There may have been a notion t lint a lute and cry raised against the proprietors of the elevators at . Bulralo and New-York would drown the charges against the Canal Ring . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more oppressive ' becomes the extortion of the ling . If carriers are fleeced by private corporations , it is the more reason why they should not be plundered by the State . We notice that the committee report that the facts which they give ill regard . to terminal charges at Buffalo " should have important influence in determining the propriety of reducing the tolls on the canals . " But how ? The committee show that there is very nearly a monopoly in the elevating business at . Buffalo , and that the charges of the company which has secured the monopoly are such as apparently yield large profits . But what has this to do with the propriety of the Legislature 's reducing the tolls on the canals ? That in a question which is touch talked of , but not very thoroughly understood . At present , it is plainly a ordinate matter . The first thing for the Legislature to do is to secure an honest and economical management of the canals .
