" DE GUSTIBUS . " WHEN Madame De Sta*l said that taste teaches what we should avoid , she left her definition half finished . If taste only taught us that , we should be reduced to a state of aesthetical atrophy , or rather to that forlorn condition in which Sancho Panza found himself at the dinner table , when dish after dish disappeared before the . hungry governor at the instance of his too cautious medical adviser . There is indeed a direct analogy between the physical sense and the intellectual attribute which most languages express by the same word , and it is nowhere more apparent than in the extraordinary diversity of choice which is common to both . We all have our conventional notions of good manners-of what is to us real eye-pleasure or ear-pleasure . The sources of gratification to sight and hearing are as numerous and opposite as those which are experienced by the palate itself . In the whole range of gastronomy , from the appreciation of caviare to a relish for cow-heel , there is no more of epicurism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental appetite . The gradations of taste in the highest sense of the word are infinite . For instance , we all know that it would be hopeless to set up in any given sphere of life a standard of aesthetics which should be followed by all who move in that sphere . The influence of education , of temperament , of association , of example , would soon be felt in a thousand different ways , and would render our definition of taste ( in so far as it implies excellence of judgment ) impossible . The truth is that this faculty is dependent on , and has in a great measure to accommodate itself to , the age in which we live , the country which we inhabit , and the condition of life in which we are born . That code of good manners which it was once the fashion to call etiquette requires constant revision ,  --  is in fact being constantly revised from time to time . How many changes have we seen in our own day , from the stately " deportment " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the free and easy habits of their grandsons ! The " swell " of 1878 differs as much from the " buck " of 1838 as the buck of that date differed from a " dandy " of the Brummel type , and Brummel himself from a " maccaroni " of a previous age . The change is not always in one direction . In some matters our social by-laws have relaxed their severity ; in others have become more stringent . Children are no longer expected to address their father as " sir , " nor to bow to their parents on entering a room , as was once the custom . On the other hand , a boy from Eton who should now use as much license in speech , and abuse servants in such language as was common with young gentlemen a generation or so ago would hardly be considered a gentleman at all . The rules laid down by Lord Chesterfi*Ad for the behavior of his son at table , etc. , sound as obvious in the ears of a modern youth of good breeding as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first letter of the word " horse . " School-mistresses are not still obliged to inveigh against the impropriety of eating peas with a knife . We have reached an age of refinement when such points are universally concedec* yet it must be confessed that the rising generation has contracted certain habits of dress and carriage which would have been thought slovenly half a century ago . " Until I was fifty years of age , " said an old gentleman once to the writer of these lines , " I never thought of sitting in an arm-chair unless I was unwell . " Now every young bachelor sprawls upon the sofa to read or smoke . The deference , too , which was formerly paid to the aged by their juniors has diminished so much that it promises to be fairly obliterated . In the early part of this century , boys of eighteen were still boys , who did not venture to join in the conversation of their elder relatives unless they were encouraged to do so , which was but seldom . If they expressed an opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Greek youth , who were accustomed to hang their heads down in the presence of their elders . In our own day , the social /ogct virilis is assumed much earlier , and a lad who is still at school will often answer and argue with Paterfamilias as if the two were on an equal footing . It is unnecessary to discuss here the merits of the change or to consider how far this increase of familiarity-although it may diminish the respect-will often increase the love which a son bears to his father . The fact is merely mentioned as one of many causes which make it difficult to give any permanent definition of taste in its relation // to good manners while good manners themselves are subject to such continual changes of fashion that the habits of a well-bred man in one century would be barely tolerated by modern society in the next . It will perhaps be argued by some that it is the acquaintance with , and selfaccommodation to , these conventional rules which constitute good manners in any age . But this is an axiom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , the more we attempt to associate taste with moral influence the more perplexing seems the problem to be solved . Was any court more punctilious than that of Louis XIV. ? Was not his late Majesty , King George IV. , known as " the first gentleman of Europe ? " Whether the British public is actually and sincerely more moral in the nineteenth century than it was a hundred years ago , is another question upon which we need not here enter . There are ethical as well as aesthetical fashions , and philosophers have found them both as mutable as the taste which guides us in the choice of furniture or dress . A popular vice often stands in the same relation to the principles of virtue as a popular ugliness does to the laws of beauty . The moralists of Addison 's time would not have urged a single plea in defense of drunkenness . The artists of our own day universally condemn the shape of a modem hat . But the author of the " Defense of the Christian Religion " continued to tipple unrebuked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millais would care to walk down Regent street with any head-covering but that which gentlemen usually wear in London . In these cases , custom becomes not only a second nature , but a new doctrine . However great may be the difference which time creates in our taste , through altered habits and customs , it does not impress us so much as those social peculiarities which separate one nation from another . In the first case the change is gradual ,  --  so gradual that it is hardly perceived . The decorum or licentiousness of a royal court , the good or bad teaching of a popular writer , will exercise an influence by degrees . The young are naturally imbued with the spirit of the age in which they live ; the middle-aged unconsciously accommodate themselves to it ; while those who have grown old under a different re'gime , if they do not adopt the new precepts , have at least the discretion , for the most part , to abstain from open disregard of their practice . But the manners of a Frenchman in London or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted with the nature of the society which he enters for the first time , have at once the effect of inducing comparisons not always favorable to the new-coiner 's nationality , and certainly disparaging to his taste . It is in vain to tell a French haberdasher that we do not think it necessary to raise our hats on entering an English shop . In John Bull 's omission of that ceremony he only sees a vulgar insolence . In the same way , when we meet a German savant at dinner , who clutches his knife half-way down to the blade , and uses his fork for a purpose which certainly was not contemplated in its manufacture , it is not sufficient for us to know that he is but doing what his countrymen do every day . We at once consider his behavior as disgusting and ungentlemanlike . The fulsome gallantry which passes for politeness to women , the clap-trap sentiments and obvious insincerity of Parisian life , nay , the very cut of foreign coats and boots , may raise in our minds an involuntary evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of their own country , no shadow of fault could be found . It is true that these are difficulties which the rapidly increasing intercourse of nations may tend to remove ; but we are obliged to admit that a long period of time must yet elapse before we can arrive at anything like an international criterion of good taste . If universal principles of moral taste can be said to exist at all , they are seen in that amiable forbearance and genuine unselfishness which find , let us hope , individual representatives in every nation . It is , after all , a due consideration for the feelings of others and the tact . which , without dishonesty , avoids offending them that make this quality of most value in our dealings with one another , and it is agreeable , in this light to find a direct relation between the profession of Christianity and the attributes of a gentleman . This is the precious talisman which , if rightly used , retains for us the . pleasure of a lasting friendship , secures the peace and union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and daughters , makes a happy home , and robs life itself of half its bitterness . The " right man in the right place " has become a proverbial character ; but the right word in the right place must first fit him for his own . How much needless apprehension , misunderstanding , dispute and endless enmity , social , political and domestic , might have been avoided by some little word which judgment // and good taste should dictate ! We sneer at the teaching of a Machiavelli , but if we used half the penetration and sagacity in our intercours*e with fellow-men which he recommends for the guidance of a state , it would be better for most of us . Of course , it is not intended to praise the Italian diplomatist in any other sense than that in which the unjust steward of the Parable is commended . It is possible to avoid backsliding without indulging in injudicious candor . Perhaps , after all , in its practical result , the lirst is the lesser evil of the two . That blow in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recoils with double violence on the assailant himself . If it is deserved , it is not harder to bear or more fatal in its result than if it were openly administered . If it is undeserved , we have friends who quickly come to the rescue ; let the injury be but brought to light and woe to the offender who has caused it ! The idle gossip of the world is unheeded by those whose good opinion we care to preserve , and as for others , their blame will sound like praises in most ears ; while deliberate and malicious calumniation is sure to be openly rebuked by honest men . What gentleman ever listened to vile aspersions of a character which he knew to be prompted by unkindly feeling ? What gentleman ever repeats the silly chit-chat about A or B which he has had no means of verifying ? The real opinions which we form of any man are in the main our own . We have not picked them up at a club or kettle-drum . The most important points of every man 's character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her hundred tongues . Of course , our minor weaknesses-those little frailties and idiosyncrasies , without which the study of humanity itself would be but dull monotony-will always be freely discussed while we are absent . Who would wish it otherwise ? Unless we imagine ourselves perfect we know these faults exist ,  - -  know them better perhaps than any one can tell us . Why then should we seek any further information on the subject ? Let us leave it for our friends ' amusement . Jones ridicules Robinson 's affectation and the attention which he pays to his dress . Robinson laughs at the uncouth manner and slovenly appearance which distinguish Jones . Poor Brown 's peculiarities become a butt for both the former gentlemen ; and yet there is no reason why all three of them should not remain very good friends . The man must be a fool who can expect to be spared from such criticism  --  a greater fool who should desire to have it repeated to him . We all know that people canvass their friends ' characters more freely out of their presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no one calls this dishon* est . It is a uniVersally accepted license granted and taken in turn by all members of society . But your plain-spoken man who will give you , as the phrase goes , a piece of his mind , who tells you of your faults to your face in what he thinks a candid sort of fashion , who blurts out his opinion on this or that subject without the slightest regard for your feelings-such a friend as this may be the very soul of sincerity , but a very disagreeable companion . It is quite possible to express dissent or disapprobation more gently than this without stooping to hypocrisy , and it is the judicious steering between these two extremes which men of the world best understand and which constitutes one of the chief elements of good taste . There are many occasions on which the exercise of this quality will occur to most people as obviously necessary , and yet it is astonishing how often its consideration is entirely overlooked . For instance , there is scarcely any point on which a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of his religious faith . Yet how often do we hear in mixed society , and especially among younger men , expressions of ridicule launched against certain creeds , - sometimes against religion altogether ,  --  for the sake of some silly double-en/en/c or stupid anecdote , the whole essence of whose wit depends on its profanity . This species of joking , pitiful and paltry as it is , may cause exquisite pain and indignation to some listeners who not only have the mortification of hearing it , but as is well known will be prevented from openly protesting against it by a fear lest they should be thought officious or pharisaical . This form of irreverence , therefore , apart from all higher considerations , is as cowardly as it is cruel , and may be reckoned among the most glaring instances of bad taste . Great absence of delicacy not unfrequently characterizes men of active benevolence and generous impulse . They set about their alms-giving and various acts of kindness in a blustering sort of fashion , with a perfect conviction that what they are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-creatures , and that is all they care about . The modus ojerandi is utterly // ignored . It seldom occurs to these good people that the recipients of their bounty or charity have any other concern with the matter than to take it and be thankful . The sense of obligation or honest pride that makes a gentleman hesitate before accepting favors which he may never be able to return is forgotten in many a scheme of every-day philanthropy . It is doubtful whether any barrier to social intercourse which may exist in a difference of rank or intellect is ever equal to that which a great disparity of worldly means often interposes between man and man . In the first two cases the inequality seems inevitable . We are content to acknowledge a superiority which the laws have decreed or which is the gift of nature . Thus intimacies frequently exist between men of widely different stations of life and unequal mental capacity . The two conditions soon accommodate themselves to each other , and either fall into the tacitly acknowledged relation of patron and client , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship . But supposing all other circumstances equal , the line drawn between affluence and comparative poverty is more strongly marked , and presents on one side certainly a keener contrast than any comparison which birth or intellect could provoke . Titles are , for the most part , hereditary ; genius is inborn ; but a fortune may be , and indeed nowadays frequently is , acquired in a single generation by the most adventitious freaks of destiny . Gentlemen constantly find themselves outbidden in social positions , on the hustings , in their matrimonial projects , by fellow-citizens who but for their money would be nowhere . A professional man of education and refinement , after years of toil and trouble , after forfeiting the pleasures of his youth and wearing out his brains in devotion to his calling , may by and by discover that he is dependent for his bread on the caprice of a lucky cheese-monger . How many painters and architects , for instance , have writhed under the overbearing vulgarity ofa parvenu who firmly believes that he has a right to criticise their taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In his mind , the whole affair resolves itself into a commercial question . He treats the designs submitted to him as so many firkins of butter or bales of cotton . He will get as much as he can for his money . He will get the best he can for his money . But he forgets that whereas in the one case he knows as well as the seller what good butter and good cotton should be , he does not know as well as the artist what constitutes a good picture or a wellplanned house . Apart from these professional relations , the mere fact of unequal fortune is sufficient obstacle to prevent any great intimacy between men who are , even in point of birth and education on a common footing . Their habits of life are different ; their tastes fre* quently become different . Character itself yields to the potent influence of wealth or the painful minuteness of needful economy . No man of spirit cares to be indebted to his neighbor for comforts and luxuries which , but for the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference to the cost of pleasure begets a sort of careless vanity or vulgar ostentation , indigence , on the other hand , has its dangers . The petty considerations which embarrass a man will sometimes make him mean , but oftener he will hug his very poverty with a foolish pride . The good taste of those who find themselves in either of these extreme positions is shown by the manner in which they comport themselves toward each other . No one but a nouveau ric/ze cares to flourish his success before his less fortunate companions ; the vulgarity of the display is so very obvious that he would be at once ashamed of it . There is more excuse for the apologetic uneasiness , and depressing sense of contrast which the needy feel in their intercourse with society . And yet if we analyze the feeling , it is just as reprehensible . You are asked to dine with A , a man in humble circumstances . He orders trumpery French en/re'es from the confectioner round the corner , gets the green-grocer to wait upon you , and treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better dinner for half the money , if he had been contented with humbler viands , and allowed Betty to serve them . It is the fashion to call this sort of folly dishonesty , and ascribe it to the desire of keeping up false appearances ; but this seems to be an unnecessarily severe conclusion . Your host may only aspire to return your hospitality in a manner which will please you . He has not the good taste to perceive that even if the dinner had really come from Gunter 's and the champagne was Clicquot 's best , your enjoyment of it would have been marred by the knowledge that he could not afford what he was giving . B , on the other hand , bids you to his table , where you find a roast leg of mutton and potatoes . He pledges you in good // draught beer ; and you might feast with great satisfaction to yourself if he did not spoil all by continually repeating the fact that you are dining with a l ) OO* man , and that though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expect , etc. , etc . The relation in which men of unequal birth stand to each other involves a question of taste which is not easily settled . English moralists have , of late , cried he upon toadyism to such an extent that one is almost ashamed to confess acquaintance with a lord . And yet there is no country in the world where a titled name commands such respect as in England . It is easy to explain this by saying that the aristocracy of this country is not a cheap aristocracythat it represents an illustrious descent or an intellectual worth which is deserving of public esteem . But this was not always the case . Even in our own day men have been raised from the ranks with no such claim . Yet we know the mere prefix of a " Sir " before a name goes far to this day at a committee meeting or in a ball-room . Whether it be a fault or a virtue this is a national peculiarity . The lines of social demarcation are nowhere more emphatically indicated than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor are they attended by the absurdities of etiquette which the Hindoo or Brahmin faith might impose , but they separate by a stern law of artificial life , class from class in a manner which is unknown elsewhere in modern Europe . They are drawn through all grades of society , from the most elevated coterie down to the humble offices of domestic life . A French bonne is much more a servant in her dress , and far more humble in her notions than an English nursemaid . Yet an English nursemaid would not presume to address her mistress in the familiar language which the French bonne would use toward madame . She could not be trusted with the license ; not , heaven knows , because the English character has less diffidence in its composition than the French , but because she would at once forget her station . A German gentleman sees nothing infra dig . in shaking hands with his tailor , but an Englishman knows that if he were to admit his tradesmen to the same privilege , they would probably first undervalue it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful fact , that if you wish to command civility and attention in an ordinary London shop where you are not in the habit of dealing , it is necessary to assume an air of calm superiority to the gentleman across the counter . If you approach him with a humble manner , he will regard you with an eye of suspicion . But , if you are polite to him , he will often treat you with absolute contempt . These are only some familiar illustrations out of many which might be selected to show that this superiority or precedence of class over class is not only assumed downward , but looked for upward in England . It is to be feared that the romantic notions of British freedom formed by Roman peasants and Venetian gondolieri might find realizatiQn in a sort of bondage from which they would gladly escape . What are commonly known as the " lower orders " here have much more political but far less social liberty than they enjoy under the rule of some foreign states . The origin of this state of things with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to the gross ignorance which has so long characterized our English poor . The mental condition of a London laborer or small tradesman was not many years ago , perhaps in some instances still is , far inferior to the average capacity of similar classes on the Continent . In Germany , where education has long been compulsory and undertaken by the state , the humblest errand boy is better informed on most subjects than those who would be in the position of his employers here . It would therefore be most undesirable to allow familiarity from those who have never learned the dangers of its abuse . The same reasons may , in a modified sense , be assigned to the want of sympathy and cordiality which has existed between the aristocracy and middle-class life . Intellect has with few exceptions found its proper level in every age . But it requires intelligence of a peculiar order  --  a rare combination of the best qualities of head and heart  --  to endow men with that degree of refinement which is necessary to fit them for a higher sphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the society of those whose superior breeding and more polished manners are due not only to education but to Nature herself . Should these conditions , however , be fulfilled , the desire which prompts men to associate with others , who though occupying a higher social station , are more their equals in regard to intellect and manner than most men of their own standing , is natural enough . No one can be blamed for seeking that sort of company , whether among his betters or his inferiors , from which he can really derive an honest pleasure . It is the running after // a mere title for the sake of self-aggrandizement and the abject truckling for worldly objects which constitute real toadyism . There is often as much vulgarity exhibited in a contempt , whether real or affected , for what outsiders call the beau monde as there is in the overtures which are made to gain its favor . One is the result of a sickly sense of dependence ; the other of a rampant egotism , and both tend to what every gentleman must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most obvious test which we apply to ascertain each other 's social characteristics is derived , of course , from conversation . The manner in which our ideas are expressed , although it may leave unrevealed all that pertains to moral disposition , is a ready index of taste , or rather of the extent to which we possess that amiable wariness of mind which we call tact , and which is in truth the very soul and essence of good breeding . A morose nature will take especial delight in contradictions . Some people are never so well pleased as when they can gainsay what they hear , at once , and without qualification . " Is that your opinion ? Well , I do n't think so . " " Pardon me , no/king of the kind ever happened " ; or , " I differ from you compie/ely . " These are the expressions of a man who is charmed to be at variance with you . If he could agree with your remarks he would not be half so happy . Should you be wrong in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . He must do so in his own vulgar bullying fashion ,  --  with such a flourish of trumpets as shall not be mistaken for anything but victory . We may place in the same ranks with such a character the vain and narrow-minded enthusiast , who looks on the whole world from his own point of view , and refuses to regard any subject but in the light by which he himself may be imperfectly illumined . He will not modify his theories one jot in discussion whether they be theological , political or artistic . He is absolutely right , and everybody who does not agree with him is absolutely wrong . The endless variety of condition and impulse to which the human heart and mind are subject is totally ignored by him . it never occurs to such a man that two people may hold very opposite opinions on many subjects and yet be both justified in doing so . Instead of " suum , " he reads meu ; n " cuique " and would have the whole world cry , Amen . Another sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which certain small wits hold to be their right . Most people will admit that , in social and convivial circles , the man who enjoys a reputation of being " amusing " frequently becomes an insufferable bore . It may not be always his own fault ; but a man of this stamp is generally so spoiled by flattery , so long accustomed to look upon himself as an everlasting source of entertainment , that he not only believes everything he says must be entertaining , but that it is his incumbent duty to say as much as possible . The consequenqe is that his friends have to listen to a monologue of more or less interest , and find that any remark which they chance to make is only made an excuse for repartee . Of course , the same objection may be raised against any excessive talker , whatever may be the worth of his discourse . The prolonged attention which is given in a lectureroom can not be expected in ordinary society , when everybody is looking for his turn to speak . The most loquacious persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening-or , at least , of seeming interested in what others say-is one of the most important elements of polite conversation and good manners . Next to garrulity , in order of objectionableness , stands that mysterious reserve noticeable in some characters , and of which it is impossible to say how much proceeds from natural shyness , how much from a sour and ungenial disposition , and how much from actual stupidity . It seems paradoxical to say so , but an undue diffidence not unfrequently results from a certain kind of inactive vanity . A man must think a great deal about himself before he cares what others think of him ; and it is frequently the foolish notion that everything he says and does will be important enough to demand criticism , which makes a timid man cautious and silent . Moreover , it is. well known that those people are most anxious to maintain their dignity who have little real dignity to maintain . Servants , for instance , are much more punctilious about the nature of their duties than those who employ them ; and often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to answer a bell or carry a parcel , their master , had need been , would have readily undertaken the duty himself . Thus men of an insignificant presence or dull understanding frequently assume a much more lofty air in society , where they think it necessary to assert themselves , than those whose superior manners or abilities command a real respect . // The former , conscious of their own deficiencies and adopting an artificial substitute , may be compared to a man on stilts , who holds his head higher than his companions , but walks uneasily , because unnaturally ; while others , who are content to be as nature made them , go through the world with less pretensions , indeed , but with infinitely more comfort to themselves and all around them . It appears that some men of this class either affect , or are really possessed by , a total apathy for everything which excites an interest in healthy minds . They have not a note of admiration in their composition . The language of praise never flows from their lips .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  the musician wastes his sweetest strains . For them the painter plies his magic art in vain . All that is fair and lovable in nature and humanity seems but a dead letter to these cold batrachian tempers . The genial current of the soul is frozen up , and sympathy with the outside world becomes impossible . In the society of such people no cheerful intercourse takes place , and life itself can only wear a dull and leaden aspect . Is anything more irritating than the sulky indifference with which they meet the remarks of those who have the spirit and capability to appreciate and enjoy ? That half-muttered assent - that dreary shrug of the shoulders-fill an earnest man with honest indignation . Truly it would seem as if an absence of all taste were more intolerable to contemplate than taste which is even wrongly directed . Women are , as a rule , possessed of such natural shrewdness and keen perception in the affairs of ordinary life , that any deficiency of moral taste in them proceeds from bad discipline of the heart rather than from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors in what may be called the by-play of life 's drama ; and so , undoubtedly , they are , when they have an end in view , and especially when desirous to please . But if no such object exist , envy , hatred , malic&amp;and uncharitableness rise to the lips of an illtempered woman as surely as bubbles to the surface of a troubled stream . Who has not noticed the knitted brow , the scornfully curled lip , the flushed cheek , the bridled chin , and silly sneers of petty rivalry and peevish displeasure which mar sometimes the fairest faces ? A girl who has been injudiciously brought up , who has been petted and spoiled by her relatioiis , whom no one has dared to contradict , and who has been accustomed to receive the homage of her little circle ; bids fair to be less liked in general society than many with half her good looks and accomplishments . The Petruchio who has the taming of such a Katherine is not , indeed , to be envied . It requires no little courage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world will not be prepared to render her that deference which she was accustomed to exact at home . Such a woman , consumed by endless jealousies , is always ready to depreciate those qualities of her own sex which she does not herself possess , and , instead of paying honest tribute to the excellence of characters which do not accord with her own , finds , like Pope 's Atossa , a sort of malicious pleasure in disparagement . " Who with herself , or others , from her birth Finds all her life one warfare upon earth : Shines in exposing knaves , and painting fools , Yet is , whate'er she hates and ridicules No thought advances , but her eddy brain Whisks it about , and down it goes again . " If moral taste is the natural consequence of good breeding and an amiable disposition , it is evident that it must be wanting in such a character . On the other hand , what better example of kindly forethought and subtle delicacy can be found than in the bearing and conversation of an amiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please without resorting to the sickly wiles of coquetry ; gentle and refined in all she says and does ; ever ready to defend instead of to malign ; she is literally incapable of giving offense to any whose good opinion is worth retaining , and she may , indeed , be considered a perfect model of that precious quality which unites the wisdom of the world with true benevolence of heart . It is interesting to compare the points of resemblance which exist between moral and resthetical tastes . It would seem at first that the principles which rule the one and the other had much in common ; and so they have , in a certain sense . But it must be remembered that whereas the former has but one origin and object , viz. , the desire to please , and is exposed to no conflicting influences , the perceptive faculty , on the other hand , is multiform in its direction , and varies so much in nature and extent that it may be said to belong in an equal degree to those who hold diametrically opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good manners in any individual age or country ; but taste , understxd as a // 744 right appreciation of beauty , is not only affected by a diversity of education and the caprice of fashion , but is swayed by all the subtle idiosyncrasies which combine to form a character , and constitute the difference between man and man . Thus , the question " What is taste ? " is almost equivalent to asking " What is the human heart ? " or , " What is beauty ? " How far it is part and parcel of our nature - how far it is independent of ? , or influenced by , external teaching and example-is a deeply interesting question in philosophy which has frequently been discussed ; but in truth it is impossible to lay down any broad principles on this subject which are not continually belied by exceptions , when we examine it in detail . There are some who hold that perception of the beautiful is an instinct deeply implanted in all humanity and observable in the earliest and most uncivilized condition of a country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first objects of admiration to the savage would be the works of Nature herself . Yet this is so far from being the case that " - the poor Indian , whose untutored mind Sees God in clouds , and hears him in the wind , " although his wild and romantic theology may lead him to look on a storm with superstitious dread , will , so long as he remains untutored , be utterly indifferent to the natural charms of landscape . Yet his taste for artificial beauty , as exhibited in a choice of form and judicious assortment of color for the purpose of decoration , will be found almost always right in effort , and allied to those doctrines which the most educated of our designers have endeavored to graft upon modern work . The very pattern of the tattooing with which the New Zealander mars the features of his bride may be a beautiful thing in itself , though hideous in its application . Natural form is disregarded for the sake of human invention . The same principle seems to obtain in the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , is enhanced by the fact that the porcelain painters never attempted more than a conventional representation of scenery on their plates and tea-cups . The native artists of Japan , though long possessed of wonderful skill and accuracy in the delineation of mountain form and the characteristics of animal nature , were until lately content to typify , rather than imitate , these , in their fictile productions and lacquered wood-work . Our trade with those countries is probably doing more to vitiate their taste for decorative art than any other adverse influence during centuries past . For , precisely as a nation , remaining in what we consider , socially , a semi-barbarous condition , will excel in ornament by reason of its inability or dislike to interpret natur'e literally , so we who , as a civilized people , find intense pleasure in picturesque realisms , have become too sophisticated for the enjoyment and appreciation of that simplicity of form and color which has marked the best ages of manufacture . The consequence is , that Oriental goods , as now made for the English market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy the requirements of a " civilized " taste . It is an easy thing for an ignorant man to ridicule the design of a " willow pattern " plate . The first thing which will probably occur to him is that the trees there represented are not like ordinary trees . He will then proceed to notice that the birds which fly across the scene are disproportionately large , and that all rules of perspective are ruthlessly violated in the drawing . Yet it is chiefly in these apparent faults that the merits of the design consist . Compare it with any of the pseudo-realistic views of Tintern Abbey or Loch Lomond with which it was once the fashion to decorate our washing-basins and dinner services , and it will be seen how infinitely inferior the latter appear . The meanest condition of decorative art is when it passes into a phase of direct imitation of nature . Imagine an Egyptian obelisk covered with life-like sketches of men and beasts , shaded and painted up in dramatic groups ; its dignity is lost at once . Even in the Panathenaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with almost unequaled excellence and truth , no tricks of perspective are admitted to deceive the eye . The Greek kept the imitative faculty subservient in his decorative work . He suggested nature by it . He did not attempt to illustrate her . His bassi-relievi were conventional , but the noblest type of conventionalism that the world has ever seen . Let us take a third example , and remember how modestly the medkeval sculptor stopped short of fact when he quaintly indicated the flowers of the field and the fowl of the air in the solid freestone block which crowned his pillar . The skill was not wanting ; a due appreciation of the loveliness of his subjects was not wanting ; but he felt , as all true artists must // feel , that if he had carried imitation farther in such a place , he would but have exhibited the hopek*ssness of letting human notions of ornament pretend to the refinement of nature 's work . Centuries afterward , when Gothic architecture was degraded in form and spirit , an attempt was made to realize in stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bough . The result was an inexpressible meanness of decoration , which may still be traced in some of our " Tudor " churches . The conditions of sound decorative art are , in short , widely different from those of the imitative arts , and this is a point which is constantly overlooked in modern manufacture . For instance , our designers continue to produce , and the public continue to buy , carpets and paper-hangings which aim at illustrating vegetable life . The principle is an utterly wrong one , and has never been adopted by those Oriental nations who excel in textile fabric . Yet the taste which guides the weaver of an Indian shawl and selects the colors for a Turkish rug is independent of what we call art education ; and that which we fail to accomplish by endless theorizing and teaching in our schools of design , is done in the East almost by instinct . There is no reason why any craft of this order , which depends for its existence on tradition rather than the exercise of intellect , should ever fall away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cause as an alteration in the method of manufacture , or the invention of a new material should operate adversely to its interests . But after once falling into disuse , its re-establishment will always be attended with more difficulty than the revival of those arts in which the mental faculties are more actively employed . Thus when the manufacture of stained glass was abandoned in England , and the invention of printing superseded the labors of the missal writer , the national taste for , and proficiency in , those arts decreased to such an extent , that their revival now is attendez ? by difficulty even in the hands of enthusiasts , while , to the general public , painted windows and illuminated prayerbooks must have a certain smack of pedantry and even of affectation . On the other hand , the history of pictorial art in England , from the days of Hogarth ( to whom we may trace the origin of our modern school ) down to the present time , exhibits , on the whole , evidence of steady progress , not only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the judgment which should lead the artist to select his subjects , and the public to appreciate them . Of course individual taste will always assert itself in such a choice . To one order of mind the accurate delineation of nature , with a stern disregard for dramatic effect and conventionality of scene will be the object to be aimed at . This feeling led to the establishment of the so-called pre-Raphaelite manner of treatment which , even in its crudest efforts , found many disciples and admirers , and has certainly done much to reclaim our painters from the slovenliness which once characterized their work . But a considerable section of the art world still holds to the formerly accepted principle that nature must not be interpreted too literally , that the artist is justified in grouping his figures and arranging his landscape so as to fulfill certain traditional ideas of beauty , rather than convey an impression of historic truth . Of these two classes , the former may be said to regard art as a means , the latter as an end . Examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tendency of one will be recognized in the endeavor to refine upon nature , while in the latter we notice an earnest resolve to realize even her defects rather than sacrifice the probabilities of fact . The relative advantages of each system must necessarily much depend on the subject to be handled . In the treatment of sacred art , for e*cample , we may admire the conventionalism of the middle ages which so often represented the Madonna , crowned and enthroned with a saint on either side of her , when we remember the object of the picture and the situation which it was to occupy . It is quite possible at the same time to entertain an equal respect for the talents of painters , who , in our own day have treated religious subjects with an air of perfect truth and naturalism . But the designs of such men as Benjamin West and those of his stamp who endeavored to combine the two principles , only reveal a cold formality which has no relation to either . Judged by the standard of the day , they neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realist , while their nature seems half maudlin , half dramatic . Yet there was a time when such works commanded the attention and even the praise of the religious world ,  - -  a time when the saintly conceptions of Francia and Fra Angelico would have been regarded with indifference or contempt . In tracing the history of any art ,  --  music , // poetry , painting , or architecture ,  --  it is wonderful to note the revolutions , the metamorphoses , which that strange Nemesis of human senses-taste-has effected . Sometimes its work has been slow and subtle , creeping on from step to step , so that the delights of a generation have differed from those of a former one only in degree ; sometimes the change has been suddenly accomplished by the illustrious example of individual genius . Occasionally discoveries in the world of science have brought their influence to bear in a direction hitherto neglected ; but oftener the tide of public favor has ebbed and flowed in strange and diverse currents , lingering at some shore , we know not why ,  --  eddying round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing its course quietly in one unruffled stream ,  --  anon tossed by the opposing elements of superstition and ignorance , or turned from its passage by those considerations of commercial interest or national prosperity which may sometimes cause , and sometimes mar , the right development of social art . Perhaps the range of taste , from its highest aspiration to its most humble form of human enjoyment , is nowhere more extensive than in the field of music . Is it *ossible that there can be any analogy between the rapture with which an educated ear listens to the glorious compositions of Handel ai , id that commonplace sympathy with opera tunes which is elicited by the jingle of a hand-organ ? Can we believe that the same sense which lifts the heart heavenward in Mozart 's Requiem " can bind us to earth and earthiness with the " Traviata " ? What has the scientific profundity of a German symphony in common with the vulgar rattle of an " Ethiopian " band ? These are the opposite poles of a world of taste in which there are infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements from which they are derived ? A change of key here and there , a little shuffling about of the tiny alphabet of sound , and lo ! Palestrina 's angels are jigging to the airs of Offenbach ! The fashion in music is as mutable and capricious as that which changed the " Grand school " of painting into the school of Wilkie , and replaced the " brown trees " of Constable by the sweet , truthful verdure of Hook 's landscape and sea pieces . Charles II . found the music ( as well as the morality ) of foreign courts more congenial with his taste than the sober fashions of his native coun try . He was bored by the compositions of Bird and Tallis . Could not the gentlemen of the Chapel Royal infuse a little more spirit into their anthems ? The royal predilections for tune found an echo in the national taste , and no doubt fiddlers soon began to fiddle , and parsons tci preach , in accordance with his majesty 's wishes . It was a saying of Samuel Rogers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we may regard George III . as the first great defender of that sublime faith . Who shall say whether the recollection of the good old monarch , solacing himself in his latter misery at the harpsichord with those notes which he so dearly loved , and which , above all other , seemed most fit to soothe his troubled spirit , may not have taught loyal hearts first to respect what they have since learned to appreciate and admire ? The days have gone by when men drew their inspirations of taste from the throne ; but a hundred other influences may still be working , and form the bias of our own day . A popular writer , a theological clique , a painter who entraps the public eye with a sensational picture , an actor who hits on some hitherto untried vein of pleasantry , the whim of some eccentric individual , brought suddenly to light ,  --  nay , the idle words which fall unwittingly from some poor mortal who is fated to pass into oblivion himselg-may be caught up , interpreted as an oracle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt was made , not many years ago , to revive the heroic couplet in a modern satire . Circumstances which it would be hopeless to explain , rendered the poem less popular than , perhaps , its author had anticipated . But if it had made what , in the language of the play-bills , is called " a hit , " what a revolution might have been expected from the rising generation of verse-makers ! As it is , a reaction from the style of the day is by no means improbable . The decasyllabic rhymes which Ben Jonson had roughhewn , which Dryden had shaped into noble meter , and which Pope copied in his neat , smooth distichs , were pronounce*i a hundred years ago the most perfect forms which a poet 's thoughts could assume in the English language . The bard of Twit'nam had a host of imitators . The philosophy of the " Dunciad " was as nothing to the elegance of its verse . Succeeding generations reversed that judgment . Wordsworth , Scott , Shelley and Coleridge declared for the modern school ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the ancient measure // fell into disuse , and people began to look upon it with the same sort of curiosity as that with which a piece of old Chelsea ware or a rococo costume is regarded by dilettanti . Does the same doom await the varied music of Tennyson 's verse ? Perhaps the next poet laureate will emulate the hexameters of Longfellow , or adapt alcaics to the modern ear . The very expressions which delight us now may be banished from the vocabulary of our grandsons , " - si void usus Quem penes arbitrium est , etus , et norma loquendi . " The fashion of our tastes is varying eternally . The pen , the pencil , and the lyre must all submit in turn to the inevitable law of change . Cimabue thought to hold his own until young Giotto beat him from the field . Oderigi sighed in purgatory over the success of Bolognese Franco . When Mr. Ruskin , in our own time , kindled his " Seven Lamps , " a great many lesser lights became invisible . By and by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more splendid flame . Fifty years ago the rage was for Phidias and the Grecian temples . Then came the " Gothic Revival , " and young England declared for the Pointed Arch and William of Wykeham . But another reaction has since taken place , and to-day the craze is for that type of domestic architecture which prevailed during the Caroline and Georgian periods , and which , for want of a better name , is called the style of " Queen Anne . " Similar vicissitudes may be noted in the progress of histrionic art . Siddons , Kemble , Young ,  --  ancient pillars of the British stage , sticklers for the proprieties of the drama , the dignity of verse ,  --  have ye revisited in spirit the scenes of your by-gone triumph ? What do your worthy ghosts think of the acting of Mr. Irving ? Was Charles Kean really so much inferior to his father , or is it the natural tendency of old gentlemen to look back with undue admiration on the heroes of their boyhood ? In one of Doctor Arnold 's Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Balbus , who is described again and again as a very bad actor . Perhaps that unfortunate person has been much maligned . Had he lived in the present century , we might have learned to appreciate his merits . The poet Close may be appreciated in a future generation ,  --  nay , perhaps he already has his admirers . But the matter is too serious for joking . It is not very long since the greatest novelist of his age died  --  a man who , above all others , seemed destined to reform the class of literature to which he so magnificently contributed . But even in his life-time a school of fiction had sprung up which he must have regarded with mingled pain and contempt . For ( to draw a parallel from nature ) it bore no more resemblance to his own work than the poisonous but gaudy berries of the hedge do to the ripe and wholesome corn beyond . Yet even this trash has achieved a popularity ! Truly we may say of many arts-De gusti1'us non est ' distutandum /   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
