txt The failure of the Bank of the State of Now-York is the greatest disaster that has yet happened to any bank included in the national system . It is also one of the most disgraceful . This bank bad a capital of $2,000,000 , and on Oct. 2 , 1874 , reported a surplus of $400,000 and undivided profits .01 $281,000 . Its net deposits were then about $4,000,000 . For last week the average of net deposits reported is only $2,855,200 . The falling off in deposits is not an infallible sign that confidence in the ? solveney of a bank is lessened , but where it takes place on so , extensive a'scale as this , it is a pretty severe test of the soundness of the Management . Unfortunately the management of the Bank of the State of New-York was not able . to stand this test . The Vice President of the bank bad lent a sum of $230,000 to himself . A concern called the United States Attrition Flour ' Company had overdrawn its account $450,000 , and the same concern had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ' loans were fortified by good security . A firm in the produce commission business bad also been permitted to overdraw $250,000 ; and . $240,000 of protested paper , besides the sinus before mentioned , are among the assets . All these Sums put together , counted as a total loss , do not wipe out , the , capital and surplus , and unless there is a great deal more of week stuff than is now suspected , the entire loss will be sustained by the shareholders . The note-holders can not possibly lose a doflar , and in all probability the depositors will be paid in full . The details of the downfall , as briefly summarized above , and fully detailed elsewhere , make up a very bad ease against the management of this bank. - The annals of banking , how ever , contain many quite as bad , and some which are much worse . All the rascality of the country is , not to be laid on the shoulders of the politicians . The enormous fall which has taken place in the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far resulted in surprisingly few bank failures . When thousands of fortunes have melted away and left no trace , it is to be - expected that banks should - fail occasionally . The business of a bank is to borrow money from one sot of men . and to lend it to another . If those who have borrowed do not pay back , the banks themselves may be unable to satisfy-their creditors . But if the maxims which experience has established for the safe conduct ! Atha banking business are followed , it rarely happens that banks go down , even in . such stormy times as these . The ' National Bank act is an excellent law , but it is impossible for any governmental machinery to supply character or brains to those who are wanting in these respects . ? Responsibility must be , . lodged somewhere , and where more ' than a thousand million dollars are placed in the hands of Boards of Bank Directors , and by them loaned to the people of so vast a country as the United States , too much reliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government . The Presidents , Cashiers , and active managers of the several banks are the persons who should be held responsible , and they should be carefully selected . Carelessness inevitably breeds dishonesty and breaches of ' trust . It is so in politics , and it is the same in borrowing and lending money . We , of course , expect the school of inflationists winch is so worthily represented by IIENav C. CAREY , HENRY CAREY BAIRD , and Congressman KELLEY to make all the capital they can for their 3.65 assignat scheme out of this failure . About a year ago they boldly predicted the breaking up of all the London banks as the consequence of the Collie failures . There have been several large failures in London since then , and some of them most disgraceful ones , yet not a single , London bank of any importance has suspended . We expect similar vaticinations from the same sources touching the banks of this City . Mr. CAREY and his school have all the contortions of the ancient sibyl , but none of her inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of ordinary business men . The men of substance who are in any way connected with the banks of this City , and there are few of that kind who have not some relation , or other to these institutions , have no reason to fear that our bank officers are deficient either in integrity or ability . There is a record of fifty years and more to refer to in support of this opinion , and that record is not to be reversed by an incident like that of yesterday . The object Mr. CAnEY and his . disciples is to destroy the banks throughout the United States . That , at least , is the plain consequence of theirprojcets , and they will use this latest development of moral rottenness to further this hopeful scheme . We must be ' prepared to face sonic trouble in the future , and we must remember that there are 9,000,000 of men in the country who have votes , but probably less than 100,000 who know much about banks or currency .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
