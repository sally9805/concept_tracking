STRANGE SCENES IN STRANGE LANDS . ADVENTURES OF AN OPIUM MONOPOLIST IN CAMBODIA . IN the course of a life devoted to such commercial pursuits as gave me an acquaintance with many lands and men , it was my lot to see , in a way that no one else has probably had the chance to see , that littleknown corner of South-eastern Asia called Cambodia . Travelers come , but they can not penetrate palace walls ; they publish the records of their journeys , but the jealous Oriental , or the interested foreigner laughs in his sleeve at the story of veneering which the author took for true wood ; only the unusual position in which I was placed , as chief of the legal opium agency in the country , allowed me to gain an insight into the realities of Cambodia . It is not generally known that a sort of protectorate is exercised by France , through the Governor of French Cochin-China , over this marvelously rich land  --  a protectorate which , at no very distant day , may have an important political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third power , should come into conflict with its representative was unfortunately , as things stood , unavoidable ; but the alluring riches of the agency or " farm " were the means of giving me some interesting , though dreadful , experiences with the pirates , whose ferocity // has been known and feared since the early days of Dutch and Portuguese discovery . In the following pages the reader will find a faithful account of some of these experiences . THE ROYAL BANQUET . To get a general idea of Cambodia it is enough to say that Pnoum-Peinh , the capital , owing to its position at the intersection of four branches of the alluvial river Mekong , is in contact , by the usual oriental highways , with Siam and Laos on the north and Annam and Cochin-China on the east and south . The actual population of Cambodia is reckoned at about one million souls , of whom over eight-tenths are native Cambodians , 6o , ooo are Annamites , 40,000 Siamese and Laosians , 40,000 Chinese , and the remainder , say 15 , ooo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the King of this mixed population , had farmed out to a wealthy Chinaman of Saigon , the monopoly of the opium trade throughout his dominions , and in return the latter paid into the royal treasury an annual rental of 300,000 Mexican dollars . Now a ball of opium ,  --  it is sold in the shape of a Dutch cheese ,  --  while it costs only fifteen or sixteen dollars at Singapore , Shanghai or Hong Kong , was sold in Cambodia at twenty-five or thirty dollars , and in addition to this profit the farm had the sole right to sell , through small retailers and smoking-shops of its own , the liquid or hot opium for the consumption of the public . The chief privileges accorded the farm by the King were : to employ as many men as the farmer thought advisable ; to own arms , boats and junks , and to establish on the river and the arroyos as many customposts as the needs of the monopoly demanded . The farm , moreover , had its own flag , and was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King . The latter alone had the right to use his own opium . Woe to any other found in possession of the drug , unless it had passed the farm ! The wares were confiscated to the latter , a suit was then entered , and a fine of ten times the value of the seized goods was levied by the courts of the country , and divided  --  a third to the King , a third to the princes and mandarins , and a third equally between the farm and the chief agent . The close proximity of Laos was a great temptation to smugglers , since the ball of opium had there an intrinsic value of one hundred dollars , and for all commercial purposes this merchandise was the most profitable to handle . Watch ' was , therefore , more closely kept in that direction , and on certain occasions the agents of the farm engaged in armed fights with the natives and the pirates , who at that time infested the river and the arroyos . These bandits were the last remnant of the rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who for three consecutive years , had waged a bitter war for the throne against his elder brother NOrod*in . For this reason the forces of the opiumfarm were some five thousand Chinese of Wangtai 's ( Shangai ) congregation , he being their chief in Cochin-China as well as in Cambodia , all well-armed and , strange to say , well-drilled . Their commander was , therefore , an important personage , in view of the impossibility of the King raising so great a force in so short a time . The King had conferred on me the title of Mitop , that is , General , at the end of a six month 's residence at Pnoum-Peinh . For Wangtai had returned , after my installation , to Saigon , where more important affairs claimed his attention , leaving to me the entire responsibility of his venture . While previous farmers of the drug had been ruined , my first year brought us thirty thousand dollars profit ; an energetic watch was not wanting , and I was well supported . Law-suits rained upon the smugglers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed . The King , as well as his mandarins , was deeply interested in the matter , and my daily relations witb them brought me into the presence of his Majesty , who , having taken a liking to my character , often asked me to pass a few hours of an evening with him ; the first invitation which I received impressed me so forcibly that it is worth telling . One evening NOr*d*rn sent thirty of his slaves with torches , and eight bearing a palanquin , to get me . Entering this novel chair , the escort took up its march by the grand avenue , parallel to the river , towards the palace , about three miles from my dwelling ; on our way all the natives whom we met threw themselves on the ground We passed the s*i*s , or large rooms thatched with palm leaves , but open to every wind , and where the country courts are held ; they were five in number , and sur // rounded the palace entirely , save where the facade looks out on the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years before from the Governor of French Cochin-China , and encircled by many royal piroques , of strange and graceful curves and variegated colors . These formed the Cambodian fleet . Crossing various small streets of charming little wooden buildings , all alike , and raised above the ground because of the periodical overflows of the stream ,  --  the dwellings , as I found , of the women of the Royal Harem ,  --  we stopped before a large octagonal brick edifice , newly built , containing the apartments of the King , as well as the rooms of the favorites . The stair , of good proportions , was composed of seven granite steps , procured from the ruins of a once celebrated pagoda , built some centuries before on a little hill not far away . By a circular balcony of carved and gilded wood , I passed , under guidance of a page , through one of the glass doors into a room whose black wood floor showed , in admirable workmanship , a group of curious animals from the Hindoo mythology . The wainscot seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light from an European lamp hung from the middle of the ceiling prevented me from examining it . Lances leaning here and there against the walls , fans of peacock tails , tails of yaks from Thibet wound about peculiar twisted spears with handles of bamboo root encrusted with gold  --  a sign of high dignity-these with the pages were the only furniture of the room . One of the latter , crouched in Hindoo fashion in a corner , struck several beats on a tom-tom hung on the right of the door . Another slave appearing , I crossed a second large room darker than the first , and in so doing stumbled against a pile of arms . The noise of falling weapons brought back the page who led me safely by the hand from what I perceived was a military museum . Just as sounds of music fell agreeably on my ear , a flood of light burst into the hall and showed me an assemblage of strange and wonderful arms . It was the slave announcing to his Majesty the arrival of the Mitop of the Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign was made to me to enter . Behold a large hall , perfectly lighted , and to the right , at the end , luxuriously stretched upon a high couch , the King ; his head resting 6n a rich cushion of yellow silk worked with gold , his body on mats of a most delicate texture . His Majesty is clothed in the pkc*a of brown silk woven with gold , drawn to the figure by a goldthread girdle and a massive buckle of the same metal set with precious stones . His head and breast are nude ; he raises himself a little and makes me a sign to approach . In trying to comply I am forced to walk *oftly and with circumspection , because all about him a great number of women are bowed on their knees ; it is only when quite near to the King , who is laughing immoderately , that I perceive the dismay my arrival has produced . Evidently my ladies had not been forewarned of the visit of a European . Shaking hands , the King seats me beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives are clad in the national Jluia of variously colored silks , rose , blue , red , green and violet , which blend together agreeably and produce the most charming effect imaginable . A long , folded , brown silk scarf , carelessly thrown about the nude bosom , which it does not conceal , completes the costume . As ornament they wear engraved gold bracelets on their legs and arms , with rings on their fingers . The stare of so many frightened , gazellelike eyes , the perfumes penetrating the air , and the novelty of the sight throw me into more confusion than the greatest dangers I have heretofore encountered . This agitation does not escape the King , who says laughingly : " I see , Mitop , that you are not used to this kind of spectacle . " " No , your Majesty . " " Well , you perceive then that it 's a very great favor I am doing you I bowl and you must be a great friend for me to invite you , a foreigner , into my home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first was the Commandant Lagr6e , and then all my wives , who , as to-day , I had not forewarned , rushed away in terror . I had the greatest trouble in the world to make them come back . I see your presence causes them only some curiosity , mixed with a little fear because of your size . " I am sincerely obliged to your Majesty for the honor done me again I bow . By calling me friend'the king has made me proud and happy and your Majesty may rest assured that I shall do everything in my power to please you ; as to these ladies once more I incline myself I // should be very sorry if they think me capable of causing them the slightest vexation . " " Yes , yes , I know that . It is very well : we will return to the subject later . " All this conversation took place half in French , which the king understood , and half in Cambodian , which I spoke well enough . NOr*dOm , at that time twentyeight years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perfectly shaped and proportioned , differing very noticeably in that from all his subjects ; in his head he showed his Mongolian origin , and his crown of hair two inches high , worn in a thick tuft on the top , became him marvelously , the rest of his head being carefully shaved . This peculiar head-dress is worn by all the Cambodians ; the women alone retain two locks of hair besides , two or three inches long , about the temples . In addition to this the King 's wives had the long nails of the left hand gilded and turned back over the upper surface of the hand-a great beauty in their eyes , and a sign of race . At the extremity of the room , on a platform raised about ten inches , a scene was being acted from the Indian mythology , where the good and evil genii , represented by men with tails , white or black men , with wings of red , were exerting all their power to charm the daughters of earth , clothed in the garments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . These actors , called b/as or fools , are like the acrobats and clowns in our circuses . The dancers , or lak*ines , by their steps , gestures and the more or less natural , but always graceful , writhings of their hands , arms and legs , represent the dance . Others , specially educated to represent poetry and literature , sing their own compositions to the accompaniment of a peculiar music I have often heard various songs of this kind , fresh , unsophisticated and graceful , which seem a peculiar property of oriental poetry . The orchestra on the left of the stage drew my attention particularly . It boasted thirty-seven woman players and three musicians , who , holding various unknown instruments , boded no good to my ears . There was the kiong-nong , a system of cymbals of different sizes in a semi-circle , crouched in the center of which the musician strikes here and there with little mallets in both hands , now slowly and anon with the greatest rapidity . The vibration , more or less long drawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delightful harmony . The kia-ni is a sort of long flageolet of great purity of tone . The guitar , called tu-kkat has a very deep and rounded back , to give a loud resonance . Another no less curious instrument is the ran-nan , reminding one singularly of a xylophone-so much so that it makes me doubt whether the latter organ is as French as we suppose . In this , little plates of sounding wood , round above and flat below , are hung above a graceful junk , which acts as a sounding board . These are struck with little mallets by the two hands at the same moment , and the flat and melancholy sound they yield accords admirably with the quivering tones of the kiong-nong , which is its necessary accompaniment . These unknown and peculiar shapes made me fear some dreadful hubbub , but what was my surprise when I heard all these artists extract from their instruments such soft , melodious tones , gentle melodies , transparent , charming , restful , and sometimes to the last degree pathetic notes ! What I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having nothing in common with the usual monotonous droning of the musicians of other oriental races . In truth , the King , as well as the princes and mandarins , adore music , which they hold to be the principal , if not the sole , art , and it is the only one which has reached a high grade among them . At the end of three hours , all too short , the drama closed , and the King caused a supper to be brought , to which he invited me . At his order his wives withdrew , after having made him the salutation , on their knees , by raising their joined hands to the height of their mouth , and then carrying them to the forehead . As long as they were under the royal eye they walked bent down , but straightened themselves on reaching a door behind the King 's couch , and disappeared , with a long loqk at me , more gentle than the first . " Well , Mitop , what think you of my artists ? " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see you like my music ! Does it bear any resemblance to that of Europe ? " " Not in the least , your Majesty . " " And which do you prefer ? " " Yours , your Majesty , because of its unaccustomed tones , soothing and strange . " // " Ah , very well , very well ; sit down , and while we sup you shall hear another kind . " At his command all the women-players and actresses left the room , with the usual prostrations , by the same door and in the same manner as the wives , leaving their instruments behind . Women brought in the supper of cold fo*vls in curry , to which I was already used ; delicious indigenous fruits and various sweetmeats , as well as champagne . The King only tasted the eatables , but he drank stoutly . Five women and a man entered and crouched at a little distance ; they were the new musicians . The man held a flute of Laos , with five reed pipes , very high and of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hard wood , in which the pipes were inserted , each one two-thirds of its length . Holes drilled on each side allowed the fingers to carry the instrument , though slanting , to the mouth of the player , who , blowing out and drawing in his breath , produced , by the movement of his fingers on the holes , a soft and pure tone , like the song of birds . To his right a woman held a guitar , like the /ii-kkaiof the orchestra , but smaller and rounder , the sounds from which equal those of the former in sweetness and harmony . Two others played on little cymbals of different tones , and , with a little drum , formed the accompaniment to this delightful music . Two singing poetesses of exceeding beauty , without paint , and clad in a rich Cambodian costume , placed themselves behind us , fan in hand , now fanning us , now serving at the table , all the while singing improvised verses in alternation , taking graceful attitudes and walking on the points of their bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little tinkle from the many bracelets on arms and legs . This savage and , at the same time , melancholy music ; these sweet and rhythmic chants in honor of the King ( some even were in my praise ) ; the warm air charged with various essences from the fragrant oils burning in a multitude of little oval bronze lamps , fiat on top and ornamented with finely worked figures ; these perfumes , to which I was unaccustomed , this Asiatic luxury , combined to produce a charming effect . Toward the end of the repast the King started from the reverie in which he had fallen to say to me : " I have the right , you know , Mitop , to have opium in my possession , and as I shall soon need various goods from Laos , which I send for every year-hem !  --  and as your men keep a very sharp look-out , " said he , laughing , " I should like to find the passage of the river free in about fifteen days-h 'm ! - that being the right period-only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that your agents do not visit them ; are you agreed ? " This speech , frequently broken by the King 's " hems , " showed embarrassment , and gave me , moreover , plenty of time to consider his demand . I , therefore , answered , feeling that to be politic I ought to promise , since I could immediately send a despatch to Saigon telling Wangta* my conversation , and get an answer within twelve days . " Why certainly , your Majesty ! In fifteen days ? " " Yes , lVlitop , not for fifteen days . " " It is agreed ; the day the boats are ready to go your Majesty has only to let me know. ** " Ah , very good , " said he with a relieved air , " I am pleased , very much pleased with you , and I desire-that you be contented also . " " But , your Majesty , I am that already in seeing you cdntented . " " No , no , that is not enough ; I want to make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me for something you desire greatly , I will give it you instantly . " " Well , your Majesty , I should be very much pleased to have the fine ape which is kept in the waiting sdld of your mandarins . " " What , only that ? I give it you ; it is Pibolle 's ( the minister of the navy ) , but that is nothing . I will send you Sadeck , for that is his name , but I want to make you a present besides , " and drawing a splendid brilliant from one ofhis fingers , he asked me to put it on in his presence . Day was breaking ; the King arose , and I , doing likewise , thanked his Majesty warmly as he gave orders for my return . I was reconducted to my dwelling by the same escort , my head still full of all that I had seen . Reaching my room , I threw myself into an extension chair , where I lay some time in reverie , when suddenly a soft and melodious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ears . I looked up , and saw Sakunetana , the poet songstress , presenting me with Sadeck , whom she held in leash . I sent a despatch to Wangtaf , and went // to see the head of the French Protectorate , the naval Lieutenant Moura , who had sent for me three times . The advice I had received at Mitho , in Cochin-China , from an agent of the farm , where this officer had lived , before taking the post of Pnoum Peinh , had caused me to avoid all relations with him save those in direct connection with the farm . On entering his dwelling , which lay opposite mine , I found him stalking about the room . After some angry words concerning the banquet , he broke out : " I forbid you , do you hear , to allow such honors to be paid you , and if I shall have to arrest and put you in irons with my own hand , I 'll do it ! Then you 'll have to yield to my wishes ! " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , " you know well enough that I am free to do as I please . I am not a sailor . As to your threat , ponder well before putting it into execution , for I warn you that the very day you attempt it will be the last of your life ! " I did not forget to describe this scene to the King , who laughed very heartily at the important airs of the functionary , and his jealousy at not being asked to the private fete . Having returned home I set myself to observe Sadeck , whom I had chained in my bedroom , forbidding the servants to give him anything whatever to eat . Upon placing food before him , I was glad to see him eat eagerly . Sadeck belonged to one of the four orders of the quadrumanes called Anthropomorphic Apes from their near approach in many particulars to human beings . All are wanting in tails and hanging cheeks . This one , belonging to the Gibbons or Hylobates , and called by zoblogists the Siamang Gibbon , was peculiar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one found only in the island of Chantaboune , in the Siamese Gulf , but not yet classified by science . Called by the Cambodians Pou**s , and by the Siamese DI*nis , this curious order has a pale brown coat very thick and woolly , fore-arms and hands of great length , and a facial angle of 400 to 450 ; small ears of almost human shape , and a height of about four feet . One peculiarity of Sadeck 's was the conformation of his hind feet , the first and second toes of which were partly joined together by an extension of the skin . To the slyness common to these creatures Sadeck added a really surprising intelligence , for he learned tricks in a few days with marvelous ease , and became remarkable for his exceeding gentleness , and even for his docility , although he was somewhat capricious . I taught him to sit at table like a man , use a knife and fork , to wait on me , to bow to , and conduct to the door , the visitors I received . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great strength to carry , very often seizing a dish from one of the " boys " to carry it to me , but when coffee was served he was a really curious sight , with his gestures and ludicrous imitations , his little cries like those of a spoiled child from whom sweets are withheld . Then I would give him his coffee in a saucer , which he would take seated gravely at my side , and always using the spoon only ; never would he touch it with his hands . I did not dare to attach myself too warmly to the little beast , fearing to have to give him up some day or other . But very luckily that never happened , for an answer came from Wangtai , telling me to do all I could to make myself agreeable to the King , but to be pitiless to all others . Then I was able to devote myself to Sadeck 's education . A few days after the interdict placed by Lieut . Moura , his Majesty came with his whole court to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , two-thirds at least stayed beyond the door , crouching to the ground , and with faces turned toward the green gold-embroidered street-umbrella , which was stationed outside as a sign that the King was within , and that no natives in consequence might pass . Announcing that nine of his boats would leave on the sixteenth day , at five in the morning for Laos , and asking me that evening to supper , the King arose and was about to withdraw , when piercing cries issued suddenly from my bed-chamber . The King entered the room quickly , and we saw Sadeck scratching his head and redoubling his cries at our appearance . As he then jumped upon the window-seat and looked out , the King glanced in the same direction , and with his finger pointed out Moura just entering his house and wrapping a handkerchief about his hand . His majesty began to laugh , and I was not slow to follow , when one of his train came up and told us the rest of the affair . Vexed not to know what the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // slipped into the little by-street leading towards the country , in hopes of overhearing our conversation through the open window of my bedroom ; but he had reckoned without Sadeck , who , seeing an unknown head , had sprung on his favorite place , the window-sill , and shown him his teeth . Moura , furious at not being able to approach the window , had struck the beast with his cane ; the latter , without losing a moment , had jumped upon , and bitten him in the hand ; then , springing back into the room , had begun the angry cries that had brought us to the scene . I sincerely pitied the fellow , for Sadeck was endowed with respectable incisors , and must have bitten him unmercifully ; but the King replied that it was well done , and that he only got his due . Accompanying his Majesty until he was mounted in his palanquin , he said in French , as he was leaving : " To-night I shall expect you to supper . * At eight in the evening a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to bear me to the palace . II . THE PIRATES* ATTACK . THE next day I sent runners to all the stations on the path of the King 's boats with particular instructions , and on the day of departure , in one of them , a Chinese interpreter of my own to act as escort as far as Cratich on the Cambodian frontier . One of the chief reasons for this action of the King was the fact , that the number of balls of opium in his boats was much greater than the figure he had acknowledged to ; but at this it was politic to wink . I could not openly seize the King 's goods , because no one among the mandarins would have been willing to condemn his Majesty , and after all , it did the farm little harm , since the opium sold by him did not circulate in Cambodia . On the other hand the King did not wish it known that the goods were his , for they would have attracted the pirates , who , half from hatred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made themselves masters of them . Moreover in case of a safe passage the Chinese and other merchants , always on the lookout for a profit , would have infallibly made inquiries , and by combining might have either hurt his trade by taking away his customers , or by an excessive importation of certain articles , have flattened his market . I was lucky enough to have what I wanted carried out , for , two months afterwards , the boats returned loaded with exchanges more profitable than those of former years . His Majesty wished to give me the honor of the success , for had it not been for the presence of mind of Assine , my interpreter , and the precautions I had taken , the boats would have fallen into the hand of the pirates . To give the reader some idea of this exchange trade and the estimation of certain articles by the Laosians , it is enough to say that a common knife , a little child 's glass and needles , were articles always in demand , and gave a profit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their eyes . Often in commercial transactions at a later period , when the native would not immediately decide to give me what I wanted , I have secured the article by means of an empty bottle ,  --  - it was irresistible . In countries where gold and silver are produced , these metals have no value in the eyes of the natives ; with little or much they do not think themselves rich , but for an object which can be of use to them on the moment , they will give anything you desire . Once I obtained from a rich mandarin of Muang-Kao , in a large village above Bassac , in exchange for an ordinary mirror with gilt frame , about four feet by two and a half , costing me , I believe , twenty dollars at Saigon , the sum of $1*5 ' on which it is plain there was a pretty profit . Wang-taf had written a few days before to ask whether I could send him the sum of forty thousand dollars , in spite of a quarter 's payment being due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learning from the cashier of the farm that such a sum was on hand , I resolved to forward it ; this , however , required three or four days of preparation by several men ; bad coin inundated the whole country ; the Cochin-Chinese accused the Cambodians , and the latter returned the accusation , but , however it was , every dollar brought to the farm was carefully tested . Even then a few bad ones would slip into the mass . The money that circulated best in those two lands was the piaster or Mexican dollar , as bad coin did not reach there from that far distant land . For this reason I had made a practice of causing each piece to be tested and verified by a // Chinese specialist in such matters , before the money left the farm to enter the general circulation , and that they might be recognized I had them marked with India ink by a cork cut in a certain pattern across its ends . This custom had given the farm an excellent reputation . The tester , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another a pile of twenty dollar pieces and the noise they made in falling one on the other was enough to tell him of a doubtful coin ; this was then set aside by the teller , whose duty it was to arrange the piles . The third Chinaman was the marker , and with the proverbial patience of Asiatics he wet his cork on a little flannel pad steeped in India ink , and gravely , methodically , stamped each dollar on one of its faces . Nothing was more interesting to observe than those three Chinese ; themselves lovers of the merchandise they sold , their yellow faces were shrunken like baked apples and ornamented with enormous brass goggles coarsely made . These , graceful as those worn by learned dogs at fairs , have not been improved since the days of their inventor , a Chinese of whom Confucius speaks . Never did I see those serious Chinamen laugh , and their slowness made me always wonder if they had not balanced their famous goggles on their noses and were afraid that too hurried a movement might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which they worked and moved about in the narrow space allotted them almost made me believe that Chinamen have a special faculty of passing through each other or shrinking up when coming in contact . I oversaw their work , the the piling of the dollars in the five open chests , to whose iron-bound sides the money for Wang-tai was entrusted . This done , the chests were closed and I sealed them , there to wait till sent next morning to Saigon by a little steam-launch which was to come for them . At that moment a small retailer of the farm came in haste to say that he had overheard a conversation of two opium smokers in his shop , about five miles away , revealing a plot to attack the farm at night . The continous clinking of money for the last few days had given the spies of the pirates throughout the town to understand that large sums were on hand in the farm chests , and as they had long cherished such a plan , they thought it an occasion not to be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had not often heard of these pirates , but that I also knew that violence , incendiarism and murder accompanied the wretches everywhere . Without entirely trusting the bearer of this bulletin , nevertheless I did not disdain the warning , and made all the preparations prudence demanded . The retailer , who had the right to a reward in case the news was confirmed , was instantly sent back with orders to make observations and . report . It was four in the afternoon . I sent also in different directions some fifteen spies of our own to collect as precise news as possible . I then got together the household of the farm , about two hundred men , . to whom the password was given . The arsenal was next visited , the ammunition withdrawn from their tin receptacles and . and the arms made ready . The three Chinese chiefs , whom the reader knows , . but with whom bravery had nothing to do with their positions as cashiers , considered victory only possible through a greater number of defenders and wished to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese of Pnoum-Peinh belonging to their congreg*tion to aid in the defense . I refused point blank , objecting that the farm being exposed to these strange defenders , their coming and going might compromise the very cause they served by allowing a few pirates to slip into their ranks in the height of the tumult , and that we would infallibly be massacred ; that I would alone assume all responsibility in the defense , if the news proved true . But , seeing signs of great disquietude in their faces , I told them it would be better if they went on board the three boats anchored off the farm with all the opium left in store , with the articles of value and all that might add to a conflagration . Seeing their faces clear , and having heard from two other retailers a confirmation of the news , I began the preparations for their departure . I was now in hopes that the pirates would fall upon the farm , and get such a lesson as would rob them of any desire to try the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swore to obey me in everything . The partitions or Chinese screens of wood painted red and cut at the height of a man into a border of queer painted flowers , were taken down , and with their baggage and things of value the Chinese chiefs were put on // board the boats with the opium . As to the money , I had a powerful motive to keep it myself , because without it I would not have been aided by the Chinese , but to guard against a surprise or any accident , I had part of the pavement of the farm taken up , a large hole dug , all the money buried and covered up ; the bricks were replaced with the old mortar , strewn with dust , and the floor took on the same appearance as before . The number of the bandits I did not know , but by advices received at an earlier date I thought myself not mistaken in reckoning their united bands at about three thousand . It remained to be seen whether all would join together for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of Chaudoc , the crews , about fifty in number , reducing my forces to about one hundred and fifty ; but all resolved to fight , and the men whom I had chosen were among the most vigorous and determined . Having given them their orders , I went to tell the King of the danger we were incurring . His Majesty offered me the whole of his army , composed of about one hundred men . I thanked him , and explained my plans , which the reader will learn farther on . To Lieut . Moura , also , I sent a notice , since as head of the French Protectorate it was his duty , according to the conditions of the former treaty , approved by the governor of Cochin-China , to give us aid and protection in case of need ; then I went home to dinner , and at eight set out for the farm , armed with a good carbine , a revolver , and a saber . On arriving I learned that at least ten thousand pirates , so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although that figure was somewhat exaggerated , I understood that all the bandits were about to fall upon us . That changed my plan in some respects , and I sent a further notice to the King and to Lieut . Moura , who would surely use all possible means of defense . At nine the farm was shut as usual , and we began the preparations for interior defense . A mile from the palace , and the same distance from the French Protectorate , on the farm , was is huge square building , entirely new , and powerfully built , half in brick and half in Bienho* stone  --  a red , calcareous rock near Saigon . There were two entrances , one looking out on the river , and about fifteen feet by ten , the other on the highway , twelve feet by six . Each closed by means of a solid four-inch teak-wood door , covered within by a strong iron plate , held by broad nails , whose large heads gave the outside the appearance of a prison door . The system of closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fold very easily by means of a solid iron track , with rollers let into the door . Once shut , a strong brass hook prevented any one from forcing a passage by any but very extraordinary means . The walls were very thick , the shutters of the four windows , which gave light to the interior of this building without stories , were lined moreover with iron sheeting ; when all were shut their thick closing bars of iron gave the appearance of a small fort . The eight swivels which composed our artillery I caused to be mounted on their carriages ; three I trained behind the door looking on the road , the five others were stationed in a semi-circle behind the river door . Each piece was double-charged , and rammed full to the neck with grape and sape " ques-little zinc pieces the size of a shilling , with a square hole in the center . Each shot cost us three dollars . By means of a strong rope , fastened by the middle to the iron knob of each door , three men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal only , to come together , swing the doors wide open on their well greased tracks , and thus unmask our guns , and at the discharge three others , bearing hard upon the rope in turn , were to close the leaves , and allow the artillerists to handle their pieces under cover . Lances were distributed to the men having no settled post ; they were to go where they were needed . All these preparations were completed in the greatest silence , and occupied about three hours . I gave my Chinamen a good ration of sham-skourn , and each one awaited the critical moment , seated or lying down as he wished . It was about an hour before dawn when a knock came to the door on the road . I ordered one to answer in a sleepy voice : " What do you want ? Every one xis. asleep ! " " Want to buy three balls of opium , " answered the voice . " Well , come to-morrow morning . " We were lighted by a couple of night lamps only ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I 'll be back soon . " As I prevented a further answer he went away . I was convinced that it was a trap of the pirate to get the door // opened so that his comrades might , in an instant , dash through after him . Abotit half an hour afterwards , my men being troubled no further , and from imitating the snoring of a sleeper , having really gone to sleep , I began to give way myself , believing the attack had been postponed . Suddenly hurried blows from some iron instrument roused us all , and a voice cried : " It 's past five o'clock , give me my opium ! " " You 're too early yet ! " we answered in a surly tone . Hardly were the words said , when there burst forth the most furious and devilish yells ; the doors were violently attacked on both sides at once , and would have been broken were it not for their great thickness . Tumult and frightful howls arose about the farm ; I cast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his post ; a drop of sliarn-siwum strengthened my Chinamen , and when I saw that all were ready , the artillerists by their guns , the matches lit , I gave a whistle . The two doors opened at one moment , and eight discharges of grape were buried in the bodies of the pirates as they rushed towards the opening . Another whistle , and the doors closed . With lances the bodies of those who fell near the guns were pushed aside , and the pieces were reloaded in the same way . The manouver took less time than it does to describe it . The noise had quieted a little , but the ruddy smoke I had seen through the open door , and the crackling of burning bamboo , told me that the pirates had set fire to a part of the city in order to draw attention in another direction , hoping , under cover of the confusion , to seize the farm . A few moments later the doors were again assailed , but with such violence that I feared every minute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new victims ; three times the doors opened , and three times shut again after the murderous discharge . The cries of these madmen always returning to the attack in the faces of certain death , impressed my Chinamen very much . Soon they began battle against the building by the windows-again I gave the signal ; the doors were opened , and once more death depleted their ranks ; but we could not prevent ten or more of the bandits rushing in like demons through the half opened door . My Chinese , excited by the smell of powder and the yells of the pirates , began to yell also ; finally I made my voice heard above all the uproar , and got the doors closed . The farm , already dark enough , was full of powder-smoke , which added still more to the obscurity . The cries of both sides , the Chinese , who , drawn together in a clump , and letting off guns and revolvers at random , were wounding each other ; the in , describable hubbub of a fight in the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the diabolical howls of those without , the impossibility , moreover , of distinguishing anything five feet away , was making our position exceedingly critical , when the idea struck me to seize a Chinaman , and make him beat one of the farm tom-toms with all his might . A sound so sweet to Chinese ears did what neither my voice nor my whistle could . The Chinamen stopped , and rallied about me in a group ; then I advanced and made out a knot of four of the bandits still on their feet in a corner , their eyes shining like flames , and in an attitude of defiance . Rushing at them I felled one with a pistol shot , and , at the same moment , received a blow on my left arm that made me drop the weapon ; enraged , I turned q nickly on my assailant , and despatched him with a saber stroke . The other two were cut down by the Chinese . Restoring a little order , and having put the dead and wounded aside , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , I afterwards learned , had been established some two hundred yards above the farm , raking the road . Taking the robbers in the flank , it hurled death and terror into their already decimated ranks . Startled by so unexpected an attack , they tried a last despairing onslaught on the door , which baffled them again . On the river side the attack , although less impetuous , was more deadly . The pirates on three junks , armed with guns and two little swivels , kept up a continuous fire on the farm building , and my men were on the point of giving way . The three swivels and the defenders of the road gate came to their aid . I counted my men , and found about fifty of us still unhurt . My benumbed arm hung motionless at my side . Having succeeded in overcoming the tumult , I caused the door to be worked ; it rolled with great difficulty , and I sent into the pirates the most murderous fire they had yet received . The grape and the sape'ques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the false dollars which the farm had received since its installation , // and which had been put aside . We had no more ammunition for the guns , the door would not work easily any longer , but trying to push it to as much as possible , and , putting our pieces in form of a barricade across the opening , we exchanged in that way shots and saber-cuts . I do not know what would have been the result if the Cambodians had not come to our aid . Manning their pirogues , they had towed the European steamer of the King up to the point at the bend of the river , and the latter sent among the pirates half a dozen shots from the 24-pounder in the bow . They fled at last , abandoning beside their dead and wounded sixteen prisoners , who had not time to get on board the junks . Their flight was in the direction of the Great Lake , and on passing the gunboat " La Hache , " they received as a good-bye token , a volley of bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon . This was the only assistance I received from Lieut . Moura in the course of that terrible night . Day soon dawned , followed by a bright blood-red sun rising from the rose-tinted pearly gates of the East to light a scene of slaughter , too terrible to be described . The King arrived not long after , followed by his grand mandarins , among whom was the Prime Minister or Cr*on . The number of the dead and wounded was found to be six hundred and forty-seven , *nd they were all thrown into the river by order of the King , in spite of my intervention for those still alive . During this operation the French quartermaster , Tanguy , arrived , followed by some ten sailors , to demand from me the prisoners . I told him to appeal to the King , but the King would not give them up , saying , " that not having had a hand in the fight , Lord Moura had no right to demand the prisoners-at any rate not unless he came himself , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King , surrounded by his ministers , rendered his verdict forthwith , and half an hour afterwards these wretches were condemned to be beheaded , and Lieut . Moura came juist in time to see the head of the sixteenth pirate fall . This , with those of his fellows , was fastened on a long pointed bamboo planted before the farm . Notwithstanding my protest , I had to resign myself to the neighborhood of those sixteen heads placed half and half before the two fronts of the building . In those countries , when a crime is committed , the murderer is brought to the very spot where the deed has been done , judged , and , if found guilty , executed , and his head exposed to the view of passers-by , and the beaks of birds of prey . A particular injunction decrees the pain of death against any one removing these frightful symbols of royal justice I do not know whether the heads really inspired the bandits with horror , but the farm was never attacked again . On leaving the place , witness both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to get some rest , after having caused two of his own physicians to look at my arm , which they declared was not broken . The Chinese belonging to the Farm , headed by the three chiefs , having come in about ten o'clock , now departed to consecrate three fat roast pigs to Buddha in a pagoda which lay behind my dwelling . Stepping out of my door , I found the leaders wearing long straw-colored silk robes , a little conical cap on their heads , adorned at the tip with the brass button of Doctor of Letters , from which a little fringe of red wool hung . They were preceded by two tom-toms , one of enormous size , borne in a palanquin by four Chinamen , while a fifth , of great strength , walking in the rear , struck it rolling blows with a mallet wrapped in tow ; the other was carried by one man , and beaten in the usual manner . This hurly-burly represented the Hymn of Victory ; the large one alone is the Hymn of War . Passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chiefs lighted each three little pieces of perfume-stick , which they placed before my dwelling in order to bring the blessing of Buddha ; then bowing down before me , and taking their clenched left hand in their right , they cried out : " Aoud , douci , ciouci . I ansWered in the same way : " Aou* , dozed , dozed , " trying to catch the same intonation ; the train took up its road to the pagoda to present their pigs to their divinity . The smallsteam-launch coming up from Saigon took during the day , by one of the Chinese chiefs , a report from me , the money , and about a hundred of our wounded .
