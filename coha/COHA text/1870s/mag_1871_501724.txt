qwq EFER. the President to violate the Constitution , and thus bring on an immediate dissolution of the Union . But you can hardly expftct me to regret that I did hot escape their censure . They were men who had been taught that enmity to the Constitution was the sum of all public and private virtue . There certainly is not an uncorrupted man in the country who will say that I was to blame for giving the law faithfully and truly . You declare that " contemporaneous history has already pronounced " against me , and you quote a few words of twaddle , apparently from the writings of some one whose name you are ashamed to mention . You call this a judgment upon me which posterity is not likely to reverse . Political power dishonestly wielded always has hacks to defend its excesses by maligning its opponents . A dozen books of that character have been printed within the last seven years . These productions come withjn the awkward description you have given of your own ; they are " not history or biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deposit for worn-out calumnies-mere sewers into which the filth of the party is drained off . I hope I am tolerably secure from the praises of this venal tribe ; and their abuse is prima fade evidence of a character at least negatively good . It is not worth while for you or me to trouble ourselves about tosterity , for posterity will not probably take much account of us . No doubt you did all in your power to subvert the free institutions of our Revolutionary fathers , and to debauch the political morals of the country ; but the utmost exertion of your abilities has not sufficed to raise you above the common file of partisans who have engaged in the same evil work . On the other hand , the cause of liberty regulated by law has had a crowd of advocates so infinitely superior to me that my feeble efforts can not be expected to attract the notice of future generations . You make no attempt to justify your abuse of Mr. Buchanan ; you do not repeat your charge against Mr. Toucey of scattering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor do you now pretend to assert that Mr. Thompson was guilty of robbing the Indian trust funds . But you offer no reparation , nor even make an excuse , for the wanton and unprovoked injury which you tried to commit upon the character of the living and the memory of the dead . You sullenly permit judgment to be rendered against you by nil dicit . I mention this only to say , that it very seriously affects your credibility upon the other points . 1*zisus in uno , falsus in omnibus . You pervert my words and my meaning when you say that I represented Mr. Thompson as being above the range of ordinary mortals . I merely declared that his mental ability , good sense , and common honesty placed him very far beyond you , who had assailed him with a false charge of felonious robbery . You do not see the justice of this comparison , and you think that if I had not been a mere lawyer , having " little acquaintance or association with statesmen , " I might have entertained a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputable as any that you ever followed either before or after you took up the trade of a politician , you may make what deduction you please on that account from the value of my judgment but you must not interfere with my undoubted right to believe ( as I do most devoutly ) that it would take a great many Wilsons to make one Thompson . It was not to be expected that Governor Floyd would escape your maledictions . No public man ever provoked such a storm of popular wrath as he did . The President , who had trusted him , withdrew his confidence , drove him from his counsels , and ordered him to be indicted for malversation in office . His colleagues left him to his fate , and there was nobody in all this land to take his part . He had some qualities which commanded the respect of folks like you as long as he lived and moved among you . But absent , unfriended , defenceless , deadfallen in a lost cause and buried in an obscure grave-he was the very man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom your magnanimity would prompt you to attack . But w*hy did you not charge him with misconduct in the financial management of his department ? That might have provoked a comparison between him and Cameron , much to the disadvantage of the latter , whom you wished to court , flatter , arid whitewash . Therefore you preferred to take up the exploded charge of sendine , guns and munitions to the South for the use of the secessionists in the war . Your first paper had nothing in it on this subject except the bald assertion , and I was content with a naked denial . But in your last you come back with a more extended averment , and produce what you seem to suppose will // be taken as evidence by at least some of your readers . Let us look at it . A committee was aRpointed by the House of Representatives in January , i86i , to ascertain how the public arms distributed during the year iS6o had been disposed of . Mr. Floyd was not present at the investigation ; he had not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " him if it could . It reported the evidence , but gave no judgment criminating him with the offence you accuse him of . On the contrary , the opinion was expressed by the chairman that the charges were founded in " rumor , speculation , and misapprehension . " But you take up the reported evidence and try to make out a case which the committee did not make out by carefully suppressing all the principal facts and misstating the others . Your charge of fraudulently sending aims to the South can not be true of the heavy cannon made at Pittsburgh for the forts in Louisiana and Texas , because they were not sent at all . Floyd gave an order to ship them on the 20th of December , i86o , but it was revoked by the President before a gun was started . It is , of course , possible that Floyd , in making the order , acted in bad faith ; but there is no proof of that . On the contrary , Colonel Maynadier , an honest as well as a sharp man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts of the case , and understood Floyd 's attitude with regard to secession and union as well as anybody in the whole country , cheerfully set about the business of carrying out the order , though it was not in writing , and testified that he had no suspicion of any improper object or motive in it . In fact and in truth , Floyd was not , in sentiment or in action , a secessionist until after he saw that the breach between himself and the President , which originated in other matters , was irreparable . Up to the time when he got notice that he must resign , he was steadily opposed to the Southern movement , and the bitterest enemies he had were the leading men of that section . Colonel Maynadier says that " he was regarded throughout the country as a strong advocate of the Union and opponent of secession ; " and he adds as a confirmation of this , that " he had recently published over his own signature in a Richmond paper a letter on this subject which gained him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pernicious views of many in his own State ' After he found the whole Admin. istration against him , he was driven by stress of necessity into the ranks of the party which he had previously opposed . The great and important fact to which the resolution of the House directed* and confined the attention of the committee , and which is made perfectly clear by the evidence , you do not refer to at all , but keep it carefully out of sight from beginning to end of your statement . The question was and is , whether the Secretary of War under the Buchanan Administration did at any time subsequent to th' first of January , iS6o , treacherously dispose of guns and munitions for the purpose of giving to the South an advantage in the war which the leaders in that section intended to make against the Federal Government . This was the " rumor , speculation , and misapprehension " to which the chairman of the committee alluded ; . this is substantially what the partisan newspapers and stump orators have asserted and reasserted over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country have been made to believe it ; this is what you meant by your first article , and what you persist in and reaffirm by your last . Now examine the facts . There was a law almost coeval with the government for the distribution of arms among the different States according to their representation in Congress , for the use of their militia . Under this law the Ordnance Bureau , without any special order from the head of the department , gave to each State that applied for it her proper quota of muskets and rifles of the best pattern and make provided for the regular army . During the year rS6o the number of muskets so distributed was exactly 8,423 , of which the Southern States received 2,091 , while the Northern States got nearly three times that number , to wit , 6,332 . Some long-range rifles of the army calibre were distributed . The aggregate number amounted to 1,728 , and they all went to Northern States except 758 , about half enougli for one regiment , which were divided between Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana , the other States of the South receiving none . Why did you conceal these facts ? You knew them , and you could not help but see their strict relevancy and great importance . Perhaps you did not know that the suj5*ressio yen is as bad as the suggertio fe/si , and thought it fair to make out a criminal charge against a dead rebel // by keeping back as much of the truth as did not suit your purpose . The fact that the Southern States neglected to take their propei* and just quotas , which they might have got for the asking , satisfied the committee , and no doubt fully convinced you , that there could have been no fraudulent combination in i86o between them and the War Department to rob the Government of its arms for their benefit . That concluded the whole case , since it was impossible for a sane man to believe that such a plot could have been formed and acted upon at a previous time and yet had no existence in the year immediately preceding the war . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1859 , before any war was apprehendedbefore the election of Lincoln was dreamed of-before the division of the Democracy , which made his election possible with a million majority against him-Floyd ordered a transfer of i5 , ooo muskets from Northern to Southern arsenals . This you parade with a great flourish as evidence of a most wicked robbery . But here we find you again at the disingenuous business ( is not that a soft phrase ? ) of , keeping back a truth which would have spoiled the force of your story . These arms were all worthless and unserviceable . We had 500,000 of them ; they cumbered the Northern arsenals , and could not be used ; a law had been passed to authorize the sale of them ; they were offered for years at two dollars and fifty cents apiece , about one-tenth the price of a good gun , and they could not be got off . Twice a considerable number were sold , but the purchasers upon further examination refused to take them . Of these 500,000 condemned muskets , the Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the South , doubtless for the mere convenience of storage . To " weapon the rebellion " with arms like , these would have insured is destruction . the instant its forces came into the presence of troops having the improved modern gun in their hands . Floyd could not have done a greater injury to.the Southern cause than this , would have been . Nor is it possible to believe that Southern leaders would have conspired with him to purloin these useless arms in 1859 , and then , in iS6o , decline to take the share that legally belonged to them of the best muskets and rifles ever invented . All these facts appear in the evidence reported by the committee , from which you pretend to be making fair and candid citations , and you say not a word about them . If you were " a mere lawyer , " or any lawyer at all , and would go before a judicial tribunal mutilating the truth after this fashion , you would immediately be expelled from the profession , and no judge would ever permit you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you would appear . as a witness , and in that character testify to the contents of a written document in the . way you have set out this report to your readers , it might be followed by very disagreeable consequences , which I will not shock your polite ears by mentioning . Mr. Cobb , while Secretary of the Treasury , performed his duties with singular purity , uprightness , and ability . No enemy has ever ventured to point out a single public act done in that department by him of which the wisdom , the lawfulness , or the honesty could be even doubted . The disjointed and loose accusation of your first paper implied that by some official delinquency he had purposely disorganized the fiscal machinery of the Government , or otherwise perpetrated some malicious mischief on the public credit . Now , however , you are reduced to the old and never*failing resort of " treasonable utterances " : something that he said in private conversation had the effect of injuring the credit of the United States . What was it ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and private , began to go down immediately upon the Presidential election of i86o , and continued going down for years afterwards . Is this attributable to the treasonable utterances of Thomas , and Dix , and Chase ? But what is the use of pursuing such a subject ? Mr. Cobb was dead , and you felt a sort of necessity for doing some despite upon his grave . This feeble absurdity was all you . could do . I considered myself bound to defend Mr. Stanton against the praise which described his character as infamous . Down to the time of his apostasy we were close and intimate friends , and I thought I knew him as well as one man could be known to another . I do not claim that he owed me anything ; for I made no sacrifices of myself or anybody else to serve him . I advanced him in his . profession and thereby improved his fortune , but he got nothing in that way for which lie did not render equivalent services . I strove long , and at last successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o.np* against him , because I thought them unjust , and because it was inconvenient for me that the President shoul4 not trust a man in whom I had unlimited confidence . I recommended him pressingly for Postmaster-General upon the death of Mr. Erown , solely for the reason that the exigencies of the public service in that department required a man *his great ability and industry . I caused h ' *m to be appointed Attorney-General , because I knew ( or thought I knew ) that he and I were in perfect accord on all questions , whether of law or policy , which he might have to deal with , though he was not in my debt , the apparent warmth of his nature impelled him to express his gratitude in most exaggerated language . After he took office under the Lincoln Administration our paths diverged so widely jhat I did not often see him . When I did , he sometimes overwhelmed me , as before , with hyperbolical demonstrations of thankfulness and friendship . If his feelings ever changed , he " died and made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me record my solemn declaration , that I never saw anything dishonorable in his conduct while I was associated with him . lie never disappointed me while he was employed under me , or while we were colleagues in office ; and he never failed me in anything which I had a right to expect at his hands . His enemies spoke evil of him , but that is " the rough brake that virtue must go through , " and I allowed no tale-bearer to shake my faith . My own personal knowledge does not enable me to accuse him of any mean or disgraceful act . How far you have succeeded , or may hereafter be able to succeed , in proving him a treacherous hypocrite , is a question to be considered . But I am not one of your witnesses ; my testimony , as far as it goes , is directly against you . Under these circumstances it was impossible for me to be quite silent when I saw your publication in the " Atlantic , " or to confine myself to a mere vindication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that you had " wholly misunderstood the character of Mr. Stanton and grossly injured him by what you supposed to be a panegyric . " Your description of him , if accepted as true , would compel the belief t , hat his whole political life was one long imposture ; that as a trusted ' member of the Buchanan Administration , he acted alternately the incompatible parts of a spy and a. bully ; that while he was the chief law officer of the Government , he was engaged in the foulest conspiracy that ever was hatched against the life , liberty , and honor of a colleague for whom he was at that very time professing unbounded friendship ; that he was the protigi and crony of Simon Cameron , and appointed Secretary of War to carry out his policy ; that being so appointed , he did loyally and feloniously embezxle public money to the amount of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars at one time . It is true that you were actuated by no malicious intent . You meant to do him honor . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascribed to him was good . When you wove for him this disgusting " wreath of ulcers gone to seed , " you thought you were decorating his coffin with a chaplet of the choicest flowers . You , painted a monster of depravity , and you expected the American people to worship it with all the fervor of savages when they fall down to adore the image o ( some hideous demon . No doubt the votive offering of your affection took this anomalous form because you believed that duplicity and crime employed against Democrats would give him the highest claim he could have on the admiration of the Abolitionists , and because it did greatly increase your own esteem and regard for him . But my interest in his reputation required that he should be properly appreciated by that honest ' portion of the people who still adhere to the moral creed of their fathers . I do not assert that your last paper proves nothing . I will give you the full benefit of every , fact you have established . So far as you have shown Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , I will make no contest about it . But I will not yield one inch to any allegation of yours unsupported by evidence . I will try to save out of your hands as much of his character as you have not already destroyed by credible evidence . My effort was to take him down from the pillory to , which you had nailed him by the ears a " a fix 'd figure for scorn to point its fingem at . " You have done your strong to op. pose my rescue of him , and any partial success which may have rewarded your struggle must be a great comfort of which I can not justly deprive you . We will e* 7 // amine your evidence and see upon what points you have made out your case , and wherein you have come short of your aim . i . You asserted that Mr. Stanton had been from his earliest youth an abolitionist in his secret heart ; that to leading men of that party he declared himself in entire agreement with them , and hoped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , he gave in his perfect adhesion to them , concurred in their views of public morality , and was willing to promote their designs against the Federal and State governments whenever he could make himself most efficient to that end ; At the same time he was in the Democratic party by virtue of his declared faith in. exactly the opposite sentiments . To us he made himself appear a Democrat of the most ultra class . I do not say that he was an active propagandist ; but all Democrats with whom he spoke were impressed by the seeming strength of his attachment to those great principles by the application of which they h'ped to save the Union from dissolution , the country from civil war , and the liberties of the people from the destruction with which your ascendancy threatened them . We took him on his word , believed him thoroughly , and gave him honor , office , and high trusts . Now a man may be an honest Democrat or a sinere Abolitionist , but he can not honestly and sincerely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hostility was deadly . Each recognized the other as a mortal foe . They were as far asunder as the poles on every point of principle and policy . They differed not merely about rules for the interpretatien of the organic law , but opposed each other on the broad question whether that law was entitled to any obedience at all . One of them respected and reverenced the Constitution as the best government the world ever saw , while the other denounced it as an agreement with death and a covenant with hell , which it was meritorious even for its sworn officers to violate . If we loved any portion of it more than another , it was that part which guarded the individual rights of the people by habeas corpus , jury trial , and other great judicial institutions , which our ancestors on both sides of the Atlantic had shed so much of their blood to establish ; and it was precisely those provisions which had your bitterest enmity , and which you made the first use of your power to abolish , trampk down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on more than one side of such a controversy ; he could not sei 've God and Mammon both ; he could not be for the Constitution and against it too ; he could not at once believe and disbelieve in the sanctity of an oath to support it . He professed most fervently to be heart and soul with us . If he also professed to be with *M , he was a wretched hypocrite . If he kept up this fraudulent deceit for thirty years , and thereby got the highest places in the gift of both parties , he was " the most marvellous impostor that ever lived or died " When your first article appeared , I did not believe that you had any ground for this shocking imputation upon his character . I was compelled to disbelieve and contradict it , for reasons which were then given and need not now be repeated . But I said the testimony of the Chief Justice would silence my denial . The Chief Justice has spoken out and sustained your assertion . You do prove by him a declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , from which the inference is a fair one that he was in the Democratic party with intent " to betray the Constitution and its friends into the cruel clutches of their enemies* ' whenever he could find an opportunity . But you are not satisfied with this . To make the brand ineffaceable , you show that several years after his declaration to Mr. Chase , he , being an avowed advocate and champion of Democratic principles , was either appointed by his political brethren , or else volunteered , to answer an abolition lecture delivered at Steubenville by a man named Weld . He disappointed all parties , including the lecturer himself , by declining to come forward , though very pointedly called for . He made no excuse at the time for deserting the cause he had undertaken , but afterwards he slipped round secretly and alone to the private room of the lecturer and gave himself in as a convert . " I meant , " said he , " to fight you , but my guns are spiked , and I came to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . It never struck Mr. Weld that there was anything sneaking or shabby about this transaction . With the obliquity of vision peculiar to his political sect , he saw nothing but " hearty frankness , independence , moral insight , and keen mental force " in the conduct of a man who privately denounced the opinions and priiiciples which he publicly supported ; // 263 and twenty-five years afterwards Mr. Weld piously thanks God on paper for such an artful dodger to serve as a leader of his party . The next place you find him after the Steubenville affair is in the van of the Ohio Democracy . They , too , believed in the hearty frankness and independence " of the declarations he made to them . They showed their faith by their works ; the Legislature , by a strict party vote , elected him Law Reporter , an office which he sought eagerly , and received with many thanks . In all the conflicts of the Buchanan Ad. ministration with the abolitionists and their allies , he was an open-mouthed opponent of the latter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful among the faithless on the Lecompton Constitution . So far as we , his Democratic associates , were permitted to know him , 110 man detested more than he did the knavish trick of the abolitionists in preventing a vote on slavery by which it would have been expelled from Kansas and the whole trouble settled in the way they pretended to wish . He was out and out for Breckinridge in i86o , and re garded the salvation of the country as hang . ing on the forlorn hope of his election . To Mr. Buchanan himself , and to the members of his Cabinet , he paid the most assiduous court , was always ready for an occasion to serve them , and showed his devotion in ways which sometimes went rather too close to the verge of obsequiousness . While we were looking at this side of his character , and supposing it had no other , he was , according to your understanding of his history , in " entire agreement " with the deadly enemies of every principle we believed in . The mere fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is nothing that he there met abolition people . All that might happen , and his fidelity to the Constitution would moult no feather . But you mention it as a remarkable circumstance , and it is remarkable , because abolitionists exclusively were in the habit of assembling there to talk over their plans , to concoct their slanders against the Administration , and to lay their plots for the overthrow of the Government and laws . It was a place where men congregated for political , not merely for social purposes , and Mr. Stanton knew he would be de trop unless he was one of them . He accordingly made himself not only acceptable , but interesting , by telling them that he was of Quaker blood , and got his abolitionism by inheritance ; his grandfather liberated his slaves-he did  --  and purged the family of that sin ; and Benjamin Lundy took him on his knee when he was a little boy and taught him the political doctrine which he had never forgotten , but which he had opposed by every open act of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he went into court in the Sickles case , and loudly bragged that he was the son of slaveholding parents ; his father was a North Carolinian and his mother a Virginian . You may see that part of his speech on page 51 of the printed trial . It is hard , to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds , but Stanton seems to have mastered the difficulty . Mr. Sumner 's testimony to the early and thorough-going abolitionism of Mr. Stanton is entitled to great weight , because it is coupled with an act which attests its entire sincerity . It is a part of his certificate that when Mr. Stanton 's nomination as Secretary of War was sent to the Senate , he ( Sumner ) immediately rose to urge the confirmation , stated his acquaintance with the nominee , and said emphatically , " Within my knowledge , he is one of us . " Mr. Sumner certainly would not have made such a declaration at such a time and for such a purpose unless he had the clearest conviction , based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most virulent type , prepared to tread the Constitution and the statute-book under his feet , and ready to go all lengths for the subversion of liberty and justice . There is another fact corroborating your view , which you have not mentioned , but of which you are fairly entitled to the benefit . When Mr. Stanton went into the War Department , he immediately began to act with reckless disregard of his sworn duty . He surrounded himself with the most loathsome miscreants , and used them for the foulest purposes . Law , justice , and humanity were utterly outraged . Those who knew him as I did , and had heard him curse the perpetrators of such crimes only a month or two before , exercised the charity which believeth all things , and concluded that he was moved by some headlong impulse which had suddenly revolutionized all his thoughts , feelings , and principles of action . But your proofs show that in the kindness of our construction we did not give heed enough to the maxim , Nemo repentefuit turpissimus. // Such a depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity of his moral nature must have previously undergone that gradual process of decomposition which could result onlyfrom long and sympathetic association with the enemies of the Constitution . On the whole , it must be admitted that you have made out this part of your case . With Democrats he was a Democrat , enjoying their confidence and taking their favors , while he caused it to be well understood among " men of your school in morals and politics " that his devotion to the l ) emocracy was entirely simulated . It is now also clear beyond doubt , that to Southern men he avowed himself a full-blooded secessionist . The testimony of Governor Brown to that effect is as good as any that you have produced to prove him an abolitionist , and you have made the fact so probable in itself that very slight proof would be sufficient to establish it . Is not my conclusion a fair one from the premises , that this is the most " marvellous " imposture upon record ? Does the history of the world hold on all its pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the highest public employments under two different parties of diametrically opposite and hostile principles , by making simultaneous professions of fidelity to both of them ? Do not mention Sunderland , for his hypocrisy gained him nothing ; nor Talleyrand , for he was merely a trimmer ; nor Benedict Arnold , for he acted his double part only during a fe*v months , and closed it with ignominious failure . To find a parallel , you must go to another scene of action , and a far lower line of life . Jonathan Wild for twenty years imposed himself on the London police as an honest man and a most zealous friend of justice , pretended to assist the officers in their business , and shared richly in their rewards ; but during all that time he was the adviser , the " guide , philosopher , and friend " of the principal thieves in the city , and to them he constantly betrayed the measures taken by the public authorities for the preservation of order and law . 11. - We are directly at issue upon the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his appointment as Attorney-General , that war might be legally made against the States , and the people thereof , in which ordinances of secession had been passed , by way of coercing them to remain in the Union . You say he was sent for by the President , and gave him that advice , accompanied by an argument in writing , which was so convincing that it was inserted in the first draft of the message , but afterwards stricken out . No such paper being in existence , and Mr. Buchanan as well as Mr. Stanton being dead , your allegation is easily made ; if it be true , it is hard to prove , and though false , it is harder still to disprove . The evidence you produce is Mr. Da*ves 's statement that Mr. Stanton told him so . I say nothing about the danger of relying on the accuracy of a conversation reproduced ' from mere recollection , after so long a time ; but I answer that it is not true , for the following reasons : i . Mr. Buchanan made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal questions . When he was in doubt , he took the opinions of those who were officially responsible for their correctness . He had no kitchen cabinet . .2 . If he had made this an exceptional case , and taken Mr. Stanton into his counsels by the back stairs , and if Mr. Stanton had furnished him with a paper which produced conviction on his mind that , all his constitutional advisers were wrong , he would most certainly have shown it to them , , or told them of it . 3 . Mr. Stanton was a lawyer of undoubted ability , and the absurd opinion which you attribute to him could not have found a lodgment in his mind , even for one moment . 4 . If he had really entertained such a notion , and desired in good fajtl* to impress it upon the Administ , ration , he would not ( I think he could not ) have concealed it from me . It would have been contrary to the whole tenor of his behavior in those days , and what is more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did express views , exactly the opposite of those which you say he urged upon the President . He endorsed the opinion which I gave on the 20th of November , a86o , in extravagant terms of approbation , adhered steadily to the doctrines of the annual message , and when required officially to pronounce upon the special message of January , iS6i , he gave his concurrence heartily , strongly , and unequivocally . In all the discussions upon the subject , he did not once intimate that there was , or ever had been , the slightest difference between him and the other members of the Adminis. // tration . Do you mean to say that this was mere sham ? Was he so utterly devoid of all sincerity , honor , and truth , that he gave the whole weight of his influence and power to the sul ) port of a do*trine which he believed to be not only false but pernicious ? If he was such a knave as that , then tell me what reliance can be placed on any state-. ment he may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buchanan Administration while he was a member of it ? Was he false to the principles that he pretended to believe in ? Was he treacherously engaged with you in trying to defeat the measures he was trusted to support ? Did he aid and strengthen and assist you in your efforts to blacken the reputation of his associates and friends ? Before these questions are answered , let us look for a moment at the situation we were in . Mr. Buchanan was compassed round on all sides with more difficulties and dangers than any other public man in this country ever encountered . The party which elected him was utterly routed ; its force wasted by division , its heart broken by defeat . Every Northern State was in the hands of enemies , flushed with the insolence of newly-acquired power ; and after his official condemnation of secession , the South fell away from his side in a body . With bitter , remorseless , unrelenting foes in front , and flank , and rear , he was literally unsupported by any political organization capable of making itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmed , and weaponed with the truth , " and he went right onward in the path made sacred by the footsteps of his great predecessors . H ' * declared the secession ordinances mere nullities ; the Union was not for a day , but for all time ; a State could not interpose itself between the Federal Government and individual citizens who violated Federal laws ; the coercive power did not apply to a State , and could not be used for purposes of indiscriminate carnage in which the innocent and the guilty would he mingled together ; but the laws must be executed , and the just rights of the Federal Government maintained in every pare of the country against all opposers . The whole theory of the Constitution , as expounded by the men that made it , and all their successors dnwn to that time , justice , humanity , patriotism , honor , and conscience , required him to announce and maintain these principles . They were not only true , but were either expressly or impliedly admitted to be true by all except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , had trained themselves to a different way of thinking , and they immediately assumed an attitude of pronounced hostility to the Administration , The foremost of the abolition orators and the leading newspaper organ of the so-called Republican party took the high ground that the Southern States had a right to break up the Union if they pleased , and could not justly be opposed . But , though they " drew much people after them , " and gave great encouragement to the insurrectionary movement , no man who was at once honest , intelligent , and true to the country , failed to see the wisdom of the President 's views . The President elect endorsed them fully on his way to the capital , as he did afterwards by his official action . From all quarters addresses and petitions came up , which showed the popular appreciation of them . Even the Massachusetts Legislature , without one dissenting voice in its more numerous branch , and by an overwhelming majority in the other House passed a solemn resolution approving them in the strongest language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But everything depended on Congress ; and what did Congress do ? Both Houses were completely in the hands of shallow partisans , who were either too stupid to understand their duty , or too dishonest to perform it . The men of most ability and integrity whom Republican constituents had sent there-such men , for instance , as Charles Francis Adams-were heard but not heeded . The President , thoroughly informed on the whole subject , communicated all the facts in a special message , told Congress that the powers confided to him were wholly inadequate to the occasion , demonstrated the absolute necessity of further legislation , and implored them not to postpone it , for the danger , imminent then , was increasing with every moment of delay . To all this they were as deaf as adders . They could be reached by no appeal to their hearts or consciences . They neither adopted the executive recommendation , nor gave a reason for refusing . If any measure having the least tendency either to restore peace or prepare for war got so far as to be proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was sure to be quietly strangled . The issues of life and death to the nation hung upon their action , and they would not lift a finger to save it . No legislative body , since // the beginning of the world , ever behaved in a great crisis with such scandalous disregard of its duty . But if there were no statesmen among the managers of that Coi*gress , there were plenty of demagogues ; if they were indiffergnt to the fate of the nation , they were intensely alive to the interests of their faction ; if the regular committees slept suI ) inely on the great public questions submitted to them , the secret committee , spawned by a caucus , went prowling about with activity as incessant as it was stealthy anti malignant . You could not gainsay the views which the Administration took of their own duty or yours , nor deny the wisdom of the recommendations they made ; but you could , and did , answer them with a storm of personal detraction . The air was filled with falsehood ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drowned in " the loud roar of foaming calumny . " This crusade was conducted with so much vigor and success , that some members of the Administration were pursued into private life by the rage of the partisan mob , and thousands of the worthiest men in the land were actually imprisoned and persecuted almost to death , for nothing worse than expressing a friendly opinion of them . The messages of the President will stand forever a monument to the wisdom , foresight , and honest patriotism of the executive Administration , while history will proclaim through all time the dishonor of that Congress which could answer such appeals with nothing but vituperation and insult . It was at such a juncture that Mr. Stanton was appointed to take a high and most confidential place in the Administration . His language glowed with gratitude , his words spoke all the fervor of personal devotion to his chief and his colleagues ; he gave his thorough approval to the measures which they thought necessary to preserve the unity of the nation in the bonds of peace . Yet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in communication with the opposition ; sought out you and others whom he had never known before , and sought you solely because you were enemies of the Administration ; offered himself as your spy , and did act for you in the capacity of a false delator ; went skulking about at midnight to aid you in defeating the measures which with us he pretended to support ; forgathered with your secret committee , and gave you assistance in carrying on your pcr sonal warfare against his benefactors ; nay , worse than all that , he helped you to trump up a charge of treason against one of his colleagues  --  a charge which he knew to be false  --  a charge for which , if it had been true , that trusting friend might lawfully , and would deservedly , have been hanged by the neck until he was dead . Oh ! it was too foul ; it was base beyond the lowest reach of comparison . If your story be unfounded - if Stanton after all was a true and honorable man-how will you answer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the feelings of his friends ? If thou dost slander him and torture we , Never pray more ; abandon all remorse ; On horror 's head horrors accumulate For nothing canat thou to damnation add Deeper than that . But let justice be done though the heavens should fall . Some at least of your statements are true , unless Mr. Da*ves , Mr. Howard , Mr. Seward , and Mr. Sumner have volunteered to help you by sacrificing the character of " the great Secretary . " I will not waste time upon the details which your witnesses have given of his treachery . It appears to have been a freewill offering of his own , induced by no solicitation of yours , but tendered by himself ex mero motu . The moment he was inducted into office he looked about to ascertain who were the bitterest and most malignant enemies of the men to whom he owed all his public importance and much of his private prosperity . He found them quickly , and though they were entire strangers to him , he put himself immediately into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their regular spy , and exercised himself diligently in that base vocation , making reports to them daily , and sometimes twice a day , until the close of his official term , when his occupation necessarily ceased . This mean employment must have taken up most of the time which should have been devoted to the duties of an office on which the public business , always heavy , was then pressing wlth unusual weight . He did not communicate any knowledge which was necessary to guide you in the discharge of your duties , for every fact of that kind was as accessible to you as to him ; the Administration kept nothing back ; the President volunteered to give all he knew concerning the state of the Union ; no department was closed against your investigations ; every call for information was // promptly and fully answered . If that had not been enough , every member of the Cabinet would have been perfectly free to speak with any member of Congress , or to go in person before any committee . Mr. Seward did confer with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any dodging about it ; and he was always welcome , as he is now , to tell everything that passed , for he neither asked nor could have asked any question , if the country had an interest in it , which I was not willing to answer . With all the channels of truthful information thus open and unobstructed , you preferred to get what you wanted from a spy . Mr. Howard has the cheek to proclaim that during the " labors " of his committee , instead of acting upon honest and legitimate evidence , he sent inquiries to this secret informer , who answered by giving in formation of " great importance , " but his communications " were always indirect and anonymous ! " If there be one sentence in your whole article which is marked more than another with your characteristic hardihood of assertion , it is that in which you try to make a merit of Stanton 's treachery . It is curiously reckless , and for that reason worth giving in your very words . " These facts , " say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotism , which prompted him to rise above the claims and clamors of partisanship , and to invoke the aid of loyal men beyond the lines of his own party , and outside of the Administration of which he was a member to serve his imperilled country , menaced with a foul and wicked revolt . " Why , this is precisely what the President and all the honest members of his Cabinet were doing openly and above board . They had no legal power which could avail to serve the " imperilled country " without the cooperation of Congress , which was wholly ruled by the opposition . They invoked " the aid of loyal men beyond the lines of their own party and outside of the Administration , " because it was from thence only that aid could come . But with you and your associates the " claims and clamors of partisanship " were so much higher than considerations of public duty , that you not only refused all aid to the country , but you insulted and abused and vilified the President and his friends for asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration , invoking aid for the imperilled country ? Did he skulk about in secret to effect in that way what his brethren were trying to accomplish by an open appeal to the reason and conscience of their political opponents ? If so , how did he succeed ? Did his secret , anonymous , and indirect communications ever produce the slightest symptom of patriotic emotion in the minds of those who received them ? What did you , or Mr. Sumner , or Mr. Dawes , or Mr. Howard , or Mr. Seward , do to avert the great calamity of civil war ? What measures did any of you bring forward to serve the country ? In that hour of peril what man among you acted like a man ? Which of you " rose to the height of that great argument , " or showed himself fit in mind or heart to meet the responsibilities of the time ? The Union was indeed " menaced with a foul and wicked revolt , " and all you did was to " let the Union slide . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs received no attention at your hands ; but yon were all the while mousing about after some personal calumny by which you hoped to stir up the popular passions against the true friends of the country ; and Stanton , unless you slander him , made love to the infamous business of helping you . You have given us but small samples of the " indirect and anonymous communications " which Stanton made to you and your associates . The bulk of them must be enormous . He was engaged for two or three months fabricating at least one tale every day for Mr. Seward , and another coi*-sisting of " the most startling facts " to suit the needs of Mr. Howard , while you and Mr. Dawes were gratified in a similar way at the same time . Are these " startling facts " held back for some other funeral occasion ? Take notice yourself , and tell your friends , that while their stories are hid away from the light , the presumption that they are not only false but kr*own to be false is growing stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgets at once . There is a point or two here on which I would likDe to draw you out . Mr. Seward says that he and Mr. Stanton discussed and settled measures . The topic which absorbed the attention of all minds at that time was Fort Sumter . Compared to that , all others were insignificant ; and of course the measures relating to it were not overlooked It is known from the published statements of Mr. Welles , Judge Campbell , // and others , that Mr. Seward was deeply engaged in a plot to surrender that fort , which plot he afterwards brought to a head , and by sundry tricks very neady made it successful . Stanton professed to agree with us that the fort ought to be kept ; but you have shown that his professions in the Cabinet were not very reliable , and Governor Brown has proved that he could be a secessiomst as well as anythng else , if occasion required it . Now , what did they set/k upon about Fort Sumter ? They were engaged in something which both knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their employment of a medium , their quick dodge when they met on the street , the mortal terror of detection which they manifested throughout , all show plain . ly enough that they had no honest object . Tell us if they were contriving a plan to put the strongest military fortress of the Government into the hands of its enemies . The midnight meeting between Messrs . Sumner and Stanton is in all its aspects the most astounding of historical revelations . If you recall Mr. Sumner to the stand , it is hoped that he will see the necessity of being much more explicit than he has yet been . From what he has said it appears that Stanton " described to him the determination of the Southern leaders , and developed particularly their plan to get possession of the national capital and the national archives , so that they might substitute themselves for toe existing Government . " This is so extremely interesting that it would be a sin against the public not to examine it further . Early in the winter somebody started the sensational rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be got up in Washington , which might seriously endanger the peace of the city . It was discussed and talked about , and blown upon in varions ways , but no tangible evidence of its reality could ever be found . The President referred to it in a message to Congress , and said that he did not share in such apprehen3ions ; but he pledged himself in any event to preserve the peace . When the midnight meeting took place , the rumor had lived its life out-had paid its breath to time , and the mortal custom of such things at Washing . ton ; it was a dead canard which had ceased to alarm even women or children . This t*rtainly was not the subject of the corn- ' munication made that night at one o'clock . Stanton did not surround himself with all the adjuncts of secrecy , darkness , and terror , to tell an old story which had been in everybody 's mouth for weeks before , of an impossible street riot by the pol ) ulace of Washington . What he imparted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous , fit for the occasion , and worthy to be whispered confidentially at midnight . He disclosed a " plan of the Southern leaders to get possession of the capital and the archives , and to substitute themselves for the existing Government . " It was a coup d'etat of the first magnitude  --  a most stupendous treason . This l ) lan Mr. Stanton " developed particularly , " that is to say , gave all the details at length . Mr. Sumner manifestly believed what he heard ; he received the revelation into his heart with perfect faith ; and he did not underestimate the public danger ; but he did nothing to defeat the treason , or even to expose it . He was thoroughly and minutely informed of a plan prepared by Southem leaders to revolutionize the Government , and he kept their counsel as faithfully as if he had been one of themselves . He took Stanton 's frightful communication as quietly as he took the President 's message . Nothing could stir his sluggish loyalty to any act which might tend to save his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Stanton made these statements to him , he was struck " by the knowledge he showed of hostile movements . " That is preqisely what strikes me also with wonder and amazement . Where in the world did he learn " the determination of the southern leaders " ? Where did he get an account'of the intended coup d'e'ta4 so detailed that he w 's able to develop it particularly ? This knowledge becomes *s " tounding when we recollect that , so far as now appears , *obody else outside of the " Southern leaders " had the least inkling of it . Is it possible that his connectioli with the secessionists , and his professed devotion to their cause , went so far that they took him into their confidence , and told him what " hoatile movements " they intended to make on the'Government ? How did he get the secrets if not from them ? Or must we l**lriven at last to the conclusion that the whole thing was a*rnere 1nven* tion , imposed or Mr. Sumner to deludt him ? But Mr. Sumner owes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us have the particulars which Mr. Stanton developed to him . We have a right to know not only who were the Southern traitors engaged it i // this plan , but who were confederated with them in Washington . Isuppose Mr. Sumner , as well as Mr. Stanton . had " instinctive insight into men and things " enough to know that no government was ever substituted for another by a sudden movement , Without some cooperation or connivance of officers in possession . Who among Stanton 's colleagues did he say were engaged in this affair ? Did he charge the President with any concern in it ? If he declared all or any of them to be innocent , does not Mr. Sumner see the injustice of keeping back the truth ' ? Did Stanton tell him that be had zommunicated the facts to the President and Cabinet ? If no , did he give a reason for withholding them ? And what was the reason ? Was the guilty secret confined to his own breast , or did any other member of the Administration share his knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck so rich a vein of historical fact ( or fiction ) , that he is bound to give it some further exploitation . The following passage in Mr. Sumner 's letter to you excites the liveliest desire for more information . After describing his visit to the Attorney.General 's office , and Mr. Stanton 's reception of him , he goes on thus : " He- began an earnest conversation , saying he must see me alone-that this was impossible at his office-that he was watched by the traitors of the South-that my visit would be made known to them at once ; and he concluded by proposing to call on me at my lodgings at one o'clock that night , " etc. , etc . ' Why was Mr. Stanton afraid of the Southern traitors ? Why did they set a special watch over him ? No other member of the Administration was tormented with a fear like that . All of Mr. Staiiton 's colleagues felt at l ) erfect liberty to speak out their opposition to the hostile movements of'the South , and they all did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ut by the Southern traitors under a surveillance so strict , that he could not speak with a Senator except at mid* night , by stealth and in secrecy . At his own office it was impossibl. to see such *isitors ; the Southern ey**as always on him . How Aid those traitors of the South manage to control hbn as , they controlled nobody else ' ? By what means did they " cow his better part of man , " and master all his movements ? What did they do , or threaten to do , which made him their slave to such a fearful extent ? His relations with them must have been very . peculiar . The MR . BLACK TO MR . WILSON . 269 suspicion is not easily resisted that'he had his nocturnal mee'tings with Southern men also , and that he feared simply the discovery of his double dealing . This is what we must believe if we suppose that he really was shaken by those unmanly terrors . But ' I confess my theory to be that the did not feel them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might fool Mr. Sumner to the top of his bent . What does Mr. Sumner himself think ? Was he or was he not the victim of a cruel humbug ? IV. - Did Mr. Stanton conspire with the political enemies of the Administration to arrest Mr. Toucey on a false charge of treason ? That such a conspiracy existed seems to be a fact established . *Vhat you say about it shows that you knew and ap . proved it . Mr. Dawes and Mr. Howard were in it , and no doubt many others who have not confessed it themselves , or been named by you . But Mr. Stanton was not with you . The evidence of his complicity which you produce is altogether too indefi. nite , indirect , and obscure to convict him of so damning a crime . The enormous atrocity of the offence makes it impossible to believe in his guilt without the clearest and most indubitable proof . Stanton and Toucey were at thak time acting together in perfect harmony , closely united in supl ) ort of the saitie general measures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Stanton knew him to be a just , upright , and ' honorable man , whose fidelity to the Union , the Constitution , and the laws was as firm as the foundation of the everlasting hills . To Toucey himself , and to his friends , he never expressed any sentiment but e*teem and respect , and he declared his confidence in him even to Mr Seward , who was his enemy , as you your . self have taken the pains to prove . Was the destruction of this man one of the pur. poses for which the first law officer of the - Government sneaked about among your secret committees , met the plotters in their midnight lurking-places , employed a gobetween to fetch and carry his clandestine messages , and , like a treacherous informer , wrote accusations which he trusted even to the hands of his confederates only whilb they were read in the light of a street lamp ? There were two distinct and separate way* in which the conspirators could effect their designs upon the man whom they had marked out for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal warrant , // regularly issued by a competent judicial officer . But to get such a warrant it was absolutely necessary that somebody should perjure himself , by swearing that Toucey had levied war against the United States . Was Stanton to make this false oath , in addition to the other proofs which he gave of his loyalty ? Or was it expected that Peter H. Watson , who carried the charges , would swear to them also ? If you did not rely on Stanton or Watson , was it you , or Mr. Dawes , or Mr. Howard-which of youthat meant to do the needful thing ? Or was it intended that all three of you should entwine your consciences in the tender embrace of a joint affidavit ? Or had you looked out for some common " man of Behal , " who was ready to be suborned for the occasion ? No , no ; you may have been eager to feed fat the ancient grudge you bore against Toucey for being a Democrat and a " Union-saver " ; but none of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence . Nor could Stanton or Watson have been persuaded to encounter such peril of soitI and body . Nor could you if you had tried your best have found any other person to make the accusation in the form of a legal oath . The price of perjury was not then high enough . in the Washington market to draw out from their hiding places that swarm of godless wretches who afterward swore away the lives of men and women with such fearful alacrity . From all this it is very clear that there was to be no swearing in the case , consequently no judicial warrant , and no lawful arrest . But Toucey was to be arrested . How ? Of course in the only other way it could possibly be done . i'he conspirators intended to kidnap him . Mr. Dawes says that from the hour when the paper directing the arrest was read under the street lamp , and " went back to its hiding-place , " the Secretary was watched . The members of the committee , or the hirelings they employed , dogged his footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the signal . They could rush out as he passed the mouth of a dark alley , knock him down with their bludgeons , and drag him off . Or the lawless and " patriotic " gang might burgiariously break into his house in the night time , and , impelled , as you would say , by " high and holy motives , * take him by the throat and carry him away . After proceeding thus far , it would be necessary to dispose of him in some fri vate dungeon ( for you knew that the public prisons and forts could not then be prostituted to such base uses ) , where no friend could find him , and whence no complaint of his could reach the open air . Even in that case , " with all appliances and means to boot , " his speedy liberation would be extremely probable , and the condign punishment of the malefactors almost certain , unless they acted upon the prudent maxim that " dead men tell no tales . " The combination of Booth and others to kidnap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it was pursued , step by step , . until it ended in a most brutal murder . Facilis descensus Averni . Was this a becoming business for Senators and Representatives to be engaged in ? In that " hour of national agony , " when hideous destruction stared the country in the face ; when stout men held their breath in anxious dread ; when the cry for relief came up to Congress on the wings of every wind ; when the warning words of the President told you that the public safety required your instant attention-was that a time to be spent in prosecuting plots like this ? I will not ask you to repent of the wickedness ; it is not wrong in your eyes ; it comes up to your best ideas of loyalty , patriotism , and high statesmanship . Your witnesses think of it as you do ; they take pride and pleasure in their guilt , and wrap this garment of infamy about them with as much complacency as if it were a robe of imperial purple . But was Stanton in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul conspiracy to kidnap the Secretary of the Navy , " his own familiar friend , his brother who trusted in him and with whom he ate bread " ? If he had sent the paper which was read under the street lamp , why do you not produce it , or at least show by secondary evidence that it was in his handwriting ? If Mr. Watson was the medium through whom he communicated his verbal directions to the committee or other persons confederated with him , why does not Mr. Watson appear and say so ? To fasten this great guilt on Stanton will require evidence far better than Mr. Howard 's small and silly talk about " a bird which flew directly from some Cabinet minister , " and stronger than his belief founded on the fact that Stanton was a " suspicious character , " especially as Mr. Howard admits his own participation in the crime , and is therefrir*something more than a " suspicious character " himself But it // is not merely the defects in the proof-it is the incredible nature of the story which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , that the contemplated crime could not be l ) erpetrated with impunity . Toucey breathed the deep breath and slept the sound sleep of a freeman under the guardianship of a law which Stanton at that time did not dare to violate . A Democratic Administration still kept ward and watch over the liberty of the citizen . A vulgar tyranny which allowed abolitionists to do such things upon their political opponents was coming , but it had not come ; the reign of the ruffian and the kidnapper was drawing near , but it had not arrived ; the golden age of the spy and the false accuser was beginning to dawn , but it had not yet risen . XTOU may think it some excuse . for this false charge against Mr. Stanton that it is not much worse than others which you have proved to be true . But justice requires that even bad men shall suffer only for those misdeeds which they have actually done . One of the greatest among American jurists held a slander to be aggravated by proof that the victim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a sick man or a cripple is a worse wrong than it would be to one of sound limbs and vigorous health . V.-Mr . Stanton 's personal behavior and bearing in the Cabinet have been much misrepresented by others besides you . I am told that Mr. Seward described the sup . posed " scene " in some speech , which I have never read . It was given at length , and very circumstantially , in a : London paper , over the signature of T. W. ; Mr. Attorney-General Hoar , in a solemn oration which he pronounced before the Supreme Court last January , repeated it with sundry rhetorical embellishments ; nearly all the newspapers of your party have garnished their pointless abuse of the Buchanan Administration with allusions to it more or less extended ; and no doubt the bookmakers in the service of the abolitionists have put it into what you call " coiltem. poraneous history . " So far as I have seen them , all these accounts differ from one another , and none is exactly , or even very nearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general picture of Mr. Stanton as engaged in some violent conflict which his colleagues were too dull , too unprincipled , or too timid to undertake , though some of them afterward plucked up heart enough to follow his lead . They declare that Stanton took the most perilous responsibilities , boldly faced the most frightful dangers , and with heroic courage fought a desperate fight against the most fearful odds ; that the other members of the Cabinet looked on at the awful combat as mere spectators of his terrific valor , while the President was so frightened by the " fierce and fiery " encounter that all he could do was to " tremble and turn pale . " All this is ( to use Stanton 's own language ) " a tissue of lies " ; a mere cock and bull story ; a naked invention , purely fabulous ; a falsehood as gross and groundless as any in the autobiography of Baron Munchausen . Mr. Stanton was never exposed to any danger whatever while he was a member of that Cabinet ; never had any occasion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues ; never denounced those he differed from , and never led those with whom he agreed . He expressed his dissent from the Southern members on several questions , but no man among us took better care than he did to avoid giving cause of personal offence . He acquired no ascendancy at the council board , and claimed none ; he proposed no measure of his own , and when he spoke upon the measures originated by others , he presented no views that were new or at all startling . He and I never once differed on any question , great or small ; and this , though of course accidental , was still so noticeable that he said he was there only to give me two votes instead of one . He did not differ with Mr. Holt on any important question concerning the South more than once , and that was when the compact , afterwards called a truce , about Fort Pickens was made . He must have agreed with the President when he agreed with Mr. Holt , for the latter gentleman declared most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generous support . " He never insulted the President . Mr. Buchanan knew how to maintain the dignity of his place and enforce the respect due to himself as well as any man that ever sat in that chair . It is most certain that Mr. Stanton always treated him with the profoundest deference . If he had been rash enough to take on the airs of a bully , or had ever made the least approach to the insolent rudeness for which you desire to credit him , he would instantly have lost his commission , and you would have lost your spy . Among the versions whIch have beer // given of this false tale , yours is the most transparent absurdity ; for you give dates and circumstances which make it ridiculous . At a time when Floyd wa* in disgrace with the whole Administration - after all his brethren had broken with him , and he had been notified of the President 's intention to remove him-when he was virtually out o* office and completely stripped of all influence-Major Anderson removed his commaud from Fort Moultrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , forthwith arraigned the President and Cabinet for the act of Major Anderson , declaring it to be a violation of their pledges , though it was not done by them , and they had given no pledge on the subject . That he could or would make an arraignment for any cause of the body by which he had himself just before been condemned is incredible that he would arraign it on such a charge is beyond the belief of any sane being . But such , by your account , was the occasion which Stanton took to display his superhuman courage . It was then that he armed his red right hand to execute his patriotic vengeance on that fallen , powerless , broken man . He must also have let fall at least a part of his horrible displeasure on the head of the President ; else why did the President " tremble and turn pale " ? I said this narrative of yours was mere drivelling , and I think I paid it a flattering compliment . But , to explode the folly completely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would show that . Major Anderson acted in strict accordance with orders sent him through the War Department , of which Floyd himself was the head ; and this you contradict . It is perfectly manifest that you examined the record , for you transcribe from it and print two telegrams exchanged between Floyd and Anderson after the removal of the latter took place . You saw on that same record the order jpreviously giventhe order on which Major Anderson was bound to act , and did act  --  and you have deliberately suppressed it . Nay , you go still further , and with the order beibre your eyes you substantially deny'the existence of it . I copy for your especial benefit the words which relate to this point : " The smallness of your force ( so say the instructions ) will not permit you , perhaps , to occupy more than one of the three forts ; but an attack , or an attempt to take possession of either one of them Will be regarded as an act of hostility , and you may then put your command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase its power of resistance . You are also authorized to take similar ste/s whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act . " There is the order in plain English words . To make out your assertion it was necessary to conceal it , and you did conceal it from your readers . But that is not all . You find a telegram from Major Anderson , dated on the morning after the removal , in which he says simply that he had removed , but says nothing of the grounds on which he acted . On that same record , and right beside the telegram , you saw a letter from Major Anderson to the War Department , dated the same day , in which he does refer to his orders , and says , " Many things convinced me that the authorities of the State des : *ned to proceed to a hostile act , " and then adds : " Under this impression I could not hesitate that It was my solemn duty to mot'e my command from a fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . eight or sixty hours to this one , where my . power of resistance is increased to a very great degree . " You totally ignore this letter , in which Major Anderson justifies his removal in the very words of the order , and pick Out a hasty telegram in which nothing is said of his orders for the purpose ' of proving that he acted without orders-an assumption which the record , if honestly cited , woujd show to be utterly false . You will hardly venture to repeat your denial ; for besides the original record there are thousands of authentic copies scattered over the nation , and anybody can find it in Ex . Doc. , H. R. , vol. vi. , No. 26 , p. xo . I do *xot trust myself to make any general remarks on this glaring instance of mutilated evidence . You are a Senator , and I acknowledge the Scriptural obligation of a private citizen not to " speak evil of dig . nities " ; but of a dignity like you it is sometimes so difficult to speak well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words so as to make them appear like a denial that Mr. Stanton ever wrote any letter at all on the subject of the " Cabinet Scene , " whereas I asserted that no letter written by him would corroborate your version of it . After coolly striking out from the sentence quoted the words which express my propos:tion , you proceed to contradict it by the statement *f Mr. Holt , who // says that a letter was written , but he declines to say what was in it , I knew that Mr. Schell had addressed Mr. Stanton with the object . of getting him to tell the truth and tear away the " tissue of lies " which so many hands had woven about this subject . If he answered at all , the presumption was that he would answer truly ; and if he answered truly , instead of corroborating you , he must have denounced the whole story as a mere fabrication , Do you think now that in the absence of all evidence showing or tending to show the contents of the letter , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do not mean to let this stand as a mere question of personal veracity between you and me , though I have the advantage , which you have not , of knowing whereof I affirm . But my denial throws the burden of proof upon you with its full weight . Recollect also that the strength of your evidence must be proportioned to the original improbability of the fact you seek to establish , and that the reasons * ftriori for disbelieving this fact are overwhelmingly strong . All presumptions are against the idea that a man who dodged about among the abolitionists as their spy , and vowed himself to the secessionists as their ally , and all the . time manifested a dastardly dread of being discovered , would openly insult the President or do anything else that was bold and violent . But you have taken the task of proving it ; and how have , you done it ? I certainly need not say that Mr. Holt proves nothing by writing a letter in which he declines to tell what he knows . His expressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew the truth to be against you . As little , nay , less , if less were possible , do you make out of his speech at Charleston . He deals there in glittering generalities , sonorous periods , and obscure allusions to some transaction of which he gives no definite idea , except that Stanton was not an actor in it , but a spectator ; for he mentions him only to say that " he looked upon that scene . " What the scene was he declared to be a secret , which history will perhaps : never get a chance to record . Failing wholly to get anything out of Mr. Ilolt , you naturally enough resorted to Mr. Dawes ; and Mr. Dawes , willing but unable to help you , called in the aid and comfort of his wife . " She , " her husband says , " distjnctly rensembers hearing Stanton tell at our MR . BLACK TO MR . WILSON . 273 house the storyof that terrible conflict in the Cabinet . " That is the length and breadth of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not the story it self . It was about a terrible conflict ; but we do not learn who were engaged in it , who fell , or who was victorious-how the fray began or how it ended -- only it was terrible . Was Mr. Stanton the hero of his own story , or was he relating the adventures of somebody else to amuse or frighten the company ? Mrs. Dawes is undoubtedly a lady of the very highest respectability ; but with all that , you will find it hard to convert the idle conversations at her house into history ; and the difficulty is much increased by the fact that neither she nor any . body else is able to tell what they were . The declaration of Mr. Holt that he would not reveal what he knew on this sub ject , and Mr. Dawes 's statement that Mrs. Dawes told him that she heard Stanton tell something about it , which she does not repeat , is all the evidence you offer on the point . Yet you affirm that this most improbable and slanderous story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declarations of Mr. Stanton to credible witnesses , and the positive averments of Joseph Holt . " Can this be mere ignorance ? I am tempted . to believe that you have gone about the business with a set purpose to make yourself ridiculous . I fear very much that on this . question , as on so many others , you have been guilty of a wilful sutpressio yen . Did you not know* that Mr. Ilolt 's testimony would be against you , when you took advantage pf his scruples about . giving it ? Did not Mrs. Dawes recollect more than you have quoted ? I may be wrong in this suspicion ; but a man who mangles a public record mustnot com-. plain if his good faith is doubted when he presents private evidence . Mr. Attorney-General Hoar , believing this scandal to be true , tried in good faith to get the evidence which would prove it . When he found it to be false he passed over to you the letters which he had got in the course of his search , and you printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale which he discovered to be unfounded ; but the politician had not magnanimity* enough . to retract it ; and therefore be let you burn your fingers where he would not put his own . This story of a " Cabinet Scene ) " as it floated about among irresponsible newsmongers , seemed for a w*rile like a formida // ble slander ; but you have made it utterly contemptible . VI. - Your account of Mr. Cameron 's retirement from the War *Department and Stanton 's appointment on his suggestion demanded refutation , because it not only perverted and misrepresented a fact of ' some general importance , but was a serious injury to Mr. Stanton 's character as it then stood . Between these two men it did not seem as if there could be any relations which implied confidence or friendship . If Stanton himself was any authority for his own sentiments , he had no respect either for the horse contracts or the " nigger arn*ii*g " ( as he called it ) cf his predecessor , and Mr. Lincoln had just as little . Stanton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cameron 's policy with all its corruptions . I admit that since the evidence you have furnished of Mr. Stanton 's duplicity in other matters , it becomes possible to believe he may have been insincere about this also . Still your attempt to deceive the public was inexcusable . Of my own knowledge I know nothing about Cameron 's appointment or removal but I will give you the main facts briefly and without the alia enormia , as I have them on undoubted authority , and as I firmly believe them . A bargain was made at the Chicago Convention of i86o , that in case of Lincoln 's nomination and election Cameron should receive a Cabinet appointment . Mr. Lincoln was no party to this contract ; but after much persuasion and pressure he coyisented to ratify it by trying Cameron as Secretary of War . Before the end of nine months the experiment ended , as you know , and as everybody else knows , in a coml ) lete and total failure . Mr. Lincoln , seeing this , determined tcs get rid of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameron and carried by Mr. Chase , then Secretary of the Treasury . That letter is not now in existence , but Mr. Chase described it as curt-that is to sa*r , plain , short , and direct . Mr. Cameron understood and felt it as an abrupt dismissal . He afterwards got it suppressed , and a correspondence different in its whole tenor and effect substituted in its place . Ever since then he has been trying to create the opinion that he reti , ed from a Department full of rich jobs , not only without compulsion , but in spite of the President 's affectionate desire that he should remain and manage them as he had done before ; and he makes it a part of the story that he was permitted to designate his successor . He contrived to produce some belief of this on the mind of Mr. Chase ; but if Mr. Chase had known more of Cameron 's character and previous history , he might have been less credulous . Of the fact that Stanton was appointed on Cameron 's suggestion we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all the circumstances make that improbable . If the President made up his mind to remove the incumbent , he certainly would not have proceeded to execute his resolution by writing him a curt letter of dismissal without having settled upon somebod*r to succeed him ; for at such a time as that he could not mean to leave the War Department ac*pha/ous while he would be hunting a head for it . But concede that no thought was taken for the new officer before the removal of the old one , can it he that the President decided the whole question in favor of a man never mentioned before , on the mere suggestion of the officer he was discarding , and without seeking advice from those members of the Cabinet who still retained his favor ? The suppressed letter is , therefore , not only an important fact in itself , but it has the gravest influence on the credibility of Mr. Cameron 's whole tale . Other questions signify but little in comparison to that . If the correspondence afterwards published was not that which actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom , er at whose instance , the spoliation was committed . The short , plain , direct , curt note , with which Mr. Lincoln opened the business , would have explained everything , if it had been permitted to see the light ; and it could not have been destroyed except for the purpose of making a false impression . This compels me to show that your conduct in the affair has been such as admits of no justification except that burning loyalty and intense patriotism which converts all vice into virtue . After your first article appeared , and before my answer to it , a leading and very distinguished member of the Republican party in this State told you that you had misstated the ficts concerning Mr. Cameron 's retirement , and especially the important and principal fact of the suppressed note from the President ; and he referred to the Chief Justice , who , upon being interrogated , gave you the authei*tic information // 187 that such a note had been written , delivered , and suppressed . Thereupon you solemnly promised that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would tell the whole truth . Besides , Judge Chase , after my review of you , wrote me a letter from Sandusky , Ohio , in which he said that he bore the note in question , and mentioned that he had also written to you . What he wrote you of course I do not know , but he certainly did not give you one version and me another . You had , therefore , the written statement of the Chief Justice , in addition to his verbal assurance . With all these lights before you , and with all the obligations of common veracity , strengthened by an express promise to tell the truth , what do you do in your second article ? Vhy , you simply stick to your first story . Nay , you take great trouble to smuggle the truth away , aud bury it out of sight ; for , instead of producing Judge Chase 's letter to yourself , in which the fact , no doubt , is fairly stated , you give us an extract from another letter written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to quote " - nothing whatever on the subject of that important letter . I forbear to say much that ought to be said about this part of your behavior , because the distinguished gentleman before spoken of has taken you in hand , and will doubtless jerk an acknowledgment of the facts out of you , in spite of all your shuffling . VI 1. -A word before we part about the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars raised out of the Treasury for Governor Morton . Taking your account of that business as correct , I proved in my former letter that it was in the highest degree criminal . You left no escape from the conclusion that the parties were guilty of embezzlement under the act of 1846 . Your narrative of the transaction impressed it with all the marks of what is called in the flash language of Washington " a big steal . " You showed that the parties themselves so understood it at the time , for you put a conversation into their mouths by which they are made to admit their liability to prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true . Mr* Stanton 's worst enemies never charged him with that kind of dishonesty , and Governor Morton had a reputation which placed him far above the suspicion of such baseness . Both of them may have had serious faults , but they would not rob the Treasury under any circumstances , or for any purpose . I asked three members of the Indiana delegation whether there was any foundation for your assertion ; they all answered no , and gave me the explanation which I used in my published letter . Your replication to this point is one of the most astonishing parts of all your wonderful production . I denied that Messrs . Stanton and Morton had committed a felony , and gave a version of the affair which showed them both to be perfectly innocent . You grow ill-tempered and vituperative upon this , and charge me with " unconcealed , not to say ostentatious , malignity . " I confess this is turning the tables upon me in a way I could not have expected . In general , the malignity is presumed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who repels it . There might have been some hope for you yet if you had recanted your first assertion , or admitted the etrors of your statement , or made some effort to explain away the effect of it , by showing that you did not mean what you said . But you hold fast to every word of it ; not a syllable do you retract . On the contrary , you insist that it is effrontery in me to affirm that a debt was due to the State , and that it was paid according to law . What you say in your last , in addition to your first statement , makes the case look worse than it did before . But it is not true .. The payment was not made on account of arms furnished to loyal citizens in rebellious States , nor was the money given to the Governor , to be disbursed by him on his own responsibility , a3 agent of the President . That much I can say on the official authority of the present Secretary of War , who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transaction appears to be based upon the claims of the State of Indiana for expenses incurred in raising volunteers . " But Governor Morton is still above ground , and can take care of himself . If he made a raise out of the public Treasury without authority of law , and in defiance of the penal statutes in such case made and provided , he owes it to you to confess his guilt fully and freely . If he is innocent ( as I believe him to be ) , it is clue to himself and the memory of Mr. Stanton that he deny your allegations , and exhibit the true state of the facts , without delay . The sum of the case , as it now stands , is this : Mr. Stanton put into the hands of Governor Morton , not a warrant as you say , // but a requisition , on which the Governor got out of the Treasury two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . If this requisition was based on a just claim , and drawn against a fund appropriated to the payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly commonplace , and precisely similar to other acts done every day , before and since , by all the Secretaries  --  a simple discharge of routine duty , involving no respon*ibility whatever , no honor , and no blame . But it suited your ideas to glorify Stanton by declaring that he took the great responsibility of helping Mr. Morton to the money contrary to law , against the principles of common honesty , and in violation of his oath , thereby exposing both himself and his accomplice to the danger of prosecution and imprisonment in the penitentiary . This was the feather you stuck in his cap ; for this you think him entitled to the " grateful admiration of his loyal countrymen . " I sought to deprive him of the decoration you bestowed on him , by showing that the money was paid according to law on a claim satisfactorily established , out of money regularly appropriated to that purpose . I tried to prove that it was not an embezzlement , and that there was nothing criminal in it . But this took the loyalty out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes . Thereupon you fly into a passion and become abusive , which shows that your moral perceptions are very much distorted , and makes me fear indeed that you are altogether incorrigible . This paper has grown much longer than I intended to make it , and I have no space for the exhortations I meant to giveyou in conclusion . I leave you , tuerefore , to your own reflections . J. S.
