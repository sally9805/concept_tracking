A QUEEN AT SCHOOL . LETTERS FROM A FELLOW-PUPIL OF THE YOUNG QUEEN OF SPAIN , AT A FRENCH CONVENT , DURING THE WINTER OF 1873- ' 74 . PENSIONNAT OF THE CONVENT OF , NEAR PARIS , Tuesday , October 7th , 1873 . DEAR : This night we bid fare*vell to liberty . To-morrow is the grand " ken /r**e " at the convent , when all the scholars some back , and then vacation will be over , lessons will begin , and there will be no more peace for the wicked . At present only about a dozen of us have come , mostly foreigners , and we have an easy time of it , with very little restraint , but of course when there will be one hundred and fifty girls to manage , everything will have to go like clock-work . I am beginning to get a little acquainted with the nuns , who are lovely , each one more so than the other , so cheerful , and many of them so clever . But you never saw anything like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every turning , like the captains on the ship in " Innocents Abroad . " As we are going to breakfast a nun is seen approaching , and we all stand aside and courtesy , for this is the superior-general . On the way back another nun looms up in the distance . This turns out to be the superioress of what we call the " Little Convent , " a building the other side of the park , where the younger children live . While we are at lessons somebody else comes in and we all rise . I inquire who this may be , and am informed that it is the superioress of the " Great Convent . " At the noon recreation we wander out to the grounds to play , and soon up one of the paths the superioress of the convent at Malaga is seen , coming to speak with the little Spanish children . She is here as she had to leave Malaga for some reason ; possibly there vere too many superioresses there . Meanwhile another nun has hove in sight , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make your courtesy , my children . This is the superioress of the novitiate . " I begin to wonder with Mark Twain if you could heave a rock in any given direction without hitting a superioress ; but it would n't do to try the experiment , for the superioress of the Pensionnat is sitting in the room where I am writing . Should n't you think this was enough for any earthly institution without counting first and second mistresses of class , and I do n't know how many others ? The last-named superioress has been an angel of comfort to us poor little homesick wretches , for this has been a night of tears . You never saw such a melancholy set as we all were a few minutes ago . It began at dinner , where a Greek girl , Alexandrine by name , big enough and old enough to have known better , cried because she did n't like something we had to eat . That started another girl , and there soon broke out a chorus of sympathetic sobs from the younger children , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is forlorn enough at best at meal-time . The refectory is a great stone room meant to accommodate the whole school , and we sit , forming a very insignificant group , at one extreme end , cheerless rows of empty tables and benches stretching before us , and our voices echoing with a most sepulchral sound . Up in the recreation-hall it all broke out afresh . We tried to sing and have games , but they would n't go off . There are half a dozen little Spaniards who do n't know a word of French , and of course they feel utterly deserted and forlorn , and one after the other they began crying as if their hearts would break . The Greek girl soon joined in , and then the English girl followed . When I saw Regina go , I could hold out no longer , and two girls from the French provinces were soon the only sur // vivors of the general wreck . But before long the door opened , and there stood the lovely superioress of the Pensionnat , in the purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking like a vision from a better world . She sat down among us and we crowded round her , on the floor or wherever we could be nearest , each trying to get hold of her dress , as if that could do us any good , and by and by she succeeded in getting us consoled and our eyes dried . Regina and I are now writing letters home , and Madame Marie is telling the other children a story ; I ca n't make out what the story is , but there must be a horror to it , they all look so deeply interested and excited , and Antoinette 's hair is quite standing on end . However , that is rather the normal condition of Antoinette 's hair . Sunday , October 12th , 1873 . All the scholars are back again now , and you would n't know the old building , it is so swarming with girls . We are divided into two classes , the " Grande " and the " Moyenne . " The " Petite Classe " of fifty or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate from us in every way . There is to be a distinguished addition to the Pensionnat next week in the shape of one of the Orleans princesses , a daughter of the Duke of Montpensier . She is to be installed here as a day-scholar , and will have her seat in class and be in every way just like one of us . The Countess of Paris , who is her sister , was also educated here . This little princess , they say , is betrothed to her cousin , the young prince of the Asturias , and if that is the case , she may be queen of Spain some day , though to be sure it does n't look much like it just now . My neighbor in class , Alexandrine , the Greek girl , is much excited over the advent of this royal damsel , and has been entertaining me lately with her notions of rank . It is strict silence in study-hour , but Alexandrine is afflicted with no conscience to speak of . She has a way of lifting the cover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screened thus from the eyes of the mistress in charge , she proceeds to give me the benefit of a few remarks . Alexandrine being rather given to the vanities of this world , her notions of what is consistent with royalty get little further than dress . I verily believe she expects the princess to appear among us in a satin gown and diamonds . - Apropos of dress , I have been getting " riled " lately on the subject of our blue uniform . We wear a black dress for every day ,  --  a single skirt made in one with the waist , and no trimming , its plainness only relieved by a little cape or pelerine which gives it rather a jaunty air . But on Sundays and on Wednesday afternoons , when our friends come to see us ,  --  parlor day , as we call it ,  --  we wear the same thing in blue . Now of course the blue is the prettiest ; but it is supjosed to be so extra fine that , except when we are in the parlor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a big , highnecked , black apron , buttoned up behind , just so managed that we ca n't fasten it ourselves , but must go about disturbing the class to find some angel to do it for us ,  --  an operation of at least ten minutes . And no sooner is the affair on-which does n't include keeping it on , for it is so loose that it threatens to slip off every moment-than we are sure to be called to parlor , or chapel , or something , and it must off again . then after all this trouble we do n't even have the satisfaction of keeping on the blue dresses all day , but have to trudge up to the dormitories before dinner , and put on the black ones again . By this time I get wrought up to such a pitch of exasperation that I am ready to vow I will never touch the blue thing again . However , it is the rule of the school to wear it unless the girls are in mourning , so I have to console myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that there can be no more excellent and praiseworthy means of acquiring that virtue than through this same blue dress . Monday , October 20th . This morning I staid in from recreation to help one of the Ribbons arrange a desk for the little Princess of Montpensier , who was expected to-day . There was not much choice among the desks ; they are all pretty well battered and ink-stained , and hacked with pen-knives ; but we chose one that , on the whole , was as respectable as any we could hope to find , and went to work to wipe it off and scrub up the inkstand . The school-rooms are high and sunny , with long windows opening to the ground and giving a pretty view over the lawn and walks . They are furnished with several rows of desks , l ) ainted black originally , at which we sit on square wooden stools . The only visible difference between the princess and ourselves will be that she will have a chair instead of a stool at her desk . We have chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be next to and under the *pecial charge of Anne de G- , one of the Ribbons ,  --  the first scholar of her // division , and the youngest in it . It is always the custom to put a new-corner under the protection of one of these children wearing the white ribbon and medal , who are the good girls and monitors of the school . The princess will be just in front of me as we sit in class , so I shall have a good opportunity to observe her . This will also put her in front of Alexandrine , who is much elated at the prospect of being in such a distinguished neighborhood , and kept hovering about us during the arrangements , in great fear lest we might undertake to change her seat , much to the distress of the good little novice guarding the recreation , who kept calling her back to the grounds and threatening her with bad notes every time she wandered into the school-room . We had such a laugh over Alexandrine this morning ! She has been inquiring lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the day the princess came , and was quite distressed to hear that we were to wear our black dresses and everything was to go on as usual . She made up her mind that if no one else knew what was befitting to royalty , she at least did ; so this morning , while we were expecting the princess any minute , Alexandrine sailed into the schoolroom , attired in her blue uniform , a velvet ribbon round her neck , and her hair done up on the top of her head with one long curl hanging down her back . How she came by her finery nobody knew , for our things are kept in the lingerie , and we ca n't get anything without permission ; but , there she was . She tried to slip into her seat unobserved , but of course she was pounced upon immediately . She excused herself by saying her other dress was tom . None of us believed it , but the nuns never like to appear to doubt a girl 's word , so the mistress said if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover it up with her black apron and pelerine , and sent her to the dormitor ) r to take down her hair and braid it up as usual , with an admonition never again to appear with any of it hanging down in that disorderly fashion . Meanwhile there was great excitement at the lingerie . The good little lay sister , who has charge of things there , whom we girls disrespectfully call " the little yellow hag , " discovered a blue dress missing , and coming down to see about it , caught Alexandrine in her clutches , and , as she is very good and conscientious , of course she insisted on her changing immediately , and said it could n't be allowed , and so forth . I am afraid we all rejoiced secretly in Alexandrine 's downfall , and received with relish the little lecture on simplicity which followed . After all , the princess is not to come till to-morrow , so poor Alexandrine suffered this mortification for nothing . Tuesday , October 21st . The princess actually arrived this morning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Montpensier came out with her , to call on the superioress and see the school . It was just at the noon recreation and we were all out m the park , so they walked round and visited the play grounds of the different classes , and staid some time watching our games . We had been told we were to stand still and courtesy as they passed , but the duke and duchess begged particularly that our game of prisoner 's base should not be interrupted , as they wanted to see how well we could play . You can imagine that on hearing this , we chased each other with great zeal . Poor Alexandrine has dropped from the clouds ! She does n't think much of the French royal family now . Of course we were all looking out eagerly for our new schoolmate , and she soon appeared , walking with the governess a little way behind her parents and the superioress . All we could see was that she was a girl of thirteen or so , still in short dresses , with a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . She had on a very simple little suit of some purple-and-white striped stuff , and wore white cotton gloves and boots without heels . Fancy the feelings of Alexandrine I They were somewhat assuaged however by the appearance of the duchess . She is the sister of Queen Isabella , and is a tall , distinguished-looking woman , and was very richly dressed , and full of animation , and seemed very much interested in everything she saw . The princess was not formally introduced to us till after we had gone into class , when the superioress brought her in to show her her seat . She had taken her hat off and looked very shy and pretty as she came in . She seemed to be a good deal embarrassed at facing so many girls , and hung her head a little , and answered in a very low voice when she was spoken to , but her eyes looked up bright and full of intelligence . There is something very attractive about her : she is peffectly simple and unassuming . She took her seat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lessons and the books she would need . I had a good chance to examine the princess as she sat directly in // front of me . She is large and well-formed for her age , and sits up very straight , though she droops her head a little . Her complexion is very fine and clear , with a healthy tinge , and her features are pleasing , especially the eyes , which are of a soft gray or hazel , with dark lashes , deep set , and very bright and full of expression . Her hair is jet black , and splendidly thick and glossy . She wears it brushed tight to her head and braided in two braids , which are fastened low across the back of her head . Then she has a very white throat and prettyshaped ears , and altogether promises to develop into quite a handsome woman . We had been told beforehand by the nuns that we must all call her " Madame . " It seemed a funny idea to call such a little girl Madame , especially here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever the difference in age or rank , but the nuns did n't think it right that we should be quite so familiar with a future queen . I noticed however that they themselves called her by her name " Merc*d*s. " * At the three-o'clock recreation , in stead of going to the play-grounds we had permission to walk up and down the alleys with Madame and show her the grounds , which we were delighted to do . We always like a walk , for then we can chatter to our hearts ' content , and after so many hours of study and silence , liberty to talk is what we most crave . But it turned out afterward that poor Madame was dreadfully disappointed at there not being any games , as she was crazy to play with us . We had such a shout at Louise R- . When the rolls were being passed for lunch she was told to put one on the princess 's desk , and she looked up in such a surprised way and asked , " But can she eat plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We all like what we have seen of her . She tries very hard to fall into all our ways , and was quite distressed at having a chair when the rest of us sat on stools . The cb**ir was not much to boast of ; but she did n't - *ing different in any way from the other girls . Wednesday , October 22d . Our little princess lost her prisoner 's base again , for this was " parlor day , " and at noon we all go up to the dormitories to have our heads shampooed , and after that operation is over we put on our blue uniforms , to be ready if we are called to the parlor . Madame was to study her English lesson while we were upstairs ; and it was decided that I should stay with her to keep her company , as I could help her with her English lesson if she wanted it . So downstairs I staid . I had never spoken to Madame yet , and I suppose each of us felt a little shy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , each pretending to study very hard and secretly eyeing the other . After a while I ventured to ask in English if I could give her any help . She refused , and we took to our books again and there was another silence . Pretty soon , however , she looked up and asked me if I knew her English teacher , Sister Mary of the Incarnation , and there a spring of sympathy was opened . This lovely nun , who is half worshiped by the girls , is to be sent on a mission to the little savages in New Caledonia , and in mourning her departure Madame and I grew quite friendly . She is rather shy at first about talking , but is quite animated after she gets started , and I fancy she likes a little fun as much as anybody else . At the afternoon recreation , which is an hour long on XVednesdays , we took great pains to get up a game for Madame 's benefit , but so many of the Grandes were called to the parlor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were much honored , and we had an exciting game . The Moyennes had been awfully jealous when Madame was put in our class , as she is younger *han most of the Grandes , but the super ress put them down nicely when they gru pled by saying , " When the Moyennes are : reasonable and studious as the Grand , s we shall be glad to put a new-coiner amongst them , but at present we think the princess would receive a better example of goodconduct and industry from the Grandes . " At this the Moyennes blushed and were silent , for in all their great class they have only one girl wearing a ribbon of any kind . At first , some of us undertook to instruct Madame in prisoner 's base , but we soon found she knew it as well as any of us ; she is a fast runner and will make a capital * *xks *x* *&amp;&amp; s*v* with her anX wouX4ri*t chase her very hard * Marie de las Merc&amp;1*s-Isabe11e Fran*oise at first , but she saw through it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she is going to be a trump . Without losing the gentleness and simplicity of her manners she is fast getting over her shyness , and though there is nothing rough about her yet she is bright and gay , with plenty of spirit and ready for all sorts of adventures . November . Such a funny time as I have of it at the drawing class ! I am seated next to two Moyennes who are noted as the greatest chatterers in their class . The nuns , who are deluded enough to look on me as one of the good girls , expect me to keep them in some sort of order , but I have given up the task long ago . On the other side of me is the little Princess of Montpensier , and she is my hope and comfort , for she has some susceptibilities . She is not very industrious ; she works well a little while and then waits for the teacher to come and correct her drawing , and meanwhile employs herself scribbling her name and initials , " M. 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " M. 0. , " in every comer of the pal ) er . But she takes the slightest hint very nicely , just giving a good-natured little laugh and shrug - and going right to work again . But I get every day more confirmed in the opinion that the consciences of those two Moyennes are proof against all impression . The one nearest me , Julie , is a rough , boastful kind of girl , not very bright , and rather a butt in the class . The other girl , Blanche A- , is one of the characters of the school , and the only person known who can completely subdue Julie . Julie is very credulous , and Blanche being very clever easily imposes on her . They distract one greatly in class . The rule being " no talking , " Blanche consequently ceases not for an instant to talk . She gets tired of drawing , mutters to herself , declaring she *vont take another stroke , and leaves her Jupiter Tonans looking helplessly out of one eye . Blanche always attacks her heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them one feature till the last is done to her satisfaction . Nevertheless she is convinced that the prize of drawing lies in store for her . Now Julie has the same conviction in regard to herself , but , having great faith in Blanche 's powers , thinks it very likely she may get the second prize ; so she flatters her a little , telling her she draws wonderfully and is sure of the prize , all of which Blanche accepts gracefully , and , holding her production at an admiring distance , surveys it with great complacency . Soon , however , dissatisfaction begins to creep in ; she calls upon Julie to criticise certain points , and then , with that long guttural , expressive of disgust and impatience peculiar to the French race , she tears the paper through the middle , breaks her charcoal to bits and smooches the drawing all over . Having thus disposed of it she folds her arms , leans back in her chair and settles herself to talk , only stopping occasionally to throw in a few criticisms on Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself for the heroine , in the course of which she makes mysterious allusions , drops hints respecting the supposed splendor of her connections , seems on the point of taking Julie into her confidence , then hesitates , and finally stops short with an impatient *vave of the hand . By this time , Julie , who has stopped work long since to listen with wideopen mouth and eyes , is firmly persuaded that Blanche is some princess in disguise . Julie likes well enough to talk herself , and sometimes ventures on a little story of her own , but that is the only thing that sends Blanche to her drawing . As soon as Julie takes her turn in the conversation Blanche yawns , then gets restless , takes a fresh sheet of paper , sharpens a new pencil , and we have the opening scene over agaim They are a hopeless case I am afraid . If any one should suggest to Blanche that rules were made to keep and not to break , she would only open her great gray eyes in utter amazement and disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listens with all her ears , often giving me a mischievous little look that shows she sees through them perfectly . Madame is quickly getting used to our ways here . She is very ambitious to do everything just as we do and watches us closely , so that now she falls into rank with the rest of us as we march in files from one room to another , or from the refectory to the playground , and makes her courtesy on entering or leaving a room as if she had been trained to it for years . She told us a little to-day about her ways at home . The Duchess of Montpensier brings up her children very sensibly , and they all have to get up at six and go to bed at eight . Madame was quite disappointed when she came here to find that our hours are even earlier than hers , for we get up at half past five . However her bed-time is earliest , which consoled her somewhat . Her playmate is the Prince Ferdinand , a year older than herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never dream of going to bed without their father 's blessing . Merc*d*s says that sometimes when their father is off with the hunt he is delayed till nearly midnight ; but , instead of undressing , the children stay down-stairs and take naps in chairs till he gets back . They are never allowed to lie on sofas when older people are present , but Merc*d*s says she can sleep very soundly in a chair . When the father comes home , they just wake up enough to receive his embrace and blessing and get off to bed as fast as they can . November 26th , 1873 . Yesterday was the feast of St. Catherine , the patroness of young maidens , which is a great holiday in France . Of course , we had grand doings at the convent ,  --  no lessons all day , a lottery and games in the morning , a concert in the afternoon , extra courses at dinner , and theatricals in the evening . But the day began all wrong . After breakfast the whole school was called into one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found assembled . There it turned out that the girls in the larger dormitory , excited by the anticipation of the day 's festivities , had " cut up " like everything . The irrepressible Blanche A- was the ringleader , as usuaL She had waked up in the middle of the night , and , feeling lively , woke the girls around her , and began to act Punch and Judy with the pillow-cases for their entertainment . They got laughing so and made such a racket that the whole dormitory was roused , and the girls jumped up and ran round to see what the fun was . The two poor nuns who guard the dormitory had their hands full trying to bring them back to order , and it was nearly morning before anything like sleep was possible . The superior-general spoke seriously to the principal offenders , and Blanche A - and half a dozen others , besides a perfect shower of bad notes , were not to come to the concert or join in any of the games during the day ; only they were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were going to act . But one girl did n't escape so easily . The chief instigator of the frolic had been Alice de L- , one of the older girls , who ought to have known better . She had got in some scrape last week , and the nuns threatened to separate her from the class ; but she had been penitent and they had been lenient . But this time they said they could not pass over her disobedience ; so she was marched upstairs into a little room opening out of the lingerie , where she will be under the eye of a mistress , and there she is to stay , taking her walks and - her meals alone , till she is willing to beg pardon of the whole school for her bad example . All this cast a gloom on the beginning of the day ; but it ended up brilliantly . In the morning , while we were in the midst of some exciting games , Fanny N- came rushing to me in a state of despair . One of the plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got up among the girls of the Epglish class , and they wanted me to take the place of Alice de L- , who had had the second part . I was horrified at the thought of acting with so little preparation ; but I finally consented , to prevent the play 's Yalling through , for Fanny N , who had the principal part , knew it so splendidly that it would have been too bad not to give her the chance to distinguish herself . So that whole day I haunted the garden , book in hand , like the troubled spirit I was , missing the concert and half the other good things . Just before dinner we had a rehearsal , and it was some compensation for my woes to be drilled by Sister Marie N- , apretty Englishnun , with whom I am much in love . Things looked rather hopeless at this rehearsaL My part went haltingly enough , and it turned out that Bertha V , who was Bemardo , did n't know the first word of hers , and stumbled so over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to give up the play , after all . But at dinner the girls found out the trouble we were in , and were full of sympathy , and eager to get up a petition from the whole school begging the superioress to release Alice de L- just for this one night to act ; then she could take Bertha 's part , which she knew as well as her own . In honor of the holiday we were allowed to talk in the refectory , to change our places , and sit wherever we liked . The uproar that ensued in this great room full of girls chattering , laughing , shouting across the room to one another , dragging heavy benches over stone floors , and dropping cups and knives on the marble-topped tables , was enough to have driven the whole community distracted . Sister Fran9oise was as indulgent as possible , for she likes to have us enjoy ourselves ; but at last things came to such a pass that she brought down her gavel on the table with a rap that hushed us in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were not only very ill-bred , but were abusing our privileges , and now we might finish the meal in // silence . At this a few Moyennes rebelled ; but as they were the principal offenders , we Grandes quickly hushed them down , and we sat the rest of dinner in mournful , silent rows . After dinner , when we were free again , the girls renewed their offer of begging for Alice 's release , and a deputation was formed to be sent to the superior-general . It was suggested that the proper person to head it would be the Princess d'Orleans , and so the deputation adjourned to the little parlor where the princess had been dining with the Ribbons . Poorlittle Madame was much urged , and had a hard time of it . She refused at first ; but the girls thought it was from shyness , so they teased her to go , painting our case and the disasters that would ensue if Alice were not to . act , in the most dismal colors , and reminding her that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything for her schoolmates . The poor child hesitated a long time , divided in her mind between her feeling that the superioress was right in punishing Alice , and her eager wish to be popular with her playfellows . She colored , and the tears came into her eyes ; but she was firm in refusing , confiding in Anne de G- that she thought the nuns knew better than we what was good for Alice 's character , and we ought not to interfere with their plans and give them the pain of refusing us . Some of the girls were provoked with Madame , and muttered " Little prig , " and " She 's afraid , " but most of the Ribbons came forward and supported her , taking their stand against the deputation . However , they could n't prevent its starting off . After they had gone , Horatio , Bernardo and I repaired to the dressing-room to get ready , studying our parts till the last moment , and Sister Marie N- flying round to put us in order . What a palpitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , with whom you are desperately in love , suddenly drop on her knees before you to strap up your boots ! As soon as we were dressed , we flew down-stairs again and paced the cloisters in suspense , for the girls were gone so long that we began to grow quite hopeful . When they appeared they said the superioress had been as kind and sympathetic as possible , and would be very glad to release Alice , only that she must go through the form of begging pardon first ; and had mounted way up to the lingerie to have an intervie*v with Alice , and give her the girls ' message . But Alice was obstinate , and would not beg pardon . I think she clung to the hope that they would let her out at the last moment , to prevent the play 's being given up , and she *did n't care how long she was in l ) unishn ) ent afterward . By that time , the Petites had come over from the other building , and the nuns and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor , where they had put up a stage which is kept ready for such occasions . We determined to try our scene , anyho*v , so we rehearsed till the last moment in the dressing-room , while the first play was going on ; Fanny and I sending Sister Marie N into fits of laughter by overacting absurdly , and going into ecstasies of terror over the ghost . We noticed that Bertha was unwontedly quiet , and just as our turn came to go on to the stage , the poor child burst into tears , declaring she could not , would not play-that she was frightened to death ; and really she was as l ) ale as a sheet , and her teeth chattered in her head . We were in despair what to do ; but Fanny and I scolded and encouraged her by turns , and between us we managed to drag her on to the stage . There , between Fanny 's spirited acting and the ghost , which was a grand success , the thing really went off very well . But Bertha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , had to be prompted every time , and finally broke down on her only long speech . Fortunately , Fanny , with great presence of mind , finished it up for her somehow , and went right on , so that nobody noticed it . I could have hanged Bertha , if the poor soul had n't felt so badly about it . The ghost was very effective . We got Camille R- to take the part ,  --  a tall , . black-eyed girl , with marked aquiline features . She appeared enveloped in grayishwhite draperies , and a blue flame playing about her mouth ,  --  caused by phosphorus , or something ,  --  quite startling the audience , and frightening some of the Petites* almost out of their wits . Camille do n't know a word of English , so Sister Marie N- had to stand behind her and shove her on when the time came . The French plays that followed ours were very bright and pretty , full of good hits and funny misadventures . They were written for the occasion by two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things . One of them was a sort of operetta , adapted to music we all know . They were capitally acted by a dozen girls , among whom was Blanche A , the heroine of last night 's adventures . The audience were kept in shouts of laughter , the nuns enjoying it all ' // as much as any of us . We mingled with the audience after the acting was over , and had a jolly time of it . Cakes and candy were passed free to the actors , and fruit and lemonade sold among the girls , who feel justified in wasting their substance on such things , as the proceeds go to the poor . Since the English play turned out a success , the girls seem to have experienced a revulsion of feeling . I found them all saying that it was just as well Alice had not been allowed to act ; that she would learn that she was not all-important on such occasions , as she seemed to think herself ; and they could n't understand her being so obstinate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become quite a heroine in their eyes for having taken the stand she did . Thursday , December- . The third division in history , Sister Marguerite 's class in the Middle Ages ; came down in quite an excited frame of mind this evening . It is a large class , made up mostly of Moyennes , and contains a number of girls as full of mischief as any in the school . Sister Marguerite has had a good deal of trouble all winter in trying to keep order and silence during the recitations , and now to-night the girls reached a pitch of noise and dissipation that made lessons almost impossible . Bad notes , usually so effectual , were now of no avail , and as one by one the older girls got led away by the spirit of mischief that prevailed , poor Sister Marguerite felt that all authority was fast slipping from her hands ; and when at last little , quiet , demure Madame , to the delight of the offenders , could resist their overtures no longer , but began too , to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be resorted to . With a rap on the desk that made every one jump , she said , sternly , " Merc6d*s ! " The princess started to her feet , and turned crimson , and the girls looked up to hear what was coming next . Sister Marguerite went on gravely : " Merc6d*s , I am grieved to *ge you encouraging this conduct in your classmates . You may go and stand at the door till the class is quiet . " All was hushed in an instant , and the girls were aghast ; for to stand at the door is considered one of the most humiliating of punishmerits , and is seldom resorted to except with the Petites . The door of the recitationroom is a glass one , leading into the hall , right at the foot of the staircase where people are continually passing ; so that the offender , who stands outside , is in full sight of the passers-by , as well as of the class . The girls looked wonderingly at each other , at the mistress , then at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment she hesitated , then she turned and walkedquickly , with head bent down , to the door , opened it , went out and stood there with her hands folded and with a very red face . This step had the desired effect of bringing the class to order , for there was hardly a girl but felt she deserved the punishment far more than Madame . However , Sister Marguerite let her stay there several minutes . Just as she was about to call her back , down the stairs came the good , kind mistress of class , who has a soft spot in her heart for all little sinners , and who could n't help laughing at Madame s discomfiture at being seen in such a position , and , embracing her , led her back to class , asking Sister Marguerite if the child had n't been doing penance long enough . From this till the end of the lesson , the girls were all like little models . This evening , after Madame had left , the nuns told us that after class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having given her this punishment , saying , " You have reminded me that , in my position , I ought always to give the highest example . I hope I never shall forget iL " She always takes a reproof in such good spirit that I do n't wonder the nuns think so much of her . December 29th , 1873 . The dreadful day of judgment is passed and the New-year 's vacation is at hand . The last week has been taken up by the quarterly examinations , and yesterday was the grand " Lecture des Notes " - an ordeal dreaded by good and bad alike . It takes place in the big recreation-hall , where all the classes , with the superioresses and whole staff of teachers , are assembled . The mistress of class calls the girls names in order , and each one has to stand up before the whole august assemblage while the mistress reads her average in conduct and studies for the term , and the list of good and bad notes ; and then those of her teachers who have any complaints*. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious to bestow , do it then and there . Some of the poor sinners of the class have a hard time of it , though we all stand more or less in awe and trembling . However , the nuns are always very quick to see little efforts at goodness and most kind in making allowance for faults . Among those who fared the worst was our young friend Blanche A- , from whose teachers there went up one universal wail , for Blanche 's sins were in number // as the sands of the sea . My neighbor , Alexandrine , was another sufferer . It seems , Alexandrine has been discovered lately perusing " Les Maiheurs de Sophie , " and other harmless books , during study hour . Now , Alexandrine has tried class after class in school , and in each she has straightway taken her place at the foot ; and the picture of this fat , lazy girl , with her preference of infantile literature to serious application , was too much for the nuns , with their quick , French sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jesting at her expense . XVhen Alice de L stood up , her report was received with a silence more mortifying than the severest reproach , and as she sat down the poor girl burst into tears , the first sign of feeling she has shown since her punishment . Afterward , when we had gone back to class , she came into the room with the superioress and knelt down in sight of us all , while the mother , in a few words , begged us to pardon Alice and receive her back , as she was earnestly desirous of doing better . She came and took her seat in class again , and I have been much pleased with the tact and consideration the girls have shown in treating her . I was cunous to see how the Princess d'Orl*ans would fare on this occasion ; but she had to take her share , as I supposed . Madame , it was said , had given perfect satisfaction in her behavior , and studied very well in class , but she did not make the progress they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English teacher remarked an aversion on Madame 's part to talk in any language other than her own , whereupon the superioress gave a little lecture on the necessity of conversation in becoming familiar with a language . That reminds me of a funny scene at the English examination , where Madame was called upon to recite something . She chose Longfellow 's " Psalm of Life , " and stood up quite bravely at first . She did very well till about half-way through , and then , all at once , she got stuck , and the first thing we knew she had utterly disappeared from view . The child had been so mortified at her failure that in her embarrassment she sat down ; but so comic an effect had this sudden disappearance that the whole room burst out laughing . Nothing would persuade Madame to get up and face us again . On the whole , the nuns have been most kind and indulgent to us . I suppose they have had a great deal of experience with children and know how it is best to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1874 . We have just come down from chapel , and I seize this opportunity for a letter , though the mistress is looking at me very hard as if she thought I was wasting my time . Alexandrine , my bt*te ; zoir* , has had her seat changed and is now a heavy cross to Anne de G Anne has a horror of all untidiness , and Alexandrine has been meddling with the inkstand and now there it goes , spattering all over Anne 's immaculate copy-book-the pride of her heart . Anne loses command of her temper , rasped by such constant little annoyances , and flies out at Alexandrine . But repentance follows quick on her wrath , and now she bursts into tears , sobs she knows she is not good enough to weartthe ribbon , and for a moment there is quite an uproar , but at last Anne gets consoled , and Alexandrine gets a note of carelessness . At the next desk is little Madame struggling to fold up her veil . We wear long muslin veils at chapel instead of hats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Madame s veil being ne'v , is stiff as a board , stands out in all directions , and keeps slipping off her head ; so the poor child has no peace in chapel with trying to keep it on , and finally had to ask permission to wear her hat . Just now we are all looking forward to the *8th , which is the fife of the superior-general , and a great holiday here . There is to be a representation of " Athalie " that night , and we have been rehearsing diligently for some time . I say we , though I am only one of the chorus of Levites . We are going to have Mendelssohn 's music , and the acting will be very good , I think . Camille R- , our friend of ghostly memory , is Athalie , and she is tragedy queen personified , and Elizabeth de M , President of the Ribbons , who is the High-priest , has a great deal of dramatic poweri They have got a precocious mite from the Little Convent to be Joas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this atom of a child and her appre*iation of the fine points of the play are wonderful . There was great tribulation before a suitable Mathan was found . Stephanie 5- , a talented Polish girl of high rank , was to have the part , and we thought she would do it very well , but l4nfortunately she is very sensitive , and the nuns got tired of being answered by a burst of tears every time they proposed a different accent or gesture , so they tried several girls before alighting on Jeanne L- , one of the Ribbons . Jeanne has a good deal of spirit and acts capitally , but has to stand N // no little roughing about her appearance , - it looks so funny to see her pretty baby face and innocent eyes in the character of the crafty apostate . However , she looks as dignified as possible while acting , and afterward joins heartily in the laughter at her own expense . We rehearse almost every day , in fact everything is " Athalie " now . The girls are always addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as for poor Margot de H the appellation of " Cd enfa ; i/ fatal " will probably stick to her for the rest of her days . We do n't expect to do anything in a sober-minded way again till the *8th is safely over . There is also to be a reception of Ribbons that day . I do n't mean a party , but that a few girls are to be chosen for the white ribbon from among the aspirants , and probably some new aspirants chosen too . The aspirants wear a purple ribbon , which it takes from four to six months ' good conduct to earn . With it they get certain privileges , and then are on probation about the same length of time again before they can get the white ribbon and medal , as there are so many responsibilities attached to that , that the nuns have to be very sure of a girl 's character before they will give it . If the Ribbons prove trustworthy and efficient , they can be a great help in running the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w* generally have as many as twelve or fourteen . If-there ! I 'm caught ! The mistress has been staring at me for some time , and now asks if this is not my hour to be at the piano , so I have to answer meekly , " Yes , ma m ? rC , " and put away my pen . February 1st , 1874 , * . 1'Infirmerie . The superior-general 's feast was a most successful day throughout . We were not told till the night before who had been chosen for the ribbons , and of course I was quite excited to find that I was to be one of the four new aspirants . Madame la Princesse d'Orkans was also one , and three aspirants were chosen for the white ribbon , all of them girls who are very popular in the school . The reception was to have taken place right after early mass , but at the time appointed Madame never appeared . We waited and waited and got no message , and at last it got so late we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chapel , kneeling before the altar , in our veils , and with lighted tapers in our hands . There was some lovely singing , and as we left the chapel the girls crowded round us to give us their congratu lations , and in the midst of the general rejoicing Madame made her appearance . We were all inquiry , but could get nothing out of her , and she was taken off immediately to apologize to the superioress . We were curious to find out why she had n't come , and as well as we could gather from different sources , the case seemed to be this : When the nuns told her she was to have the ribbon , she was much surprised , for she had thought that , being only a day scholar , she would not be allowed to wear it . She was very much affected , and kept repeating that she did n't deserve it ; that not spending the nights here , she did n't have half the temptation to break rules that the other girls had , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that she ought to have it than because she really had earned it . After she got home , she decided that she would be better satisfied to wait till the next reception , in June , to be made aspirant , and feel sure in her own mind that she deserved the ribbon . Whether she consulted with her parents or not , I do n't know . I believe she did , and that they sustained her in refusing ; but at any rate she dreaded so having a fuss made over it , that she said nothing about the reception being at such an early hour , and did not come out till her usual time . Some of the girls thought she had no right to be so scrupulous , but that she ought to take the ribbon , if th ' * nuns gave it to her , and try to deserve it afterward . At any rate , we are all sorry not to have Madame an aspirant , for she has made herself very much liked by her sweet , modest ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doings . Yet , on the whole , I do n't know but that she is more popular than ever , for French nature is so quick to see and admire anything a little above the common standard , and the ribbon is so much thought of here . As blunt , honest Augustine M-. said , " I never could have refused it , if I had felt I deserved it ever so little ; why , my shoulders fairly ache 'd to wear it ! " When the princess came back she was very cordial in congratulating us , kissing us on both cheeks , as the other girls had done ; but , I fancied , looking a bit wistfully at our decorations . Of course , " Athalie " was felt by all to be the grand event of the day , if not of the age . We had a final rehearsal of the choruses in the morning , and had to practice grouping ourselves for the different scenes , so as to make the most effect and yet take up the least room on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , which have been got up with great care , // and are really quite gorgeous and oriental . The scenery , too , which was painted by the nuns , was very effective . Madame was to have spent the night out here , in order to see the play ; but just at the last moment she bid us good-bye , very much disappointed not to stay . The girls had a report-I do n't know how true it was-that the Duchess of Montpensier did not wish Merc6d*s to spend so much time here , as she was already so much attached to the convent that they were afraid she would want to become a nun , and they had other plans for her future . Well , the play went off without a hitch , and everybody thought it was wonderfully well done , Elizabeth de Mand " Ze te/if . Joas " carrying off the honors , of course . We had more fun than a little behind the scenes . I never saw people so quick as the French to seize on any absurdity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a great deal of roughing of the actors between the scenes . But they can be serious , too , and the play was a great deal of it pretty tragic and impressive . A quantity of sugar-water and candy was provided for the actors and chorus , to prevent their getting hoarse , and we all profited by it , especially Blanche A , who , from the amount she dispatched , you would think had the leading part of the play . She had only a dozen lines to say ; but she made more fuss than any one , giving herself the most important airs , criticising freely , and making the most unasked-for suggestions to the actors . The Grandes got perfectly furious with Blanche ; but she is so impervious to all snubs that there is nothing to be done with her . After the play was over , we were sent up to the dormitories , to take off our costumes and put on our uniforms before we were allowed to mingle with our friends in the audience , for fear of catching cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actors got no little praise . It was quite difficult to subside into ordinary school life again , after all this excitement . However , everything is running very smoothly just now , and I am gradually getting used to wearing the ribbon and to my duties as aspirant . I have not entered on my duties very vigorously though , yet , for I have been confined to the infirmary for some days . In spite of the care taken of us on the night of " Athalie , " I managed to take cold , and this cold has developed into a cough ; and though I made every effort to suppress it , I have been sentenced to the infirmary . The history of how it came about is rather funny . I sleep in a little room , one of the nuns ' cells , right at the door of the dormitory , and the superiorgeneral , who has a severe cold , has lately been moved into the cell next to me , as it is supposed to be warmer than the others , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers seemed to cause a good deal of excitement among the nuns , for it was told me about thirty-six times . In the first place it was publicly announced in class so that the girls might be very quiet in passing her door on the way to the dormitory . Then I got a private warning . One of the nuns who guards the dormitory said to me as I was going into my room , " Perhaps you do n't know , my dear child , that the superioress has just moved into the room next to you , so you must be careful to make as little noise as possible in undressing . You had better take off your boots first thing . " I thanked her for the warning and retired . I followed her advice , took my boots right off and undressed as quietly as possible . In a few minutes I felt I must cough or perish . I swallowed about six glasses of water and stuffed a handkerchief into my mouth , but it was no use , the coughing fit came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there came a gentle tap at the door . I opened it . A nun was passing by and hearing me cough she thought she had better warn me , so she said very softly , " My dear child , you must try not to cough if you can help it , or you will disturb the superioress , Perhaps you have not been told that she is quite ill and has just moved into the next room . " I promised to be quieter , and consequently I passed the night in the most uncomfortable , half-strangled condition , with my head buried under the pillows . The next morning I was half awake when I heard a knock so low that I thought it must be at the next door . But it was repeated , so I got up and opened a crack of the door . A lay-sister poked her head in . " I am sorry to disturb you , Mademoiselle , but I thought you would be already up , so I stopped to let you know that the superioress has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not well , if you will be good enough to make as little noise as possible in dressing . For instance , if you did not put on your boots till the last thing . I beg your pardon for disturbing you . " I smiled and said it was no matter , and she departed . But in my efforts not to make a noise I was twice as long as usual // dressing , for it took about ten minutes to put on each separate thing ; consequently when I got ready it was so late that the others had already gone down to mass . I hurried out of the room , but the door has no handle and shuts with a key , and no one can do anything in a hurry ; so , after rattling a good deal to no purpose , the key finally fell on the hard floor with a great clatter . One of the nuns was outside at the fountain and looked at me reproachfully . " My child , try not to be so careless again , for the superioress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " During the day I had some rest from the subject , but as bedtime drew near , I knew it would be brought up again , and I was not mistaken . I had gone into chapel a few minutes before evening prayer to make my little meditation . The chapel is lovely at that hour ; it is not lighted , except for the one lamp always burning before the altar ; there is no service going on , only a few nuns kneeling at the stations of the cross , and everything is very sweet and peaceful . I had not been there two minutes when I felt a hand laid lightly on my shoulder . I turned and saw the superioress of the pensionnat . " I am sorry to disturb you , my child , but will you come with me a moment ? I have a little word to say to you . " I followed her into the entry and she began rn the most mysterious manner : " I wish to tell you , my dear ,  --  it may be quite useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose you are a noisy child at all , - but as Our Mother they always call the superior-general , Our Mother ' is suffering from a bad cold , she has just been moved into the room next to you ; so you must be as still as possible . For instance , you had better take your boots off when you first go in your room . You have slippers , have you not , that you can put right on ? I dare say you always do this , but still I thought it safest to tell you . " I thanked her , and went off , wondering who would be the next . I knew it would n't stop there , and , sure enough , as we were forming into rank to go up to bed , the mistress of class beckoned me aside . " My dear child , have you been told that the superioress has taken the room next you ? " I said I believed I had , so she went on , " No/re M ? re tells me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you . Not that your cold is serious at all ,  --  it is only that we have lost so many Sisters by consumption , that she dreads the very sound of a cough . You had better stop at the infirmary , and get something to take for your throat , and I hope you will control your cough as much as possible . " To control a cough is easier said than done , so I mounted to the infirmary . Before I had fairly got into the room , the mistress of the infirmary caught sight of me , and began , " You are the very little person I most want to see . I was just going for you , to give you something to stop that cough of yours . By . the way , I do n't know whether anyone has told you yet that No/re Af ? re has just moved into your neighborhood . She is not at all well , and I am afraid it will disturb her to have such a noisy person next to her . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I laughed , and said I would do my best , and Sister Constance , the little lay-sister of the infirmary , was sent to concoct a draught for me . After I had got ups.tairs and my boots oW she appeared at the door with it , coming into the room to see that I drank every drop ,  --  " For perhaps you have n't heard , Mademoiselle , that No/re M ? re , who is quite ill , is in the next room to you . " She was for continuing , but I interrupted . F made her sit down , and I told her the whole story from beginning to end , and she laughed till she cried . That was not the last of it , though , for the superioress inquired what child it was that roomed next to her and had a cough , and was told it was one of the Americans ; but as there are three Americans in the school , she always confuses our names , and before she got hold of the right culprit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that she was now their neighbor , and hoped their cough would soon be better . She was much amused , after each in their turn had declared their innocence , when she alighted on me , and I had to acknowledge myself the guilty one . In spite of my protestations that I was fast getting well , she felt worded about me , and when I went upstairs that night there was no bed in my room . I exclaimed , and was quietly told that it had been taken down to the infirmary , and I might collect my things and follow it there . I felt rebellious , but it was too late to alter things that night , so I went down , and somehow I seem to be here still . The infirmary is pleasant enough , large and sunny , with a cozy open fire and several arm-chairs-things which do n't exist in any other part of the house , so we make the most of them . Still , I miss my little room very much , except for one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed , there is about six inches of wall between my head and the // chain of that bell , which scrapes up and down close to my ear . At five in the morning the nuisance begins . They call it the angelus bell , but it is not the angelus bell of poetry and song . You know how precious are the last few moments of the morning 's nap , and it is just then that that wretched bell is the most busy . It begins and rings out , solemnly , one , two , three , three times ; then , very deliberately , it tolls twenty . Then it suddenly starts off as if distracted and rings , rings interminably . The first morning I thought it was bewitched . I lay there counting ,  --  would it never stop ? Forty , fifty , . - surely that was enough to waken a household ! But on it went mercilessly till I lost my count somewhere in the eighties , and was nearly wild . I tried counting several mornings , always getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nervous over it that I would wake up at about four in the morning , in my eagerness to be ready to begin . I have decided finally that the number is a hundred and twenty . There is a few minutes ' rest from that quarter till getting-up time , but the nuns undertake to arrange their rooms just then , and as the fountain is in the hall just outside my door , there is a grand stampede till the next bell , when they all rush off to chapel , and sometimes they do n't get quite through in time , and there is a muttering of ; " DeL fr / es/-ce possible I " and pitchers and brooms are dropped like so many hot potatoes . This time the bell rings in a general kind of way , and ends by tolling twenty-five ; but we do n't mind it so much after this , as we are up and dressing , which is fortunate , as it rings pretty much all day ,  --  what between the hours and half hours , the services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one having a number , which is rung out after the manner of the fire-districts in Boston , and has quite a home-like sound . March , 1874 . We have just had a visit from Monsignor Capel , the distinguished English prelate . I was very glad to see him , as I had always heard so much of him . He is connected with the English branch of our convent and pays a visit here every year , and is very popular with the children , as he always begs a holiday for us on his visits , and we look forward with delight to Monsignor Capel 's day , as we call it . We heard him preach twice , in English of course . He is a tall , squarebuilt , handsome man , with a strong face and a very impressive manner in preaching , - dignified , but full of zeal . I expected to be carried away by his sermons but they struck me as being more forcible and sensible than brilliant . He is very fascinating in private . He asked to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Salle des Enfants de Marie . There he was very kind and pleasant and entertained us nearly an hour . He began by making a funny little speech in French , which he talks in the most English way possible , and got us all laughing . Then he asked to have the rogues of the school come up to him , and half a dozen of the Petites actually did step forward ; and he made them tell all about the latest scrapes they had got into , till they were covered with confusion and the rest of us laughed till the tears ran down our cheeks . He amused himself guessing the nationality of the foreigners and was right in every case but mine for he made me out to be Scotch . The foreigners make quite a respectable show-one Russian , one Pole , one Swiss , four Belgians and several Spaniards . Madame stood up among the Spaniards , for she is very proud of her nationality and devoted to everything Spanish . The poor child is in the deepest mourning now , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Prince Ferdinand of Montpensier , a year older than herself . She had the measles a little while ago and was away from school some time . She only had them slightly , but her brother caught them and died after a few days ' illness . It is very sad , for now the only son left is a sickly little fellow of seven or eight . Madame has been quieter than ever since she got back , and no wonder . We English-speaking girls were brought up and introduced to Monsignor Capel after-. ward , as he asked particularly to know us . We are seven , two English , two Irish and three Americans . He talked very pleasantly with us , but without trying to make us laugh as he had before . He preached again that afternoon at the prise d ' /zabit of a young novice , an American I believe and a convert . It was curious to see how he changed from the agreeable man of the world to the earnest and dignified prelate . Before leaving Monsignor Capel elicited great applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half holiday for us . It is , however , to be put off till mid-Lent . July , 1874 . There have been a good many changes lately in the school . Sister Madeleine , the lovely mistress of the Moyenne class , has had to be sent to some baths // on account of her health , and since then , instead of appointing a new mistress , the class has beea put under the charge of the Ribbons , and we take turns in guarding it . I wear the white ribbon now , so I come in for more than the usual responsibilities of my station . To do the Moyennes justice , they have behaved extremely well . They feel put on their honor to be silent and good when they have only one of their own coinpanions to look after them , and every one remarks how quiet and studious they are . How long the supernatural goodness will last it is impossible to tell . The Princess d'Orh*ans is now aspirant , and has worn the purple ribbon for one month. * *Ladame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has been a great family gathering , and she was absent from school for several days , and when she came back we knew it had all been arranged .

Another change in the school : Blanche A- , the irrepressible , has at last overstepped all bounds . Even the long-suffering nuns have found her unbearable , and Blanche , to the unmitigated delight of the Grandes , has been sent to a branch convent at N- , where , as it is a much smaller school than ours , she will get more discipline and more particular attention . Another cause of joy to our souls is the removal of Alexandrine , who has been caught in a succession of be*tires , till at last they took a quantity of false curls out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stole into the Moyenne class , spilt ink partou/* over books and everything , and then let another girl be blamed for it for some time . But at last the nuns found out the truth and she was expelled . This is an immense relief to poor Anne de G , who has had the worst of it to bear . Anne is as wonderful at her studies as ever , and is certain of the prize of success . The school-year is almost at an end , and we are all hard at work , for the matter of the prizes is soon to be settled , and that is our great excitement now . "
