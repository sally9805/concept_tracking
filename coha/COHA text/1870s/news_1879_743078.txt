txt Does Postmaster JAMES know what a storm of indignation he is preparing for New-York by requiring the names of States and counties to be placed on letters ? Heretofore the citizens of other large cities have regarded New-York as " a stuck-up thing , " as the ladies would put it . Now , if we address our letters to " Chicago , Cook County , Ill. , " we shall be voted insolent and intolerable . Local pride is quite strong in this country . Fortunately , local affection usually goes hand in hand with real local pride , and people are happy and contented in cities which , without these bonds of attachment , could not hold their inhabitants longer than their selfish interests detained them . With what delight the rural newspaper refers to " glorious old Smith County , " when the aforesaid Smith County is probably the youngest county in the State . Not long ago , during an exciting political contest , a Nevada newspaper-writer said that " old Nevada would give a good account of herself at the next election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten that his so-called ancient commonwealth was a howling ' waste of sage-brush , a few years since . And in the ' last National Convention of the Republican Party , one enthusiastic delegate , when the last ballot was about to be taken , arose and said , with great impressiveness : " Mr. Chairman : Colorado , the youngest State in the Union , yielding to none in her admiration for JAMES G. BLAINE , " ( and hero he paused , while the vast assembly wondered if young Colorado would manfully stick by the losing candidate , ) " casts her three votes for RUTHERFORD B. HAYEs ! " Nothing ' but an enormous amount of State pride could have sustained Colorado when the laugh went around at this anti-climax . But the pride with which people regard their State and county is nothing compared with that which they have for their city . If it is a big city , the citizen is proportionately inflated . To a certain degree , the importance of the city is reflected in the individual . The poorest tramp of Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that city , as if , in some way , he Were more of a man for living in the midst of so vast an accumulation of capital . And when it was discovered , or reported to be discovered , that Chicago had killed and packed eleven hogs more than Cincinnati in a certain year , the rejoicings of the first-named city moved all ranks of society . In such a new glory even . the humblest had some personal share . In San Francisco there is so glorious a climate , such strawberries all the year round , and so cosmopolitan a population , that the San Franciscan not only pities people who are compelled to live elsewhere than in his beloved city , but he is sure that you regard him as an individual representative of the eighth wonder of the world . There is , to be sure , an inconsistency in the conduct of this particular variety of citizen . The San Franciscan could not live where he does not have his " strawberries all the year round ; " but as soon as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , and never returns unless he is obliged to . Nevertheless , there can be but one San Francisco in the world . Similarly , there can be but one Chicago , one Boston , and one St. Louis . Most of our readers have been forcibly impressed with the fact that tlire can never be more than one Philadelphia . And yet it is calmly proposed that we shall acknowledge that there are several Chicagos in the United States . As a matter of fact , there are four , situated in as many different States . The genuine thieaio person argues that if obscure villages and hamlets choose to imitate distantly the real Chicago by adopting its name , the ' Chicago should not be humiliated . And it would be a humiliation for a Chicago person to receive a letter with " Illinois " written under the name of his ! famous city . It would be an intimation that there were more Chicagos than one . ' By what right , he will ask , are these paltry villages allevied to obscure the pre-eminence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name We firmly believe that the average - Chicago'man would refuse to receive a letter addressed ? to him at " Chicago , Cook County , IlL " It would be regarded as a studied verbal insult . We can only imagine the indignation with which a Bostonian would regard a letter addressed to him as a citizen of " Boston . Suffolk County . Mass . " So mush ; , culture , capital , breeding , and Mayflowerism swept away at one stroke would be an intolerable affront . There are seven Philadelphias , yet we have heard of an instance of the return of a letter-envelope addressed to " Philadelphia , Penn. , " with the added remark that there was but one city of that name . If Postmaster JAMES 'S order is rigidly enforced , we shall have our correspondence returned from the great cities outside of this State with indignation . It seems to be assumed that the Philadelphia , for example , is entitled to stand alone without the added indorsement of the State of Pennsylvania . As for San Francisco , it is California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local pride swallows up city and State . But , in some of the other cases to which we have alluded , the citizens of great cities will not endure having their abiding-places even apparently distinguished from others of the same name . The city must stand alone . When a letter has only " Philadelphia " for its local address , the great and famous city of that name is intended . The contemptible little Philadelnhias may be designated by their counties and States . Who cares ? But where shall we draw the line ? The City of Williamsburg , N. Y. , is no mean place . But its Post Office address is " Brooklyn , E. D. , " and there are nineteen other Williamsburgs . Why should not some of these similarly-named places set up its claim to be the Williamsburg ? Is the privilege of having State and county omitted from one 's letters to be determined on a basis of population ? or capital ? or area ? We shall be embarked in a laborious study of statistics , census reports , and gazetteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this would require . There is no way out of our dilemma . Since letters addressed to Philadelphia , simply , may go to Ohio , or to Delaware County , N. Y. , we might as well be on the safe side , and make sure of our share of the responsibility by adding " Penn . " to the address . This done , we may calmly abide the coming of the storm .
