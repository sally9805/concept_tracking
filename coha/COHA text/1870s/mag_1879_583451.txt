trunk which I bought of that miserable buffoon in the Via Sistina , I should easily persuade myself that the actual world were bounded on the east by the Atlantic and on the west by the Pacific Ocean . I was just considering whether I should try to smuggle it through the custom-house , or whether , perhaps , it would be wiser to give Uncle Sam his due . " " And what does the relief represent ? " asked Cranbrook , half indifferently . " It is a copy from an antique one . Agamemnon robbing Achilles of his Cranbrook gave a start , and walked rapidly toward the other end of the boat . In half an hour he returned , stopped in front of Vincent , grasped his hand warmly and said : " Harry , let us agree never to refer to that which is passed .

There is an epilogue to this tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter of 187- , ten years after their first Italian sojourn , the two friends again visited Rome together . One beautiful day in February , they found themselves , perhaps not quite by accident , in the neighborhood of the well-remembered villa . They rang the bell at the garden gate and were admitted by a robust young man who seemed to be lounging among the overgrown hedges in some official capacity . The mossy Triton was still prosecuting his thankless task in the midst of his marble basin ; the long stairs to the terrace were yet as damp and slippery as of old , and the noseless Roman senator was still persevering in his majestic attitude although a sprig of maiden-hair was supporting its slender existence in the recess of his countenance which had once been occupied by his stately nose . Vincent and Cranbrook both regarded these familiar objects with peculiar emotions , but faithful to their agreement , they made no comment .

Cranbrook gazed long at the child , then lifted it up in his arms and kissed it . The young man who had opened the gate for them stood by observing the scene with a doubtful expression of suspicion and wonder . As the stranger again deposited the child on the blanket in the bottom of the sarcoph gus , he stepped tip before the door and called : Annunciata A tall , comely matron appeared in the door  --  and the strangers hastened away . DICK . SATURDAY evening , the iith of January , 1873 , 1 entered the ruins of the old d*p6t at the foot of Lake street , in Chicago , to take the Michigan Central night express , for Ann Arbor . My half-finished cigar led me to enter the smoking-car , where I took the second seat from the rear , and presently began studying the very unusual company of passengers in front of me . The car was nearly filled with men who were returning from California ; a wild , rough set of fellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but were now coming back disappointed and reckless . They were rudely dressed , and each man wore at his belt , strapped on outside his blouse , either a knife or a revolver , while arms of greater magnitude leaned against every seat . The party had been traveling for more than three weeks , having been snowed in again and again on the far Western roads . Weary and desperate as they were , they sang roaring songs , and shouted and quarreled ; but more than all , they drank . A large demijohn stood on a shelf in the front left-hand corner of the car , arid from this the cups and bottles were filled from time to time as it became necessary . As we swept around the head of the lake , we halted , for the first time since starting , at Michigan City . Here a new passenger entered the car and took the seat immediately behind mine . A hasty glance showed him to be a man of about thirty-five , stout , with dark complexion , brown eyes and hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business that made me look at him twice . // He wore a somewhat faded , shaggy overcoat , a fur turban cap , and heavy top-boots into which his trowsers were tucked . He had no baggage , but held a lantern in his left hand , swinging it carelessly between his knees and often looking thoughtfully at it for some minutes at a time . Again and again I found myself half turned in my seat , gazing at him . Meanwhile the din and rowdyism in the car grew more and more boisterous . Presently one of the loudest and worst-looking of the company , having filled a large bottle from the tank in the corner , began to pass it to each one in turn as he staggered down the aisle . On he came toward the rear , drinking , cursing , yelling ; and every man that he passed drank with him . At last he stood at the seat before mine . I saw that he was about to offer me the bottle , and to avoid him , I turned and looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he reached over and pulled me by the shoulder , forcing me to face him , and told me to drink . He was a well-built fellow , six feet and over , brawny , and with two navy revolvers in his belt , and a large dirk-knife at his breast , and he was thoroughly drunk . I looked him straight in the eye , but be only leered at me and renewed his demand . I apologized , told him I never drank , and begged off as best I could , but it was all of no avail . I tried to get out of the seat , and so out of the car , but he stood across the passage , and raising the botde high over his head with one hand , he held me by the shoulder with the other , and with a terrible oath , commanded me to drink or he would break the bottle over my head . In stature I am five feet eight , and both Howe and Fairbanks agree that I kick the beam at one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that discretion was the better part of valor , so , taking the bottle from his hand , I choked down a swallow of its vile contents . Pushing me back into the seat , the ruffian proceeded to the stranger behind me and offered him the liquor . The man was bending over , holding his lantern with both hands , and slowly swinging it backward and forward . He raised his keen brown eyes to those of the rough , dropped his chin slightly , and then , without emotion , said deliberately ,  --  " Go to hell ! " The assailant was dazed for an instant , but recovered himself , and renewed his demand . Then the stranger set his lantern upon the floor , stood up to his full height , and said quietly : " Stranger , I do n't want no fuss with you , an ' I do n't caiclate to have any , but the best way for you to get clear of a knockdown 11 be to get away from here about as quick as you can ! Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stood there so quiet , yet so determined , that the drunken man , after eying him for a minute , dropped his head , turned , and went , mumbling , to the front of the car and sat down . The stranger stood till the man was seated , and then , seating himself , took up his lantern and quietly swung it as before . I was overwhelmed with shame , and turned and apologized to him . The keen brown eyes looked frankly into mine as I spoke , and seemed to read me through and through . When I had finished , the man placed his hand almost tenderly upon my arm which rested upon the back of the seat , and said : " Stranger , do n't you fret . You did all right , for a man in your fix . It likely do n't hurt you to take a swaller o ' whisky , and it would a ' hurt you to a ' got a lick over the head with that bottle , the way that feller was handlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now for me , the thing that I wont do , even if I have to be strung up the next minute if I do n't , is to drink whisky And after a pause : " It war n't always so , though ; for , God knows , I 've drunk enough o ' the stuff in my time . Lord , stranger , I 've seen many a night such as these fellers is havin ' . I 've seen the time when I would n't a ' asked nothin ' better'n to a ' done just as that feller did that come back here with that bottle a minute ago . But I quit about ten years ago , and since then I haint put a drop between my lips . I 'd rather , a thousand times , be took home with a hole in me big enough to drive a yoke o ' cattle through ! You see , stranger , it ai nt everybody that 's got such a wife as me ; and when a man gets such a woman as mine-why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what a woman Dick is , and something o ' what she 's lived through , and how she 's done it , you would n't wonder ! You see the difference between you and me now , do n't you ? But do n't you fret , stranger ! you did all right . " He had taken his hand from my arm after the first few words , and sat there , swinging his lantern as he talked . At the mention of Dick his eyes grew strangely // bright . My interest in him grew , as he spoke , and when he stopped , as he did somewhat abruptly , I found myself exceedingly anxious to know more of him , and especially of Dick . Dropping the subject immediately under consideration , however , I offered the ordinary comments upon the weather and the night . It was bitter cold , the thermometer ranging several points below zero . The moon was full and the sky was clear . The ground was covered with snow to a depth of nearly three feet on a level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make time " with our train over the heavy track . The wheels ran on with that muffled , echoless hum which only deep snow and extreme cold can produce . The wheels hugged the rails with an icy crunching , while the frosty rattle of frozen iron made one feel that every piece of metal either on or under the train must be as brittle as glass . In reply to my remarks on these matters , my companion went on as follows : " Yes , it 's a bad night for a run , and it would n't surprise me any minute to see us go into the ditch . You see I know this road pretty well . I 've been braking here on a through freight for something more n a year now , and when a feller makes four trips a week over a road , in all kinds o ' weather , and at all hours of the day and night , he gets to know the thing pretty well , after a while . We 're on a pretty scaly piece o'track now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Run . The bridge went out last fall , and when they put it back they put in a lot of old rails that had been bent and straightened , and they 're just about like a string o ' clay pipe-stems to-night . If Jack do n't take her slow over that hole he 'll leave us all in it , as sure as - there ! I thought he 'd pull her up . He 's a mighty fine fellow , Jack is , and he knows what he 's about . See him hold her level , now , round this curve just ahead . " As the train sped on , the noisy crowd , one by one , dropped off to a limp and maudlin sleep . My companion seemed pleased to talk and I was equally pleased to listen . Presently a little incident occurred that turned the conversation into the direction I had wished . Looking out of the window over the snow that glistened under the clear , full moon , he pointed out to me a low log house , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track . It was in sight but an instant as we shot by . " There , " said he , " is the old house where I was born , thirty-seven years ago come May . My father moved out here from New York , moren forty years ago , when all there was in this region was bears , Indians , timber and ague . I 've heard the old man tell about shooting bears right out o ' the door o ' that old house back yonder . He come out all the way in a wagon , and squatted here in the woods . Lord , he had no idea then that there 'd ever be a railroad within five hundred miles of him . He was a regular old pioneer  --  the old man was always wanted to he on the go . His name was George Whipple , and I was his oldest boy , and named after him , so I 've always had to write Jr . ' after my name . It 's a pity folks ca n't find names enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been all used up in the family afore . But then it took a good many names to go round in our family . There was thirteen of us altogether , big and little , old and young . Well , my mother died when I was about fourteen , and after she died , my father married again in a few months . I do n't blame him , the way he was fixed ; you see he was poor , and had a lot o ' children to he took care og and he had to have somebody ; so he got married . " Well , me and the old woman he got could n't agree , so I run away and went to Detroit , and began life for myself , a-settin ' an alley , in a whisky saloon . up nine-pins in That 's a bad place to begin , stranger ; but that 's the way I begun for myself , and that 's where I begun to drink . " I stayed there for a couple o ' years , till I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a livery-stable . I worked there for about three years , till I was pretty near of age , and then I went South ,  --  down to Knoxville , Tennessee , and went into the livery business there for myself . And there 's where I first saw Dick . Her father was a planter ; had a nice place , with lots o ' niggers , about twenty miles up the country from Knoxville ; used to live in big style , regular old Southern swell , in fact . " I wish you could a ' seen Dick , stranger , just as she was the first time ever I saw her . She 'd come down to the ville on a visit to some folks I knowed . You see , it was one evenin ' , along about the last o ' September , and a nigger come down to the stable and ordered up a carriage for the old man . Well , the horses was pretty nigh all out , for it was just as nice an evenin ' for a ride as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of it , and so I had to rig up a team of little black fillies , that we had n't had in the stable very long , and dares n't trust to Tom , Dick and harry to drive ; so I made up my mind I 'd go and drive em myself . I tell you they was beauties , stranger ; pretty nigh fullblood Morgans ,  --  just as clean-legged and smooth-built as they ever grow , and full o ' life ; d get up and go for all was out , and yet just as gentle as kittens , if you knowed how to handle em . I 've drove a good many horses in my day , stranger , but I never found anything quite up to a Morgan , and these was just about as nice Morgans as ever I see . " Well , I rigged up , and lit out . Up to the house , the folks was all ready , a-waitin ' out on the porch ; I never noticed much about em , when I first drove up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for folks o ' that stripe , about all he wants to do is to tend to his team , and mind his own business generally . But Lord , stranger , just as I was standin ' there , waitin ' for an old woman to get in , I heard some one laugh , comm ' down the walk . Heavens , stranger , if you only could a ' heard that laugh ! I turned round , and there she was ! Bless your life , stranger , it ai nt no use for me to try to tell you anything about her . I might talk from now till we get to Jackson , and then you would n't be no better off n you are now . You see , Dick 's one o ' them kind o ' women that you 've got to see to know about . She was about fourteen then , not much bigger round n my thumb , not very tall , but slim and graceful as a greyhound . And her eyes , and her lips , and teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , stranger , I ca n't tell you nothin ' about her now , no more ' n I could then . There ai nt but one such face in this world . " Well , she come laughin ' down the walk , and lit into the carriage as though she did n't weigh an ounce , and I shut the door , climbed up , and drove off . Lord , stranger , I never took another such a ride as that in my life , afore or since . Why it just seemed to me I was a-sittin ' on a cloud , and drivin ' an angel right through the sky without ever touchin ' ground . You see , that little team was just what I wanted , just as much like dream horses as you could get , and I just gave the little gals the ribbons , and they took em , you bet . " Well , we drove up the river , and then away back o ' town , up in the hills , and then down the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and ran round to the horses and began pettin ' Kit . ( That was the off one  --  the same one that I 'd been pettin ' all the way . ) She patted her neck and stroked her head , and , finally , she just put her cheek right down on the filly 's face . Kit stood there as quiet as a lamb . And Dick stood there a minute , and then she looked up to me and spoke to me ,  --  the first words she ever said to me in her life . She just looked right at me-I 'll be blowed , stranger , if it do n't go over me now , just to think o ' how she looked at me that evenin '  --  and then she says : You must be good to her , mister driver , for she 's little and nice , and not very strong . Fix her up good tonight , wont you ? - for she 's been an awful long ways for us , and looks tired , poor little thing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get well tended to that night ,  --  mebbe she did n't ! But as near as I can recollect , I did n't leave the stable till about three o'clock in the mornin ' , and I 'll bet you I went into that stall more'n fifty times , to see if there wa' n't something I could do for that little gal . " Well , all this time I 'd been drinkin ' pretty steady . I took a drink that night afore I went to drive them folks . I always drank then , right along ; did n't think I could do without it . But the next mornin ' , when I got up , I went right down to the stable , and never took a drop-somehow I could n't . The first thing I done , I went into Kit 's stall and petted her a little , when the boys wa' n't lookin ' , just as Dick had done . Hanged if I did n't put my face right down against hers , just as Dick done , and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , too . I kept that filly for more'n five years after that , and I would n't a ' sold her then , only I had to . " Well , I did n't drink nothin ' for more n a week , and I kind o ' kept alone by myself a good deal . Two or three times I went up by the house where Dick had been , but I could n't get a sight of her . She told me afterward that she went home the next day , up into the country . Then the boys , they got to makin ' fun of me . You see I 'd quit drinkin ' , and gamblin ' , and swearin' ' mostly-though that was the hardest to get rid of ; I haint got quite clear o ' that yet . But the boys , they asked me when I got religion , and how soon I was goin ' to preachin ' , and all that ; Lord , they had n't no idea what really was the reason for my doin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' just // about run me out o ' town makin ' game of me . When they first begin blowin ' I got mad about it , but I saw that only made things worse , so I finally give in , and went to drinkin ' again . " Well , by inquirin ' round I found out where she lived , and who she was , and all about her . So , along the next spring , I went up that way , sort o ' casual like , to buy some horses . I rigged up in the best I 'd got , and I could sling it on pretty thick them days , too , if I tried , for it was afore the war and times was flush ; I did a good business and owned all my stock . I got up there , and met the old man and talked business with him for a blind , and laid low and kept an eye out for Dick . I saw her at supper , and then I staid all night and spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Dick play and sing for me . Lord , stranger , but she can sing ! Oh no , she ca n't go so high as some of em ; but somehow she 's got a way of getting off a song that just double discounts anything else I ever heard . Oh , well , it 's no use makin ' a long story out of it ! But anyhow , I used to go up there , off and on , for about two years , and I got well acquainted with her ; and the better I got to know her , why , the oftener I went to see her . And then , finally , I got to takin ' that little team o ' blacks up there and goin ' ridin ' with her ; and we used to ride , and talk , and have just the nicest times that two folks ever did have , I reckon . Well , one night we 'd been a-ridin ' till pretty late , and we got back and found all the folks had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the little gals to the barn , and Dick and I went and brought some chairs out onto the porch and set down . You see it was along in the fall , and cool nights , and it was full moon , and the porch fronted the south , and it was just too nice to go off and leave . So Dick and I set down there , and did n't say much for a good while-just looked at the sky and the hills and woods . It was about such a night for moonlight as it is out there now , only there wa' n't no snow . Well , while we 'd been ridin ' I 'd been tellin ' Dick about my life , and what a rough time I 'd had , and all that ; and she 'd said just the best things to me about it , and told me how sorry she was for me , and so on ; and sittin ' there on the porch , we got to talkin ' the matter over again ; and finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to marry me , fair and square ! Well , you just ought to a ' seen her , stranger . She was sittin ' in a kind o ' low chair , and the moon was a-shinin ' right square into her face , so that I could see her just as plain as day . She sat right still and trembled , and just looked right down at her feet , and that made her eyelashes come clear down on to her cheeks . And she 's got the longest and cleanestcut eyelashes I ever see . Well , she never said a word for more'n five minutes . Lord , it seemed like a young eternity to me ! And then she looked up , and her eyes was brim full o ' tears . She did n't really cry , you know , but just had her eyes full o ' tears ready to fall , and tremblin ' like , there in the moonlight ; and she looked right at me for a minute , and then she says ,  --  and her voice kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George ! What made you say that ? ' ( You see she 'd got to know me so well that she just called me George without thinkin ' . ) I 'm nothin ' but a little girl , and you are a man grown . I never thought you come to see me because you wanted to marry me , but only because you liked me , just as I liked you . ' Now wa' n't that a great speech to make to a feller ? Oh well , I took it all back , told her to play I never said it , and all that ; but somehow , after that night , she always seemed different . It just appeared as if she growed into a woman all in one night . " It was a long time afore I ever said anything more to her about it . In fact , I do n't know as I ever would a ' said anything about it again , if she had n't a ' give me a chance to . I used to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' with her , and all that ,  --  and we used to talk just the same , only about that . But one night , I was sittin ' alone out on the porch , where I 'd been smokin ' with the old man , and the first thing I knew she come and kneeled right down afore me , and put both her hands into mine , and she says , George , I never answered that question you asked me so long ago . You have n't forgot it , have you ? I 've been thinkin ' it all over , ever since , and I know now that I 've loved you all the time . I do n't quite see how it is that you should love me ; but I know you do , or you would n't say so , and so I 've come to say yes . ' Well , stranger , may be you know a little how it is yourself about such times . But any how , right there , on that old porch , begun a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haint let up yet , and we 've seen some pretty rough times too , since then . " He paused suddenly , bending forward and listening intently ; then , with a slight nod , he said , " That 's all right . I was just // waiting for us to strike a bad joint on this grade . But Jack is up to it . " He then re-sumed : " This was along in the fall . The old man give his consent , for I was gettin ' on fine ,  --  reckon I was good for about ten thousand them times ,  --  and we never set no time to be married . But along in the winter I had a hard run o ' luck . First I went on a note for a feller , and he broke , and I had to make it up . It was for somethin ' over six thousand , and it run me pretty close to make the raise . That was when I sold Kit . Lord , but I did hate to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after that , one Sunday night , when I was up to see Dick , the stable got afire , and burned up pretty much all I had left . Then in the spring the war broke out , and I always was a-blowin ' round , talkin ' just what I thought , no matter who heard , till finally it got too hot to hold me in that region any longer , and so I sold out most o ' what I 'd got left , and skipped out between two days , and got off to the North . I did n't get a chance to see Dick afore I left . Of course we all expected the thing d be all over in a few months any how , and then I thought Dick and me 'd be all right again . So I come up here to Jackson , and pretty soon enlisted in the Michigan Cavalry , and went south again . For about a year we was with Halleck over on the Mississippi , but after a while I got transferred to Burnside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Rebs , and went with him up to Knoxville , and you see when I got there I was on my old stampin ' ground . Lord , I never thought I 'd come back to the old town that kind o ' way . " Well , of course I was all the time thinkin ' about Dick , and when I got back to the ville I was going to go right to work to hunt her up . But you see old Longstreet got after us ,  --  got in below us , you know , and shut off our grub , and it took about as good as we 'd got in the shop to bold things level for a while . Pretty soon , we got a whack at the old devil down at Fort Sanders , and we just everlastingly cleaned bin-i out . That let up the siege , and we went back into Knoxville , and a part of us boys was detailed to guard the city . While the siege was goin ' on things had been runnin ' pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rough ; so , along about the middle o ' January , I was put in charge of a squad o ' men and teams to tidy up the city . " All this time I had n't heard a word from Dick or knowed a thing of her . You see , here it was more'n two years and a half since I 'd seen her . But bless your soul , stranger , do n't you think I was afraid she had gone back on me-not much * ! That ai nt her style . You see , when a woman does as Dick did that night out on the porch , she ai nt agoin ' to give up and take the first feller that comes along . Oh , I know there 's plenty o ' men  --  and women , too , for that matter-that says they will ; but such folks haint never known such a woman as Dick . " Well , one day I was out with my men clearin ' up , and I rode into a back yard-I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind o ' all scattered round . I got off my horse , and went to the back door and knocked . A woman come to see who was there , and I told her that if she did n't take care o ' them chips I should have to , and if she 'd got a rake , I 'd help her get em into shape ; and we talked away there a while . She was kind o ' sassy ; some o ' them Reb women was just old business in goin ' for the boys , and givin ' em fits gen'ally . So I stood there talkin ' with the old lady , and kind o ' devilin ' her a little , and the door swung open a little more , and I saw there was another won-ian in the room . I saw her dress right through the crack between the door and the frame . I did n't think much of it in particular , though I always did somehow feel a little kind o ' red in the face and sink-hearted like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get a fair enough sight at to tell what she looked like , especially if she was about Dick 's size . " While me and the old woman was talkin ' there , this other woman somehow edged out , little by little , till the first I knowed I looked up , and as sure as shootin ' , stranger , there stood Dick ! She was a little taller than when I saw her last , and looked pale and tired and anxious like , just as though she was a-watchin ' and a-watchin ' for something to come , and was all tuckered out waitin ' for it . " I tell you , it was about as much as I wanted to do to stand still , for about a minute . I knowed her as soon as I got my eye on her , but she did n't know me , for sure . You see I 'd changed since she saw me last . I 'd been drinkin ' right along , and was red in the face , and bad a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , in the old days ,  --  so it wa' n't no wonder she did n't know me . But I just stopped // short on my racket with the old woman , and looked Dick right square in the eye . I could n't stand it no longer , and I just says , Dick ! ' and then There it is again , stranger ! You see , when a fellow is talkin ' about such things as these , there ai nt no words good enough to tell all you mean . For , you see , that little old time out on the porch begun right over again , just as though it had never stopped , and three years seemed like no time at all . She 'd been in the city all through the siege , but somehow I 'd missed her till then . But after that , of course , we was happier than ever . " Her father had lost all his property , pretty near . His niggers had all run off ; and the old man was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doin ' the best he could to get along , and Dick was stayin ' with her aunt in the ville . Dick told me that , after I skipped off north , her father said she should never marry that Yankee scoundrel ; but that did n't make no difference . You see she 's quiet enough , Dick is , but she 's got a will of her own . " But I wa' n't in no hurry about gettin ' married . And so things run along for quite a while , till it got to be almost summer , - sometime about the middle o ' May ,  - -  when things took a turn we were n't a-lookin ' for . " You see , I 'd been drinkin ' right along all this time . I never used to drink days when I was goin ' up to see Dick , but all the rest o ' the time , I was pretty full . I used to gamble , too , for all that was out . " One day , it was the *9th o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poker all day long , and it seemed that day as though the more I drank , the better luck I had . Just about dark , I got orders to rig up a train o ' wagons , and go down the country , across the river , for forage , that night . So I got out , and was just about ready to start , when one o ' the boys come to me and says , George , do you calc'late to ever cage that canary o ' your'n up there on the hill ? If you do , you 'd better be about it ; for I heard to-day that the old man was in town , and that he allows to run her off to-night ! ' It beats every thing , stranger , how some *uch thing as that 11 brace a feller up when he 's full . I was as sober as I am now inside o ' two minutes . I turned round to the feller that told me , and says I , Charley , you take this train down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and I 'll be there sometime in the night , to come back with you . ' Well , I rode right off to the house wThere Dick was stayin ' , hitched my horse , and went in . As good luck would have it , the old man was n't about , and Dick come runnin ' to me as pale as a sheet , and tremblin ' like a leaf ; and told me that it was true , her father was gom ' to run her off . Says I , Dick , look here . Do you want to marry me , just as I am , and to-night ? ' And she just come up and put her arms around my neck , and hid her face on my shoulder , and says , George , I 'll marry you any time , and the sooner the better , for I ca n't be parted from you again . ' Says I , That 's all right , little girl ! Just you put on your sun-bonnet , so as the folks wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and go down to head-quarters , and I 'll go and get the chaplain . ' " Well , as soon as we got the thing fixed up , I took her down to the hotel ,  --  they 'd just got a little house started there ,  --  and I give the landlord a hundred dollars ; told him that was my wife , and that he must keep her till I come back , for I 'd got to go , and there might be some trouble ; but if there was he must see her through . Then I went with Dick to her room , took off her sunbonnet , kissed the tears out of her eyes , and then mounted my horse , and struck out . " The old man come down after I was gone , but he found out it was all over , and no use raisin ' a row , so he just made the best of it , and give Dick his blessin ' like a sensible old davy as he was . You see , such old fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just you clean em out , on the square , once or twice , and they 'll come down as handsome as you please . " Dick and I staid at the hotel for a couple o ' weeks or so , and ther we went to keepin ' house . You see , the chances was that we should have to stay where we was for a good while , anyhow , and Dick wanted to keep house , so I let her . I was pretty flush for a while after my run o ' luck on poker , and I made the most o ' what I got on that haul . We got a nice little brick , that I could rent cheap , and bought a lot o ' condemned Reb furniture , and set up in good style . The furniture was some of it Ar . We had a mahogany bedstead , big high head-board , you know , and tall posts for curtains , and a rosewood dresser , and fine chairs , and all that sort o ' thing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix up that house was a caution , I tell you . I got a nigger woman to do the // work , and the first thing we knowed , why here we was , all set up , as if for keep . " But you see I kep ' on drinkin ' pretty steady all the while . That night when Dick and I was married , and I went ridin ' off alone , down the river there , I got to thinkin ' over this drinkin ' business , and about concluded I 'd quit ; but when I got back , of course the boys made me set em up for the weddin ' , and that got me started again , and when a feller gets started once , stranger , you see it 's pretty hard to stop . But I took it kind o ' easy , and was careful never to get chuck full , and I got along so well , that way , that I just about begun to think I could do that thing , right along , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you , stranger , if a feller thinks he 's agoin ' to play that game , and win , he 's fooled , sooner or later , you bet ; it 'll beat the oldest man that ever lived . " But everything went on smooth as a dollar for about three months , and Dick grew better and better , every day , and we was as happy as the day was long ,  --  all only my drinkin ' . " But one day , along in August , it was all-killin ' hot , and I got to goin ' , and was full afore I knew it , and the boys took me home at night drunk as the devil ! Oh , my God , stranger ! it do n't seem as though it could be true , but it is : I was just beastly drunk-mad drunk . I yelled , and cursed , and tore round gen'ally . But Dick just got the boys off that had brought me home as quick as she could , and then she got my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bound it up with cold cloths , as tender as though I 'd been a baby . After a while she got me quiet , and I went to sleep , and slept like a log , till morning . " When I woke up , about four o'clock , I was lyin ' on the front side o ' the bed , with my face to the back . There was a lamp burnin ' , and soon as ever I opened my eyes , I saw Dick lyin ' there lookin ' right at me , and she says , George , do you want anything ? ' just as though I was the weakest and sickest man in the world , and she just dyin ' with pity for me . My head felt as though it was about as big as the moon , and my throat was as dry and hot as the road to hell . So I told her I 'd like a drink o ' water but that I 'd get up and get it . But afore I could stir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , and had it for me . It was the first time Dick had ever seen me drunk , or anything but just as kind and gentle as I knew how to be ; but she never said a cross word to me . She never cried and took on , the way some women does ; but was just as kind and lovin ' to me , as though I was the best man in the whole business . Oh , I tell you , Dick 's a woman , she is ! " But , stranger , you ca n't have much notion o ' how I felt , about that time . You see if a woman snarls round , and cries , and snuffles , and calls in the preacher to pray with you , and talks to the neighbors about such things , why , then , it kind o ' gives a feller some excuse for goin ' to the devil ; but to have her do as Dick did ,  --  never say one word o ' blame ,  --  why , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to go on , and it just cut me up worse'n anything ever I struck afore in my life . " Well , we got up and got some breakfast , and then we went into the little parlor we had , and I took Dick on my lap , and pulled her head down on my shoulder , and put both arms around her , and then I could n't stand it any longer ; and I just broke right out , Oh , Dick ! ' but that was as far as I got , for then we both broke down and cried . Lord , stranger !  --  to think o ' Dick doin ' that , and my makin ' her do it . " After a while I said , Dick , by the ever-livin ' God , this shall never happen again ! ' but she put her hand over my mouth , and says she , Hush , George . Do n't say such an awful thing . ' You see Dick 's religious , and she could n't bear to hear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she says , for if you ca n't keep such a vow , do n't make it , and break it , for that will only make a bad matter worse . And then says she , George , you know it will just about kill me to have you drink so , but I do n't care for that ; it 'll kill you , too . So , if you can quit , do , and I 'll do everything in the world for you . " And then she hid her face again , and cried . Oh , it seemed as I should go wild ! I sat there and held her , as she sobbed , and cursed myself to myself for a heartless devil . I could n't find curses bad enough for me ; but the more I cursed myself , the worse I seemed . And pretty soon Dick looked up , and she says , George , am I to blame for this ? Have I been a kind of poor , weak wife to you , instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been disappointed , and gone to drinking on account of it ? Oh , if I have- ' " I did n't hardly mean to tell you that last , stranger ; but you see I 'm at it , and I might as well tell it all . Did you ever hear // anything like it in all your life ?  --  to have her blame herself for my drinkin ' , when I 'd been at it for moren ten years , and wa' n't fit to be thought of in the same year with her ! But that 's just like Dick . Oh , she 's a woman , she is ! I ca n't tell you anything about it , stranger . But anyhow , I just promised Dick by all that was holy , that this should be the last time , and I 'd quit forever . And I meant to keep my promise , when I made it . I did , so help me God ! " Well , we sat there , and by and by Dick felt better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  did n't say one word against me , you know , and kind o ' kept talkin ' quietlike about other things , till we both got to feelin ' happy again , almost as though nothin ' had gone wrong . And then , just afore I had to go , Dick says , George , I want to say a little prayer . ' And so we kneeled down together , and she put both her hands in mine and hid her face on my neck , and she prayed . She says , Oh , Father in heaven , help George to be what he really is , the best man in the world ; and help me to be to him the best wife that ever lived . Amen . ' Stranger , there ai nt many words in that prayer ; but if the best preacher that ever went to glory had a ' prayed a month , he could n't a ' said anything better'n that . " And then we stood up , and Dick kissed me , and I went out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem strange to you , and almost out o ' reason , stranger ; but as sure as you live , after all that , prayin ' and all , I stopped and got a drink afore I got down town / It 's a fact ! Not fifteen minutes after Dick had said that little prayer , and I 'd swore I 'd never touch another drop , I 'd swalloxved a glass o ' whisky straight . That seems awful , do n't it ? Well , it was ; but it did n't seem so to me then . I did n't mean to be such a confounded liar and sneak as I really was . You see , I made myself think it was the best thing to do . As Joe Jefferson says in Rip , ' I thought I would n't count that time . ( I tell you he can play that enough to raise a feller 's hair , that knows what 's what . ) You see , I was all unstrung in my nerves from my spree the day afore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did unstrung me all the worse ; and I thought I 'd take just one glass for medicine-just to brace up , you know , and steady my nerves . That 's the way I reasoned to myself . But it was all a fraud-just a hellish fraud , and nothing else . What I really wanted was straight whisky , and that 's the way with all these fellers that quit only just for medicine , and take bitters , and blackberry cordial , and tincture o ' rhuburb , and all that kind o ' truck . Oh , I knov how they do , for I 've been there , and lied it out with the best of em. ** The train stopped at a station and my companion stepped out upon the platform to banter the boys who were braking a down freight . Returning , he went on : " I tell you , stranger , man 's a curious animal . He 'll not only lie to others about whisky , but he 'll lie to himself . He 'll lie just as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinkin ' . That 's a pretty rough thing to say , but it 's so , and there 's millions o ' mend tell you so , if they 'd be honest , but they wont be , that 's what 's the matter with em . You see , what a man wants is somebody that he can go to , and just know that they know him from head to foot ,  --  know how infernally weak , and sneakin ' , and lyin ' , and mean he is , on this whisky business , and then give himself up and tell em the whole thing , just as it is , keep nothin ' back , and then have em keep track of him . I do n't mean in any sneakin ' kind of a way , as though they kind o ' felt above him , and looked down on him , as though he was a poor devil that they had to be bored by lookin ' after ; not that , but look after him as a mother would after her baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go alone , and had to be helped . I tell you that 's what a feller wants when he gets to goin ' on whisky ! But , Lord , just signin ' a pledge do n't amount to much , to a real old soaker , if he haint got some friend to back him up . Now , you see how it was with me . I promised , just as sacredly as I could , never to drink again , and I meant to do as I said , and yet I 've told you just what I did . You see , Igot off a/one and got beat by a good excuse . Well , I took one drink and it steadied me down , and made me feel so good , that pretty soon I took another . You see , I thought then I 'd kinder taper off , and it would be easier . That 's another good excuse , you see . And that night I went home and spoke up as cheerful to Dick as though it was all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as though she thought I had . And t/uit 's where we both missed it / You see , Dick knew I 'd been drinkin ' , but she loved me so she could n't bear to let me know she did , and I thought I 'd drunk once , and she did n't find me out , and so I // could again . But the thing run along , and every day I 'd drink more or less , and just acussin ' myself for it every time , too , but still keepin ' at it , till one day about a month after my first spree I got to goin ' again , and it was the same old story right over , only worse . Stranger , there ai nt nobody but what 's been through something o ' the kind that knows anything about it . " Well , I was brought home again drunker'n ever . But Dick was just the same . She never said , I told you so , ' or anything like that , but got right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only gentler and better , if such a thing could be . " It 's no use tellin ' you about gettin ' over that time . It was just about as it was afore , only I was more discouraged , and Dick better and braver'n ever . " I wanted to promise her again , that this should be the last time , but she said no , as she did afore . But I promised , anyhow , and Dick prayed God to help me to keep my promise , and I meant to , then , more n ever before ; but inside of a week , I was at it again , on the sly . I did n't let even the boys know o ' my drinkin ' . And I tell you , stranger , when it comes to that , a fellow 's got about as low down as he can get . " So I kep ' on till about the first o ' November , lyin ' to get my liquor , lyin ' about drinkin ' it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day I got on a slide again , and I do n't believe I ever did get so full afore . I was fightin ' drunk , and that night the boys carried me home on a shutter . Oh , I was used up bad . But Dick begun on me just as before , without a word. - I do n't hardly know whether to tell you all o ' this or not , stranger. - Yes , I will you wont know all o ' what a woman Dick is , if I do n't . " Well , after the boys went away , and Dick was workin ' over me , I got wild . I raved , and tore round the house , broke the furniture , drove the nigger woman out o ' the house , and worse'n all , I-I struck Dick ! Yes , I did , stranger ,  --  struck her right over the head , with the round of a chair , and cut a gash two inches long , just over her left eye . She carries the mark o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked her down for a minute , but she got up and never minded herself ; but just tended to me , and the blood a-runnin ' all down her face-Dick 's face , you understand . Well , when I see the blood on her face it kind o ' scared me , and after a while Dick got me quiet and off to sleep , and then she went out and got the surgeon , and had her forehead sewed up , and then come back home and sat up with me all night . Oh , you do n't begin to know yet what kind of a woman Dick is ! That 's what she did , stranger . There ai nt one woman in a million that would a ' done it , but she did , and would a ' done it again , if she 'd had to , God bless her . " When I woke up in the morning , Dick was movin ' round the room tryin ' to get a little breakfast . You see the nigger did n't come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame her . I rolled over and got out o ' bed , pulled on my clothes , and chucked my feet into an old pair o ' slippers , and shuffled toward the door . Dick says , Where are you goin ' , George ? ' I 'm goin ' out to get a drink , ' says I , as harsh as I could speak . ( I never spoke to her like that when I was sober , afore or since . ) I 'm gone to the devil any how , and I might as well make a clean job of it while I 'm at it . I 've been drinkin ' right along ever since I promised you to quit , and I ca n't stop , so I might as well go fast , while I 'm goin ' , ' and I started out . Then Dick says , George , you need n't to go , I 've got some whisky here . ' And she went to the closet and took out a quart flask , full , and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stranger ! She 'd gone out in tlze zzz*At azid got t/uzt bottle filled for me to drink / " Well , I drank about half the bottle without ever takin ' it from my lip and between then and eight o'clock I drank the balance . That steadied me a little , and I eat a little breakfast , and then I went and sat down on the bed by Dick . I did n't say a word . What could I say ? I just set down and took hold of her hand . Oh , my God , stranger ! It makes me almost faint now to think o ' that mornin ' . " Dick was pale , her head was bandaged up , and she 'd been sittin ' up with me all night . But she let me take her hand , and hold it , too . And she never said one word against me for drinkin ' , or breakin ' up the furniture , or strikin ' her , or anything . And we set there , that way , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just lookin ' down on the floor and thinkin ' . And then Dick says , quiet like , George , you ca n't last long at this rate . I 've knowed all the time since you come home that first night , that in spite of all your promises , you was drinkin ' all the time , and I did wrong not // to let you know I knowed it , but I did n't think it would ever be so bad as this . But George , even if you have got so in the habit of drinkin ' that you ca n't stop , ca n't you do this ? - get your liquor and bring it home and drink it here , and not try to deceive me , or have those awful men bring you home so off from the street . ' " I tell you , stranger , that let daylight through me . I saw then that Dick knew me through and through ,  --  that she knew what a lyin ' devil I 'd been , and had knowed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around my neck , and said , George , you know I 'd die in a minute to save you . I promised , when I married you , that I 'd stand by you , and be a true wife to you , as long as I lived , and I 'll do it ; for in your heart of hearts you 're the bestman in the world , and I ca n't bear to have you away from me when you 're wild with liquor . Oh , George , George ! you must not get away from me . I know it all . You are a noble man , but the fiends have got hold of you , and made you what you never shall be ; for you and I together will beat them , with God 's help and blessing . You must tell me everything after this , and I 'll do the same to you . If you must drink , drink here at home with me , and never try to deceive me ; but love me , and trust me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for God will bless our honesty and love . ' That 's what she said , stranger . You need n't promise me that you wont drink , ' she says , only , if you do drink , come and tell me all about it , and just how you broke down , and we 'll try again to make that weak place strong . If you can help it , do n't ever drink without askin ' my advice about it . Do n't make excuses why you should drink , without tellin ' me about them , and together we can do what we can never do apart . ' Well , stranger , that got me ! You see , there wa' n't nobody , nor nothin ' , in heaven or on earth , that could a ' done for me what Dick did . And she just said another one o ' them little prayers o ' hers , and then I kissed her and prayed the first real prayer I ever prayed in my life ,  --  just prayin ' God to bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . And afore God , stranger , from that day to this , I 've never put a drop o ' liquor between my lips , and I never will ! As soon as I see that Dick knowed it all , and made up my mind to go to her when I could n't go alone-then I was all right . " And so I quit , and all hell could n't make me begin again , and Dick knows it . She never says anything to me about it , never asks me about it , or suspects me ; but we just understand each other in a quiet way , and that 's enough . I 've learned to distrust myself and to trust Dick . Oh , Dick 's a woman , she is ! " We 've had a lot o ' trouble since then , hut we 've been mighty happy , and Dick 's always tryin ' to comfort me and help me , and keeps up wonderful herself . " Lately she 's been beggin ' me to leave the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've been thinkin ' for a good while I 'd quit , and now I 've made up my mind to , any how . The last trip but one that I made , one of the boys that was brakin ' on the freight just ahead o ' ours , fell off between the cars somehow , and was all cut up . Well , Dick found out about it , and it nearly set her wild , for she said I 'd be brought home that way sometime , and then she 'd be left all alone . And she begged me so hard that I told her I 'd quit . " So after I got into Chicago this mornin ' , I took the passenger back to Michigan City , to meet the pay-car there , and get my discharge . I can get something to do , I know , and Dick says if I ca n't she 's got a sewin ' - machine and two wash-tubs , and she 'll take in sewin ' and washin ' rather'n have me on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' that , just yet ,  --  not while I 'm alive . " It 'll he two o'clock to-night when I get home , but Dick knows I 'm comm ' . i telegraphed her this evenin ' , and she 'll be up , and have the coziest little fire and the nicest cup o ' coffee , and a little supper made up , that ever was in all the world . And she 'll hear me come a-crumpin ' along on the sidewalk , and she 'll open the door and the light 'll shine out oh , say , stranger , you could n't stop over one train and come up and see Dick , could you ? Oh well , that 's so , business is business , ' and if you ca n't , why it 's all right ; only I 'd like to have you know Dick , that 's all . For she 's the best woman the Lord ever made , and , in spite of all our troubles , she 's one o ' the happiest women that lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's any happier or prouder'n I be . I do n't , stranger , for a fact . " Well , here we are , all safe as a dollar . I thought Jack u 'd take her through all right . Taint every feller that could a ' done it though , you want to know . Goodnight . I 've talked a good deal to you , // but then I 've had something good to talk about , that 's one thing sure . Good-night ! God bless you ! " Oh ! I say , stranger , Jack has pulled her down a little further'n common to-night . The brakes did n't hold , I guess , and if it was daylight , I could show you the house where we live , right from here . It 's up on the hill , right up to the head o ' this street . I 'll tell you , though ; the train 11 stand here ten minutes , while they change engines , and , if you was to keep watch , may be you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Good-night . Good-night , stranger ! He stepped briskly out along the walk , swinging his lantern as he went . I stood and watched the swaying spark far up the street , following it , as on another morning , and in another land , a band of hopeful hearts followed the light that led them to the place where Love Divine had made its home . It grew fainter and fainter in the distance , but ever swung to and fro , till , like the star of old , it came to the place where Love was , and there , like that , it stood . Suddenly a broad gleam of golden light flashed out into the darkness . It glimmered for a moment and was gone . The door had closed upon George and Dick , shutting them into the sacred radiance of their home , and into my heart forever .
