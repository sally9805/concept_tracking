ARTICLE VI. - WHAT CONSTITUTES SUCCESSFUL TEACHING IN COLLEGES ? To INSTRUCT under all conditions involves substantially the same imparting powers in the teacher and receptive capacities in the scholar . But the age and progress of young men at the period of their pupilage in the college separates them from the rigid discipline of the schoolmaster , and the entire freedom allowed in professional study . Moreover , students are at this time in their transition stage , and the education they receive , more than any other , shapes their destiny . For these reasons the instruction and government suited to this period have a distinct individuality , which it is now proposed to consider . Undoubtedly the most efficient method of influencing others is by enlisting their sympathy . So long as access to their real nature is denied , it is scarcely possible to direct them for good or evil ; for there must be communication between man and man before they can unite in any common work . Unless this be effected , their energies will be directed to different ends , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre&amp;minentlv between teacher and pupil ; since the idea of education is that on* person shall be able to direct not merely the action , but the thoughts of another . It is plain that this can not be done unless each comprehends the motives of the other , and there be that confidence in the superior wisdom of the instructor which will justify his acceptation as a safe guide . While the feeling of confidence should he mutual , the guiding mind exercises it consciously , and must put himself en rapport with the nature to be taught ; but the latter unconsciously opens to receive the influence . No man is fit by nature to be a professor unless he loves young people , and takes pleasure in the constant ( lisplay of that brightest flower the earth has ever seen , the bloom of youth . Hence lie must never grow old in heart , or forget his own bright days when the sun shone gloriously upon the world , and made it seem full of beauty . And with this memory must be preserved the consciousness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as spirited , thoughtless , and overflowing with mischief , as the animated groLip which sits before him . Nor is this enough . He must earnestly desire them to be happy , and make it a daily study to render their youth as bright and joyous as this life of toil will allow . Life 's high noon will come soon enough , and with it so much of care that youth should be made happy , since it can come but once . The teacher 's object must always be , not to repress nor freeze to death these buoyant spirits , but to direct them into the proper channels . For it will not do to destroy any real power ; it is too precious and should all be utilized . If he can show a lively sympathy in the welfare of his pupils ; that his object , even when it becomes necessary to repress the exuberance of spirits , is not to abridge any innocent pleasure , but to seek their highest good ; and can supplement this by culture to insure confidence in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For by this beginning his pupils are led to consider him , first of all , in the light of a friend , whose constant aim is their welfare ; and when this understanding is secured between them , the way is open to enlighten the under . standing and mould the moral character . Without love for pupils and intense enjoyment in student life , an appetite as keen in the looking on as in personal expe. rience , there can be but little effected by an instructor , how . ever intellectual and accomplished . He may rule by force of will , and his severity be tolerated because of respect for his talents and acquisitions ; but unless he communicates with the heart , he can never fully enlist the intellect in his service . There is no time in the history of young men when they so much need sympathy as when they enter college . This is usually their first distant or protracted removal from the home of their childhood . Hitherto the youth has been considered merely a boy in the household ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he is alone in a strange place ; with no new ties formed and all the old ones broken and bleeding . At such a time words of sympathy make a lasting impression , and inspire the soul with new courage . There are more young men broken in spirit , and thereby precluded from obtaining the culture of college , during the first month of their separa // tion from home , than the four years which remain . It may be said sneeringly , that it is only weaklings who need such coddling ; and that home-sickness is a disease which is nnmanly . With such a view we have no patience . Every young person having a good home should feel deeply the separation from it ; and if he does not there is something lacking in his nature . He may be stern and too proud to give way to what he terms weakness . But sternness and pride are not all the qualities necessary to form a perfect character . Sensibility and gentleness can effect much more happiness , both for him who exercises them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harshness . Besides , the possession of these gentler qualities is not inconsistent with the greatest firmness of purpose and steadfastness of character . On the contrary , they are always found in the highest types of human nature . " The perfect gentleman is he who unites the tenderness of a woman with the courage of a man . " While we can be children hut once in age ; while we can never , when once dissevered from the home circle , re*nter and incorporate fully with it ; still the more of childhood 's frankness we retain through after life , and the more of that precious savor of home we bear with us everywhere , the more " sweetness and light " will we diffuse in our pathway . Hence , if at the time when students meet as strangers , there can be a gentle word said , or a sympathetic glance bestowed by the instructor , many a sad heart will be relieved by the assurance that all true friends have not been left behind . If some are independent enough not to need this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner than coldness or harshnesss . For all classes of men are more easily led than driven . It seems a truism to say that no man can govern others who can not control himself . Yet the lack of this ability is the origin of more failures in professional instruction than all other deficiencies combined . To teach requires a calm , collected mind , undisturbed by passion , not disconcerted by opposition , not disquieted by confusion . To perform the purely intellectual part of his duty , he must be self-contained , so as to rise superior to all efforts made to throw him off his balance . But his work is , also , to cultivate the heart ; and // hence he must not be offended in anywise by the treatment received from his charge . If they needed neither government nor instruction his occupation would be gone ; and to the degree that the pupil is captious or uncivil , to the same degree should his guide be able to oppose an example of quiet , gentle , dignity . The faithful disebarge of duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak rather than the lips , are a powerful means of culture . If there be any place where , more than all others , the reliance upon " Words , words , words , " is fatal , it is in the professor 's chair . Yet this is the universal resort with all men when they lose their self-possession ; and the teacher is often tempted to try their efficacy . For , in every company of young men there are some who are u0ly tempered and uncivil by nature-though these are the exceptions . Others are puffed up with conceit , and do not readily brook control . No matter how rigid the spirit of discipline be in any institution , there are a thousand ways in which the professor s rights , and the proprieties of the place , may be encroached upon with the purpose to annoy . Two methods of dealing are possible , provided self-control be complete . One is by force of character shown in severity , and thereby to crush out all opposition by summary punishment . In this case fear is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than not to rule at all . For if anarchy in the State is worse than any uniform species of government , however tyrannical , much more is this so when the object of rule is to give opportunity for instruction , since this is wholly dependent on systematic good order . Some natures can govern by no other method than force ; but for those who are not shut up to this there is a more excellent way . The greatest firmness is entirely consistent with the most affectionate kindness . And when we consider that the task is not merely to enlighten the intellect , but to make the heart better ; and through this combined culture to form the character for life 's work , it is of far more consequence that the instructor be loved than feared . Undoubtedly a combination of the two is desirable , in consequence of the diverse natures of the pupils which call for the exercise of both qualities . It is seldom , however , that a man effects any good result by the exhibition of anger . If there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other way , then , perhaps , it is allowable ; but even in such eases the passion displayed in perfect self-control under strong provocation , is most efficient . Besides , brute natures on exhibition have no place inside of college walls where all should be refinement and culture ; and surely should not be manufactured there by the example of the instructor . It is self-evident that no man can secure the respect of others who does not have it for himself . ilence when he so far forgets the requirements of his position as to lose his self-control and act like a madman , certainly , after reason has regained her seat , he must be heartily ashamed and mortified . Such conduct calls for apologies ; but these from teacher to pupil are fatal to the discipline of college . By this calmness , which is inseparable from self-control , the confidence of those who have force of character is secured ; and such elements add greatly to the strength or regimen in any body of thinking men . One person who remains unmoved amid all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For every other temper is fickle , and what is constantly changing can itself effect no permanent result . The disposition which is unmoved , however , is ready as a rallying point , and all others will in time gravitate to it . The mastery of a subject is necessarily limited by the conditions of human knowledge , and also , practically , by the location where the instruction is given . But the lowest degree of mastery that is admissible , must be at least an amount of knowledge quite beyond the attainments which the most inquiring pupil may be expected to make while necessary , and is expressed best by the word growth . For though the instructor have the elements of his subject by rote , though he possess a verbal accuracy and critical mastery of its outlines , embracing all that he can impart within the time allotted for pupilage , this will not suffice . Instruction derived from no more intellectual capital than this will quickly grow lean . The teacher will become monotonous , and the pupil grow wearied through the necessary repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are repeated in one continual round will // lose their faculty of arresting and fastening the attention , and hence cease to instruct . Doubtless the chief reason is the condition of that mind which is content to stand still while all around it is in motion . For it insensibly imparts its own dullness through the medium of truths which are in themselves momentous , even though they are not repeated except to successive classes of hearers . There must be sympathy , not merely between the hearts of teacher and pupil , but also between their intellectual processes . The youthful mind is a vigorous plant . It is prickly all over with interrogation points , expressed or implied . It is eminently progressive and expansive . It advances with the spirit of the age ; and by this progress alone will leave behind it that teacher who is content with his acquirements , though they be accurate and extensive , if they be not growing . Hence every successful teacher must never cease to be a close student himself . As he must not lose that freshness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of youth , so he must not be out of harmony with the growth about him . He must , in fact , stir np the fresh soil with the share of his own intellect ; he must sow the seed of his own ripe experience ; he must irrigate by the sweat of his own brow ; he must pluck up the rank weeds of idleness in his new field by careful culture of his own fallow . The teacher must be a student , not sin*ply for the purpose of obtaining the information to impart , but for the influence on his own habits of thought . It is not enough to show the way clearly by accurate description ; he must have the exhilaration of new prospects , which can be obtained successfully only when fresh fields of inquiry are surveyed . If knowledge be power , then his progress in original reseai-ch will measure his ability for effective work . First principles must be the foundation of all investigation ; but these continually receive new illustration by application to fresh truths , because they rehabilitate familiar ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation in any subject causes the most trite principles to start up like old friends , whose faces are none the less dear because they have prospered since we last met them . Knowledge , while it grows , never becomes old or dull ; because by its accretions it remoulds itself into new forms . Thus it effects // the same pleasure in each successive effort to instruct , as it did at its first acquisition . In this way the mind of the teacher shares with the pupil in the sympathy of a common intellectual effort . To insure this result , however , the studies of the teacher must be of two sorts . One has been indicated above in the constant progress made by further investigation in his specialty . The other is by a fresh revision of the particular lesson taught . However elementary the subject of instruction , or familiar its first principles be , they should be revised ; not in a general way , but in precisely the mode they are to be taught . If a text book be employed , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often as a new class of pupils is to be instructed . This might seem to he useless in the case of one who had repeatedly taught the same subject , and according to the same text book . Yet it is necessary in conveying information that the ideas be clear and definite , and that the language employed be precise . This combined result can be obtained only by a careful selection of the words best adapted to convey the meaning . Of course the mere learning a lesson by rote is not advocated , save where the task is the mastery of forms ; but the consecution of ideas must he maintained , and they clothed in phraseology on a level with the scholar 's progress . If the latter depends upon a text book this must be the basis of the teacher 's preparation , because he must be able to go through substantially the same process himself , as that through which knowledge is conveyed . Besides , he must be familiar with the language of the text book by a fresh perusal , in or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s mind , and require an explanation , not according to the general principles of science , but on the basis of that amount of knowledge which can be obtained from the authors studied . Though acquisitions exclusively in the line of the subject taught may insure highly respectable teaching , yet it will be narrow in its influence upon character . The mind does not expand in one direction alone , neither is its food hut of one sort . Man is , physiologically , an omniverous animal ; and will not attain his best type if fed on one viand , however excellent . He requires variety , though there be one staple ingredient present in all his dishes . Still more is this so with the mind . Its // range is limited only by the objects of the external world , and the powers of the mind within . All subjects of knowledge , as Cicero* so well said , are connected together by an indissoluble tie , and are to a degree mutually dependent . Hence there is absolutely no limit to the amount of illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which an idea fastens itself upon the mind , the firmer will it remain , and the more surely will it grow with rapidity . While the obvious illustrations , homogeneous with the subject , are necessary to its comprehension , they do not enlarge the range of vision , nor liberalize the mind so much , as those that are drawn from more remote sciences . One great danger of the young is that they will be puffed up by their conceit of wisdom ; and hence a most important point to be gained is the enforced revelation of their own ignorance . This can not be done so effectually by a narrow line of illustration as by one of extreme range . For thus will the mind of the learner discover how illimitable is the domain of knowledge , and how confined our narrow grasp . But when the firm foundation of acknowledged ignorance is laid , it is safe to awaken the enthusiasm of the ingenious by showing , that while we can know but in part and understand but in part , we can know nothing accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge with which our acquisitions are inseparably connected , and form an indispensable element . Hence is verified the Greek proverb : He who does not know everything knows nothing.t Thus every idea mastered is treasured up the more securely because it is connected , by most interesting relations , with all that is knowable . The remoter bearings of a subject in this way have a tendency to liberalize the mind ; they awaken new pleasure at every step ; they make men of one profession or line of culture respect those engaged in another pursuit , by the consciousness that they are all mastering co*3rdinate parts of one infinite system of truth . There is an opposite danger to be carefully avoided , which consists in frittering away the energies through a desultory * Pro . Archius , 1 fin. // rambling over too wide a field . This is more to be dreaded in the ease of the pupil , before habits of consecutive thought and patient application are formed , than by the teacher , in his studies . The scholar must usually confine his labors within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he goes beyond them it must be for the purpose of relief , as journeys of recreation , or vacations 1*or bodily health . But the master should not be so confined , because he is bound , not simply to convey the particular information by which the learner can make progress , but he must expound and liberalize his modes of thought as a necessary part of education . For no idea can be taught perfectly , but in its relations . Even in the most abstract sciences , as Pure Mathematics or Formal Logic , the terms can produce no significant results unless they connote definite objects . Hence an exclusive study of these sciences , apart from any practical application , instead of enlarging the understanding and developing its faculties , dwarfs them ; and renders their devotee averse to attempt , as well as unable , to grapple with any questions of real life , involving , as all such subjects do , complicated relations . Accordingly , it is clear that the wider the field be from which illustrations be drawn , the greater will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men of extraordinary talents in a particular direction , and who are specialists in their studies , are almost invariably unsuccessful as teachers . That man whose thoughts are concentrated upon himself exclusively is so disgusting that he is barely tolerated among his fellows ; and this only because other men are not equally selfish . Such a person is manifestly unfit as an example by which the character of the young is to be moulded . But more than this . Such a state of feeling incapacitates the mind for clear action , because it is preoccupied with one idea so thoroughly that all others exert but a passing influence . Accordingly , if the teacher would be in the proper condition for efficient work , he must lose sight of himself in the interest he professes in the subject of instruction . While this principle holds good in every kind of mental activity ; while the public speaker , the actor , or even the writer , must sink all thoughts of self and be absorbed in his subject if he would interest , this // is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The teacher is not here for his own sake ; he comes not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and consecrate his life to the good of his scholars . There is yet another reason . He is diligently watched by multitudes of sharp eyes , which become dangerously critical if they see any exposed place for the shafts of ridicule to enter . Tn this effort , they will not fail to be highly successful , if he places himself so much on a par with them as to regard any thing said or done as personal to himself . Each man has his own weaknesses and idiosyncracies ; and these always grow by being humored , and become more conspicuous in proportion to the sensitiveness which their possessor exhibits . Hence any feeling of offended dignity , and especially any complaint that there is lack of respect , is fatal to the successful work and personal comfort of the teacher . The obvious truth is , that if an instructor has plenty of dignity , it will take care of itself without his thought ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole attention to its preservation , and betake himself to some place where it is not likely to be wounded by rude shocks . An attempted insult from a pupil should not be noticed , however gross , unless it be of such a character as to interfere with the professor 's work ; and then is to be checked exclusively on that ground . For it is perfectly clear that no man can be insulted unless he choose to accept the affront . If he is in the line of duty , the pupil who is so abandoned as to wantonly attempt to hurt his feelings , is sure to be summarily condemned by the better spirit of the class . This is the strongest element of government in college ) and if the professor can fully enlist it , he may well disregard all unreasoning petulance from the baser elements . If an occasion for insult be really given , then , as the affront is deserved , it must needs be pocketed in silence ; for vain will be the attempt to take refuge behind the dignity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted by men in any position , that if they are on the lookout for afli-ont and disrespect their search will be rewarded with abundant success . Much more is this the case where the same * meet from day to day , and he who should occupy a commanding elevation acknowledged to be above insult , leaves his vantage ground , and by // placing himself on a level with his inferiors in age and position , offers himself as a mark for every missile which the fertility of youthful mischief can contrive . If any teacher thinks he can be a match for a lecture-room full of bright young men , after they have , through his overbearing demeanor or childish punctiliousness about respect , been made to feel that their first duty is to give him all the annoyance they can , he greatly overrates his own powers or undervalues theirs . He may check their mirth in his presence ; he may tread out their mischief for a time ; vet if he do this successfully , it will be not by resenting this as a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fight will be long and bittei , if ever successful , when waged against any personal annoyance as such . Both teacher and pupil will be emphatically in hot water ; and meanwhile there will be no good work done in educating the intellect : while the hearts of all involved will grow in bitterness , rather than in that love which always accompanies true culture . But he who , with entire forgetfulness of self , lives in his subject and for his pupils , will be remembered by them . They will take care of his reputation , if it need any care . While he will not any sooner expect to be insulted by them than a parent does by his child , they will repay his faithfulness by a world of love ; and their respect will crown his venerated bead with the sweetest laurels that cultured men can wear . With devoted affection do we look back to those true and faithful men at whose feet we sat and learned . Some have finished their course , full of peace and honor ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bands which neither the passing of years nor the buffetings of life can pluck asunder . Since it is the nature of young people to relish sport , mischief must be assumed as an element of character to be considered by every one who is brought in contact with them . Greek culture produced the most perfect development of mind and body ever gained apart from the higher spiritual relations ; and doubtless was preparatory in furnishing the noblest type of human nature for the Gospel to consecrate to God . In this most perfect tongue of earth , the name of a young person is *rai* the player , from 7raL$co to play or sport . Playfulness is // the bent of every healthy , proper child ; and if there be no disposition for fun and frolic , this is nndonbted evidence that something is wrong mentally or physically . Hence , if any person thinks that this instinct should be eradicated , or that its exubei-ant flow can be ( Iried up , he has no conception of that nature which is to be educated ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehension . For if he could have his will in crushing ont all fun and mischief* there would be left only an emasculated and prematurely aged mannikin : not a vigorous , sympathetic youth , alive to all noble thoughts , and ready for any worthy task . This thing-no longer a person - will be able , perhaps , to go over by rote , and with mechanical precision turn ont the tale of bricks assigned . The hand organ grinds out its unvarying number of tunes , but has no harmony nor originality . The question then is , how to direct this exuberance of life without destroying its fountaiii or checking its innocent flow ? It is a fact verified by all experience , that the teacher who is on the look out for mischief will find it . The pupil is quite too liberal to permit him to return empty handed from his " still hunt . " It is cqnally true that espionage devel. opes latent powers for evil , which otherwise wonld slumber . Such is human nature , that a prohibition stirs up desire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tantalus , and canses redoubled efforts to grasp it . It follows , therefore , that clear judgment should be exercised in determining how much be forbidden in advance , and how much noticed after the offence has been committed . Sharp , discriminating sight and hearing are invaluable , not so much to see all that is done as to enable the teacher to weigh exactly the guilt in a case deserving reprehension , and to fasten it with . out mistake on the proper offender . These two duties are among the most difficult that fall to his lot , and measure his skill by an unerring standard . The i-cal object of government is to secure obedience for its own sake , without reference to law . For duty is easy if it be performed voluntarily , and the fetter of restraint is galling only when it confines a restive member . Hence the multiplication of regulations in the class room is to be avoided ; and threats of punishment for anticipated offences should be resorted to with extreme caution . Espe. // cially should threats be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for threats , but the enforcement of law . When any act is to be denounced with no farther punishment , a time should be selected when no offence is under consideration ; so that both parties may weigh it apart from personal feeling as far as this may be possible . Threats are ruinous to dicipline if not executed ; and hence , the fewer made , the less danger the teacher has of seeing them a dead letter , and feeling himself contemiz*tible in his own eyes , as well as of those whom he has vainly trie ( i to frighten . Offences must needs come under all discipline . But the majority that arise among students are of that sort in which more harm is done through the uneasiness and excitement occasioned by their punishment , than by over-looking them entirely . It is not meant that they should be unnoticed , for the teacher should see everything ; but that they are generally too trivial for him to be justified in quitting his more important work to give them any attention . It may be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens the flood-gates of disorder . But in practice no such result follows . That the summary execution of Draconian laws increases the number of offences , is a matter of history , and must be admitted by every thoughtful publicist . When capital punishment was freely inflicted in England for highway robbery and burglary , these crimes were far more frequent and daring than after the penalty was mitigated . The constant execution of criminals cheapens the estimate of life , and familiarizes reckless men with deeds of violence . And the general tendency of all punishments is by frequent repetition to rob them of their power to intimidate . The great object of law is to rule so that offences be few ; and **hen the execution of justice becomes necessary it will be preventive of crime by striking wholesome terror . But , as all discipline contemplates punishment for disobedience , cases will arise when the offence must not be passed over . Here the punishment must be prompt , firm , impartial ; and not to be rescinded . It should be inflicted with as little publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those not involved . College censures or penalties should be so clearly just that they commend themselves ; and then the character of the professor will be a gaurantee of their propriety // when the reasons are not known to the other students . And the mysterious leaving of a bad student is the most efficient cheek ever brought to bear upon the disorderly ones who still remain . Every offence that deserves a penalty should be tried at once , because the censure , when viewed in connection with the misdeed , commends itself more to the guilty parties , as well as the looker on , than after delay . For while the offence will grow less distinct , and excite less disapprobation as time passes , the punishment , however late , will be new when it comes ; and hence seem aggravated . The assertion that decisions to punish should not be rescinded , implies that such determination be arrived at with great caution , and not at all without positive evidence . But when once announced they must be carried out without fear or favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment , arises from the absolute certainty of its infliction . While the instructor must possess ample knowledge of his subject in order to be fitted to teach , he should never claim infallibility . The more completely he is cultured , the less will he be disposed to arrogate this in word or action . He should , therefore , never be offended if his opinions are questioned , provided this be done in the temper of genuine truth seeking . The spirit of free inquiry should be encouraged ; and while respect for his authority must be maintained , yet this will provide for itself if he possess such attainments as deserve respect . Besides , however dogmatic he be , this will not secure respect for his authority on a disputed point unless his opinion rests upon a true basis . He that knows but little can ill bear to have his opinion questioned ; he that is thoroughly master of himself and his work , can well afford to acknowledge a mistake . For no one on earth is infallible , save His Holiness ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many points in the best established sciences are still open questions ; and it is perfectly natural that among many curious and vigorous young inquirers , some one might anticipate the teacher in the discovery of the truth ; and when such is the case , a true man will always raise himself in the estimation of all whose good opinions are worth having , by frank and distinct acknowledgment . The relations between teacher and pupil are // admirably expressed in the name by which those professors who formerly lectured in Latin addressed their scholars : " Commilitones , " Fellow-soldiers . The teacher leads the way , the pupils help him fight the battle ; and the spoils of victory are to be divided between them . If , on the other hand , every pupil is to be a Pythagorean , and accept each word becanse avTo* * He said , free inquiry will be stifled if not destroyed . The great object of education being to make men fit to direct themselves when pnpilage ceases , as cease it soon must ; to make them independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher drops it , and in their turn be pioneers to hold up the torch for their successors ; it is of the utmost consequence that every degree of freedom , consistent with the true modesty of knowledge , should be fostered . And hence , that teacher who has magnanimity enough to give full credit to his scholars , when by independent research they elucidate a point which was hitherto obscure to himself , takes the surest method to secure their entire confidence ; and at the same time educates minds which will prove by their work that his influence has effected the most coveted results of instruction .
