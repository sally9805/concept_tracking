PREFACE . It may be immaterial to the public to be acquainted with the causes which led an unknown author to compose a poetical work that perhaps will be neglected : yet , as every author hopes for a better fate , if the vanity that leads to publish the poem is pardoned , the preface may be received with equal indulgence . After reading mr . Scott 's Marmion with attention and pleasure , I could not help considering whether an equal effect could have been produced with two alterations  --  the first , bringing the supposed guilt of Wilton nearer to the time of his unjust punishment  --  the other , softening a little the dreadful doom of Constance , that the abbess of Whitby , a good character , though tinged with professional prejudices , might no longer concur in a direct murder . It was easy to find in english history a traitor with whom Wilton might be suspected to correspond , in the person of De-la Pole , of the house of Suffolk , descended from the sister of Edward IV . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry VIII .  --  This family , of which some account will be given in a note , must not be confounded with another of nearly the same name , the Poles , descended by their mother from the duke of Clarence , to whom Henry VIII . transferred his jealousy after the house of Suffolk was extinct . An idea for the second alteration was suggested by a passage in Carlton 's memoirs of the war in Spain , which will also be quoted in the notes . Whilst reflecting upon these supposed alterations , the plan of a dramatic poem suggested itself so strongly to my imagination , that I could not help trying what would be the poetical effect of my own thought when set down upon paper . And as the work proceeded , the necessary difference between a narrative and a dramatic poem required many other deviations from the fable of Walter Scott 's Marmion . I have , however , thought it allowable to retain many of the sentiments and expressions of the original poem . This resemblance is principally to be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fouth act , the parting scene between the abbess and Clara , the meeting of Clara and Wilton , and , above all , in the scene of Marmion 's death . Many persons may undoubtedly be disposed to censure a plagiarism of this description ; but as the foundation of the story is avowedly borrowed from another , I hope that I shall meet with indulgence for having sacrificed an appearance of originality to the advantage of employing sentiments and expressions which every lover of poetry must confess to be striking and appropriate . The great length of this drama would be a serious objection if it was intended for the stage , but it only ventures to solicit attention in the closet . Another objection has been made by some of the author 's friends , who were otherwise partial to the work ; the mixture of so many scenes , drawn , from real history , with a fable so entirely fictious as that of Marmion and Clara . The interest is divided ; the fabulous characters occupy the three first acts ; in the fouth an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to his tragical fate , painted in colors that nearly resemble those of real history .  --  This objection is strong , and would be insuperable , if this drama was presented to the public as , a regular tragedy either on the grecian or the french model .  --  But english authors may appeal to english customs , and shelter their irregular dramatic plans behind the arguments of many experienced english critics . The two last acts of this drama were written with a wish to fill up the masterly outline given us by Walter Scott of the interesting character of James IV . and to awaken better authors than myself to revive the practice of historical dramas too much abandoned since the age of Shakspeare . The disastrous reign of Mary queen of scots has long been considered as a theme for poets ; but the preceding ages of scottish history , from the accession of Bruce to the death of James V. present many striking events , well contrasted characters , and important moral lessons . Perhaps indeed the task is fittest for scotchmen as best acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hoped the period is now arrived when they might execute such a task unwarped by those prejudices of party which exaggerated either the vices or the virtues of their ancient kings . In the political sentiments which my actors deliver , I have endeavored to transport myself to the period when they really existed , the period of 1513 , and have followed , in many places , the narrations of Pinkerton and Hume . On this account I have represented Henry VIII . as the general object of his subjects ' reverence and affection ; for it was long before the english discovered that his natural heat of temper was degenerating into tyranny ; and had he died soon after the battle of Floddon , few english monarchs would have left behind them a more popular character .

Earl of Surrey ( embracing Howard ) Welcome , my son , right welcome ; these three days Have boisterous tempests fill 'd my soul with care : For perilous is bleak Northumbria 's coust , And scarce we dared to hope Newcastle 's walls Would shelter England 's noble admiral , Whose exploits I would praise , but that a father Should leave that task to more impartial tongues .

Earl of Surrey King James has pass 'd the Tweed , and Norham won Through treachery more than force , and Wark and Ford Have oped their gates . This news might waken fear . But better hopes arise , when I reflect That James in mid career has stopp 'd his course , Loitering the precious time in wanton ease ; Ease that I ween will double all his toils . Howard , t is fit I tell thee that his rage Storms loud against thee for his admiral 's death , And calls for due revenge . How . Howard Then let him take it On me alone . I stand prepared to prove , In knightly combat , Barton was a pirate . Would that no greater danger menaced England , Than this good sword could ward .

Resistless zeal To serve their country and their much-loved king Warms every bosom . With religion 's pomp I mean this day to consecrate our cause . Meanwhile in council with these worthy chiefs , With Stanley , Dacre , Tunstall , I began To plan the future war , when from their towers The joyful burghers your approach proclaim 'd . How . Howard Advance and meet the foe : t is thus your son Dares to advise . Baulk not the high-laised spirits Of my bold followers , who have bid the flag Of England wave triumphant o'er the main . Sur . Earl of Surrey Fain would I bid the trumpet sound to arms , But let us watch our time , End note : 1Kb nor rashly stake All that is dear on earth , our country 's weal .

Experienced chiefs Should learn that caution must be valor 's guide . Stan . Stanley Let not that guide betray the power it serves . Invaded nations who can tamely bear Despoiling havoc lose their martial fame . Soldiers who once distrust their leader 's valor Are half subdued ere yet the battle joins . Advance , my lords , let but the scots behold Our red cross banners , and their blood will freeze . Sur . Earl of Surrey Invaders may be foil 'd by slow delays . The soldier pent within his cheerless camp , Or wandering , rebber-like , in search of prey , Feels sordid interest chill his patriot zeal , And shrinks when danger presses . Now the scots Double our numbers ; but their credulous king . Caught in the wonted snare of treacherous love , In dalliance wastes those days when he should strike .

Stan . Stanley Shall England 's honest spirit stoop to art Against a generous , unsuspecting prince ? It were a stain to knighthood ! Sur . Earl of Surrey How ! is art A crime unworthy of a gallant knight ? Think , Stanley ! had your father 's virtue proved Of such unyielding temper , had he own 'd His secret love to Richmond , my brave sire Might have survived the dint of Bosworth field , And Gloster still have reign 'd our lawful king .

From the field of death This old man bore it to some unknown grave . Sur . Earl of Surrey Enough , my friends . The lost de Wilton 's house Was near allied to mine . Lord Marmion 's merits Command applause . T is not for me to judge . The hand of heaven decided in the lists . Tun .

Tun . Tunstall Ay , is it love indeed which moves that courtship , Love of her charms , or of her ample dower ? He is no whining fool of old romance , Who with chaste passion serves one matchless dame  --  His love is not exclusive . Many a fair one Has trusted him too far and rued too late Her blind credulity . Nay , some , t is said , Not meanly born , have lost all sense of shame , And in disguise attend his leisure hours .

T is thus with man . One single vice indulged Spreads through the heart , till virtue , quite o'er power 'd , Resigns her empire to encroaching guilt . How . Howard Speak you of Marmion thus ? Tun . Tunstall Not with conviction , But with involuntary doubt . How . Howard I would not Entrust him with a blooming daughter 's care . But in the field of battle place him next Your friend most dearly loved , and rest secure He 'll guard his post till victory or death . Sur .

Earl of Surrey Welcome , lord Marmion . Art thou come to share This hour of England 's petil from invasion ? Much were my army by thy presence graced . Marm . Lord Marmion I thought to come a messenger of peace ; And hoped by fair inducements to prevail On James 's soften 'd heart . But on my way I learnt that Scotland 's king has pass 'd the Tweed .

The scottish king Resides . t is said , at Ford . Sur . Earl of Surrey I fear the attempt To reach him may be dangerous . His wild troops From the bleak hills that front the northern main , Or from those streams more savage though more fair , Where rancorous war with England still is waged , Have pour 'd like locusts o'er our fertile fields , And desolation on their steps attends .

Earl of Surrey Even now the chiefs Of every holy order are assembled To grace that rite which all the north reveres , When Cuthbert 's abbot blesses our just cause , And trusts his far famed banner to my hand . Tun . Tunstall A fitter object still has struck my mind . Last night , a holy palmer sued for shelter Till he could visit Cuthbert 's blessed shrine .

I shall but relate , In plain unvarnish 'd words . a tale of guilt :  --  Some few years since , a maid of noble birth Received the hallow 'd veil within a convent Dependant on the priory of Tinemouth , And subject to our benedictine rule . This maid resign 'd her soul to sure perdition , And with some unknown lover took her flight . Now would you learn that woman 's guilty name ? Constance de Beverley !

A young squire conceal 'd His paramor beneath a minstrel 's garb .

( after a pause , Ranulph resumes his speech ) What means this silence ? dost thou scorn the justice That gives thee space by prayer and frank confession To lessen thy tremendous weight of guilt ? Does terror hold thee mute . It comes too late . Fear should have seized thee when the form of vice First rose upon thy fancy . Those fix 'd eyes Bent on the ground , those pallid cheeks , those lips That quiver with convulsion , must not waken Such pity as would strike our justice blind . ( another pause ) Still art thou silent ! art thou well aware That lawless love is not the only crime , Though that alone might sink thee to perdition , For which thou stand'st arraign 'd ? hast thou not sought Against a young and guiltless virgin 's life , To practice poison ?

Speak , Hubert , does thy tempter Now stand before thee ? Hubert . Hubert T is the very youth . Such was the badge that shone upon his breast , The falcon argent in an azure field . Such were his auburn locks , his features , eyes . ( kneeling ) Have mercy , I but purposed to deceive him . O spare a hapless wretch . Const .

It was enough , he broke his plighted faith , Forswore his vows , and Constance was despised . But what of this , the unfeeling herd may say , T is an old tale bequeath 'd from age to age Till our sick fancy palls . Ay ! but if fate Accorded with my courage and my will , Never did antient story spread the fame Of faithful maid betray 'd for worthless gold , Who loved , was wrong 'd , or was avenged like me .

Well have ye framed a fair and full excuse , Exempting you from dangerous virtue 's toils . Continue still to press the balance down Of feeble sin , and bid the scale of power Lightly ascend though charged with heaviest crimes ; Your fawning flatteries will not long avail To shield your wealth from envy and revenge . Your sphere is turning fast . An hour of darkness Ascends above your heads , it gathers round !

Clar . Clara ( alone ) Unhappy Clara ! through how many storms Of varying passions and incessant fears , Does fortune bear thee in her rapid flight . Scarce had I stood the shock of Marmion 's presence When the alarm of poison roused my soul To indignation ' gainst a causeless foe . That transient flame is quench 'd , and disappointment Spreads its chill influence o'er the buds of hope  --  O Marmion ! thou whom more than death I fear , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thrown by with arrogant and selfish haste . SCENE XI  --  to her enter EDITHA , a nun . Clar . Clara Is't thou , Editha ?  --  stay , and hear me speak Editha . Editha I must to my sad office , and convey The scanty food our captive shall receive Till death releases her from lingering pain  --  Yet will I stop to join the general voice In joy for your escape , and praise to heaven , Who saved you from the most atrocious wretch That e'er disgraced our sex . Clar . Clara No more , no more ! Sore am I wearied by the officious zeal Of crowding sisters , who but little know The cares that fill this bosom . Tell me true  --  Once more could any mortal converse hold With wretched Constance ? Editha . Editha Oh ! impossible ! T is a strange wish ! Clar . Clara High motives have inspired That wish which ignorance blames . You are appointed To bring her food . Can you perform that office . Yet hold no converse ? Editha . Editha From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , A basket is suspended . One coarse loaf , Of water one scant measure , are the whole Of its contents . On each revolving morn The engine is drawn up , and if three days The cates remain untouch 'd , a massy stone Is hurl 'd upon the grate , and never more Dares human step approach . Clar . Clara O mercy ! mercy ! I shudder but to hear . Editha . Editha Indeed t is fearful . Clar . Clara Could art devise no method to convey The slightest message ? Editha . Editha O ! too much I dread The penalties incurred . Clar . Clara Hast thou e'er seen This dreadful doom enforced ? Editha . Editha Too sure I have . Clar . Clara And could the wretched sufferers long survive ? Editha . Editha I think scarce half a year . Want , gradual want , Consumes them shortly . Clar . Clara Did no holy priest Assuage their pangs with hopes of heavenly grace , Or hear their last confession ? Editha . Editha None dare venture . Accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silence must they perish . Clar . Clara Then boldly I proclaim , this was a doom No christian e'er invented , but some fiend Studious to drive contrition from his prey . And set despair and suicide in view . As the last friends the sufferers can embrace . When justice wears the garb of cruelty , Her heavenly form is recognised no more ; And when the punishment excites such horror , Our erring thoughts absolve the worst of crimes . SCENE XII  --  to them , EUPHEMIA , abbess of st . Hilda , who has been listening during Clara 's last speech . Abbess . Abbess My child ! what words have thus escaped thy lips ? I came prepared to calm thy just resentment , And preach forgiveness to a fallen foe : But little thought to hear thy voice arraign The justice of the church . Clar . Clara O ! my best mother , I pray thee hear me ,  --  and in private hear . ( aside ) Abbess . Abbess Go , Editha ! your prioress expects you . the nun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts , Whatever doom stern iron-hearted law Commands and executes  --  there still are limits , That once o'erpass 'd  --  our common sympathy Awakes , resumes its sway o'er indignation , And bids us make the sinner 's cause its own . You too have felt its power ,  --  disown it not . I see the trace of nature 's kindly tears In those red swollen eyes , and mark the sobs Which rise unbidden from a laboring heart . Abbess . Abbess What if you guess aright , compassion 's tears Are wasted here . Thou know'st her frantic rage ; Her bold impiety surpass 'd belief . Clar . Clara Ay ! but I heard how Ranulph 's kindling anger Cut short her frank confession , and provoked Her stubborn pride . She with a vassal fled !  --  O mean , evasive art ! she fled with Marmion . I know you guess 'd the truth , when most obscured By mists his cunning raised  --  and when a ray At last burst forth  --  to have its light supprest By one proud partial judge : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught by Marmion , And whilst she suffers , why must he escape ? Abbess . Abbess Clara , thy words have moved me  --  yet , reflect . Is it indeed the touch of heavenly grace , Or inward pride , apt to pronounce rash censure On learned churchmen , that inspires thy speech ? The world would scarce believe that christian mildness Can lead thee to forgive thy murderess ,  --  Nay , with warm eloquence defend her cause . Clar . Clara Good mother ! I do not pretend to virtue Raised above nature 's frailty . If my life Had flow 'd in one smooth stream of tranquil bliss ; If Wilton had been mine , and mutual love Lull 'd every care in sweet forgetfulness ; Then had I heard , with sudden terror roused , Murder stood ready to cut short my joys , Then , swelling anger had pronounced such guilt Unnatural , fiend-like , passing every bound Of gentle pity . Wo and disappointment Have taught a different lore ; have bid me scan The force with which tyrannic passion sways Our frail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat brooding o'er my Wilton 's wrongs , The fiends of hatred and despair have aim 'd Their venom 'd shafts : death has arisen before me As a stern friend , not as the king of terrors . Trembling I think , had Marmion 's hollow virtues Won the first wishes of my yielding soul , My dectile heart might have imbibed the stain Of his pernicious dictates :  --  then had wrongs , Had miseries such as Constance feels , assailed me . Ah ! heaven alone can tell the dire result . All guilty as she is , she stands before me As Marmion 's victim , not as Clara 's foe . Abbess . Abbess I own that wicked woman has received Most piercing injuries . Her prioress Confesses , that with many a bitter tear , And strong reluctance she assumed the veil . Her brother 's avarice would not share the gold Their father left behind . Clar . Clara Ha ! heard you this ! Why ! if her vows were forced , they may be void . She may be free from stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snares Prepared for others : she must surely know Some guilty secret that would shake the fame False merit purchased . Whilst I speak , I feel The thought like inspiration swell my breast . Abbess . Abbess Indeed , I fear that Ranulph judged the cause With needless haste . Clar . Clara O ! use a strenger word ! Too hasty !  --  no !  --  he was too worldly-wise . Possessor of that standard which t is held Can turn the fate of battle , arm 'd with power That haughty Marmion trembles to offend . He will not risk such greatness in a contest . With Henry 's favorite : and whilst he sees Assembled armies kneel at his approach He heeds not Wilton 's wrongs , nor Clara 's tears . But , dear Euphemia , did you not inform me , When female votarists trespass ' gainst your laws , That their own sex should judge them . O ! methinks , Had I been there , I would have plainly urged My right to question criminals , and tried Mildly to draw the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you was too tame . Abbess . Abbess My daring girl ! there spoke thy father 's spirit ,  --  The spirit of our race !  --  thou wert most fit , Could'st thou relinquish all vain dreams of love , To fill that office which I now sustain . Thou would'st not yield even to our lofty king The smallest atom of st . Hilda 's rights . There is a native shrewdness in that bosom , Young as thou art , which I have oft observed Surpass the dictates of experienced age . Clar . Clara This shrewdness is the fatal child of wrongs . That fear and hatred which have fill 'd my breast , Since Marmion broke my bonds of plighted love , Taught me suspicion , bade me ruminate On passing , thoughts that innocence forgets , Watch my own feelings , and from them decide On others motives . T is a painful gift I fain would cast away .

Be patient  --  be content to hear me own Some touch of blameful weakness  --  Much I fear We can not now retract . Clar . Clara Are there indeed No means to speak with Constance ? Abbess . Abbess If there were , Our laws forbid it , and stern danger waits The rash attempt . Clar . Clara Danger ! I fear it not . E'er since that mystic scroll the latest trace , As I believe it still , of Wilton 's hand , In which he trusted to a feeble maid That last possession of the brave and good  --  Unblemish 'd honor ,  --  I have held myself Selected to that dear and sacred office  --  Guardian of Milton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear that calls me to the tomb Of desperate guilt , and tells me justice waits Mid'st those drear shades to lift her awful veil .

Cast off disguise .  --  But know , my spirit dares Immediate death  --  nor asks a rival 's aid . Clar . Clara And wilt thou still mistake me for thy rival ?

Never till now appear 'd a fair whose charms Could realize that model of perfection Your glowing fancy has so oft described , When you have hon 'd with familiar converse Your chosen courtiers . Lady H. Isabel ( aside ) Wretch , I see his aim . Hume . Lord Hume Her eyes of liquid blue , o'erarch 'd with brows Of darker tint , strike like the ethereal heavens , Half-veil 'd with clouds , that bring the fruitful showers Of early spring .

Muscrave Sooth to say , I think this english lord , though counted brave , Fears it like meaner men , and seeks protection Behind the ample buckler of the church . A holy pilgrim late from Salem 's walls Rides foremost of the train , and bears aloft A many cross with palm-branches entwined , And deck 'd with sacred emblems .

Can moderation 's voice suggest no arts To heal those wounds that honor , tyrant honor , Gives and returns ; or teach two brother monarchs To run one prosperous and yet glorious course ? James .

Will not a king accept this knightly proffer Who values knighthood equal with his crown ? James . James IV The knightly faith of princes is display 'd By succoring their allies . Why does your master Renew old claims , worn with the rust of time , Against my brother Lewis , and despoil The fruitful plains of France , our ancient friend . Marm . Lord Marmion Pardon , great prince , the zeal  --  at least sincere , Which warns you against France , that sly deceiver , Whose selfish friendship veils remorseless hate .

Well I know That France alone can balance England 's power ; Her strength subdued , this independent crown , From foreign conquerors by valor saved , Would sink for ever . All the courtesy That Henry 's pride , swoln with the wreck of France , Would grant a brother , were to fall the last Amongst his trampled slaves .

James IV In vain you lure me with these airy scenes . Near danger threatens . Would your monarch prove The just regard he bears a brother 's rights  --  I ask once more , will he lead back his troops To britain 's isle , relinquish foreign conquest , And offer peace to France ? Marm . Lord Marmion I came prepared With friendly offers to redress those wrongs Of which as king of Scotland you complain 'd : But as ally of France , sir , my commission Is silent on that head , nor dare I hope My master will accept of terms like these .

My hated rival 's shade  --  The dreams of monks  --  all , all will be forgot . Marmion is practised in the skill to free The female heart from superstition 's chains . Ay me ! what crowding thoughts at once rush in ! Why , memory , bring'st thou Constance to my view Array 'd in all those charms she now has lost ? Alas !

Faint were its languid hues , yet still it bloom 'd . Would my rash hand had never braved the thorns That guarded its frail beauty . Change abhorr 'd ! What is she now ! let me not look that way . Remorse intrude not at an hour like this ! I wait the artful Heron : t is my task , With hope of high rewards , to win her aid ; So Surrey has enjoin 'd . I hate the office .

Lord Marmion And the rigor Of this most saintly abbess would be melted With beams more powerful still  --  the beams of gold , I can not cringe to churchmen ; I disdain On bended knee to offer costly gifts To those whose vows of poverty first lured The credulous multitude to own their sway .

Much he fears Delay may raise new obstacles . Eustace Fitz Eustace ( to Blount ) Go thou . And bring him hither : for this office pains me . Abbess . Abbess ( to Clara ) Beware , my child , beware of fell despair  --  I think if thou gavest way to its suggestions The shock would break at once this aged heart . It is the very vice of demons . Man , Crush 'd to the lowest misery , need not feel it , But may look up to an unseen protector , And unappalled behold a ruin 'd world . Thou know'st ( in a lower tone ) that impious rashness has arrested The hand of mercy stretch 'd to bring relief . Young as thou art , thou hast beheld events Of warning more important , more instructive Then eloquence can paint . Clar . Clara Give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And shun the precipice that on each side Opens its fearful gulf . Abbess . Abbess My hourly prayers  --  My blessings  --  all are thine . One more embrace !

The blood of Wilton Still hangs upon that sword , and stains those hands . Marm . Lord Marmion ( in a tone of affected respect ) No selfish view , obedience to my king , Good abbess , bids me part you from your ward . I must conduct her safely to Fitz-Clare . If you persist to claim a guardian 's right , Henry in person will decide the cause . Abbess . Abbess I have no words to waste in sharp debate Unseemly for my station .

Lord Marmion O lovely virgin , raise those weeping eyes . Why should that graceful form in mute dejection Sink to the earth ? I come to ratify Whate'er Fitz Eustace promised in my name . Love but offends thy saint like modestly ; Thou shalt not hear its voice . I will not claim Even such slight courtesy as unknown strangers From a sworn vestal might unblamed receive , Till I have placed thee , safe and free , removed From treacherous friendship , in thy guardian 's halls . Clar . Clara ( turning towards him ) Lo ! I am ready , lo ' a new born spirit . Rouses within me . Marmion ! view me well . I can view thee : these eyes can stedfast view thee , Not without pain , but without suppliant tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush impetuous like a whirlwind forth . Then hush 'd in silence sleep its powers away . Thou art mistaken , thou shalt never hear Weak imprecations , unbecoming rage , From Clara 's lips . With voice composed I tell thee The laws of heaven have placed a bar betwixt us . And it would well befit thy boasted wisdom To own that fatal barrier , and withdraw . I know thou call'st me credulous and weak , Scared by the tales of reverend hypocrites . T is not credulity  --  t is full conviction Lives in my bosom , and inspires my speech ; But of what nature , let thy conscience guess  --  I scorn to use reproach . Marm . Lord Marmion ( aside ) Her genius awes me ! What , shall mine shrink appall 'd by female threats ? Never !  --  Fair lady , ( turning to Clara ) in some peaceful hour Thou wilt retract thy error . At this moment My thoughts are all on war . The ardent spirit Of Howard urges a decisive battle , And England 's voice commands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the postern-gate . Fitz-Eustace , he whose gentlest manners best Suit with the bashful fears of a recluse Of all my train , shall guard thee . Clar . Clara I obey ! Protesting first to thee , to earth , and heaven , No power shall awe me to pollute my soul With thy unhallow 'd nuptials . Thou shalt find That constancy and hate of lawless wrong Descended from the heroes of my line , Even to their helpless daughter . Thou may'st break The last weak sapling of that noble stem The glory once of Britain ,  --  but to bend it , To warp it from its native rectitude  --  Marmion , renounce that hope  --  t is past thy power . exeunt Clara and attendants SCENE XIV  --  MARMION , alone .

Have I for this renounced the enamor 'd Constance , Who with the ardent gaze of admiration Hung on my slightest word : I was her idol . Her sum of bliss . O Constance ! what dark cell Confines thee now ?  --  perhaps what cruelty  --  But sure they dare not .  --  Monkish pride would shake When Marmion frown 'd . Yet how redress her wrongs ? The spies of churchmen will beset my steps , And Clara watch me with suspicious hate .

I have much to ask , were this a time For holy leisure ; much I long to know If Salem 's temple yields indeed a balm For rankling wounds of conscience . But I hear You come to sue for justice . If my followers Have done you wrong , keen vengeance waits their crime . Palmer . Palmer Not from your subjects have I suffer 'd wrong , But from my countrymen . O , royal sir , I have a tale to utter far unlike The scene your pious fancy has portray 'd  --  Mistake me not :  --  t is no impostor begs Indulgence to his fraud .

A man proclaim 'd Traitor and recreant , yet in heart most loyal , A man long number 'd with the senseless dead  --  The injured Ralph de Wilton stands before you ! James . James IV Wilton ! that name awakes my recollection . The gradual image dawns upon my view . You were accused of plotting with young Suffolk ? Wilt . Ralph de Wilton I was . James . James IV Enough , believe me for your friend . What is your suit ? Wilt . Ralph de Wilton If ever virtuous love , Distress 'd and persecuted , claim 'd a tear , If ever knight protected helpless beauty , Exert your sovereign power , and let not Clara Be forced away by this detested Marmion , Whose love is hateful to her as the grave .

Ralph de Wilton Yes , I dare . Peruse them and decide . ( gives the packet ) James . James IV Your death was held A truth undoubted . Wilt . Ralph de Wilton By one friendly hand I was preserved unknown to all beside , But for a life of sufferings worse than death . Degraded  --  blotted from fair knighthood 's roll , The honor 'd blazon of my ancestors Unstain 'd through ages , now defaced and torn By hands so vile  --  they choke me but to name . No friendship , no alliance offers aid . All hate or shun me  --  save one faithful maiden . Oh ! blessings on her ! she redeems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend St. Hilda 's abbess , Clara 's sole protector , I find even her my foe ; yet through her means , Mysterious providence ! those proofs are mine  --  Strange is my destiny ! pain blends with joy . Declared a traitor by the king I love . A hostile king must listen to my cause , And loyalty shrinks back from such appeal . I should deserve the rigor of my fate If I did not before your throne proclaim My only hope , my heart 's supreme desire Is to confront your soldiers in the field , And , cover 'd with their blood or with my own , Approve my truth . Now , sir , my life and freedom Are in your hands . James . James IV ( after looking over the papers ) Thou hast a noble spirit , I like thee better for thy bold defiance . And will espouse thy cause as if thou wert My bosom friend . Amidst this treacharous world The brave and honest form a separate nation , And should be join 'd in everlasting league ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warrior sunk to crimes unheard of In his high order . Yet these proofs convince me . I 'll tell thee , Wilton  --  t is within my power More than thou know'st , to clear thy injured fame . Attend my words . Wilt . Ralph de Wilton My soul is wrapt in wonder . James . James IV Few months have pass 'd since Suffolk was enjoin 'd By Lewis , at whose court he skulks concealed , To speak with truth if divers noble inmates Of Henry 's court , whose loyalty seem 'd doubtful , Had been indeed his friends . My careful envoy Sent me these tidings : such is my abhorrence Of secret plots , so much I hold this Suffolk For my own foe , I felt no anxious wish To learn his answer ; but it chanced he spake With more sincerity than exiled renegades Most commonly observe , and frankly own 'd He had no secret friends at Hencry 's court .

SCENE XVII. enter to them , MUSGRAVE , the attendant , who presents a letter to James . Mus . Muscrave My liege . I waited Long at the gate that shuts the southern tower , And when I gain 'd admittance , all were gone , Lord Marmion and his train . Wilt . Ralph de Wilton Oh ! where is Clara ? Mus . Muscrave The abbess and her nuns had follow 'd Marmion , Who sent the king this letter . Wilt . Ralph de Wilton This is ruin ! James . James IV Ha ! this demands inquiry . ( aside ) Isabel Has wrong 'd her trust . ( opens and reads the letter ) So ! nought but vague excuses , " His honor calls him to the post of danger , " Honor did not enjoin discourtesy . What 's here ? he states " the abbess and her nuns Begg 'd to depart this instant . " Wilt . Ralph de Wilton False as hell ! He is her mortal foe . James . James IV I dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villain  --  Pursue him straight . ( to Musgrave ) Wilt . Ralph de Wilton Hold ! I intreat you , hold ! Though I had rather feel a serpent twine Its venomous folds around my shivering breast , Yet I must shun such aid . Within these walls You might at pleasure have detain 'd your captive ; But once included in the sacred train Of embassy  --  t is agony to speak This bitter truth ! the law of nations pleads On Marmion 's side , and were its slightest clause Infringed for me , my doom were endless shame . James . James IV Still dost thou rise superior to thy fate . I own , to see this Marmion steal a fair one , Whose charms I dared not venture to behold . Has irk 'd me sore  --  perchance beyond due bounds . I am the first to tell thee thou must follow To Surrey 's camp  --  for thither he repairs ; And since our fortune wills it , thou must buy Thy mistress at the price of scottish blood . Wilt . Ralph de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fortune Seems harder than at first . Nay , should success Attend my sword , the cunning of my rival Will ward off justice with strict literal law . And cry , he need not answer the weak challenge Of that vile being  --  a degraded knight . James . James IV My hand can break the barrier that divides you , My hand can raise you to your former state , And send you forth once more a knight at arms ; To call your rival to the listed field . Wilt . Ralph de Wilton Too generous prince ! I should indeed deserve The weight of obloquy that bears me down Could I accept that offer . My allegiance Would then , divided in two separate currents , Wrong both my benefactors . James . James IV Not a whit ! I claim no such allegiance . I have heard Of knights who offer 'd knighthood to their foes That in the lists of death they might decide Their mortal quarrel . Give me no return But open strokes dealt fairly at the breast , If we perchance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilton Forbid such dreadful meeting , guardian powers . James . James IV What ! dost thou think that leaning on my sword I 'll stand at goodly distance  --  noting down The wounds that brave men suffer for my sake , And cry with careless accent  --  " that 's well fought ! " No ! by st . George ! your far famed Edward glow 'd With purer joy when as a knight unknown He vanquish 'd Ribaumont in single fight , Than when two captive monarchs graced his court By other hands subdued . My speech , my offers Flow not from Scotland 's king , but from a knight Who feels his order 's glory as his own . I know the limits of my regal office . Honor and virtue are beyond the power Of scepter 'd kings to give or take away . To higher courts ascends their last appeal . Honor seeks justice from posterity , But virtue claims it  --  from a judge in heaven . Wilt . Ralph de Wilton By his last great tribunal then I swear , Rather had Wilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than accept Favors ill sorted with that conscious virtue Your noble mind prefers to kingly sway . James . James IV Such virtue soars too proudly , yet it strikes Involuntary reverence , and I yield . But on some points I will not be refused . With these important papers thou shalt take Suffolk 's full disavowal of thy guilt By my own hand attested . Crafty policy Will not presume to charge me with deceit ; Since interest bids me hate the friends of Suffolk , Whose claims are hostile to my queen 's just rights . End note : 1Kb But I have nobler grounds . Though Henry wrongs me , His open spirit is akin to mine , And will by conscious instinct take my word . Wilt . Ralph de Wilton How can I answer this ! James . James IV By valiant deeds ! My servants shall provide a steed , a sword , And all the panoply that suits a warrior . Wilt . Ralph de Wilton O , sir ! your goodness robs me of that strength You bid me use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilton ! Talk not of war like some soft-hearted maid . T is then the daring warrior smiles elate When equal blows resound through all the field , And valor conquers valor like itself . Then may he call his captives to the banquet , And him whose stubborn strength was last subdued Place nearest to himself . Be mine this transport ! Wilton  --  be sure to earn a seat of honor . But , Marmion , he shall never share my feast Fought he like every peer of Charlemain . T is late  --  you must retire . Wilt . Ralph de Wilton My swelling heart Will give its passions vent . Yes , I must kneel Even to my country 's enemy  --  must take This bounteous hand and bathe it with my tears , And with my lips impress the only pledge Of gratitude this gloomy hour allows . For blood and slaughter are the sole returns Assign 'd for favors that would well deserve The service of a life . O , royal sir ! Can I behold you rushing to the scene Of certain danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nor , unreproved , detain you with my prayers ? Must you assault by force those english hearts Your goodness might have melted ? all unfit Am I , though clothed in robes of sanctity , To take a prophet 's function on myself ; Yet feelings rush through my perturbed soul That seem like inspiration . Oh ! beware ! If you persist , such ills in prospect rise , That Scotland to her latest hour may rue The valor that betray 'd you to your fate . James . James IV Wilton , no more of this ! the die is cast , Honor impels us on  --  shame stands behind And with stern voice forbids us to retreat . Then let us part without unmanly weakness , I , as a king , must guard my nation 's rights  --  Thou , as a subject , must defend thy prince  --  Each to our duty , leave the rest to heaven . exeunt severally END OF THE FOURTH ACT .

Fitz Eustace ( interrupting Blount ) Hold ! hold ! for shame ! my lord , for quiet 's sake Inquire of Blount no farther . Every question Will conjure up whole troops of grisly sprights , More numerous than the plandering scottish bands . Hear me , ( to Blount ) good comrade . When the abbess wept , You scoff 'd my credulous pity . I confess My courage ill can stand a woman 's tears , But for these nursery tales of gaping rustics , They raise no weak alarms .

Ralph de Wilton Austin , that good old beadsman of my house . But sure  --  some saint or angel lent him aid . Dead in the lists I lay , to all men 's eyes ; He only mark 'd some feeble signs of life : With pious cunning he intreated leave To hide my shame in some unnoticed grave  --  Oh ! had my life been known , nor prayers nor tears Could have preserved me from a doom so vile  --  The very thought is horror . Time would fail To tell thee how within his lonely cell Day after day , he watch 'd my dangerous wounds , Or how , by his persuasion , I assumed A pilgrim 's hallow 'd weeds , and forth we fared , Sharing each arduous labor . Clar . Clara Best of men ! Where is he to partake our mutual joy . To see me clasp his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilton Ah ! Clara ! he must hear those thanks in heaven , On earth thou canst not pay them . He expired Even where he wish 'd  --  in Salem 's sacred walls .

He sooth 'd those furious transports of despair Which might have turn 'd the dagger ' gainst my breast , Or raised it foully on my treacherous foe . Oh ! none can guess , untried by such extremes , How wrongs can silence honor 's nobler voice . The thought of Marmion turn 'd my blood to fire ; I long 'd to rush upon him ' midst his friends  --  Stab him  --  and die triumphant on the stroke . But since I learnt the wonders of thy truth Methinks I hate him less  --  his crimes have served To raise thee o'er weak woman 's common praise  --  O'er every name renown 'd for constant love .

At this great crisis Surrey is arm 'd with all his master 's power , And Surrey 's house is link 'd in blood to mine . Clar . Clara The spirit of my father swells within me .

Full proofs exist : And had the will divine array 'd my spirit In manly form , and given me power to draw The sword my glorious fathers drew in fight , Then , Wilton 's friend and comrade in the lists , I would maintain his cause . A feeble maid Can only call each tutelary saint . To give their sanction to their solemn word . Wilt . Ralph de Wilton My generous Clara ! Friar . Friar Surrey , hear me speak . In the last agonies of death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Wilton 's innocence . Surrey . Earl of Surrey To-morrow 's dawn Shall see his sentence by my power reversed . My gratitude from Henry hopes to win His faithful Clara 's hand . Now other duties  --  Care for the wounded , pious rites for those Who fell in battle , claim our earliest thoughts . Chief , let us pay due honors to that prince Whose fall awakes my sorrow . Boast not , Howard , Yon mournful triumph : rather let his death Be charged to hands unknown . If vaunting spirits Exult in his sad destiny , or bid us Invade his shatter 'd kingdom , I affirm T is malice , not true english zeal , that speaks  --  Then only shall this harass 'd land be blest When leagues perpetual join in happier hour Those standards long opposed in ruthless war . Then peace shall smile at home , and foreign foes Shrink back from this unconquerable isle . THE END OF MARMION.
