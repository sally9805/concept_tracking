Tucker , St. George , 1752-1827 : LINES By the Hon. St. George Tucker , of Virginia . from Lines ( 1819 ) Footnote : 1Kb DAYS of my youth  --  ye have glided away , Hairs of my youth  --  ye are frosted and grey ; Eyes of my youth  --  your keen sight is no more , Cheeks of my youth  --  ye are furrow 'd all o'er ; Strength of my youth  --  all your vigour is gone , Thoughts of my youth  --  your gay visions are flown . Days of my youth  --  I wish not your recal , Hairs of my youth  --  I 'm content you should fall ; Eyes of my youth  --  ye much evil have seen , Cheeks of my youth  --  bath 'd in tears have ye been ; Thoughts of my youth  --  ye have led me astray , Strength of my youth  --  why lament your decay ! Days of my age  --  ye will shortly be past , Pains of my age  --  yet awhile can ye last ; Joys of my age  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be religion your light ; Thoughts of my age  --  dread ye not the cold sod , Hopes of my age  --  be ye fixed on your God
