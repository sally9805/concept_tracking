The town of Fatteconda , in Bondou , a district of Africa , inhabited by the Foulahs , and situate between the rivers Senegal and Gambia . A large tract of romantic country beyond the town . The horizon is very faintly tinged with the rays of the sun ; which grow stronger as the action proceeds , till the sun is completely risen . Selico discovered , watching the progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light !  --  those streaks , thy harbingers , Are sluggish glowworms on the mountain 's brow :  --  Thy bird , the eagle , mourns ; and constant dawn , Whom thou wert wont to press with hasty fire , Weeps dew , in token of thy love 's neglect , Thou follow'st her so slow  --  Though oft , ere noon , Faint from thy influence , I seek the shade , Come sun , and scorch me now ! Dart thy full beams , O'er Afric 's sands upon me ;  --  Bring me day ; Bring me to my Berissa !  --  to my bride ! Torribalputs his head through an aperture from the hut . Torri . Torribal Brother Selico ! Sel . Selico Ha ! Torribal ! what say you , brother ? Torri . Torribal I say that the sun do n't get up sooner for your bawling ;  --  but I do :  --  so I 'll come out and speak to you . Disappears . Sel . Selico Close to a brake , I 've seen a playful lion , Pawing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much like my brother 's wit ; a clumsy jester Hurts , often , while he sports ;  --  well , well , he loves me ; And we are brother lions !  --  I am tamest . Enter Torribal , from the hut . Torri . Torribal Now Selico , my youngest brother ! Soon , They beat the tabala , to tell us all You 're going to be married . Sel . Selico Ay , dear Torribal ;  --  With the approval of our much loved mother , And with the sanction , too , of our good priest , Farulho , father of my bride Berissa . Pr'ythee , what then ? Torri . Torribal Why , then , ' t is to be hoped You wo n't ( the bride will sour else ) hunt for sunbeams , So soon to-morrow , as to-day . Sel . Selico Still , brother , you will mock . Torri . Torribal Mock ?  --  Oh , not I !  --  Love is a pretty pastime ; and  --  last night , Beneath the tabba tree , our market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sel . Selico ' T was kind .  --  What said you ? Torri . Torribal Africans , said I , Townsmen of Fatteconda , here in Bondou , Between the Senegal and Gambia , We Foulahs are the prettiest of the negroes ; For the same sun that dyes our neighbours black , ( Feloops , Mandingoes , Jaloops , and the rest , ) Has dipt us Foulahs lighter by ten shades . Berissa is the prettiest maid among us ; My brothers are the prettiest of your tribe ; And brother Selico ,  --  except myself ,  --  The handsomest of all our family :  --  And so this loving couple 's love may last A little longer than my wedding speech . Sel . Selico A speech of scoff , and ribaldry : my heart Grieves that it can not thank you . Side by side When first I follow 'd you into the wars , ( A stripling I , you season 'd in the fight ) Remember , Torribal  --  Torri . Torribal That you fought well . Sel . Selico No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . You saw the arrow coming , and your arm , Guarding my breast , received it ;  --  in your flesh It quiver 'd ; and ne'er scarr 'd the youth you claspt : You wrenched the barb , then reeking from your sinews , And smiled as you exclaimed , " They must not wound My little brother Selico . " Torri . Torribal Umph ! did I ? Sel . Selico Yes , Torribal : You may forget . I can not :  --  But pr'ythee , think , good brother , though this hand Taking Torribal 's hand . So fondly screen 'd my bosom , that your tongue May , very deeply , wound my heart . Torri . Torribal I hate all honey-mouth ;  --  all flattery . Young men may marry ; there 's no harm in marriage . What is one wife ? our law allows us plenty ; But to desert a mother  --  Sel . Selico What ? desert !  --  You touch me to the quick ! the very wolf Feels there the tie of nature ! Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afric 's converts worship ! who shall say I leave a mother , if her age requires me ? Could I ! who  --  Madiboo appears in perspective winding round a pathway on a hill , and singing . He continues in sight till he is hid by the intervening bushes , as he proceeds on his way . Madiboo Madiboo singing . Kouskous and sinkatoo , for king Ali Beg , O ! But Serawooli king he eat antelope 's leg , O ! Sing shannawang , sing sharrawang , Sing shongo ! Torri . Torribal Over the hills comes Madiboo , our brother ! He went before the moon sunk , to fetch home Provision , by the dawn . Sel . Selico He will not say , ( While you and he remains ,  --  and I at hand too ) I left a mother destitute . Torri . Torribal Not he ! He never thinks  --  Madpates have no tomorrow . His skull holds just enough to oil his limbs , And make him active ; then he runs a field ; Shoots paroquets , and snares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more game than brains , And so we go to dinner . Sel . Selico Still unjust ! His frame , robust and pliant , boasts a nature Well suited to it ; for ' t is bold yet yielding ; Fierce to his foe as panther 's ;  --  but the dove , Who wings her anxious journey home with food , Returns not to her young with more delight , Than he comes laden to his family . The strong , but generous sovereign of the woods , And the spring lamb that frolics on the green , Have mingled both their qualities within him . Torri . Torribal Enough . Sel . Selico Not quite ;  --  They who have heads enough To prompt them honestly to use their limbs , And work a living for their humble homes , Are neither fools , nor burthens in a nation . Enter Madiboo , carrying corn , game , &c.; Mad . Madiboo singing as he enters . Good wife had Kickawick ,  --  she drowny one night , O ! But Kickawick no fish again , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &c.; Mad . Madiboo Putting down the different articles.  --  There 's maize ,  --  I 'll throw it into the paloon , And pound it , for my mother 's kouskous pudding  --  And there are partridges ; ground nuts , and rice ; And three fat guinea fowls ! I shot them , Selico , For your bride 's father . Torri . Torribal Sneeringly . Ay , priests love good eating . Mad . Madiboo Bless all their jolly chops ! I love to see , ( When there 's a wedding dinner ) the good man , Who join 'd the couple , smiling at the feast . Torri . Torribal Well , let them gorge . Sel . Selico Warmly . Farulho is no glutton . Mad . Madiboo A glutton ! Looks at his brother . Oh ! I see ;  --  the old work : You have been fretting him , about Berissa . And on the wedding-day , too , Torribal ! Come , come , this is not kind . Torri . Torribal Very sulkily . It all began In a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not begin it . You are , ' t is certain , as incapable Of a good joke , as an owl is of singing . Torri . Torribal Why , how now , Madiboo ! You bird-catcher ! Hunt and be dumb ;  --  your wit lies in your heels . Mad . Madiboo And where lies yours ? Your muddy jibes are like The frisking of an elephant . You trample , And fancy you have caper 'd . I have mark 'd you , A thousand times , tormenting Selico . Dashing your gall ( which you call pleasantry ) Upon his milky spirit ! till his heart Has aked with pain , and mine has boil 'd with anger . Torri . Torribal I tell you , fool , I jested . Mad . Madiboo Jested , did you ? Why , you are grown , of late , as bright as lead ; As comical as malice ; and cut as keen As any rusty hatchet , notched . Shame on it , Torribal ! see how he grieves . Pointing to Selico . You jeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a merry-making ; He cried , " I 'll tickle you ! " and chopp 'd his head off . Sel . Selico Stepping between them , and taking their hands . Peace , I entreat you ! pray , let us be friends ! We outrage , else , our parent 's tenderness ; Who , left in widow 'd poverty , wept o'er us ; Toil 'd in her sickness , fasting while we fed ; And clung to life , only to rear her babes . When brothers are at variance , could they think On one tear a mother shed on them , That woke their slumbers , while their infant arms Circled each other 's neck , ' t would surely quench All sparks of strife within their breasts for ever . Mad . Madiboo Affected . My sparks are all gone out ; and , goodman Gruff , When you 're extinguish 'd , say so , and be friends . To Torribal . Torri . Torribal There then . Holding out his hand . Mad . Madiboo And there . Shaking it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darina calls within . Dar . Darina Selico ! Mad . Madiboo Our mother calls you ; run ! Sel . Selico I come , good mother . Exit Selico into the hut . Torri . Torribal He talks it well . Mad . Madiboo Who ; he ? Torri . Torribal Ay ,  --  Selico . But if he bears us all such loads of love , Why does he quit us ? Mad . Madiboo Why ?  --  to take a wife . Torri . Torribal Ay ; the priest 's daughter : she is rich and grand ;  --  Else why not bring her to our little family ? Mad . Madiboo Because , ' t is like , she 'll have a little family , And then , in time , the cabin could not hold us . Torri . Torribal This mother , whom we work for , now she 's old  --  Mad . Madiboo Emphatically . Ay ,  --  and who work 'd for us , when she was young  --  Torri . Torribal Well ,  --  her he leaves :  --  and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How barbarous ! There stands the house he 'll live in . He 'll not be able , now , to visit her , Above ten times a day . Torri . Torribal Well , well ; his labour Falls on us now ; and added to our own  --  Mad . Madiboo We shall be kill 'd ! we 're both such puny children . Torri . Torribal Pshaw ! If ' t is right to marry , then , how comes it He marries first ? Mad . Madiboo Oh ! are you thereabouts ? Now it comes out ; you want a wife yourself ; You would be billing , would you ? oh , you sly one ! Torri . Torribal Not I ;  --  but he 's the youngest . Mad . Madiboo That 's the reason : Girls always like the youngest best , that 's certain . Torri . Torribal As things fall out  --  Mad . Madiboo Come , come , do n't you fall out , When things fall out just as we might expect them . I shoot , you till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily blessing for her , Selico Has paid a daily visit to the Priest . Torri . Torribal Well ? Mad . Madiboo When your corn and vegetables sprout , Do pretty girls sprout with them ? Torri . Torribal No  --  not one . Mad . Madiboo And when I have been upon the hunt for birds , I never chanced to put up a priest 's daughter . But Selico went in the way of beauty ; And she whom he soon loved , loved him : what said Her father ( good old soul ) the Priest Farulho ? Just this  --  " The filial heart of Selico " Bespeaks him good ; and he shall have my girl . " An honest husband is a wife 's best wealth : " A rich wife helps a poor and kindly son , " To cheer an aged widow and a mother . " When every match is made upon this plan , Family quarrels wo n't be quite so common . Torri . Torribal Perhaps I 've been too bitter . Mad . Madiboo Worse than wormwood We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , that  --  Torri . Torribal Others ! Mad . Madiboo Yes ;  --  but first swear not to blab . Torri . Torribal I Promise . Mad . Madiboo Your promise . Is so unlike your joke , that I can take it Hear :  --  The Mandingo king , ' t is look 'd for , soon Will take us by surprise . Torri . Torribal The usual way Of war , among our nations . Mad . Madiboo Coming home Just now , among the thickets , I espied A party of Mandingoes , arm 'd , in ambush . Torri . Torribal The army 's then at hand  --  I 'll raise our people . Going . Mad . Madiboo Catching him by the arm . As sure as you attempt to raise the people , I take you by surprise , and trip your heels up . You 'll mar the wedding . Torri . Torribal Yes  --  but are you mad ? Mad . Madiboo Be calm  --  these are but straggling parties ; we 've time , Before the main force comes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ne'er may happen . Torri . Torribal But if  --  Mad . Madiboo Nay , nay , be ruled ; the very moment Our brother has secured his bride , we 'll rouse The town . Torri . Torribal Agreed . Mad . Madiboo ' I will be but a short time ; And then  --  Hush ! here 's our mother ! not a word ! Enter Darina , from the hut , with a mantle on her arm . Torri. and Mad . Torribal , Madiboo Bless our dear mother ! Dar . Darina Blessings on my children ! On this day double blessings ! for it brings Joy to my youngest born ; and therefore , joy To both his brothers . Oh ! the drops that now Steal on my cheek are sweet as morning gems ; For my heart 's sunshine sparkles in my eye , And grateful is the dew that glitters there . Mad . Madiboo Come  --  ' t is full time that we should to the Priest ; The bride will grow impatient . Dar . Darina I shall follow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , We 'll join you at the feast . Mad . Madiboo Good  --  Brother Torribal , do you go with us ? Here Darina is unfolding the mantle , and Madiboo whispers him . Do n't  --  remain at home , To guard her . If those stragglers come to skirmish . Fight like a devil till I come to back you . Torri Torribal . Aside . Enough ;  --  hum . Aloud . I shall stay behind , now , To stow in the provisions you have brought . You and I , mother , then can go together . He takes up the articles that Madiboo has left near the door , and then exit into the hut . Enter Selico . Sel . Selico Now , mother , once more bless me , and I go . Dar . Darina Stay , Selico ; present this to Farulho . Mad . Madiboo A curious mantle that . Dar . Darina The widow 's offering Giving it to Selico . ( On her son 's marriage ) to the good old Priest . Say , while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude burst from Darina 's lips , For him who thus has bless 'd her and her son . Sel . Selico Embrace me , mother ; and our prophet guard you ! They embrace . Mad . Madiboo Aside . My mind misgives me ;  --  should the foe arrive Before we  --  hum !  --  Come , come ! Mother , farewell ! You 'll come to dinner . Dar . Darina Yes to find all happy . Mad . Madiboo Ay , to be sure ; the Priest will have his game , And that will make him happy ; Selico Will have Berissa , that will make them happy , And Torribal stays here to come with you , So you two will be happy .  --  Oh , there never Were such a set of happy , happy people , As we shall be to-day , in Africa . Come , Selico ,  --  and good bye , mother ! Come ! Exeunt ; Darina into the hut . SCENE II . The interior of Farulho 's house . Enter Mug . Mug . Henry Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why did fortune cast me on a soil , where to be fair is to be ugly ?  --  Oh , Henry Augustus Mug ! once a turner , both in wood and ivory , and free of the city of London , you are now a slave , among the living ebony ware of the world 's creation . The chief folks , indeed , of Fatteconda , the Foulahs , as they call themselves , are some patterns lighter than the original natives , and my fellow slaves ; but the town altogether looks like a backgammon board , when the game is over , and all the black and yellow men are jumbled together , Still that little jade , Sutta , runs in my head , strangely ! She is a dingy Venus , of the dumpling sort , sprung out of the Black sea  --  Eh !  --  Here she comes . Enter Sutta , crossing . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Sutta ! Sutta ! Sutta .

Little did I think , when I exported myself , to buy a cargo of elephant 's and hippopotamus 's teeth , on the banks of the Gambia , that I should be kidnapp 'd by a negro slave merchant , and carried up the country to be sold . Sutta . Sutta How much you sell for ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Damn the price , it mortifies me ! On account of my color , I did n't fetch more than an English sandman may give for a good donkey . Sutta . Sutta What dat ? Donkey very poor white man ? Mug .

Henry Augustus Mug Sink the money , if you please ; ' t is devilish disagreeable : I have sold an ivory toothpick case out of my show-glass , for double the money . Far . Farulho Nay , I was not the cause of your inthralment . You were a bondsman when I saw you first ; And toiling past your strength beneath the lash : I purchased you to smooth your yoke with down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he could find no friend , and wanted one .

Wild music without . Far . Farulho Forget your cares awhile ; my daughter marries : The house cries holiday ; and jocund mirth Floats down the musky vale , where echo answers , Each slave to day shall have his double portion . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug That 's as much as to say , we are all allow 'd to get drunk with dooli  --  a sort of African Whitebread 's Entire . Far . Farulho Oh , no ! excess befits not me , nor mine  --  A priestly festival unbends the brow , As cheerful morning lights the sober hills : The drunkard 's revel is a heated day , That ends in midnight storm , distorting nature Though faiths may differ , all must join in this : We seldom see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sacred function .

Henry Augustus Mug You may get a better dinner there for eighteen pence , than all the rich men here could give at a picnic . Far . Farulho What would you have to make your fare more dainty ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug What you have no notion of : a clean tablecloth , and a three-prong 'd fork , with a neat turn 'd ivory handle ; a hot beafsteak , done by a quick fire ; with mash 'd potatoes , and red pickled cabbage ; the mustard and pepper cruets at one elbow , and a pot of porter with a cawliflower head at the other .

SONG . A Priest of Kajaago , as blind as a stone , When he took to his bosom a wife , Cried " Deary , I never shall see you , I own , " But you 'll be the delight of my life . " Then his arm o'er her shoulders he lovingly pass 'd , And says he , " my love , what is this lump ? " She faulter 'd a little  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only my hump . " Says the Priest , " then we can not cohabit , d'ye see  --  " " Though I tenderly love you indeed ! " For I 've taken an oath that my children sha n't be " Of the camel or buffalo breed . " So he married another he fancied would fit ; Coming home in sweet conjugal talk , She stopp 'd the blind Priest , saying , " Sit down a bit , " For my legs are too bandy to walk . " " Bandy legs ! " said the Priest , " ca n't be counted for sins , " So sit there as still as a mouse ; " For Mahomet curse me , if ever your shins " Shall waddle you into my house . " Page 111 Then he turn 'd up his eyes , like the white of boil 'd eggs , And pray 'd thus to Mahomet smack : " Great prophet , afford me a wife with good legs , " And never a hump on her back . " Then the voice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his head : " A handsome young woman , that ca n't speak a word , " Shall bless your blind reverence 's bed . " The Priest he bow 'd low , crying , " Mahomet 's kind ; " Of happiness this is the sum ! " For a handsome young wife likes her old husband blind , " And most men like a wife that is dumb . " Enter Mug , in a fright . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Oh , Lord !  --  I am scared out of my seven senses ! Mad . Madiboo What 's the matter , whitey ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Matter enough , whitey-brown  --  The infernal Mandingoes are making a descent upon us with a huge army . Sutta . Sutta Den all poor slave Farulho make free , Mandingo man make slave again . Mad . Madiboo Are they in the town ? Mug .

The town of Fatteconda , in ruins .  --  Selico appears , wandering distractedly over the fragments of the demolished dwellings , with the mantle of Farulho in his hand . Sel .

Selico Plucking out arrows , from the lifeless hearts That lately throbb 'd in our companions ' bosoms ; Turning the faces of dead friends from earth , Then pondering upon their ghastly lips , Which , ere the last moon waned , smiled sweetly on us . Mad . Madiboo Fie , this is weakness , Selico : we want you To help us for our mother . Sel . Selico Wildly . Have I one ? Mad . Madiboo Have you ? Why Torribal , and you , and I , Bore her , upon our arms , into the woods , On the same day that they besieged the town : And after that you left us . But she lives  --  Sel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's alive . Ha ! ha ! I have still a mother  --  Remember ; though I saw her placed in safety , ere I went , And both my brothers with her . Mad . Madiboo Rise , and collect yourself . I have skulk 'd here , To find , if possible , a little food , Left in this village , and to find out you . Sel . Selico Well , you have gain 'd one point , if not the other : You have found me . Mad . Madiboo Not quite as I could wish : We need you to assist us ; and you seem Scarce able to assist yourself . Our mother  --  Sel . Selico Springing from the ground . I 'll fight for her while I have breath within me . Mad . Madiboo Fight for a dinner then , and win the battle .

The night before , Food was so scanty that she would not taste The little we could get ,  --  till , in her faintness , We forced it on her . Sel . Selico Would not taste it !  --  Why ? Mad . Madiboo Each felt the other 's want before their own . She would not eat , fearing to rob her sons ; Nor they because they saw their mother starving . Sel . Selico I 'll grapple with the lioness , and tear The fresh kill 'd wild goat from her sinewy paws , Ere she who gave me birth shall die by famine . I know the spot we fixed my mother in ;  --  I 'll fly to succor her . Mad . Madiboo Be cautious , then . Stragglers , from the Mandingo camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , take heed , Or you may lose your life . Sel . Selico My life ? Oh , brother , I wish that it were gone . Going . Mad .

Mad . Madiboo Do n't look so wildly You harrow me  --  you wish your life were gone ? Sel . Selico I do ; but fear not for me ; I shall ne'er Commit self slaughter : the revered Farulho Taught me religion , and I know my duties . Wretches who kill themselves , when life 's a burthen , Shrink from their fellow men to brave their Maker  --  Too tame to soar above the ills of earth , Too rash to bend to the decrees of Heaven , They fancy impious weakness resolution . Scared into courage , the heroic cowards Grow pusillanimously bold , and forfeit All ties , divine or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berissa and her father ? Sel .

Raising him affectionately from his neck . Berissa has but fled ! fled with her father ; And to some place of safety . Do not droop , man ; Come , pr'ythee do not ! Sel . Selico Look upon this mantle . Mad . Madiboo Staggered at the sight . Well , well  --  our mother wove it for the Priest . Sel . Selico I threw it o'er his shoulders in the tent , Just ere I hoped to wed my destin 'd bride .

Selico The porch was strew 'd with mutilated bodies ! Close to the Priest , and headless as himself , There lay a female mangled form , whose fingers Were twined in his : some bridal ornaments , Left ( like the mantle ) in the haste of pillage , Were scatter 'd round . I have them . Mad . Madiboo Shuddering . Not Berissa 's . Sel . Selico My clay-cold love 's . Mad . Madiboo Oh , never tell me so . Sel . Selico And will not nature tell you so , my brother ? Beneath the hatchets of their murderers , The father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had pressed each other 's hand , and death has clinched them . She was the good man 's only tendril : he The aged vine she clasp 'd ;  --  the storm was cruel ; The grateful shoot embraced the withering trunk , And clung there , till they perish 'd both together . Mad . Madiboo Selico , I  --  Remember , we are men ; We must bear up , and  --  pshaw ! I can not speak . Weeping . Sel . Selico You are a kind , kind brother ! Mad . Madiboo Ay , I trust so ;  --  But there are others , still alive , that love you . There 's Torribal  --  a little rough  --  but kindly . Then our dear mother . Yours are wringing losses , But you have still some comfort in your family . Sel . Selico More misery , as you describe it , now . A family without a home ; a mother , Dying for want ; and sons , in manhood 's vigor Without the means to help her . Mad . Madiboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to fight off present ill , Serves to efface the memory of the past . We must find methods to support our mother  --  Or perish in the search . Go to the wood : You know the winding . Sel . Selico I can trace it . Mad . Madiboo Go . Leave me , a little , here  --  I 'll soon be with you : My strength and spirits are not worn as yours . Among the ruins of the town , perchance , I may find something that may save us , yet , From famishing . Go , brother  --  and be careful . Sel . Selico Come with me to the outskirts :  --  Set me right Upon my way  --  for  --  Mad . Madiboo You are very faint . Sel . Selico A little : ' t is some time since I have eat ; And my mind 's torment  --  Mad . Madiboo Lean upon my shoulder  --  Cheerly , now ;  --  Tut , man ! all will yet be well . Come , Selico ! come , come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood . Enter Mug , carrying a hand-basket full of eatables . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug This is what I call a complete smash  --  They have as great a rage for knocking down houses in Africa , as they have for ever building , about London . What 's that ? Starting . Only a jackdaw  --  I 'm afraid I 'm frighten 'd ; for whenever I have caught myself whistling , curse me if I could tell whether the tune was " Guardian angels now protect me , " or " Go to the devil and shake yourself . "  --  I woud n't have ventur 'd into this dismal town again , from the camp of my new master , the Mandingo king , but for the hankering after the fate of my old master , the Foulah Priest ;  --  and , if I was quite sure little Sutta was deceased , I 'd go into short mourning . The poor creatures , here , are all as dead as door nails : so to keep myself alive , as it is a good English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made me his secretary of state  --  Sits down , and opens the basket  --  we men high in office always make sure of some devilish pretty pickings .

Henry Augustus Mug Here 's a basket full : but if the English secretary for foreign affairs could see me now , he would n't say a Mandingo cabinet minister lunches in style . Mad . Madiboo Rushing forward , and seizing him . You must n't touch a morsel . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Terrified . Do n't kill me ! keep me for a show ; you 'll find it worth your while . Mad . Madiboo White man  --  is it you ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Let me look at you  --  is it  --  eh ?  --  yes ! Lord  --  Mr. Madiboo ! I 'm heartily glad to meet you alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't hurt your old friend Henry Augustus Mug , the ivory turner ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug I ca n't tell ; I 'm almost desperate . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Are you ? Pray do n't put yourself in a passion , Mr. Madiboo  --  it will make you angry . Mad . Madiboo I must have food . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug I was just going to dinner  --  You have dropp 'd in a little unexpectedly  --  but I am vastly happy to see you . Pray take a seat upon the ground ! and excuse this bad set out , as I did n't expect the honour of your company . Mad . Madiboo Look you , chalk-face ! Your fear invites me to eat , what I should be very loath to snatch from you as plunder . The black slave merchants , who travel up along the Senegal and Gambia , say your nation is famed for humanity and bravery ; I wo n't insult its character for courage , by attacking such a paltry specimen of it as yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say no Englishman can withstand  --  an honest family is perishing ; succor the distressed . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Take all the basket , and much good may it do you . I 'm a little nervous , but hang me , if I do this out of fear . When my heart is full , I 'd as leave my stomach was empty . Mad . Madiboo You are a good white man . How can I thank you ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Do n't say a word . Munch dumb . Lord love you  --  I 'm made secretary of state to the Mandingo king , and have got plenty . Mad . Madiboo How did that happen ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Why , his majesty is a monarch of great natural parts , but he can neither read nor write : So , just as he was going to cut my throat , his majesty humanely consider 'd that I might be of a great deal of use to him , and generously spared my life . Mad . Madiboo Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no further occasion for you . He is no rightful ruler ; but work 'd and bullied himself into power . When the troubles about liberty broke out , among the Mandingoes , he was of low note among their warriors . Enterprise and good luck gave him , at last , complete sway over the fighting men ;  --  that 's every thing , when a nation is in a ferment , and the successful upstart is active , cruel and cunning . But what has it made him ? Why , the usurping king of a people who murdered their true king , because they would have no king ; and the pillaging protector of some trembling neighbours , whom he forces to say , come and shoot one half of us , that the survivors may thank you for putting their property under your clutches . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug I happen to be his secretary of state , for all that ; so I must do my duty  --  and , in my official capacity , see what I have drawn up as my first maiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Factory , at the mouth of the Senegal . Mad . Madiboo Well , let me gather all the intelligence I can , before I quit you  --  but , be quick . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Do n't hurry a cabinet minister ; it will spoil your preferment . No merchant has been up the country lately , and his majesty is out of paper ; so I wrote my official letter on a bit of slate , and here is the copy . Pulls out a pocket-book . I commanded the state messenger to be very careful not to spit on the despatches , for fear of rubbing them out . Mad . Madiboo Let me hear them . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug A little patience , as I used to say to my creditors . I always took in the Gazette , at Snow-hill , and by conning it over , this kind of job comes as smooth as a bit of polished ivory . Mad . Madiboo Begin . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug I 'm going . Reads from the pocket-book . " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that his majesty Demba Sego Jalla , the " Mandingo king of Kassan , whose important " cares of state have never afforded him leisure " to learn to write ,  --  has taken many prisoners " now on sale .

Henry Augustus Mug Why did n't you scamper off towards the desert ? for I hear all have run there who were not taken prisoners . Pray , Mr. Madiboo , if I may make so bold to inquire , what 's become of your mama ?  --  your mother ? Mad . Madiboo What 's that to you ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Frightened . Oh dear , nothing at all . I did n't mean to be impertinent ; but only to make my kind inquiries after the health of the good family . Mad . Madiboo I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often divulge the serious secrets of those they would serve , and bring them into calamity , without intending it . Farewell , white man ! I hope we may meet again : I owe you much , much gratitude.  --  Oh , Mahomet ! can the heart receive more thrilling transport than this basket will afford me , by preserving the dear , dear life of her who gave me my own . Exit . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug He 's off  --  and what 's very uncommon , has taken with him , without fee or reward , all that a secretary of state had to give , to the utmost satisfaction of the donor . I 'll go back to the camp , with a clear conscience and an empty stomach . SONG . By trade I 'm a turner , and Mug it is my name , To buy a lot of ivory to Africa I came ; I met a trading blackamoor , a woolly old humbug  --  He coax 'd me up his land , and made a slave of Mr. Mug . Crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , wo n't you come , Mr. Mug ? My skin is lily white , and the color here is new , So the first man they sold me to , he thump 'd me black and blue : The Priest who bought me from him , in a tenderhearted tone , Said , come from that great blackguard 's house , and walk into my own . Crying wo n't you , &c.; Good lack ! but to behold the vicissitudes of fate ; I 'm his black Mandingo majesty 's white minister of state . For hours in my lobby my petitioners shall stay , And wish me at the devil , when I hold my levee day . Crying wo n't you , &c.; Exit . SCENE III . A Wood .  --  A rude shelter is seen among the trees , which Darina 's sons have formed as a temporary residence for their mother . Torribal comes forward from the shelter , supporting Darina .

Torri . Torribal Mother  --  mother ! Do n't talk so : you cut my very heart . Here rest upon this bank . Places her on it . Madiboo loiters.  --  And as for Selico  --  Let me look out . Looks out . Not , not a soul appearing !  --  As for Selico , Though we are brothers , should we meet again , I 'd cast him from me , as  --  Dar . Darina Hold , Torribal ! No words of bitterness among my sons .

I 've woe enough ; spare me the grief of hearing One of my children vilify the other . Torri . Torribal Have I offended you ? Tenderly , and kneeling by her , at the bank . Dar . Darina Pressing his hand . You are too sudden . Man , the commanding wonder of the creation , Has , like the insect , his allotted time To do his task , and perish . Brief the span , In which he reckons up these several claims ; Parents , wife , children , sisters , brethren , friend  --  And sometimes more , crowding at once upon him ; Besides the common social ties , that smooth Life 's road , and gently slope it to the grave .

Torribal Your reprimand Weighs heavy on me ;  --  my anxiety , In your distress , must plead my pardon . Kisses her hand . Hark ! A footstep ! Looks out . Ha ! ' t is Selico ! Darina rises . But bearing nothing with him . Mournfully . Aside . Still no food ! If we have no relief , before to-night She 'll surely perish . Enter Selico . Sel . Selico I am here again , To his mother .

Selico I left my brother , Just at the outskirts of our ruin 'd town , Resolv 'd to bring you food , if food were in it : But I could find none . Torri . Torribal Could not ? Chilling news ! Dar . Darina ' T was not on that account that I inquir 'd What has befall'n ; it was  --  Sel . Selico Distressed . I know ;  --  I know . Dar . Darina Tell me of  --  Sel .

Darina Selico , You torture me : their fate is certain ! Speak ; Have they escaped ? Sel . Selico Not so . Torri . Torribal Conceal 'd within the town , then ; And like ourselves , in want of sustenance . Sel . Selico No , Torribal , not that . Torri . Torribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selico Ay ;  --  Brother , you faulter ; what then must I feel , When I pronounce  --  they 're butcher 'd by the enemy ! Darina turns aside with her hands to her face , and totters to the bank . Torri . Torribal But are you sure of this ? Sel . Selico Too certain ! Fearing That I might shock my mother with a token , Which , if display 'd , might break the news at once , Within the hollow of a tree , I hid ( Before I came in view ) Farulho 's mantle . How I obtain 'd it ; how it has convinc 'd me Both the poor souls have perish 'd , pr'ythee , brother , Let Madiboo inform you ; he knows all ;  --  And spare me the relation . Torri . Torribal Selico , I fear that I have sometimes seem 'd unkind ; Forgive me  --  ' t is my nature to be rough ; But I  --  in short we never know how much We love a friend , till he is in affliction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my mother ? I have brought provisions . Torri . Torribal Oh , welcome , welcome ! Mad . Madiboo Pushing by him . There 's no time for welcome ; For here 's the dinner waiting . Where is  --  oh ! She 's there . How fares it , mother ? Courage ! see , Here 's something to restore you . Cheerly now ! Into the shed , and eat . Helping her from the bank . Dar . Darina You 'll all partake ? Mad . Madiboo Oh , as for me , knowing there was enough I snack 'd as I kept running on the road . Torri . Torribal And the shed 's small ; let Selico go with you  --  I 'll wait  --  for he , I fear , has fasted longest . Mad . Madiboo Now , Torribal , that 's kind  --  why , Selico ! Selico , from the time of Madiboo 's entrance , has appeared abstracted and lost in thought . Sel . Selico Starting , and running to Darina . I had forgot ,  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaning on him . My poor unhappy boy ! Selico and Darina enter the shed . Mad . Madiboo Unhappy boy ? What did she mean by that ? Torri . Torribal Why , she knows all : Farulho and his daughter both are dead . Mad . Madiboo Then Selico has told her :  --  that was wrong ; She 's weak ; such news came too abruptly on her . Torri . Torribal Not as he utter 'd it : he would have strangled Affliction in his breast ; she wrung it thence By eager questions : first , he rear 'd his head , Lofty in sorrow , like an aspen struck By thunderbolts ; till trembling at her breath , He whisper 'd out his woe so mournfully , That , were it not for shame , I could have wept Worse than the softest wench in Africa . Mad . Madiboo Do n't think a tear too weak on strong occasions . A sniveller 's whimpering fills sorrow 's puddles ; But when a firm man weeps , each drop 's a diamond . Torri . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find another settlement . Mad . Madiboo I 'm sure it will , unless we hit upon something , Upon the sudden . Torri . Torribal Ay , but what ? Mad . Madiboo I know not . But this I know  --  there 's nothing in the town That 's worth a second venture ; and where else Is there a chance ? Torri . Torribal No where ; and we must starve . Mad . Madiboo Not if we can help it , still we 'll struggle . Torri . Torribal I see no struggle we can have , but one ; And that is heart-breaking ;  --  we must sit down By our poor mother 's side , and see her die , A day or two before us . Mad . Madiboo Here comes Selico . Let us consult with him how to proceed . Enter Selico , from the shed . Sel . Selico Our mother sleeps : food , after painful fasting , Has lull 'd her to repose . Mad . Madiboo Come hither , then . This meal , which the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ; but fortune will not send The white man every day . Have you reflected About a fresh supply , when this is gone ? Sel . Selico I dread to think of it . Mad . Madiboo That 's worse than folly . Our inactivity is certain death To her , and all of us . Torri . Torribal We must do something . Sel . Selico Name it . Mad . Madiboo Ay , there 's the point that puzzles us . For we are girded by the enemy ; And we have neither weapons of attack , Nor any instruments , to gain a livelihood By hunt or tillage : in a little time too , The winter rains set in ; and should that season O'ertake us here , before a stock 's laid up , There 's nothing but a miracle can save us . Torri . Torribal Suppose their camp should break up shortly ; that Would leave us ranging room . Mad . Madiboo Suppose a dinner , A day too late , popt under dead men 's noses ; That would refresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disperse . Mad . Madiboo Not yet awhile . There 's business that will take at least ten days  --  The English merchants are invited up , To buy the slaves and prisoners . Sel . Selico Quickly . Is that certain ? Mad . Madiboo They are expected in the camp to-day . Sel . Selico Ay !  --  then my mother shall be rich tomorrow . Torri . Torribal How , Selico ? Sel . Selico I 'll be a slave  --  Sell me . The traffic , we well know , is horrible , But money will preserve her ; she shall have This body 's value ; and , for once , the trader Shall be humane , although without his knowledge , By purchasing a son , to save a mother . Mad . Madiboo That son shall be myself . Sel . Selico No . Torri . Torribal Hold a little .

Let us decide By lots who shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother ; For mine is cast already  --  more unhappy I can not be ; my early hope is gone . I breathed in the soft spring of my desire , Upon the sweetest violet that ever Disclos 'd its fragrant loveliness to Heaven ; Untimely tempest nipp 'd the modest flower , And the world 's garden is , to me , a desert . Mad . Madiboo This must not be . Sel . Selico It must ; and you shall lead me Into the camp ;  --  ' twill not be difficult To mingle in the crowd , and find some merchant Willing to strike the bargain . Mad . Madiboo Horrid bargain ! You make my blood run cold . I can not do it What , sell my brother ? Sel . Selico To preserve your parent . Had we agreed , as Torribal proposed , Still one had done this office for the other . Torri . Torribal Then let it be my lot . Sel . Selico I 'll not consent . You two are heart-whole ; wretched as I am , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : To Madiboo . Or , by our prophet ! I will seek the camp Alone , and having found a purchaser , Trust to some chance to send you back the money . Hark ! there 's our mother stirring  --  We must part ! Say we go out to forage . Mad . Madiboo Torribal , what can I do ? Torri . Torribal Very mournfully . It must be as he says . Sel . Selico Let me embrace her for the last , last time , And leave her , then , for ever ! Mad . Madiboo I shall choke . Darina appears at the opening of the shed . Dar . Darina Torribal , how you stay ! you must be faint ; Pr'ythee come in and eat . Torri . Torribal I come , directly . Sel . Selico And we , dear mother , now must leave you . Dar . Darina Coming forward . Leave me ! So soon , my son ? Sel . Selico Yes , to seek more provisions . Dar . Darina Selico , you exert beyond your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Madiboo So do I. Dar . Darina Persuade him , Madiboo . Mad . Madiboo He will go , mother . Sel . Selico I must  --  farewell ! Dar . Darina Must we say that ? Farewell ! There 's a something about my heart , that makes This parting wondrous heavy . Sel . Selico To Torribal , aside . My dear brother , May you live long happy . Presses his hands ; then turns to Darina . One kiss ;  --  still one : May Heaven shield and bless you , mother ! Now I 'm ready : onwards . Exeunt Selico and Madiboo ; Torribal and Darina go into the shed . SCENE IV . The Camp of Demba Sego Jalla , Mandingo king of Kassan . Enter Mug , and several Mandingo Warriors . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Pray , black generals , brigadiers , majors , colonels and captains , keep your distance . I am secretary at war , and it is not pretty to press so strongly upon cabinet questions . 1 War . 1st Warrior Our prisoners are lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European merchants will come to purchase them . All . All Ay , ay  --  that 's all . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug But his majesty has commanded me not to let you know the time . 1 War . 1st Warrior Why ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Because you are all so greedy , you would run out of the camp to meet them , and forestall the market ;  --  besides , nothing but a verbal message has been given . 2 War . 2d Warrior We do n't believe it . Read the letter sent by the Factory , that states the day when they will arrive . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Thus far I am free to reply to the gallant general in the black countenance , who spoke last . The finances of the country , from our late glorious victory , are in a situation that may make us proud ; but I assure the gallant general , that on the subject now under discussion , no authenticated papers ( however loudly they may be called for ) have yet reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I dare say you 'll all drive your internal trade to your own advantage , and your unfortunate black and copper cattle will go at a good price . March is played at a distance . Hark ! Looks out . By the Lord Harry , the merchants are coming already !  --  Run , and draw out your prisoners . The black warriors hurry away . There they are ! in full march ! What a capital procession ! Some on horseback  --  some on oxen  --  and a long lanky jockey , that looks like their leader , is stuck upon a camel .  --  Lord Mayor 's show , on the ninth of November , is nothing to it . The music is heard stronger .  --  The European Merchants appear in procession . Fetterwell , the chief of the merchants , is seated on a camel , attended by six slaves ; Captain Adamant , Marrowbone , Flayall , Grim , and four other Merchants . Fett . Fetterwell To Mug . I say  --  who are you ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Secretary at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kassan . Fett . Fetterwell Are you ? then help me off my camel , and I 'll give you a shilling . Mug helps him off.  --  Damme , but he 's a bone-setter ! The attendants lead off the camel . Are you the person that sent the letter to the Governor at the Factory ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug I was commanded by the king , my master , to write the despatch . Fett . Fetterwell Well , then , you are Henry Augustus Mug ; turner in wood and ivory , when you are in London ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Yes ; and secretary at war , while I 'm in Africa . Fett . Fetterwell Well , master Mug  --  your two professions agree nicely , as the world goes : you are not the first , by many , who has wriggled himself into power , when he has been in the habit of turning . My name is Fetterwell ; long known as a merchant in the slave trade . Here are other gentlemen of my profession . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mug Not to-day : he has got the belly-ache . Fett . Fetterwell A very odd court excuse , for not seeing a sovereign ! But let me introduce my friends , and brother traders .  --  Here 's Mr. Flayall , bound to Barbadoes ;  --  Mr. Grim , going to Jamaica ;  --  young Mr. Marrowbone , once a carcass butcher in Clare-market , but an estate dropping to him in the West India Islands , he now barters for blacks , instead of bargaining for bullocks.  --  Captain Abraham Adamant , who lost his left leg when the inhuman negroes chuck 'd him down the hatchways , for only stowing fifteen in a hammock , in hot weather ;  --  and sundry others . Pray , gentlemen , be known to the secretary . Mar . Marrowbone Pray , Mr. Quisby , how do you think we shall find the market ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Mr. Quisby !  --  Oh , this is the young Jemmy butcher . What d'ye buy , sir ? Mar . Marrowbone Buy ? slaves , to be sure . Mug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a pound to-day ; markets vary  --  Mar . Marrowbone I ca n't see why they should , here . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Ca n't you ? Now supposing you were put up to sale . Mar . Marrowbone Me ? ha ! ha ! that 's droll  --  but what then ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Why , then a calf 's head might fetch more or less to-day than it would to-morrow . Fett . Fetterwell Well , but where are the parties ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug The black generals are arranging their prisoners . Fett . Fetterwell We must make short work of this , as this will be our last venture : for , when I left London , a bill was passing that will kick our business to the devil . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug I am very glad to hear it . The work begins in the natural quarter ; and the stream of freedom flows from the very fountain head of true natural liberty .  --  Here come the generals with their prisoners ; and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , directly . MARCH AND CHORUS . The Mandingo Warriors enter with their Prisoners , and range themselves on the side opposite to the Merchants . Warriors  --  First Party . Warriors First Party March , brave Mandingoes , march ! in triumph shout ! And draw your well-won prisoners out . Solo  --  2nd Warrior . 2d Warrior When Afric conquerors tread the field , Slaves are the harvest battles yield . Chorus . Chorus March ! Warriors , march ! Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Rabbit me , if there is n't my darling short bit of a love , Sutta , among the prisoners . And among his majesty 's own proper lot , too  --  if I could but lay her off , for myself . Fett . Fetterwell A pretty decent show . Mar . Marrowbone Yes ; the women are trick 'd out as gay as a pork-shop on Saturday night , and the men seem tolerably strong . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Now , gentlemen , I must address you in my official capacity  --  so listen . Hem !  --  Gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the king my master to inform you , that it is his majesty 's humane decree , that you may purchase  --  your fellow-creatures  --  but if you steal , or smuggle , a single slave , he will , with infinite regret , put you to death in the tenderest manner imaginable . Fett . Fetterwell The devil he will ! I wish we had n't come here . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug The market will be open a whole week ; at the end of which , if any of you prove defaulters , so great will be his lenity to you , as his customers , that he will give you the choice of your execution  --  of which there are three sorts in this country . You may either be burnt , impaled , or scalded , which ever you think the most agreeable . Fett . Fetterwell This is a damn 'd arbitrary government . Let 's look over the goods .  --  Now take care , my honest respectable friends , not to smuggle , nor steal . They go up the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an English Merchant . Merch . Merchchant He 's of the Foulah tribe , I believe ? Mad . Madiboo Ay . Merch . Merchchant I would not give three mickellies for a slave of his breed  --  they are not reckon 'd so hardy as the black negroes . You 'll get little or nothing for him , now the market is so well stock 'd Good day . Walks away . Sel . Selico They all reject us . What did he offer ? Mad . Madiboo I ca n't tell  --  I forget . My heart sickens at the business . Sel . Selico I fear , brother , my project may not succeed . They do not offer any thing that could support My mother through the winter . Mad . Madiboo No matter . Mahomet forgive me ! But I had almost rather we should all perish . Than you should be the price of our living ; And that I should be employed To carry it home with me . A bustle is heard . Stand aside , Selico ! Something extraordinary has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see us , Or it may lead to a discovery who we are . They retire . Enter Crier , and Africans crowding round him . Africans . Africans Hear him ! hear him ! hear him ! Crier . Crier " Proclamation and reward !  --  Last night , " a man , with his head muffled in his garment , " escaped through the fire of the soldiery , from " the tent of the king 's favorite female prisoner . " Whoever shall bring the offender into his majesty 's " presence , so that he may be punished " with death , shall receive four hundred ounces " of gold . " Exit Crier , and mob following him . Fetterwell and Mug come forward . Fett . Fetterwell That 's a good lot . I 'll take the whole . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug You have pick 'd the prime of the market ; those are the tid-bits of the prisoners , and reserved for his majesty 's own private pocket . Fett . Fetterwell There 's a little short girl among ' em , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Bless her , that 's my Sutta . Has n't she a sweet face ? Fett . Fetterwell Well enough for a blackamoor ; but faces do no work in the West Indies . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug You have a devilish bad taste . I 'd rather have her than all the rest tied up in a bunch . Fett . Fetterwell Why , master Mug , it is my opinion you are fond of that little black pony . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Oh love !  --  You know not , Mr. Fetterwell , its power  --  I do . Fett . Fetterwell Then let me off at a hundred for the whole lot , and I 'll chuck the girl to you as a premium . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Will you ? I 'm naturally honest in office , but the tender passion makes me peculate  --  Done . Fett . Fetterwell Then the lot 's mine . Goes among the slaves . Trundle out , little one , and get a new master . Pushes Sutta out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sutta Oh dear ! who my massa now ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Your own Mug . Sutta , do n't you remember your Henry Augustus ? Sutta . Sutta Ah , massa Mug ! you alive ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Alive ! why I 'm secretary to his Mandingo majesty . Come this way , and I 'll talk to you . Exit with Sutta . Selico and Madiboo come forward . Sel . Selico That was a large reward the crier offer 'd . Mad . Madiboo It was . Sel . Selico ' T would make my mother rich for ever . Mad . Madiboo Ay , but that 's hopeless . Sel . Selico No , not so . Mad . Madiboo Not so ? Sel . Selico No , certainly ; the merchants , you perceive , Just offer that which would prolong existence A few short days  --  Mad . Madiboo To leave us as we were . Come home , dear Selico  --  Come to the woods , And let us trust to fortune . Sel . Selico Never ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will return ; no , never , brother , While I have means ( and hapless as I am ) To save a parent , and the means are offered . Mad . Madiboo What are the means ? Sel . Selico You heard the proclamation . Four hundred ounces , paid at once , in gold , Would be a treasure . Take me to the king ; Drag me before him as the criminal ; Do you receive the offer 'd sum ; depart , Preserve my mother 's life ;  --  leave me to death . Mad . Madiboo Oh , God ! you drive me mad ! Brother  --  dear brother  --  Upon my knees , let me intreat you to hear me ! Sel . Selico I 'm wild , but fix 'd . Mad . Madiboo Think only on the torture . Sel . Selico That may be calculated . She who bore me , Suffer 'd with joy the throes that gave me being ; The pangs I shall endure , to save her life , Will be as short and grateful . Mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll raise the camp ; proclaim myself the culprit , If you refuse . Mad . Madiboo Where would you hurry me ? Sel . Selico That may be calculated . She who bore me , Sel . Selico Go on , my brother ; I am resolute : Towards the king 's camp . Mad . Madiboo You will repent , dear brother ! Sel . Selico Never  --  Set on . Mad . Madiboo I scarce know what I 'm doing . Sel . Selico Go forward . Exeunt ; Selico resolutely dragging off Madiboo , who implores him to desist from his purpose . ACT III . SCENE I. The interior of Demba Sego Jalla 's Tent . He is reclining in African pomp , and surrounded by numerous attendants . MUSIC . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Who was the leader of the guard , last night .

Demba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At your displeasure ? ay . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla No , for your life : You must be certain it is now in danger . Dau . Daucari That is the case whene'er I fight for you ; But no one sees me tremble . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Daucari . You have been negligent upon your post . Dau . Daucari You are my king ; I dare not contradict you . Come hither you ! To one of the attendants . Know you how many years I 've been in battles ? 1 Att. 1st Attendant Thirty , as I 've heard . Dau . Daucari Tell me , in all that time , I once was faulty ; Say so , that I may cry ' t is false , and stab you . Attendant shakes his head , and retires . My king , that fellow , who never flinch 'd in war , Dreads to accuse me , lest I kill a liar . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla You are too bold . Rises , and comes forward in the centre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But innocence , though tyrants reign , is fearless . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Call you me , tyrant ? Dau . Daucari I 'm too politic . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Would you betray me ? Dau . Daucari I am much too loyal . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Skill 'd as you are in warfare , think you not I must be very loth to sentence you To execution ? Dau . Daucari Yes ; I 'm useful to you . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla On that account I 'll spare your life . Dau . Daucari That 's wisdom . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla And for your service past . Dau . Daucari That 's gratitude . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla I placed you , Daucari , to guard a female , Among my slaves of war , whose melancholy ( Death 's havoc done ) look 'd softer than the willow Which graces the wild margin of a lake , And droops o'er recent wrecks . She mourn 'd so mildly , That when her anguish forced a tear to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Time would have soothed her girlish grief , and yielded A willing treasure to me . Your neglect Has let some lover steal to her in darkness She has profaned my tents ; and she shall die . Dau . Daucari You charged me , king , to head the western guard , And not to be a sentinel . I watched not All night , at one tent 's mouth : I did my duty , In visiting the posts ;  --  and when , at dawn , I saw a stranger skulking from your slave ,  --  A cloak before his face ,  --  my order was To fire , but he escaped ;  --  not I , the sentry Was criminal ; he 's punished  --  for I shot him . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Dull fool ! and so prevented all the means Of trying the delinquent , to discover Who ' t was that fled . But the reward that 's offer 'd , May bring detection yet . Begone .

Demba Sego Jalla Tell me what moneys , or what merchandise , You have obtained among the Europeans , In barter for my slaves ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Bless your royal soul , not a halfpenny yet in hand ; we must n't deal with the wholesale traders , as if your majesty kept a chandler 's shop . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla How then ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Oh , let me alone ; I 'm up to business by living in the city ; I have your majesty 's interest at heart . You are my king  --  only be rul 'd by me , and you 'll do . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Christian , your words to me are like your features , So very different from other men , That I both smile and wonder . But explain ; What is a purchase , when no value 's given ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Why , the European merchants are what we call good men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy stock , just as if they were walking into a black Royal Exchange . Some come on camels , some upon oxen ,  --  that 's the way they waddled into the country ;  --  ' t is pretty sure they 'll come down with the dust on settling day , for without that they know your majesty wo n't let ' em waddle out . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla I can not comprehend your methods ! Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Leave it all to me . Little more than a week will finish the job . In the mean time , may it please your black majesty , do n't turn dun ; but as I am now joining the fatigue of chancellor of the exchequer to the labours of secretary at war , I humbly hope you 'll double my emoluments . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Fear not ; you shall have honours . Mug .

Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Now ! speak . Mad . Madiboo I scarce am able ! Aside I have brought A man to die ;  --  do n't let it be by torture .

Demba Sego Jalla One who fled my tents , Under the muskets of my soldiery . Is that the wretch ? Mad . Madiboo He looks at Selico , and then throws himself into his brother 's arms in agony . I am the greatest wretch . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla How ! weeping on his prisoner 's breast ! Sel . Selico Quickly , and speaking over Madiboo 's shoulder . Never wonder ! He is this bosom 's friend , and has betray 'd me . Puts Madiboo gently aside , and proceeds .

Demba Sego Jalla To his attendant , and pointing to Madiboo . Bring him the recompense . Exit attendant . Four hundred ounces , paid to you in gold . ' T is fit I should keep my faith with you , Though you have broken a dear faith with him .

Vivid lightning May strike and melt me ; a false friend 's compunction Is far too weak a fire to make me bend . Enter Attendant with gold . Give him the gold . Mad . receives it with horror . Go ; buy intoxication , And drown your conscience . Guard the prisoner well . Give order in the camp for execution . This day the female slave and he shall die . Exeunt with attendants into the tent ; several remain to guard Selico . Mad . Madiboo Brother ! Sel . Selico Hush ! softly  --  these men , left to guard me : Will overhear us . Mad .

But do not , brother , let her see you weep . 2 Att. 2d Attendant To Madiboo . You must be gone . Mad .

If they have made my Selico a slave ; And if the conqueror  --  Torri . Torribal He will not bear you . Dar . Darina Not hear me ! The worst of Africans have hearts ; And surely , all who drain 'd their mother 's milk , Imbibed some pity for a mother 's feelings . Oh ! when she clings about a conqueror 's knee , And cries " restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To you a trifle , but to me the world ! " If he be deaf to that , his infancy Spurn 'd human breasts , to suckle with a tiger . Torri . Torribal I was to blame , when I confided to you One word of this . Dar . Darina Confided ! that you did not : I drew it from you . Very few conceive A mother 's quickness for her absent child . If she inquire of one who saw him last , How ' t is he fares , a look , nay , half a look , Alarms her ; and a hesitating speech Is almost confirmation somewhat 's wrong . Go onward , son  --  if you refuse to guard me , Why , let it be so ;  --  I 'm a poor weak woman ; But still maternal love will give me strength To trawl to the king 's camp , to save your brother . Torri . Torribal Wherever you go , I go ; should you rush Down cataracts , you 'll find me by your side  --  Stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter Madiboo , carrying the gold . Mad . Madiboo Who 's there ? Torri . Torribal Friends . Mad . Madiboo Torribal ! can it be you ? Torri . Torribal Yes . Mad . Madiboo And my mother , too !  --  how happens this ? Torri . Torribal She will go to the camp . Mad . Madiboo Shuddering . Oh no , no , no ! Dar . Darina I will go thither . Mad . Madiboo What a scene of horror . Aside . Dar . Darina No power shall prevent me . What is that You bear about you ? Mad . Madiboo Gold , dear mother ; gold  --  Enough to give you affluence for ever . Dar . Darina Then to prolong my life a scanty term , Which nature soon must end , you sold your brother Mad . Madiboo I wish I had . Dar . Darina You wish you had !  --  what 's done ? Torri . Torribal Taking Madiboo apart . I do not understand you , Madiboo . What has been done ? Mad . Madiboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the sum you carry there ? Mad . Madiboo In gold four hundred ounces . Torri . Torribal Not for the purchase of one slave ? Inform me , How came you by it ? Mad . Madiboo Do not question me . If any means can keep her from the camp , Let us restrain her . Torri . Torribal You are agitated . Mad . Madiboo Distracted , brother ! almost heart-broken . Another time I 'll tell you all ; at present My heart 's too full . Keep her away ; pray , Torribal , Keep her away ! I am too weak , I can not . Torri . Torribal Dear mother , let 's return . Dar . Darina I never will . Mad . Madiboo You know not what you go to see . Dar . Darina My child ! In sickness  --  health  --  in slavery  --  in death  --  Mad . Madiboo Shuddering . Death ! Dar . Darina Ay ; even in the agonies of death , A mother clings around her child . Mad . Madiboo Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Darina Forward , sons ! I am resolved . She runs out ; and Madiboo and Torribal follow her . SCENE III . The Camp of the Mandingo King ; in which are seen the preparations for execution . Two piles of fagots , one on each side of the stage , for the purpose of burning the criminals ; with various implements of torture . Selico is discovered , guarded by Executioners . A crowd is collected to witness the execution . Sel . Selico Nay , do not torture me before my time . Your king is not arriv 'd , who is to witness My parting agonies  --  then stand aloof , Ye lowest ministers who execute The sentences of power ! How need must warp Poor human nature , when a man turns jailer . For no one , sure , first made it his election , To live upon his fellow creature 's sorrows  --  And , oh ! how flinty must his office make him . If , when his petty sway might mitigate The prisoner 's wo , he doubles it , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 2 Ex. 2d Executioner Yes ;  --  Yonder the partner of your crime will die . Sel . Selico Poor soul !  --  poor wretch ! Death in a conqueror 's camp , Is swift in visitation ; gives no time , As oft he will round pallets of the sick , For leave-takings , and kindly offices ;  --  Else would I strive to calm her flutter 'd spirit , ( Whoe'er she be , ) support the sinking trembler . And cheer her with a fellow sufferer 's firmness. 2 Ex. 2d Executioner Coming forward to him . Prisoner , our faiths are different : few Mandingoes . Profess your creed , and follow Mahomet . You think me cruel , from my trade : You wrong me . If , in the camp , there 's a Mahometan You wish to pray by you , I 'll try to find And bring him hither . Sel . Selico Thank you , heartily .  --  There 's no religion , as I think , on earth , In which weak man can not exclaim ,  --  the worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , while I glow with charity for all , My heart , I trust , howe'er it pours a prayer , May , at the last , procure my Maker 's mercy . 2 Ex. 2d Executioner Say , can I serve you ? Sel . Selico No , good fellow ; no  --  But I am grateful . Step aside , and let me Pray for myself . The executioner retreats some paces , and Selico kneels . Dear spirit of my murder 'd love ! if ever It be allowed mortality to soar Into the breast of Heaven , and look down On what is left below ,  --  behold me meet Death 's agony in smiles . We soon may wander In airy blessedness : no battle-ax Can sunder love in those pure realms of bliss ; No ravagers of war can butcher age , And pinch with famine  --  Prophet Mahomet , Now waft the words I am about to utter , To thy dread Master 's throne ! Bless , bless my mother . Scorn not my prayer , though coming from the mouth Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ! Rises . Muffled drum .  --  A flourish . 2 Ex. 2d Executioner Hark ! the king approaches . Enter Demba . Sega Jalla , and his Attendants . Music plays as they march down the lines of the camp ; and the king places himself on an elevated seat , prepared for him , that he may witness the execution . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Criminal , some have murmur 'd ' t is my nature To be too lavish in decrees of death ; They say I wanton in the shedding blood : Therefore I come , that you , yourself , may own Your sentence just . Sel . Selico More just than merciful . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Can justice , then , be call 'd unmerciful ? Sel . Selico Justice and Mercy are distinct ; when join 'd , ' T is sweet to see the mild companion smooth Its stern associate 's brow ; and when the sword Is lifted , smilingly present the sheath . Atrocious guilt can hope for no indulgence ; But there are cases , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he condemns . And therefore , when a king has power to sentence , He might remember he has power to pardon . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla You stole into my camp ; the laws of war Pronounce it death . Sel . Selico Ay , if I came a spy ; But you have sentenced me on other grounds . I skulk 'd not hither , o'er my native plain , That smokes with fire , and blood , to carry back A vain intelligence to carcasses . You dread no spy from towns you have subdued , For there your plan is to exterminate . Your mode of warfare murders even infants At shuddering womens ' breasts , and silences All fears of a reprise , by butchery . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Bold wretch : you were received within the tent Of her , who heard my love , and then disdain 'd it ; My favorite slave of war ; my guard beheld you . Sel . Selico He who is above all guards , beheld you tear All of your slaves of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared you . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Mine is the right of conquest . Sel . Selico Conquest 's right , Gives a true hero the delightful power Of showing conquest 's generosity . And what 's your right ? A battle gives it you . What are the ties of those you pluck asunder ? Why , time and sympathy have knotted them : And should you die instead of some you separate , It might be better justice . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Witness , soldiers , Your king 's forbearance : witness how I bear These taunts with patience . Sel . Selico Oh , mild murderer ! Every ally you plunder , owns your meekness . Specious destroyer ! amiable despot ! Domestic creature of the tiger breed , Who pur upon your prey before you kill it . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla To the attendant . Prepare for execution .  --  To Selico . You have violated The laws of a warrior 's camp , and you must suffer . Bring in the female prisoner . 1 Att. 1st Attendant She 's here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side support her  --  a veil is over her face  --  she appears trembling  --  Guards follow her . Selico 's face is averted , contemplating the pile whereon he is to suffer . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Throw off the captive 's veil .  --  She knows her fate . Ber . Berissa Removing the veil . I do ; and though I tremble , am resign 'd . Sel . Selico Starting . Did I hear right ? her voice !  --  It can not be  --  Turning suddenly round . Berissa ! She utters a piercing shriek . Still alive !  --  My love ! my love ! He runs to her , and they fall into each others arms . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla To his guards . Force them apart .  --  Woman ! one cutting outrage Man 's pride endures , is when his love is scorn 'd By her he knelt to , whom he might command ; And she insults him to his face , by lavishing Her fondness on his rival . ' T is refinement Of female insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the body 's torture . Ber . Berissa Hear me ! and I attest my holy prophet ; While bending o'er the awful brink of death ! I swear ( and would in my last lingering pang ) Though one was in my tent , that was not he . Pointing to Selico Sel . Selico Apart . That 's truly sworn ; but proves her false as wantons . Oh , mother , mother ! ' t is for you alone I now should wish to die . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla I am not fool 'd By female oaths . Did he not , e'en this instant , Rush to your arms , while fervently you clasp 'd him ? Nay , has he not himself made full confession ? Captive ! you who disdain 'd your conqueror 's love ; You , whom I sued to share dominion with me  --  What motive , now , in daring to deny The guilt of your accomplice ? Think you , then , To save him ?  --  If he be not culpable , Then name the criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name him ! Ber . Berissa Mark , king ! this man 's impetuosity To hear the culprit named , may speak him guiltless . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla That 's doubtful : You can clear the mystery . Ber . Berissa Had I a thousand lives , and ev'ry life Condemn 'd to twenty thousand agonies , I never would divulge the secret . Conqueror , I ought not , and I will not . But remember , When you approach 'd me with your selfish passion , ( Selfish I call it , for you urged a mourner ) I then avow 'd my heart no longer mine . I dared not utter falsehood : think you now I dare advance it , dying ?  --  I repeat it , Innocent blood will lie upon your soul , If he be sacrificed . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Truth seems to gush As purely from those lips , as bubbling streams Forced from the fairest fountain . No , no , no ; You slave himself avow 'd it . Set each pile On fire , and lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with torches ; two go to each pile and remain behind them , while the other Executioners prepare to bind them to the stakes . Sel . Selico King  --  if one corner in the human heart E'er held a drop of pity for the dying , Grant me one word with my poor fellow sufferer . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla You scarce deserve it : let them speak together . Selico and Berissa come forward to each other . Sel . Selico Berissa ! how I lov 'd you know : How you Have loved I doubt . Ber . Berissa That doubt , dear Selico , Is worse than any agonies of death . Sel . Selico Is it indeed ? Ber . Berissa Indeed ! oh , if there be a secret I dare not tell , e'en you , at such a moment , From the whole course of our pure simple love , Why should you think me faithless ? But inform me How you came hither ? Sel . Selico We have not now the time . Ber . Berissa Say , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sel . Selico No ; do not , love ; your words are holy writ ; They 're balm to me : forgive my suspicions ; Your affirmation 's every thing . Oh , love ! This scene  --  Drum rolls . We part  --  farewell ! Both . Both Farewell ! farewell ! They proceed to the places where they are to suffer ; at this moment a noise is heard in the camp . Farulho rushes in , speaking as he enters . Far . Farulho I will press forward , ere it be too late . Prostrates himself before the king . King ! king ! in me behold the real culprit ; A poor old man , who strove to steal his daughter . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Your daughter ! Far . Farulho Yes , that wretched girl is mine . ' T was I that sought her tent ; ' t was I escaped The muskets of her guard ; she tried , in vain , To follow her old father . Take your victim ; Save him , who is not guilty  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ) for whom I only wish to live ,  --  my darling child ! Demba . Demba Sego Jalla To the guards . Release them for a while . The prisoners come from the stakes . Ber . Berissa But for a while ! Then let me snatch this moment to embrace My dear , dear father . Far . Farulho Embracing her . Oh ! my child , my child ! Demba . Demba Sego Jalla To Selico . Say , why did you avow yourself the culprit ? Sel . Selico Conqueror , to you , who make mens ' dwellings ashes , Domestic tales of wo , that follow triumphs , Will not be pleasing . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Speak , I need not say Speak boldly , you have spoken so already . Sel . Selico The dying , wrung with griefs , will use some license Towards those that wring them . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla You had an accuser , Who brought you to the camp . Sel . Selico He was my brother . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , you little think On all that war , in its extremity Inflicts on nature . You approach 'd with fire , When peaceful joy was throbbing in our breasts ; When I was leading my loved bride to mosque . She 's there , the daughter of this good old man , Our Priest , revered by all . I thought them dead ; For in my search I found two headless bodies Clad in their outward garments . Far . Farulho Did you so ? Alas , then , two poor faithful souls have perish 'd . In zeal for me and mine , my honest servant Descried me ,  --  " Fly , dear master , fly ! give me Your mantle  --  I am youngest ; and your daughter Shall exchange her dress with mine ; and if they dare Invade this sacred place , I 'll pass myself Upon them for the priest : then should they battle I am more stout than you  --  my girl less timid Than your dear tender child ; "  --  and so we fled : But still I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp ;  --  and my poor servants Have fallen the victims of their love for us . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla I know not what there is about my heart , That stirs me thus . In all my victories , No tale of sorrow which I ever heard Touch 'd me so near as this . To Selico . Tell me  --  when you conceived these people dead , Why were you rendered as a criminal ; And by your brother , too ? Sel . Selico To save a mother From perishing with hunger , whom your wars Had driven to the woods . The sum you offer 'd , I knew would snatch her from the pangs of famine To affluence ; and I inforced my brother To drag me hither , as the sacrifice . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla And knew she of this ? Sel . Selico No . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Her name ? Sel . Selico Darina . Darina without . Dar . Darina Guards , give way  --  and let me to your king . Sel . Selico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have told her all . Darina rushes in , and throws herself at the king 's feet  --  Torribal and Madiboo following her . Dar . Darina Pity a mother , king ! and spare my son . Torri : Torribal Mother , be calm ; ' t is not the way to soothe . Mad . Madiboo Let her alone ; a mother 's cries will penetrate Into a heart of flint : let her alone . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Rise  --  your suspense shall soon be over . Is there An European merchant in our lines . Merch . Merchchant Comes forward . Here . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Now , merchant , have you attended to this process ? Merch . Merchchant I have . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla Then pr'ythee tell me  --  you Of wisdom and experience  --  you , who boast A country , as they say , more civilized By far , than mine  --  at how much would you rate A man like this ? Pointing to Selico . Merch . Merchchant For his uncommon virtues At full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll double that , And give it his Berissa ; she shall have them , And not to purchase , but to marry him . Selico and Berissa fall at Demba 's feet Nay , rise , my heart was never mov 'd till now . Mad . Madiboo Dancing and singing . My dear mother ! My dear brother :  --  my dear good Priest ! Oh , Mahomet ! I am so happy , I shall jump Out of my skin ! Singing . Enter Mug , with a long written paper in his hand , and Sutta under his arm . Mug . Henry Augustus Mug May it please your majesty , I have drawn up a petition ; which , as you never learn 'd your ABC , according to our English fashion , I will make bold to read to you . Demba . Demba Sego Jalla What is it , white man ? Mug . Henry Augustus Mug Why , I have just heard of some poor condemn 'd folks , who were formerly my friends ; and as they have not murder 'd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highways , it 's very hard if a secretary of state has n't interest to bring them off . Looks round . Eh ! oh Lord ! I see by your countenances ' t is all settled already  --  Oh , my dear old master ! To Farulho . Lord , Mr. Madiboo , how are you , and all the rest of your family , after your confounded fright ? Sel . Selico Come , love ! my dear Berissa , come ! My mother ! My father who is soon to be !  --  Alas ! We have been sorely wrung . Ber . Berissa But we can say , Whatever we endured , ' t was virtue 's trial . Sel . Selico And oh ! how sweet when , after virtue 's struggle , We lay our hands upon our heart , and cry , We suffer 'd Heaven 's scourge with resignation , And resignation is repaid with bliss .
