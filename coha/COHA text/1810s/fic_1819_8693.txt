" The rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance . "  --  Prospero. ( in the Tempest . ) PREFACE . THE original object in the composition of the following Play , was the vindication of the character and conduct of Lorenzo D'Medici , from the calumnies of Alfieri , in his tragedy , called " The conspiracy of the Pazzi . " According to Lord Byron , " Alfieri is the bard of freedom . " How can his claim to such a title be reconciled with the injustice he has done to the liberal and accomplished Juliano ; or with the pains he has taken to represent the Pazzi , as the assertors of liberty , when history has shown them to be the bribed conspirators against their country 's independence ? We read with more pleasure his lordship 's encomium on the the great and virtuous Machiavelli  --  and humbly join in the tribute of admiration , although , " Tanto nomini nullum par eulogium . " I was soon , however , obliged to abandon the object above named : for truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could not , without perverting facts , have formed incident and character , or that unity of design and execution , so necessary for effect upon the stage . Still , in the chronology of " Alberti , " and some of its allusions as well as names , the traces may yet be seen of my first design . But I was obliged to invent a story ; Revenge , I found , had been fully exemplified in Zanga , Bertram , Fitzharding , Pescara , &c.; The passion , from being human had become unnatural ; and in modo et figura , had been exhausted . I thought . ( perhaps presumptuously ) that the portraiture of a being of somewhat more virtuous feeling , might be made to answer all the purposes of the dramatic muse . The stage has been so often made an arena for slaughtering gladiators , a scene for horrors , ( and , I regret to say , som etimes for impiety ) that if I have failed to elicit moral feeling from the struggles of natural passion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least never regret having made the attempt . Nature has been my guide ; and as far as I was able , I have followed her glowing footsteps . But who has not found it much easier to conceire , than to execute what is excellent ? An objection is made against this piece , which I readily admit . It has neither thunder , lightning , assassination , banditti , battles , scenery , nor song to recommend it . Probably my aim was higher , or my taste not exactly conformable to the admirers of Melo-Dramatic extravganza . Another objection has been started , namely , that to have rendered the catastrophe completely striking , Antonia should have destroyed herself in the second scene of the fifth act . I am aware that suicide , ( dramatically speaking is quite the fashion ; and that a species of atheistico poetical refinement has lately usurped the place of many of our vulgar notions . But  --  if I am allowed to know any thing concerning beings of my own creation  --  I can assure the reader , ( who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up religiously and morally ; and , however unhappy she might have been , she reflected too correctly to have ever contemplated such an act . It is hoped that the reader will take my word for this . The last objection against " Alberti "  --  is the most formidable  --  it is an American production ! To this charge . ( as I do not know how to get over it ) I must plead guilty . I have even the hardihood openly to acknowledge , nay , be proud of the accident of birth , which has placed me under the pretection of laws that I revere , and in the bosom of a century that I love . It is surely time for transatlantic critics to borrow the assistance of " sweet oblivion , " and allow her to soften down those feelings and prejudices which have grown out of past hostilities . To regard the place of an author 's birth as necessarily connected with the merits or demerits of his production  --  to view him through that medium alone , in which smoky war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very spirited and very national ; but it would be rather difficult to convince the world , that Criticism , under such banners , can be either just , useful , or liberal Some emissions in the representation have been restored , and some verbal alternations made . The play is now before the public as I would wish it in future to be performed  --  that is , if it have vital spirit enough to out-live a few seasons . For the friendly exertions and talent displayed by the Charleston Corps Dramatique , in the performance of Alberti , I return my sincere acknowledgements . For the very flattering manner in which it was received by my fellow citizens , and particularly for its being honoured with the presence of the chief magistrate of the Union  --  I can only say , that I wish my humble production were more worthy of the approbation they were pleased to bestow .

De Courcy But why so sad when all around you smiles : This sunny climate and elastic air Give me a flush of spirits , I could wish To see reflected in my friend . Ippo . Ippolita Ah me ! It is my father 's humor that comes o'er me . Seldom he lets me feel the happiness Of one warm pressure to his marble bosom  --  And yet it is not marble ; my affection Vouch 'd in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For I have seen him weep to look upon me , And tears are signs of tenderness . De Co . De Courcy In truth , The time is short , since sent by good king Lewis , Footnote : 1Kb I came as envoy to your polish 'd Florence ; And tho ' yet stranger to your politics , Your civil broils , your wars  --  Alberti 's name Is heard beyond the Alps  --  his martial deeds , His chivalry and skill ; they say he 's fierce As Mars , when in his army 's van ; in council Another Pericles . This man is your father ; You must be proud of him .  --  Where is he now ? Ippol . Ippolita The troubles of Italy , his own restless spirit Both carry him abroad ; but every moment Does Florence look for her Alberti 's presence To save her from invasion . De Co . De Courcy Where 's your great citizen Lorenzo D'Medici , the magnificent ? Ippol . Ippolita At Naples to negociate with the king  --  But with what chance I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold ; He 'll find it . Sit , a powerful politician , A mighty army and a host of friends , ' Twill make your kings and ministers quite gentle . And though he be not sprung of royal blood , Let him pay royally  --  he 's right legitimate . But , come , Ippolito , my early friend , Since we first read together in old Pisa I 've not forgotten thee . Art thou in favour here ? Ippol Ippolita I think I am . Lorenzo 's bounty brought me To fair Antonia , count Ridolpho 's daughter , And I am proud to think it is his wish That I should woo her  --  O , propitious hour , That made me instrumental to his safety ! O , fatal hour , that let me see her beauty ! De Co . De Courcy Why how is this ? think you she 'll not be woo 'd ? Ippol . Ippolita Ah , ' t is not that  --  I trust her heart is mine  --  For we have breath 'd our sighs , exchanged our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Lorenzo 's wish that I should marry  --  Marry Antonia  --  his looks were full of horror , And he forbids me even visit there . De Co . De Courcy Why this is stranger still . Not wed Antonia ! The high born , young and beauteous Antonia ! What 's his objection ? Ippol . Ippolita Alas , I know not . De Co . De Courcy Ippolito , that I do love thee , I have prov 'd . How can I serve thee ? Were it not the glance , And sudden resolution of your eye  --  There 's in thee nothing like the stern Alberti . His iron features seem bent up and settled Upon some single purpose of his soul . Ippol . Ippolita That thought has often crost me . I have watch 'd The smile of patience on his lips , when toil And parching heat upon the plains of Italy Have melted down the hardiest of his troops . Then he was dazzling , great ; his mind and body Form 'd for stern war , and hazardous achievemont . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've seen him sit and meditate ; the while , Flashes of anger  --  aye , and traits of mercy Came mantling o'er his face  --  that noble face , Like some pure stream reflecting every object ;  --  And during this contention of his soul He 'd mutter " count Ridolpho "  --  as tho ' he would Grind that hard name to atoms .  --  Yet , my friend , This mood but rarely visits him . De Co . De Courcy Why then no matter . Keep frowns within doors , so the sun shines abroad . Antonia 's smile , Antonia 's voice awaits thee . Ippol . Ippolita Ah , that sweet voice ! behold her at the harp  --  Her sylphid figure bending o'er the murmurs Made by her fingers ' pressure . Awhile she muses , As if to wait the power of inspiration  --  But when she tosses back her clustering hair , Lifts her bright forehead ( like chaste Dian 's crescent From veiling clouds ) and liquid sighs , not words , Come mingled with her music  --  how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is a rapture , Breathless , motionless ! De Co . De Courcy Entranced no doubt ! There 's witchery in the damsel . She will dance Down the gay throng , as if her fairy step Disdain 'd the earth : the sight was dazzled by her : She was all grace , all luxury of motion ; He limbs were very pinions , and her drapery Like the light clouds evolving to the eye , That break in glory from the silver east . Come , let us to the Count 's . Ippol . Ippolita I go by stealth ; My father interdicts my visits there ; It is forbidden fruit , yet I must taste  --  Tho ' ruin follow . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE SECOND .

Lorenzo D'Medici Nor wherefore he prohibited The marriage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd him on that subject , but he vow 'd If e'er I made an effort to arrive At how , or when , or where he had his knowledge , Or why their union were so perilous To their soul 's peace  --  he 'd quit my sight for ever . And yet to see the strange and deep delight His sympathy , his conference affords me , Rather than part with him , I silent listen As to an oracle ; or if I speak , He acts the confessor ;  --  weeps , prays with me , Tells me be penitent , yet not to hope For full forgiveness . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici When does he visit you ? Ridol . Ridolpho Whenever he 's in Florence . From the camp As rest or leisure calls him . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici Well ;  --  Count Ridolpho , I must unravel this  --  There is some mystery  --  but I know Alberti  --  And tho ' I feel him grappled to my side As the right arm of Florence , I must shake His secret from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hopes for this dear union That knits Ippolito , my young preserver , The son of great Alberti , to thy daughter . Come , Sir , the darkest night must find a morning . Exeunt . SCENE SECOND . A chamber in Alberti 's house . Enter Alberti and Ippolito Alb . Alberti Nay , my Ippolito , it may not be . Ippo . Ippolita Ah , but it must be . Alb . Alberti Must be ! No more . Ippo . Ippolita Antonia loves me . Alb . Alberti What do I hear ! Ippo . Ippolita And I love her with that pure holy fire  --  Alb . Alberti Stop there and go no farther . The holy fire With which philosophers love abstract virtue , Such flame as Petrarch for his Laura burn 'd  --  His Laura was his country , my Ippolito . Ippo . Ippolita I thought ' t was glory , Sir . Alb . Alberti Aye , glory , freedom , every noble thought That centres in the bosom of a patriot . Love these , Ippolito  --  and seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Antonia . Ippo . Ippolita O , teach me Sir , to close my eyes on day ; Teach the bright hues and fragrancies of spring To be no more delightful to my sense ; Tear out my heart and throw it to the flames , Not fiercer than the fires which now consume it  --  Before I hate Antonia ! Alb . Alberti I did not bid you hate her . Love her , then , If thou dost love that word , as other women , With kind regard , but cold and distant state , With friendship , chaste , not warm  --  Ippo . Ippolita Impossible ; All other women are as pictues to me , Mine eyes can glance on them and turn away . But to behold Antonia 's magic smile , To touch her hand , or hear her tongue drop music , And not to love her  --  ' t were a sin against Heaven 's fairest work ! She must be deeply lov 'd , For she was form 'd  --  but thus , upon my knees , I sue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather  --  Rash boy , I 'll hold no more communion with thee . Ippo . Ippolita O , stay my father ! tell me  --  Alb . Alberti Tell me , why thou art lost to all obedience ? Ippo . Ippolita I have been ever dutiful , but here , Duty , my honour 'd father , were a sacrifice Beyond my fortitude . Alb . Alberti Hark ye , Ippolito  --  hark ye , ungrateful boy ! If thou wouldst plant a scorpion in thy bosom To sting thee into madness ; if thou wouldst Pull vengeance on thy head , and on Antonia 's  --  Aye , on her innocent head , vengeance from heaven , Such as the very fiends would weep to see Inflicted on the damn 'd  --  Ippo . Ippolita O hold , in mercy , hold ! Alb . Alberti And since I find This hateful passion wrought within thee thus , That nothing else can pluck it from thy soul , But to unloose my deep and dreadful secret ; Prepare to hear the cause  --  Ippo . Ippolita Aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it blast me ! Alb . Alberti I would have kept it from thee , all in mercy , But thou thyself compellest me to speak  --  Ippo . Ippolita O ! give it utterance ;  --  though every word Stab to my heart , that were some ease , compar 'd To this dark horrible uncertainty . Alb . Alberti Meet me at noon . Ippo . Ippolita Where ? Alb . Alberti In Count Ridolpho 's gardens .  --  Thou dost start That I should mention that forbidden spot  --  But meet me there  --  for there I must unfold A tale will make thee feel how much thy peace Is dear to this sad heart . Mark me , at noon . Until that hour arrive I am call 'd hence On a soul-trying purpose . Fare thee well . Exit . Ippo . Ippolita What darkling horrors swim above my head , And cloud the heavens from me ! Can it be  --  My father love Antonia ! He , my rival ! Yes , yes ; her beauty  --  her all-conquering beauty Melts even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief illimitable ! Can it be ? No , no , I plague myself with horrid dreams  --  He love another ! he whom I have heard Speak of my mother as one enshrin 'd And lock 'd up in his heart ! O , no , my father , I wrong thy constancy . Two hours hence he said , Would that the time were come ; but he has said it , And he makes good all pledges . Enter De Courcy . De Courcy O , my true friend ; my first , my only frie J , I 'd sink beneath the buffets of hard fortune , Had I not thee to lean on . De . Co . De Courcy I ne'er before had sympathy with sadness , But thou wilt change my nature . What , give up Your sunshine exercises , your bold riding , Your hawks and hounds , your brilliant tournaments  --  Nay , every thing but music ;  --  that indeed , You seem to feed upon , as if sweet sounds Could put a spirit in your sluggish blood To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my De Courcy , can I taste those pleasures , When my heart sinks ! The day , or sweeter night , With all the chequer 'd beauties of that hour When lovers court the blessed influence Of love 's bright planet  --  all benignant things Seem but a mockery , a scene which heaven Throws in the sphere and circle of my view , But far beyond my power to touch or feel . De . Co . De Courcy Try them Ippolito ; arouse thyself  --  Ippo . Ippolita I am like one whose orb of sight 's extinguish 'd , To whom you tell the splendours of the sky . De Co . De Courcy Then there 's but one way left . This sunny clime Seems now o'ercast with clouds . So come with me , We 'll visit France and Spain and Mauritania ; So change of place may change this murky humour . Ippo . Ippolita Quit Florence ! De Co . De Courcy T is a malady to thee . Ippo . Ippolita O , it contains my single hope of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And now malicious yet delightful love , That knits together every adverse passion And bids them be at peace , resides not here , But as a guest to agitate his dwelling . Antonia , dear Antonia ! De Co . De Courcy Sits the wind there ? Then I must change my tack . A visit , Signor ? Ippo . Ippolita Whither ? De Co . De Courcy I 'd say to Count Ridolpho 's , but I know That happy isle is planted in a sea Your navigation dare not venture on . Ippo . Ippolita Yet , I will venture ; t is but to forestall By a few moments , that important point Which must disclose my fate . Exeunt . END OF THE SECOND ACT . ACT III . SCENE FIRST . Ridolpho 's Gardens . Enter Ridolpho and Filippo . Ridol . Ridolpho Now , reverend Father , tell me what thou think'st Of this Alberti ? Fil . Filippo My ever honour 'd lord What you have told me of this stranger 's conduct , His midnight visits , and his wond'rous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good Filippo , What form of penitence can cleanse my guilt ! A wife torn from her husband , and that husband My only brother ; a man so full of virtues I should have worship 'd , but I  --  murder 'd him . And then his infant  --  Heaven took that away , That I should have no hope to find its grace , By being a father to it ;  --  and my own son , My dear Cesario lost  --  stolen from my arms ! Fil . Filippo Sir , be comforted . You have a lovely daughter , that sweet bud Breathes in your bosom still . Ridol . Ridolpho But my son , lost ! He must be dead  --  so die my future hopes ! Ridolpho 's ancient name must perish with me  --  I am the last and most unhappy branch Of that proud line of ancestry . And yet Alberti  --  My good or evil genius  --  which , I know not , Tells me my name shall live ! would he were here  --  Fil . Filippo Look my lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Alberti waves his hand for Filippo to retire .  --  Filippo speaks aside . Sure I should know that face . Can it be he ! or do my old eyes deceive me ? I 'll watch and satisfy my heart . Exit . Alb . Alberti Who is that man ? Ridol . Ridolpho Ancient Filippo . Alb . Alberti Indeed , I thought so . Where has he been so long ? Ridol . Ridolpho In prayer and seclusion  --  my confessor . He now is resident in San Marco 's convent , Visits me now and then to mourn with me . And breathe the outward atmosphere . Well he knows My melancholy story . Alb . Alberti Well he should know it . Aside . Ridol . Ridolpho Thou comest to me at mid-day now , Alberti . Hitherto our conference was nightly . Alb . Alberti I am here , Ridolpho , to prepare thy soul  --  The clouds that hang o'er thy disastrous life Shall soon pass off , and truth , like mid-day beams , Shall break upon thee . Ridol . Ridolpho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how believe thee ? Alb . Alberti Look on this face . Mark well the rugged lines , Which care and toil have graven . Ridol . Ridolpho Look on it ! There is a fascination in thy features , A nameless power in those eyes of thine , That link my gaze upon thee . Alb . Alberti Still look on . Thou read'st a history there of hard encounters , Of agonies past , of passions once on fire , Now chain 'd and motionless  --  but t is darkly written . The time will soon arrive when every syllable Shall be intelligible to thy sight ; When , what I am , and how I know thy story . And why this sympathy , this interest , This nameless power o'er thy destiny  --  All , all shall overwhelm thee . Ridol . Ridolpho Come then , let me hear  --  I 'll listen as the first created man To angels telling him the tale of Heaven  --  How he had fallen , and how he might have stood . O , I have yet in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling , Of human feeling , that might still redeem me From total condemnation  --  my brother 's son  --  Alb . Alberti Speak on  --  Ridol . Ridolpho Had he but liv 'd ! I lov 'd the boy , even for his father 's sake , His father 's wrongs  --  I would have been his father : With him and my Cesario to have shar 'd All earthly wealth , all earthly love . Alb . Alberti Ridolpho , Wouldst thou have done this ? Ridol . Ridolpho Heaven knows how truly ; Dare I now demand  --  Alb . Alberti I may not yet be questioned . Suffice , unhappy man , thou soon shalt know A precious secret long nurs 'd in my heart , Which has the power to bless beyond thy hopes , Or crush thee lower than mercy 's hand can reach . Within an hour 's space I 'll come to thee , With me the agent of thy brother 's vengeance . Well mayst thou tremble , for ' t is such a vengeance As in the bitterest anger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridolpho Is then my life required ? Alb . Alberti Thy life , Ridolpho ! Can thy poor life restore the life of her , Whose very breath gave spirit to his being ? No , no , Ridolpho  --  his revenge is greater . To bow thee to the dust , not end thy life , But make thee , living , feel his weight of vengeance . Exit . Ridol . Ridolpho Why am I turn 'd to stone ? Why rest of sense To answer or resist ?  --  Alberti 's presence , Like some superior star in the ascendant , Awes every weaker influence . But , let my fate Be what it may , I think I 'd meet the direst , To penetrate this horrid mystery . Enter Antonia . Antonia My dear Antonia , on thy cheek I see The traces of that sorrow , my sad tale So lately wrung from thee . But three years after These dreadful visitations of just heaven , Thy mother 's gentle nature won my heart , And I once more had taste of happiness ;  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But thou art not alone , my father . Ridol . Ridolpho O , my sole blessing ! Anto . Antonia Sure , you have yet to witness fairer days ; Ippolito and I will make thee happy  --  Ridol . Ridolpho And dost thou love Lorenzo 's youthful friend ? I would thou didst not  --  for his father 's voice Prohibits your kind union ;  --  dark Alberti Pronounces misery on it . Speak , Antonia  --  For well I know , the force of youthful passion Is strongest when ' t is speechless . Anto . Antonia My father , I will be guided by thee ; my submission Waits on your bidding  --  yet I can not act As prouder damsels may , nor hide my love From him who sought my heart  --  and won it . Ridol . Ridolpho Antonia , The open purity of thy nature charms me Far more than courtly nicety .  --  My daughter , Rest here awhile whie I retire to prayer . Alberti , thou dost hold the book of fate  --  My heart 's subdued  --  come then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gaze like one who sees the sunny summit Of a far distant hill , and fondly hopes That some sweet cot of peace , some resting place For wearied feet is there  --  yet strives in vain To reach it  --  for between that blessed spot And where I stand , dark misty gulphs are spread ; I dare not move .  --  O , for some hand to guide me ! Enter Ippolito . Ippo . Ippolita I thought some fairy vision floated by  --  It was Antonia 's figure ! Turn Antonia , And bless me with thine eyes . Perhaps , my love , I now may gaze my last Anto . Antonia Ippolito ! Ippo . Ippolita O , I have yet one hour to give to thee , ' Till I have heard my doom . If that he bless 'd  --  Then shall the eve bring love and happiness ! But if the curse fall on me  --  Anto . Antonia What curse fall on thee ? Antonia with thee , thou should'st hope for bliss . Fair-beaming hope , our nature 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory Be inmate of thy bosom ! Ippo . Ippolita Sweetest scraph , Even from thy lips the breath of hope comes to me  --  O , my Antonia , on this very spot , Made Eden by thy presence : even here , Amidst these blushing roses , these fresh myrtles  --  Their pleasant properties made doubly sweet That thou art near them  --  here I must await , And learn my doom . Anto . Antonia Whate'er it be , Ippolito  --  Tho ' we may never meet , we still may love . Ippo . Ippolita Even beyond this life ! Sure in thy presence Some strong presentiment of coming good Visits my heart . Yes , thou celestial Hope  --  Anto . Antonia Nay , do not hope , Ippolito ; a cloud , A black and threatening cloud now hangs above us  --  O , do not hope too fondly . In my heart I feel a dread , I know not how to name . Do not the learned say that certain stars At some infallible hour , in their course Have a malignant influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish dream . Anto . Antonia I feel that hour Is near us now . Farewell , Ippolito  --  Farewell . Ippo . Ippolita Antonia , why this sudden change ? ' T is I must stand the trial ; my dread hour Draws nearer every moment ; but what time Is counted in thy presence ? Short and precious Tho ' that space be . I may enjoy it with thee . Yes , I will court thy influence , sweet Hope , Which thus transforms dark images into beauty , And desolate spots to banks of golden verdure . Exeunt . SCENE SECOND . A hall in Alberli 's house . Enter Alberti and Lorenzo . Alb . Alberti Press me no further  --  Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici Canst thou profess thou lovest me , and yet hide A secret in thy bosom from thy friend ? Alb . Alberti I 've told thee all that I dar 'd tell to man , But fate compels me now to utter that I would have lock 'd in an eternal silence . Thou knowest , Lorenzo , I am  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not told me I should ne'er have known thee  --  Thy form , thy features chang 'd  --  Alb . Alberti Mark me , Medici ; I was a younger brother  --  O damned custom ! The accident of birth , the wealth of nobles Prevails ' gainst the nobility of nature ! My father 's title  --  all his large estates Became Ridolpho 's , and I was  --  a beggar .  --  Alas ! my parent 's gracious memory I can not curse  --  Ridolpho was my brother ; O , such a brother ! Where I look 'd for love , Respect , fraternal pride , and all kind usage , I met with insult , and  --  fell jealousy . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici The cause ? Alb . Alberti The mother of Ippolito . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici His mother ! Alb . Alberti But , though I knew my brother was my rival . Aye , and a mercenary father 's choice , Helen 's dear love was all in all to milleg . And , when at tournaments I overthrewilleg . Knight after knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swore her beauty brightest , By deeds maintaining my romantic vow , That she of Troy , who set the world in arms , Ne'er rival 'd her  --  but why do I recall Those morning images of youth  --  those scenes Of thoughtless rapture  --  past forever ! Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici Nay , but be calm , nor let your passion thus Unman your nobler fortitude . Alb . Alberti I had a friend  --  a venerable man  --  The good Filippo  --  he married us Lorenzo ; In private , married us ;  --  we had a son  --  Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici You contrived To hide this marriage from her father ? Alb . Alberti Too well . Better to have declared it ; better endur 'd The ill that could have followed  --  poverty . That to escape , I hurried to the wars , Resolv 'd to fight my way to independence , Return and claim my wife  --  Now mark the sequel . My brother stopt my letters to my Helen ,  --  ( Which I had darkly couch 'd , no hint there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father  --  My brother told her that in the Italian wars , My life had perish 'd ; then press 'd hard his suit  --  Her haughty father , and her hapless state , My death believ 'd too  --  forced her to the altar All shuddering at this tyrannous enforcement , More like a victim than a bride . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici He knew not of your marriage ? Alb . Alberti Well he knew Our mutual loves .  --  O Helen ! but three months  --  Scarcely three months of absence  --  thou wert too hasty ; Thou shouldst have struggled ' gainst it .  --  When the truth , The horrid truth I heard , some dmon fierce Usurp 'd my seat of reason .  --  I ran , I flew , As if a raging pestilence pursued me ! Rocks , woods , and wilds , the stormy promontory , The headlong precipice , th ' interminable ocean , The tempest and the night  --  these were my haunts , My habitation and my conference , For two long years . Suddenly a thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd me ) Once more to see my Helen , called me forth . I sought her  --  found her  --  Oh , that fatal day ! New horrors rush 'd upon me . Each dread image In characters of blood now glare before me . Here lay our infant , with its cherub smiles , His mother weeping o'er him  --  her fair hand Press 'd to my lips , while kneeling at her feet , I had just sworn to quit forever Florence , Change my dishonoured name , and find a death Within my country 's ranks  --  That very instant Ridolpho rushes in  --  rage in his eyes , With twenty armed menials at his beck ; Vain were my efforts , though these toil-strung sinews Beat down their numbers , as the lion doth The hinds that hunt him ;  --  but my wounds o'ercame me , My sword fell from my grasp  --  bleeding and faint , Helen would have preserved me from the stroke My brother aim 'd at my unguarded breast  --  I saw Ridolpeho stab her to the heart ! He stabb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round me  --  The rest is dark oblivion !  --  Supports himself on Lorenzo . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici Look up , my friend ; that accidental wound Was slight , and though she died but shortly after , ' T was with a broken heart .  --  Ridolpho told me He learn 'd the fatal truth that fatal day ; She justified her honour , and too late Disclos 'd her marriage with thee , e'er the earth Closed peacefully o'er her bosom . Alb . Alberti Filippo 's tender care Preserv 'd to me , a life now valueless . No more you heard of Ferdinand Ridolpho . Under our founder 's name , the good Alberti , I sought for death  --  but gain 'd applause and honour  --  I sought and gain 'd thy confidence , thy friendship  --  You made me captain of the troops of Florence , You made me feel I still had cause to live  --  Live for my country . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici My Alberti , then  --  For by that name I found thee , Ferdinand  --  Say , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorenzo D'Medici Ridolpho had a son too by that marriage . Alb . Alberti He had  --  Ippolito  --  Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici Aye , thy son , Ippolito ; There is another mystery ; the youth Who saved my life  --  Alb . Alberti Is count Ridolpho 's son , Cesario . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici Ridolpho 's ! Alb . Alberti Now thou seest the sacred bar Which keeps him from Antonia . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici Antonia is his sister ! Alb . Alberti By the same father ; but another wife Had sooth 'd Ridolpho 's grief  --  Antonia 's mother . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici How came Ippolito with thee ? knows he  --  Alb . Alberti This very hour I will make clear to thee ,  --  To thee and to the world  --  my conduct past . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici A thought like lightning flashes on my mind  --  Say , doth Filippo live ? Alb . Alberti Thank heaven , he does . San Marco 's is his dwelling . Would'st ought with him ? Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alb . Alberti It is Filippo 's self ! Lorenzo , lend me now thy friendly arm . Fil . Filippo Still I gaze on thee  --  while a train of images  --  Like things reveal 'd by strong and sudden light Out of thick darkness , nows breaks in upon me If thou be'st he  --  but O , how chang 'd , how blighted ! The gallant Ferdinand , the gay , the courteous , The flower of Italian chivalry ! If thou be'st he  --  Alb . Alberti What dost thou mean , old man ? Fil . Filippo Again that voice ! and yet it can not be  --  Sure twenty years could not have wrought this change Mine eyes are dim , but then I heard that voice . O , speak again ; thy person 's majesty Floats like a vision by these aged eyes , But my heart says ' t is thee ;  --  O , speak again . Alb . Alberti Filippo  --  Fil . Filippo Thou art indeed Ferdinand Ridolpho ! Now let me die , I pray 'd once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alb . Alberti Thou faithful friend , Constant and firm when all around me perish 'd ! Fil . Filippo O , my dear master  --  let me call you thus  --  Discard the memory of injuries past . If tears and penitence can wash away The sins of passion , thy poor brother yet May have thy pardon , thy embrace . Alb . Alberti My embrace ! Look , my Lorenzo ; what a brother 's eyes , A brother 's heart could not discern , nor feel  --  His single glance has caught . Can it be possible That grey Filippo  --  within this iron frame Rusted with tempests  --  in this marble front Intrench 'd with care , but once the seat of peace , Unsoil 'd by dusty war or summer suns  --  That he , whose vision 's blunted  --  ( O , unnatural ! ) Within the ruins of what once I was , Still sees the long-lost Ferdinand ! And a brother  --  In whose seared conscience all my lineaments Should be forever branded !  --  Fil . Filippo Thou , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see thee , and not know thee . Alb . Alberti My friends , I pray you leave me to myself awhile  --  Lorenzo , I must see you soon ; farewell , Filippo . Lor . Lorenzo D'Medici Father , I will attend thy steps a little way . Exeunt Lorenzo and Filippo . Alb . Alberti And now , Ippolito , our trial comes ; ' T is thou must be my champion . Not that the sun May blaze upon the deed , or that mankind May wonder while they witness , do I choose The time and manner  --  ' T is not thee , O Pride , But Magnanimity , thou rarer spirit , Which lifts the mortal to immortal natures , And purifies the soul from earth-born passions ,  --  Thee , I would worship .  --  END OF THE THIRD ACT . ACT IV . SCENE FIRST . Ridolpho 's Gardens . Enter Ippolito . Ippol . Ippolita While with Antonia , thoughts of what may come Were lost in present bliss and sweet oblivion . But , as her figure parted from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And I am left to darkness . Why , my soul , Enter Alberti . Alberti Art thou so heavy ; why this presentiment Of something horrible and undefined Even to wildest fancy ? Alb . Alberti Ippolito  --  Ippol . Ippolita My father  --  Alb . Alberti Approach and listen . Nearer ,  --  O , yet nearer  --  For sure , Ippolito ,  --  while thus I throw My arms around thee  --  sure , a father might Be proud of such a son ! Ippol . Ippolita This language , Sir  --  Alb . Alberti Is much unlike my stern and distant manner  --  Each moment thou art dearer ! O , Ippolito , This is the last time I may speak to thee  --  The last embrace of friendship and affection . Ippo . Ippolita The last ! Alb . Alberti I fear my coldness has estrang 'd thy heart . Ippol . Ippolita O never , thou wert stern but to thyself ; Even through thy frowns a father 's love beam 'd on me , And oft I could have kiss 'd thy thought-paled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alberti Ippolito , thou dost love me ? Ippo . Ippolita O prove me , Sir . Where shall I turn my heart But to thy bosom . Alb . Alberti How shall I part with thee ? For we must part , Ippolito . Ippo . Ippolita Why should we part , my father ? Alb . Alberti Father again ! O , what a title for the man who claims A son like thee . Know , I am not thy father . Ippo . Ippolita Not my father !  --  Alb . Alberti Amazement wraps thy faculties ; ' t is most true  --  I am not thy father . Ippo . Ippolita Aid me awhile , kind heaven ! Who is my father then ? Alb . Alberti A high and haughty man  --  a hapless man . Ippo . Ippolita I know him not ; I know no father  --  none  --  But only thee ! All cold and dark I found thee , Yet my heart clings to thee . Alb . Alberti Cease , Ippolito , This wild emotion ; summon up thy manhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of dreadful matters . Thy father  --  must I speak it ! Was my dire enemy , his brother 's enemy ! Ippo . Ippolita His brother ! Alb . Alberti I loved thy mother , boy  --  Loved , do I say ? O , how all language fails To speak the feeling of this desolate heart !  --  Thy father in my absence stole her from me ; Filling her ears with stories of my death , Through force , or fear  --  she married him  --  Married her husband 's brother ! Thou art the issue of that unhallowed bond ! Ippo . Ippolita For what strange doom has Heaven then reserv 'd A wretch like me , sprung from this fatal union ? Alb . Alberti Nay , thou art innocent . Ippo . Ippolita I strive to catch some print of time , some trace On memory ; but t is eras 'd and gone . Even from my earliest years , I look 'd on thee As my real parent  --  Why am I withheld From his protection ? Wherefore am I here ? Alb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ippolita Revenge ! Alb . Alberti Revenge .

Speak out thy purpose , or I 'll hear no more . Alb .
