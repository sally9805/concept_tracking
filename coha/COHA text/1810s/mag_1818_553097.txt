txt PART I. A TRUE lover of Nature , ( and I take you of course to be one , gentle reader ! ) needs no logic to shew him that the woods are pleasant and the fields interesting ; so I shall take you at once by the hand , and carry you some odd miles out of the city , where we will hear such warbling , as , if you have music in your soul , shall put out of your head forever that symphony of old yclept " of the spheres . " Possibly many of my readers are now wondering to hear me talk of the American birds being pre-eminent for song , because , forsooth , they have heard of a ridiculous notion , started by a few scribbling blockheads , who knew very little  --  and caught up and magnified by Buffon , who knew nothing at all-about the matter ,  --  a notion , I say , that the birds of the new continent are vastly inferior , in singing , to those of the old ; this is all-saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a theory of his own to maintain ,  --  being in substance , that America was made but the other day , and , of course , that everything it contained must be poor , and weak , and diminutive , when compared with old mother Europe . He would have been glad to prove , if he could , that his own mountains were taller , and his rivers larger , and his lakes deeper than ours ; but geography is not so easily managed . You , gentle reader , know , I suppose , a great deal about the feathered creation . Very well ; - do you know a bird that can neither walk nor swim ? " What a question ! " say you ; " certainly not . " " What a ninny ! say I ; " you certainly do . " Ten to one that he will flap his wings in your face , or whisk his tail in your ears before breakfast tomorrow ; he builds his nest over your front door , or under the eaves of your house , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town for all this . Need I mention the SWALLOW , that lively , frolicsome little bird , who brings you the first welcome tidings of summer , and whose joyous twitter enlivens our very streets from morning to night ? The Swallow , I say , never was famous for practices ambulatory or natatory . His legs are short , slender , and none of the strongest , and his claws very hooked ; when he alights upon the ground , and spies a particularly fat bug or so half a foot distant , for which he has made up his mandibles , he chooses to fly for it , rather than set one foot before the other ; walking , therefore , he votes to be a decided bore ; and not having the luck to be web-footed , who does not see that swimming too is entirely out of the question ? though he has no objection to dipping his wings now and then as he skims over the water ; so , good reader , if you have ever , in the course of your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these birds in the mud , and their general use of the diving bell about the end of the season , for heaven 's sake , forget it all as soon as you can , for , upon the word of an honest man , a swallow is neither an eel nor an oyster , but only a swallow . What would you give to fly like this little fellow ? See him dart along the ground like a streak of lightning , threatening to pop into your face , and before you can dodge that jolterhead of yours out of // his way-presto ! - he sweeps off at an angle , and the next instant is cutting capers over the chimney tops half a mile distant . Do you remember the calculation made to show how far a swallow did , or could , or ought to fly in ten years ,  --  his natural life ? namely , one mile in a minute for ten hours each day-sum total 2,190,000 miles ! You laugh at this , as if it was an attempt to prove such a marvelously sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ; but is not this as good as the story of the ten men , whose united ages make eight hundred years , which you see regularly every six months in the newspapers ? This sociable and innocent bird is no less endeared to us by his amiable manners and cheerful disposition , than by his undeviating fondness for the society of man . Go where you will in the country , among the woods , and they are not to be seen , but as soon as you approach a village or a farm-house , you catch sight of your friendly companions , darting over the tree-tops , or skimming across the meadows , while their joyous and exulting twitter seems expressive of honest and unbounded confidence in the friendship and hospitality of man . We all remember how sacred we held , when schoolboys , the life or nest of a swallow . The Indians had , and still retain , the same attachment to this bird ; to this day , they invite the Swallow and Martin to their habitations , by hanging up gourd-shells on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nestle . The prac*tice , therefore , of setting up houses for the Martin , Blue-bird , Wren , &amp;c. , is of American origin , and derived from the aborigines ,  --  a fact somewhat remarkable . Speaking of the Martin offers me an occasion of alluding to one of those mortalities , which , strange as it may seem , sweep Martins from the air , as well as men from the earth . Three or four years ago , the Martins throughout the country all died . What killed them nobody knew ; they were found dead in their houses , and about in the fields ; not an individual , apparently , escaped . Whether an epidemic like the plague or small-pox had seized them , or whether the flies and wasps and bees upon which they feed had grown poisonous , we never shall know . None appeared the following seasons , and the whole species was , thought exterminated ; but the present year they have made their appearance in considerable numbers , and the " temple-haunting martlet " has again taken up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we have so many fine native songsters , very few people keep in their cages anything beside that pert and noisy little foreigner , the Canary  --  a tasteless vociferator , who is solicitous only to stun you with the loudness of his squalling . How much more agreeable the notes of many birds , that people our own woods and gardens To say nothing of the larger ones , second to none in the world for song , there are , of the smaller kind  --  the Linnet , with his sweet rolling warble  --  a bird superior even to his European namesake ;  --  the Boblink , with his most musical medley of pleasant sounds ; - the Scarlet Tanager , at once brilliant in plumage and gifted in song ; - the Oriole , hardly less in either ;  --  the Bay-winged Bunting , the Song and Field Sparrows , the Red-eyed and Warbling Flycatchers , and many others I might mention , that , for musical sweetness of note , surpass infinitely the so highly esteemed Canary bird . lint soft ,  --  we now begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left the city behind us , with its clatter and dust , its " sin and seacoal ) " and the tall trees yonder wave their leafy arms and nod their venerable heads in the distance , as if wooing us to come under their shadows . Ah , here are my favorites , the jolly BOBLINKS , gamboling about in the green meadow . Hark-what a sweet jingle the rogues are making ! What a stream of mellow notes , high and low , soft and strong , " in linked sweetness long drawn out , " they pour forth at random ! If you had not known this bird from your boyhood , you would suppose that five hundred different species of the feathered tribe were tuning their throats together . He is the most gay , garrulous , and cheerful of all songsters . His store of fine notes is so copious that he rattles them out indiscriminately with a careless and rapid profusion , which exhibits every manner and variety of contrast . One tone follows another so quickly , that your ear can hardly separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must allow that his medley is most musical . Here he comes upon the wing , and he is in such a mighty hurry to tell us all he knows , that he can not wait till he alights upon the apple-tree close by , but begins a most lusty chattering in the air . Now he alights upon the topmost bough , and sings away as if he meant to split his throat . Now he is off down among the grass ; and here he is back once more upon the tree . Look , he has been after food for his young , and has a worm in his bill ; yet for all that , he can not keep his tongue still , but rattles away a song in most comical style , without losing his mouthful . Now he jumps into the air again , and comes fluttering over our heads ; now he alights upon the rail a few yards off ; mark his striking plumage , as motley as his song ; look at him in front , and he is nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a coat of black , white , and gray , such as you never saw before . Look down there in the meadow , and you will see his wife , Mrs. Bob , in a plain suit of brown homespun ; she is in a terrible taking , for fear you should discover her nest in the grass , where she has a brood of five young Bobbies , as deft and dapper as ever chipped a shell . Now hark to that strange mewing noise among the bushes ; you suppose it perhaps to be a stray kitten , but I shall please to call it the CAT-BIRD , who , not being particularly desirous of our company , considering that his nest might be laid under contribution , is not altogether disposed to favor us with his sweetest strains . But when out of danger and apprehension , you will hear him troll a sweet and cheerful song , relieved and diversified with imitations of almost every songster in the grove . I have heard Mocking birds , that are so highly and justly esteemed , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so admirably do some individuals of these last perform their parts ; and yet you will find no written account of this bird , that says much in praise of his notes . No naturalist has hitherto done him anything like justice . The truth is , he is a mimic and vocalist of very extraordinary powers , and worthy of being classed by the side of the American Polyglot . It was a great mistake in Wilson to say that " his pipe is rather deficient in clearness and strength of tone . " * He had certainly paid but little attention to the vocal exhibitions of this sprightly * Sorry am to say anything in dispraise of that very deserving arid industrious naturalist , the author of the American Ornithology ; but the circumstance alluded to above is nothing In comparison with the errors of a graver kind , a hich abound in every part of that splendid work . // songster , or it may be that the Cat-bird in the Southern states does not display the full extent of his musical powers . I am the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in the country around Boston , are excellent singers ,  --  yet are stated by Wilson to have no note at all ! Three months ' residence in Massachusetts would have corrected a great many of his errors , and added vastly to his stock of information . There are few birds more common than the Cat-bird , or of more familiar manners , yet his great fondness for the first ripe cherries raises him up a host of enemies in the farmers , who choose to have the first pickings for themselves . The poor Cat-bird , therefore , is generally shot without mercy , whenever he intrudes into a garden , while the strange and unjust prejudice of the schoolboy shows him as little mercy in the humble thicket , where he builds his nest . Equally well known with the Cat-bird is the THRESHER , who in truth very much resembles him in general powers of song . He sings with a louder and more emphatic tone , and his notes are full of sweetness , though his imitative talent is not so great , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is rather more shy too , in his manners . As a songster , he is generally in much higher esteem than the former , and is , perhaps , next to the Mocking-bird in repute , as a cage inhabitant . It must be remarked that the Thresher is a very active , hardy and vigorous bird , and is not pleased with the confinement of a cage ; at any rate , he prefers one of ample dimensions , where he can hop from perch to perch , and whisk about his long tail quite at his ease . But if you wish to see his familiar disposition , and liveliness , and sagacity in their full extent , take him when young , and rear him in a spacious room unconfined ; then his playful temper , docility , and shrewdness are truly wonderful . As to the MOCKING-BIRD , although a stray individual now and then wanders as far north as Boston , yet we can hardly call him a citizen of New-England ; his manners and song are only known here from the tenants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can be heard to sing in perfection . Look now at that bright creature , darting like a flash of fire among the thick leaves ! It is the GOLDEN ORIOLE . What a beauty ! Can any sunset cloud surpass the dazzling brilliancy of his bright plumage ? No bauble of gold and diamonds could ever be made to equal him . He is a songster too , and no mean one , though his note has little variety and is not long kept up ; still there is a richness and mellowness in his gay warble , very pleasing to the ear ; and moreover he is so familiar in associating with man , and seems so desirous to cultivate his acquaintance by nestling and singing at the windows of our houses ,  --  if perchance we have an apple orchard there ,  --  and even in the very streets of the city where he can find a tall elm swinging its drooping arms over the pavement ,  --  that one can not help loving him . He is , besides , of the starling tribe , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , he actually talks even in a wild state , and there is one charming sociable fellow who comes under my window every day and calls out , as plainly as you would wish to have the words spoken- " Look here ! Look here , doxy ! "  --  a call which I have no doubt his doxy understands . // But the Oriole 's nest is an object worth your curiosity ,  --  a piece of architecture that shews very clearly how well acquainted he is with the fact , that a familiarity even with man has its dangers . The Oriole is no fool ; he has no notion of raising a brood of young , and fattening them all nice and plump for your old cat to gobble up at a mouthful- .. not he ; the little fellow has wit enough to fix his nest at the end , almost , of a drooping branch which hangs down with a perpendicularity enough to frighten a cat out of her nine lives . Here these ingenious architects contrive to hang their snug little bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that Grimalkin would not venture her whiskers within jumping distance of the same , for the daintiest morsel that ever made her mouth water . This nest is one of the neatest you ever saw , being wove together with strings , and matted up with tow and hair in a most workmanlike fashion . It is necessary for the Oriole to have good stout strings to begin the frame work of the nest with ; nobody need be told , therefore , that bits of twine , packthread , yarn , &amp;c. are in great request with them at the time of building ; the good wives in the country keep a special eye upon their skeins of yarn and thread which chance to be out , bleaching at that time , because it happens that this sly bird has no scruple in appropriating to himself the goods and chattels of his neighbors when they appear in such a convenient shape . Not long since , one of these little pilferers came to my old lady 's kitchen window , and made off with a piece of her wick-yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was soon woven into the nest , and for several days this white yarn , swinging about in the breeze , was a great wonder in the eyes of all the birds in the neighborhood ; the sparrow the wren , the flycatcher-every one that flitted by ,  --  gave it a snap , causing her to leave her weaving , pop out , and scold till she had driven them off . It is to be remarked that this beautiful bird is rather touchy and pugnacious , and when out of temper utters a loud and rapid cllirr , like the winding up of a clock . Now I observe you staring upward and puzzling your wits to guess what great bird it is you see wheeling aloft over our heads . That , Sir , is the type , symbol , and adopted emblem of our nation , the BALD EAGLE , who , by the way , is not bald , any more than that stout and sturdy youth , the thriving republic , whose character he represents ; only his head and neck are white ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is brown . Under three or four years of age , though full grown in point of size , he has no white at all , and has been often taken , even by naturalists , for a different bird . It is lucky he should be here just now , for these birds are somewhat rare , as , by the way , most of the rapacious tribe are , in comparison with others ; still the Bald Eagles are far more common with us than in Europe , where they are never seen except in the extreme northern regions , although an individual has been known in two different instances , to wander as far south as the centre of Europe . They are spread , however , completely over this continent , and on a day just like this ,  --  bright , serene , and a little cool , with not a cloud to be seen in the clear vault above ,  --  you may espy him hovering over the sea shore , or the banks of the river , or your own fish p*nd , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will occasionally clutch a fowl from your fhrm-yard , and has been known even to attempt to kidnap a young child ! He has a strange and unconquera // ble antipathy , when tamed  --  and when wild , I suppose , just the sameto be seen at his ( linner ; - give him his meat , and he gets his back turned against you before he will begin eating ; - walk round in front of him , and he turns round again ; - place half a dozen persons in a ring round him , and what does he do , but , after hitching and fidgeting about and finding himself completely surrounded ,  --  stretch out his wings , spread his tail , and bend over his neck till he has made himself a perfect screen , under which he may swallow his victuals , as if the vulgar business of eating were a thing which you must not suspect him of . The Bald Eagle , as I have just remarked , loves to sail about at an immense height , when the air is cloudless and serene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cool and healthy portion of the atmosphere for his home , and , being abstemious in his diet , he is , of consequence , long lived , and no doubt his age reaches near a century . But we must have one more look at him ere he soars away . See , with what majesty he wheels round and round in the air , giving now and then a strong flap with his broad pinions , but for the most part scaling in a slow and solemn sweep with extended and motionless vans ; how little labor does it cost him to sustain himself in the air ! See again , - he begins to ascend , swinging round and round , higher and higher at every turn , you can not tell how , for he appears to rise without effort ; now he has reached a lofty height , the circle of his flight grows less ; now he appears a small speck , and now no bigger than the tip end of the hair of a mosoheto 's eyebrow ; now he is out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the known world is the Washington Eagle of North-America , unless Mr. Audubon ,  --  whose splendid engravings of American birds have lately been exhibited to the Boston public ,  --  and who had the good luck to make the first actual discovery of this noble creature ,  --  be greatly mistaken in his comparison of the Bird of Washington with the Great Sea Eagle of Europe , as some persons are pleased to insinuate , which notion , indeed , comes to us in such a plausible shape that we ourselves are somewhere between a hawk and a buzzard about the matter . Be this as it may , the eagle aforesaid , whether an exclusive inhabitant of America or not , is a true citizen of the country , and affords another refutation of the absurd doctrine of Buffon , that the birds of America are in general smaller than those of the same class in the old continent . In this , he comes no nearer the truth than in his remarks of the same character , respecting the powers of singing in the feathered tribes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded . The truth indeed is , if any fair or satisfactory result can be obtained by the comparison of individuals from classes arranged according to such arbitrary distinctions as prevail in ornithology-the conclusion to be drawn is the very reverse of that adopted by Buffon , and it is the American birds that are superior in size . In going over Latham 's Synopsis for this purpose , we have found the largest individual of each genus*to be , in much the greater number of instances , an exclusive inhabitant of the western continent , and nothing but a settled resolution of twisting every fact into a conformity with his own preconceived theories could have led that great majestati ncLtura3 par ingenium into such monstrous hallucinations . // But let that pass ; we still admire Buffon as a poet , though we shall give no quarter to his philosophical perversities . Marmontel was right in assigning him a rank among those writers who deal in works of fancy , although the naturalist displayed no less astonishment than disdain at what he thought so preposterous an estimate of his powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was amazed to hear he had been talking poetry all his life . We have remarked that eagles are scarce compared with other birds , and it is well they are so . What ravage and destruction would be the necessary consequence of their existing in numbers any way comparable to those of most others of the feathered creation ! An eagle 's talons have a power equal to the claws of a tiger , to say nothing of his sharp , horny beak , and long wings , the last of which , be it known , would1be found sufficient to break the legs of the sturdiest clown that ever kicked We have seen some of these flying monsters seven feet in extent ; a six-footer is no chicken , as we are constrained to asseverate too from personal experience , having had the temerity upon a time , when we had shot him with ten leaden slugs and brought him to the ground , to set foot upon his talons , thereby receiving a clutch from the expiring animal which pierced through half an inch of special sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lock-jaw . We know not if an army of lions would be more formidable than a flock of hungry eagles , sensible of their strength , and carrying on war in a body . But the eagle is a solitary bird , and although occasionally seen in company with one or more of his species about a waterfall , or the shallow margin of a lake , seems merely to be drawn to a common locality in pursuit of food , and not from any feeling which indicates a social disposition . This preference for a solitary life seems to have been aimed at by nature in the domestic economy of the eagle ; one egg only is laid in the eagle 's nest ; he consorts with no equal in youth ; he has no brother and is like no brother ; ' he is brought up as one who is all the world to himself ; consequently your eagle is neither a co-operative in peace , nor a commilitant in war , but toils unaided and undefende* and rushes to battle in the spirit of the Yankee soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes now to the top of that tall tree , where you hear a song , which strikes you as altogether new to your ear ; you see something of a bright red among the dark green leaves ; that is the ScARLET TANAGER , one of the most elegant and showy birds in the world , his whole plumage being of the most brilliant scarlet , save the wings and tail , which are of a jet black ; mark his song , which is a very fine one , * and which I can only liken somewhat to that of a robin , with a good deal more depth , fulness and compass , a little raucous withal . This bird is not numerous , and notwithstanding his striking appearance , is very little known by the common people ; nevertheless , an ear familiar with his song will trace him in the woods in almost any part of the country , and now and then an individual will stray into the orchard near your house , or alight upon the fence of your garden . In common language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson appears never to have heard the Tanager 's real song . // Here comes another beauty ,  --  the INDIGO-BIRD ; he is about the size of a Sparrow , and his whole plumage of a most brilliant and dazzling blue , varying , as the light falls upon it , into a deeper tint or a light green ; he is not only elegantly dressed , but a very respectable and vigorous songster ; his note is somewhat sharp and wiry , having some resemblance to that of the Song Sparrow ; he is a sprightly and cheerful bird , chanting the whole summer long at all hours ; even in the blazing meridian sun of the hottest day in summer , he will mount the tallest tree in the garden , or the forks of the lightning rod on the chimney , and sing away with great vivacity for half an hour together , remitting the force of his note from time to time , as if out of breath , and pouring forth new strains with redoubled ardor , as if not to be overcome by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare , yet , like the preceding , he is not widely known in the coui*try . You see that very lively and spirited creature , fluttering , pitching and tumbling about , spreading out his broad , white-edged tail , and uttering a loud , quick , and shrill twitter-who should it be but the KINGBIRD , that bold and dauntless little fellow , ready to fight any marauding intruder or blundering stroller that dares approach his nest ? No matter how big the unlucky feathered wight may be who ventures near his premises-no sooner does the King-bird espy him , than he darts upon the intruder with the most courageous eagerness , falls foul of him , gives him lunge and thrust with his sharp bill , right and left , front , flank and rear , sweeping from side to side , up and down , over and under , with such swiftness and dexterity , that hawks and eagles are no match for him , but are obliged to turn tail and leave him master of the field . Look now ! There is that great lubberly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrape He has had the foolhardy audacity to show his ugly face within a stone 's throw of the King-bird 's nest ,  - -  meaning no harm of course , as he pretends ,  --  but all his excuses are not worth a straw to him , for in less time than half a flap of his clumsy wings , his watchful antagonist is darting at him with the speed of an arrow ;  --  and now for it ! there they go , at an immense height in the air ; the old Crow , frightened out of his wits , and s$ialling at a tremendous rate , the little King-bird pulling after him in full chase ; now they are clapperclawing ; the King-bird souses upon him and hits him a great dig behind ; the clumsy black booby shuffles and bounces about , and makes every kind of awkward manmnuvre to get rid of the little tormentor , who , after enjoying the fun till he has chased him about a mile and a half , combing his feathers all the way , lets him off with a prodigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally destitute , in general appearance , of every thing like gaudiness of plumage , is yet a very handsome creature . His form has eminent grace and symmetry , and when his crest is raised , a beautiful diadem of bright flame color , contrasted with dark ash , adorns his head , and gives him a truly majestic appearance ; add to this his eye ,  --  and what an eye ! - dark , brilliant , full and clear , sparkling with life and beaming intelligence ,  --  an eye indeed , which I have not language to describe .
