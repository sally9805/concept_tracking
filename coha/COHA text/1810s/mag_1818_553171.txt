txt On the Health of Literary Men . THE moral influences of literary occupation have been frequent subjects of speculation ,  --  . it may be interesting to examine its effects on bodily health ; especially , as the instances of early decay and death are so frequent among our men of letters . Is there any thing in our institt*tions or habits , which may have a share in the production of these melancholy effects ? The mind , during the whole of life , has an influence over the body . Its power in some instances is so great , as to sub .. vert long established habits ,  --  to destroy that equilibriu ni of action in which health consists , and indirectly induce disease . It is reasonable to suppose that this influence will // 177 On the Health of Literary gen. derange that system the least , which has acquired the most perfect development or growth ; and that hence prematurity of mind , ' acting upon the highly susceptible system of youth , may be among the causes of the feeble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be succeeded . The early education , therefore , of literary men , or those destined for the professions , should be taken into the account , when we speculate on the probable causes of their diseases ;  --  and it may be safely inferred , that that system of education will be found most favourable to health , which is calculated to retard premature intellectual development , and which at the same time produces a less violent but more healthful mental exciteme4:t . This consideration , however , has but a small place in our systems of education , which appear to be es*eutiaily systems of intellectual forcing . The time devoted to primary edocaiioii , whether for colleges or professions , is very short , and yet much is to be done ,  --  a considerable portion of elementary learning is then to be acquired . During this period , iinportaait changes in the physical condition are to take place , and it can hardly happen , but that they shall be iii some degree affected by the circumstances under which they occur . These changes consist in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ;  --  and the effects of external and internal circumstances are discoverable in the susceptibilities which particular organs or the whole system may receive . Now , in what situation or under what circumstances , may this development most favourably take l ) lace , especially in those who are destined to the professions or to literary occupation ? Perhaps a more favourable combination of circumstances can not be found , than in a school and its discipline . There the mind seems to exert something like a mechanical influence over the body , or the influences of mind an ( h body are so perfectly reciprocal , that it would be hardly possible to say , which exerted the most power . A boy at school studies , because he is to find his reward in healthful amusement abroad , and in the affectionate regards of his superiour . He has only to dread the infliction of corporal punishment , or censure , if he fail to accomplish his prescribed task . He has *mething specific and tangible in view in his labours , something which must be done ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // may be fatiguing , he knows that the will of his instructer , or cert*tinly the decline of the sun , will bring them to an end . While this salutary discipline directs his mind , a no less salutary one influences his body . TI'ie hour that closes his inteilectual labour is a period of perfect intermission . It is filled with activity , and fatigue is lost in amusement . His diet is simple and regular , and excess is checked by the wholesome restraints of home . here , certainly , is a combination of circumstances admirably adapted to preserve the sound mind in the sound body . Unfortunately , in this country , this discipline is but of short continuance ; - from school , the boy is early removed to the university . What is the difference between the two situations ?  --  and what is there in the discipline of the university , unfavourable to health at this early age ? The boy is at once submitted to entirely new and very powerful influences . He is no longer to be re* arded by play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found exclusively in intellectual distinction , and his punishment in a declared and conscious inferiority . He is at once brought under the influence of the strongest passions and sentiments which can find a place in his heart ,  --  he is perpetually vibrating between a too elevated excitement , and debiltating depression . His habits are violently broken  --  the restraints of home and of school are abandoned , and the willing dependence of boyhood is made to give place to entire self.diiection . We have here some of the causes , which tend to disturb or destroy that equable action , which should always exist in a system whose parts are only forming , and every organ of which may receive healthy or morbid susceptibilities , according to the influences which act upon them . It is unnecessary to she*v the particular affections , which may be produced by these causes , or the order in which they occur . The general effect , however , is feeble life , or at least a predisposition to some of the most formidable maladies to which the body is liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their education is completed , present some obstacles to the formation and preservation of regular habits . We rarely cultivate literature professionally ; - nearly all our men of letters are also men of active business , subject at once to the opposite influences and demands of an active and sedentary life . And he who carries the fatigues of study into the world , and tj*oso // of business into his closet , with a mind long upon the stretch and directed to a variety of objects , with little command of his hours , choice of amusements , or restraint upon his ambition , will soon feel the nec*ssity and lament the difficulty of establishing any thing like system in his labours or relaxation . His pursuits are indeed various , but change is not remission . The hours he takes from his profession must not only be repaid , but they are given to other toil , though of another kind . He feels too , that his active labours are very far from answering the purpose of free , careless exercise in the open air , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ceases not , perhaps , at its close ; and he who may have only half lost his consciousness at night , whose powers may have only been confused and troubled by sleep , must yet see the sun and his labours dawn upon him together . Our scholars are with us in our social and convivial amusements , and here they are in danger of conforming to the world in dissipation , that may be harmless to the merely active or to the fashionable , hut which offers violence to those habits of a scholar , which are most essential to a clear , tranquil mind , and a perfect command of its powers . To be wholly independent of society will not do . It has claims and uses which no man should despise . There are affections to be cherished and expanded , and courtesies of life to be observed ; .  --  and no plans should be formed without a regard to them , or with which they may not innocently interfere . Besides , the scholar should be much in society for its excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should surrend*r himself sometimes to the influence of other minds . He must relax his strained powers , be gay and eveit vacant , itT he would remove the feverishness , the depression and restlessness , which so often visit him after long and intense study . But it is also necessary that every class of men should have habits suited to their occupations ,  --  habits of pleasure as well as of work ; and besides the difficulty of establishing these , which arises from the variety and irregularity of their pursuits , our scholars are too few to form a separate class , with distinct manners and an appropriate mode of life , and therefore are apt to accommodate themselve.s in these respects , where imitation is more natural than in almost any other , to the mass among whom their lot is cast . And nothing can be more fatal to that composure of the faculties and tranquillity // of the circulations , which are so essential to the health of a student , than the irregular hours , the innocent dissipation , the parties , dinners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regularity is the first of his wants , and the habit of avoiding all strong excitement should be the first of his cautions ; and if he fails in neither of these , health will almost surely follow . It is not desirable , indeed , that our scholars should have all the influence in polished society , which the philosophers of France enjoyed , who governed in the drawing-room as i*ell as in the Academy . And yet , when we know that , for the last century , the average of the life of a man of letters in France has been stated at something over sixty years , * and that the ages of twelve of her laborious philosophers , taken at random , arnunt to a thousand years , one can not help ascribing this in part to their independent mode of life , and wishing that our own scholars would feel it a right and a duty to prescribe their indulgences as well as their labours . If they must attend to active business for support , and to letters for amusement only or distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  will not judge them harshly , when they neglect its pleasures or enjoy them temperately , or even when they withdraw for a time from their duties . The schAar is the best judge in his own case ; - the season and limits of exertion , repose , exercise and dissipation should be determined by his own sensations , his consciousness The same has been stated of ItalY-We also hear often of the long ' lives of the German students , of their vivacity in advanced years , and even that the oldest are the most efficient and useful ;  --  and this , in spite of intense study , little exercise , and an almost intemperate u'e of tobacco . But it is hardly safe to attempt an explanation of the difference in these respects , between them and our own scholars , ( allowing that there is one , ) by pointing out a few circumstances , in which the modes of living , here and there , arc opposed . The instances of early dec'iy among our literary men , are , I believe , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly , they are enough to deserve serious inquiry into the cause . If we should discover circumstances in the lives of our students , that will account for the evil , our conviction might be strengthened by finding that they did not exist among the healthier students of another nation ;  --  and yet we are to remember , that the habits , which are harmless in one country , may be hurtful and even fatal in another , and that excess in labour or indulgence , will be less injurious every where , if one 's mode of life is thoroughly systematical . Something important would be gained f*om the inquiry , if*ve should find ( what I believe to be the caie ) that the situation of foreign students is more favourable than that of our own , to maintaining regular habits , suited to their occupations and duties .
