Simeon Dubious Take up all his notes ?  --  Now I do n't think he will .  --  No , no  --  that 's impossible ! Why , sir , it is the current opinion , that he has more paper out , than all the specie in the state could redeem . Har . Harry Ha ! ha ! ha ! Well , Simeon , however current that opinion may be , I 'll not receive it , even at the discount the shavers take his bills  --  trust me ! none but fools would take the opinion at par . Sim .

Jacob Well , friend , I can not clear thy doubts , in any other manner , than by assuring thee my arrangements can not be altered .  --  In the time I tell thee , call , and thou shalt have thy money , but now I can not help thee .  --  Wert thou a poor tradesman , whose necessities could not wait , I would do it ; but those who are not in want , must wait till I redeem all . Sim . Simeon Dubious Well , if you wont , you wont  --  so I 'll go and speculate on ' em  --  damn the banks ! Exit . Jacob .

Chief Clerk There goes another of those knowing fools , who think they have made a bargain by disposing of Jacob 's money , even should they pay you to take it  --  however common sense might teach them , that if we take it for goods , we must certainly think it will be good eventually ; but come , let us deal honourably , and send him the best to suit the market he intends them for .

Ed . Edward ( Catches her in his arms , ) Thank , you , thank you , Louisa ! Now will I rest satisfied .  --  But , oh ! Louisa ! did you but know this Craveall , as I do , you would not thus defer my happiness . Lou .

Ed . Edward Oh , yes , I do , I was lost in admiration at the tortousity of his whole person  --  but hush ! they are here . Enter Percent and Craveall . Perc . Old Percent ( to Edward , ) Pray , sir , what are you doing here ? I thought I had balanced your account long ago  --  your leaf in my ledger is clos 'd , and the balance is against you . Ed .

END OF THE SECOND ACT . ACT III . Scene I.  --  A Room  --  Edward and Harry discovered sitting and drinking  --  Harry half seas over . Har . Harry Why Ned , damme , my boy , what is the use of all this shilly-shallying ? Why the devil do n't you post up your ledger and see how your account stands with her ? Ed . Edward I have , and find the books stand thus :  --  the only objections she has to uniting her fate with mine , are  --  by the will of her late uncle , she must marry whom her guardian pleases , or loose her fortune , which in case of her refusal , devolves on her guardian . Har . Harry Well , damn it , Ned , never mind ; let him take it , and you take the girl : as long as I have a stiver , you shall share it with me ; so do you go and bring the affair to a conclusion . Ed . Edward I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time require it , I shall not hesitate to tax your generosity . But I have hopes from old Craveall 's character ; Louisa 's fortune consists chiefly in the stock of the Washington and Warren bank , which you know is at present supposed worth nothing ; when he becomes acquainted with this circumstance , no doubt he will be glad to get off : and I have my doubts of the ability of the bank to raise all its paper . But I 'll away , and try her once more . Though I have her promise , " A bird in the hand " you know , Harry  --  Har . Harry " Is worth two in the bush . " Exit Edw 'd . What a devil of a fool this love makes a man . Now there 's Ned , for instance , was one of the most sensible fellows in the place ; but now  --   --  She is a dam 'd fine girl ! and  --  by the bye  --  I believe he is as sensible as ever . I 'll go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craveall the bank is n't worth a d  --  n  --  though I shall tell a d  --  d lie at the same time  --  I believe it as good as any bank in the state .  --  Poor Ned ! I wish he may succeed . SONG  --  Harry . This love is the devil , tormenting one ever ; Heigho ! poor Ned . ' T is worse than king's-evil , the gout , or bank fever : Heigho ! poor Ned . But when by jealous fears arous 'd , You 'd think , poor devil ! he 'd been sous 'd In cayenne , head and ears all over : Gad ! what a wretched wight 's a lover . Alas ! poor Ned . And when he 's possess 'd of the damsel so charming : Heigho ! poor Ned . He thinks he is bless 'd , which I think is alarming : Heigho ! poor Ned . Soon as the honey-moon is o'er , He 's e'en more wretched than before ; ' T was then to meet , he 'd risk all evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alas ! poor Ned ! Exit . Scene II .  --  A Street . Enter Simeon Dubious . Sim . Simeon Dubious Well ! so far , so good . I have got clear of these confounded bills , and by this time , my goods must be all sold , and soon I shall jingle the cash in hard dollars . I 'll now go and see Mister Sellquick , the auctioneer , and  --  Ah ! here comes my uncle Craveall . Enter Craveall , not noticing Simeon . Crav . Craveall Bad ! bad ! So it seems that her fortune is in Washington and Warren bank stock ; a pretty trick they wanted to play me ! I told Mister Per cent I would consider on it , and so I have  --  and it will never do  --  no  --  let me see  --  no , no , it wo n't do .  --  I 'll go home and write him word of my determination  --  no , I 'll call this evening , as I promised him  --  ( Simeon , who during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes him by the coat , and pulls him  --  Craveall falls )  --  murder ! robbery ! murder ! Sim . Simeon Dubious Why , uncle , it 's only me  --  I only wanted to speak to you  --  let me help you up ? Crav . Craveall Ah ! is it you , you scape grace ! you have the strength of a giant  --  a n't you ashamed of yourself to pull me about in such a manner ? what do you want ? Sim . Simeon Dubious I only wanted to ask how you were , but you look pure well to-day , uncle . Crav . Craveall Ah , you rogue , you flatter me ; but what brought you this way ? Sim . Simeon Dubious Why , uncle , I 'm speculating  --  I 've gotten clear of five hundred dollars of Jacob 's bills for goods at par , and now I 'm going  --  Crav . Craveall To turn them into hard cash .  --  Fine boy ! fine boy ! Yes , you have a head for contriving  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and help me home , you young dog ! you have hurt me confoundedly ; come along . Exit Craveall led by Simeon .

Well , Louisa , are you ready to obey my commands : To marry the man of my choice , or loose your fortune ?  --  What say you ? Lou . Louisa I will never marry contrary to my inclinations  --  true , my fortune is in your possession , and by a most arbitrary will I must lose it on refusing to obey you on the point of matrimony  --  but , sir , I hope you will not be so ungenerous to deprive me of that which can do you no good  --  at any rate , I will not marry that miser . Perc . Old Percent Beware , girl ! he will be here anon ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or take the consequences . Enter Servant . Ser . Servant Mister Craveall , sir . Perc . Old Percent Show him in . Exit Servant . Enter Craveall and Simeon . Crav . Craveall Good day , sir , you see I am a man of my word . Lou . Louisa Before you proceed any further , sir , I must candidly tell you I will not marry you . Crav . Craveall Not so fast , young lady , not so fast . ( Turning to Percent . ) Mister Percent , I have considered , and have concluded that the times are so hard , and the young lady 's fortune consists of shares in a bank which is thought broken : I say , having considered all this , I beg leave to decline the honour you intended me , and the young lady 's inclinations  --  Perc . Old Percent What , sir , do you refuse my ward ? Enter Edward . Ed . Edward Does he refuse Louisa ? then , sir , give her to me without a fortune , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old Percent ( to Craveall . ) Since you refuse her , sir , I will once in my life do a good action .
