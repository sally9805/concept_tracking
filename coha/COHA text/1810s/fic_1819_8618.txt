MOLLY FISHER . SERAPHINA . Main text Act . I. SCENE FIRST . Sea-shore in Gloucester . First and Second Fishermen , fishing from a rock . Enter Timothy . Tim . Timothy Halloa ! my friends .  --  What fishing sport to day ? 1st . Fish . First Fisherman Something , I guess , has scared the fish away . 2nd . Fish . Second Fisherman Forgot by codfish , and by mackarel left ; Of food and fun we are alike bereft . Tim . Timothy Fish on my lads , perhaps some luckier line , May bring your children wherewithal to dine ; Their mother ocean feeds them at her breast , To brave her perils , and to guard her nest . 1st . Fish . First Fisherman Alack-a-day , no fishes are there here , They all are gone to caucus , or to prayer ; Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sarve , They will not bite , and we forsooth must starve . 2d . Fish . Second Fisherman How now , what sail there ? ' t is our daddy 's smack ; See brother Jonathan is coming back ; I scent the cod-fish in the gales below , A momentary meal bestow . Tim . Timothy Unask 'd , yet welcome ; I will stay and dine ; You find the chouder  --  and I 'll find the wine . Enter Jonathan in haste  --  amazed and terrified . 1st . Fish . First Fisherman Why ! brother Jonathan , you look quite pale , Have you the cholic , or some other ail ? Jon . Jonathan No ail have I , but that which I have seen , A snake  --  a whale  --  a mighty horse marine ! He rais 'd his head up underneath our stern , And shook our boat like butter in a churn ; His length was eighty feet .  --  Mate entering . Mate . Mate I swear ' t was more ! Jon . Jonathan And thirty castles on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop brother  --  from your youth , You know you always did despise the truth ; And many a birch thy tutor did apply , The broken relic of a youthful lie . Tim . Timothy Such marvellous tales may make the idle stare , But we are hungry  --  now for better fare . Jon . Jonathan No better fare , alas ! have I to bring ; No , not a fish , nor any living thing That in the water dwells ; O ! wretched plight , The monster ate them all before our sight . Mate . Mate The speckled mackarel and the slippery eel , Cods  --  tom cods  --  lobsters , all his vengeance feel ! He eats them all , and lashes with his tail , The panting porpoise , and the spouting whale . Tim . Timothy Now , if the deacon , or the parish squire , Should swear to this  --  I 'd swear he was a liar ; Let 's see how far the rogue 's inclin 'd to knave it , Let Justice Portly take his affidavit . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jon . Jonathan Gents , I do not fear , That which I saw most truly to declare ; But fear I shall , while I alive remain , To see that monster of the deep again . Exeunt omnes . SCENE SECOND . Insides of a Lawyer 's Office . Enter Justice Portly into his office  --  soliloquizing . Jus . Justice Portly To be a magistrate  --  A country Squire ! To look at Burns , and then to poke the fire ; To loll supinely in my chair at ease , With more of children infinite than fees , To scare the rogues  --  the servants to indent , To marry girls  --  who frequently repent  --  To scold at constables  --  and debtors dun  --  To wear a wig  --  too oft the source of fun . This is the meed of my scholastic knowledge , The ne plus ultra of my hopes in college ; Yet rogues are few , and marriages are less ; Why they are not more frequent , I ca n't guess ! ( Knocking at the door . ) Enter Timothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and take a seat ! Tim . Timothy Your worship most devotedly we greet . Jus . Justice Portly What ails the town ?  --  What rogue is caught ? What goods unlicensed into Glou'ster brought ? Hats off , and speak  --  but mind not more than one , Nor he begin , until his neighbor 's done . Tim . Timothy Your worship ! most respectfully we pray That in due form , with all solemnity , Touching a certain snake , you swear this man ; If oath to such a wapper , make he can . Jus . Justice Portly Now for the truth ! you mariners can tell Who use a bucket  --  what is in a well . Jon . Jonathan If in this statement truth I do forego , Ne'er may my line another nibble know ; My hooks be rusted , pestilent my bait , And idleness and famine be my fate . Tim . Timothy This looks in earnest : Jon . Jonathan Sir you 'll find it so ! Else wherefore live I in a fishing scow : T'was noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took our lines in , and threw out our log ; And underweigh , for home and Glo'ster steering , Close on our lee , a mighty mass appearing ; We hauled our wind , more leisurely to see What kind of animal the thing might be . Ten feet his head . Mate . Mate Forty , the log-book says . Jon . Jonathan He raised securely at our smack to gaze . His breath was smoke ! Mate . Mate Too serious for a joke His breath was full of fire , but not of smoke . Jus . Justice Portly What 's in the log-book  --  let the log-book say . Mate . Mate Your worship 's pardon , I devoutly pray ! Jon . Jonathan His hull in shape was like a flour barrel , And scales of brass he wore for his apparel  --  He seemed of bronze . Mate . Mate No ! damn-me , he was blue ? Jus . Justice Portly Another interruption you shall rue ; And let me warn you , rovers of the main , I 'll not permit ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fork 'd , and lifted high in air , Seem 'd like the bowsprit of a man of war ; Sometimes at rest upon the wave he lay , Then cut his cables and ran swift away Apparently for exercise and prey . The fishes fled him , but they fled in vain , Heaven only knows , what shoals he does contain ! Jus . Justice Portly Is this all true ? Jon . Jonathan As Hull beat Dacres , yes ! Mate . Mate And no one now-a-days doubts that , I guess Jus . Justice Portly Touching his head  --  give further explanation ! Jon . Jonathan I touch his head ! not I , for all the nation ; Jus . Justice Portly I mean its looks Sir  --  come Sir , have a care , How you offend the court that 's sitting here , Or I 'll commit you Sir ! Tim . Timothy That 's fair . Jon . Jonathan I saw his head , " but darkly thro ' a glass , " And can not tell if horse , or mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This I know ; His head had all the appearance of a cow , And had I seen Miss Europy , his prize , I would have sworn it Jupiter 's disguise . Jus . Justice Portly A scholar , and a mariner combined , A pretty kernel in a rugged rind . Jon . Jonathan His back was scatter 'd o'er with hills  --  Between The waters rush 'd  --  but still the mounts serene , Upon the foaming fretting waves look 'd down , With a most lofty supercilious frown . Jus . Justice Portly The story thickens  --  as I eschew evil , I strongly do suspect it is the devil ; In the same garb , in paradise he wore , That fatal suit to me and many more ! Jon . Jonathan As we approach 'd he made his exit quite , First charm 'd us in , then charm 'd us out of sight . He left us open mouth 'd , surpris 'd and sad , Like Hamlet looking for his royal dad . Jus . Justice Portly This sailor is intelligent I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timothy ' T is so with all New-England 's gallant race , Eager to learn , investigate , and trace The world around them  --  knowledge is their aim , Hence is their happiness , and hence their fame . Jus . Justice Portly I 've done with you Sir , now you may retire . ( Exeunt all but Justice Portly . ) Jus . Justice Portly A finer job I never could desire . For sceptic appetites I 'll make a feast , One thousand affidavits at the least . O ! that the snake , for woman 's ruin made , Should patronize me in my honest trade ; Let a new sign upon my door appear :  --  Snake ! snake ! snake affidavits , taken here ! Mean time I 'll to the Mayor 's , that he may Learn the eventful secrets of the day . SCENE THIRD . Inside of a Kitchen . Enter Molly Fisher , and Tom Codus , embracing . Tom . Tom Codus As fishes carry pearl within their eyes , So in my sight is all that I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I be blind , O Molly Fisher ! sweetest of thy kind . Molly . Molly Dear to my sight as hot , fresh , pumpkin pies , On them and thee alternate feast my eyes ; E'en when I sleep , my thoughts to thee are carried , And oft I dream , heigho : that we are married . Tom . Tom Codus Thy wish was father , Molly , to that thought , And if we are not married , why we ought : Thou know'st fall well that I do love thee honey , But can not wed thee , yet , for want of money ; The rich are gods upon this purse proud earth , And tinsel is the evidence of worth . Molly . Molly Cruel papa , to cut our hearts in twain , And measure love , as he would measure grain . Tom . Tom Codus To get enough to wed thee , I have been , Through hot and cold ! aye , and thro ' thick and thin ; For you to Afric once , to India thrice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leghorn bonnet mark 'd another trip , I do n't know what it was  --  Molly . Molly I do  --  ' t was chip . Two other gifts I can not now recall , Molly . Molly An India handkerchief , and cashmere shawl : Tom . Tom Codus A cross , from Cadiz , Molly . Molly But you do forget , Your own dear picture in Scotch pebbles set ! That is the brightest , fairest , richest far ; The ruddy likeness of a yankee tar . Tom . Tom Codus Ah , Moll ! I 've been in storms much knock 'd about , My rigging injured and my bolts drove out . To be with Captain Riley was my lot , Tho ' he to put me in his book forgot . Molly . Molly Well is it true , an Arab does endure Three hundred years ?  --  O what a sovereign cure ' Gainst early death . I care not where I die , But I should love to live in Araby . Tom . Tom Codus An Arab sun is like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Where strange unreal portraitures appear , Pictures of folly , fantasy or fear . Let not the traveller to his vision trust , Whose eyes at every step are fill 'd with dust . But that 's all over  --  we 're afloat again , A notion strikes me midships in the brain ; Moll , you must know , now open all your eyes , Aye and your mouth to testify surprise  --  Molly . Molly Well I 'm all ready . Tom . Tom Codus As I said before , A curious monster is about our shore , His length two hundred feet or more ; Molly . Molly Why , how you talk ! Tom . Tom Codus Aye ! and his tail , He uses as a twig whip on the whale  --  He vomits fire , and ne'er before was seen , Such a terrific animal marine . In form a serpent , and an uncouth one  --  Heaven only knows what mischief he has done . Molly . Molly O ! mother Eve ! if such a snake as that . Coiled round thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wonder that he took thee in , But rather that he let thee out a gain Tom . Tom Codus There is , ' t is said , a yard or two of black , Somewhere about the centre of his back ; Sinbad used there to cook his daily meals ! Of salmon , sheep-head , silverfish and eels ; To catch this serpent shall be my endeavour , If I succeed ' twill be amazing clever . We 'll marry then , our fortunes will be made , ' T is worth at least one half the India trade . Molly . Molly Why so it will , go Tom and catch the snake , And I 'll begin to do our wedding cake . Tom . Tom Codus But if I fail ? Molly . Molly Why then like Hamlet 's mother , The feast of one day answers for another . ( going . ) Tom . Tom Codus Stop Moll , let 's have a song before we go  --  ' T is fashionable , and there 's not a crow , Since Incledon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why not ? By the same impulse both alike are led , One for his corn , the other for his bread . The town is vocal , ask a maid the hour , And she begins to hum " poor Evelyn 's bower ; " The ambitious Sweep ! as high as he can fetch , Pops out his head and gives you " Fancy 's sketch . " Shakspeare was wrong to call the world a stage , It is an orchestra  --  singing 's the rage ; Hamlet said too the world is out of tune  --  We live too late , or Hamlet lived too soon . Molly . Molly I 'll try to oblige you , but I sing so so , The prettiest warblers are the worst , you know . SONG . TABITHA 'S BOWER . Oh ! weep for the hour , When to Tabitha 's bower , The chief of the robbers , with false keys came ; The sun was in bed . But the moon shook her head , And cried " do n't steal the clothes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rest , Was over and he drest To walk in the broadway of heaven next morn ; But when the maid awoke , How distressing was the joke , Her petticoats were stolen , and she forlorn . A Scotch mist lay , On the narrow path way , With the marks of the boots , that the clothes-thief wore ; But the maiden 's feet are bare She has lost her only pair Of slippers , and dares not to budge from the door . The next sun 's ray , Soon tepified the clay , came ; And the ground was warm and dry , where the clothes-thief But alas , the robber wag , Has not left a single rag , To warm the skin of Tabitha  --  Oh ! fie for shame . ( Exeunt omnes . ) SCENE FOURTH . A Library . Enter Mayor , Justice , and attendants . May . Mayor This unexpected visitor , I guess , Will our good citizens of Glo'ster bless : Our inns are full , the world is on the road , And every hackman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall turn him to a good account ; Of wealth and wonder the exhaustless fount ; Let Salem boast her museum , and her witches , Her statues Newb'ry , Marblehead her riches  --  We from them all the shining now will take , The snake and Glo'ster , Glo'ster and the snake ! Mayor , Mayor to first attendant . To Boston , famous for its men of sense , Post we immediate this intelligence . Go tell the Parsons that the Devil 's caught , ' Twill save them much of preaching and of thought . To second . Rouse all the cordwainers , none else in Lynn , And with them make a contract for the skin . To first . To an apothecary sell the root , He 'll certify ' t is genuine , no doubt . To Julien pledge the fin , the soup and steaks  --  They feed on terrapins , why not on snakes ? Consult the learned , send a painter down , To take the likeness of the snake and town . To both . Meet not a woman but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in Glo'ster ; For women 's tongues were bells , when bells were none , And even now there 's not a better one . ( Exeunt attendants . ) Enter Servant on one side . First Serv . First Servant Mayor of Glo'ster , a young snake is hatch 'd . Enter Servant on the opposite side . Second Serv . Second Servant My gracious liege the little snake is catch 'd , This letter tells his colour , shape , and size ; I saw him , Sir , aye , with these very eyes . Mayor , Mayor ( reading . ) " Yesterday morn , about the break of day , A little snake was seen to bend its way Towards the water , which e'er he could reach He met , good luck ! he met with captain Beach . The doughty captain near the margin stood , Armed with the trident pitchfork of the flood ; The missile pitchfork drank the reptile 's blood . Assailed alone , the serpent 's choler rose , And he essayed to bite the captain 's toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He look 'd around for grass , but none was nigh ; One piteous look upon the ocean cast , Relaxed his teeth and through them breathed his last . " Enter Timothy , bringing in the little snake in a glass vessel . May . Mayor Who have we here ; Tim . Timothy Sir , we delighted come . Here 's the young snake in best New-England rum : He comes to prove his birth , and set at rest The sceptics , who would make his dad a jest . May . Mayor Take him to Boston , let the learned there Discuss him , and his qualities compare With the leviathan ; but where 's his head ? Tim . Timothy Cut off , my liege ! May . Mayor I thought you better bred . Tim . Timothy His head , like Buckingham 's of old , is off  --  May . Mayor Then will the learned grieve , the sceptics scoft Still we will have our pennyworth of fun ; A little snake is better far than none . ( Exeunt . ) END @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . Inside of a Museum . Enter Linnus and Scepticus . Scep . Scepticus The world 's turned topsy turvy , and mankind In quest of monsters monstrously inclined , Rack their invention , prodigies to find . When found what are they ? like a maniac 's dream , Exactly the reverse of what they seem : An hour 's amusement , or a week of wonder , An infant scare-crow , or a learned blunder ! Linn . Linnus You are incredulous  --  evolving time , As he unrolls the destinies sublime Of nations , insects , fishes , birds , and men , Bids not the self-same scenes recur again , But with new characters adorns the page , And gives distinctness to each passing age . There is no genius , where there 's nothing new , And nothing wonderful in what is true . Scep . Scepticus Where there are blockheads ready to believe , There will be knaves as eager to deceive ; Deception is an universal trade , And more by that than any other 's made . We should be always on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never trust their eyes Or ears alone  --  Linn . Linnus Philosophers do more , With artificial optics they explore Earth , air and ocean  --  all that 's in them see , And cram the world into philosophy . Scep . Scepticus Aye , all is gorged , without regard to size , As I have seen a snake , a rat its prize , Half swallowed , try , but try in vain , To swallow or disgorge the rat again , Curse its voracious appetite , and die ! Thus fatal are thy dreams , philosophy ! Poor lady Teazle , found behind the screen , Was not a more humiliating scene , Than those who follow 'd and believed in too , The modest , lunar maiden , Caraboo ; And when had lunacy a prettier toy Than the all-seeing , touching M'Avoy ? Lin . Linnus Aye , these on Cockneys tried their various arts , But we are men of more extensive parts ; Infants , with us , in sciences excel , As Zera Colburn 's relatives can tell ; Nature too , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambert , and the Westbrook calf ; The latter honor 'd by the good opinion Of the great chief of our immense dominion . Scep . Scepticus Again I tell you , neighbour , have a care ; Things often seem , what they too seldom are . Linn . Linnus The people here are far too cute to be The victims of a false credulity . Scep . Scepticus I do remember , when they cut the hair And shaved the beard and whiskers of a bear ; And having dress 'd him in mens ' clothes , they swore He was the native of some foreign shore ; And what they said , philosophy said o'er  --  Till of his upright posture sadly tir 'd , A stranger cut the rope , as he desir 'd That held him up :  --  then quickly on all fours Out ran the bear , and broke into the doors Of the Insurance Office  --  there in peril brought  --  The risk was novel , the insurers thought :  --  He fled for refuge to the water 's side , Where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not counterfeit his shape , And could not bear to be a man or ape . Linn . Linnus Why these are laughing things , laughing 's no sin : Some smile , some laugh , some simper , and some grin , The wise you tickle , but you ca n't deceive , For when we laugh , ' t is always in our sleeve . Scep . Scepticus Redheifer 's idea of perpetual motion , A Yankee  --  no ! a Philadelphia notion , Made calves ' heads of you all . ' T was not enough ; And now you have the Snake , most silly stuff  --  Both born in interest  --  of detection sure  --  Both desperate remedies for folly 's cure . Linn . Linnus That there are puzzles can not be denied , That mortify sagacity and pride . Whether the gracious dews ascend or fall ? And if a whale be any fish at all ? What name old Adam to a salmon gave , And if the serpent 's of the land or wave ? Scep . Scepticus Of neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceit or artful gain . Where has he been ere this ? Why not before , Why now apparent on our Yankee shore ? Linn . Linnus Cause and effect like shrimps on shrimps depend . And these begin just where the others end . The serpent from his couch of floating fire , Had Milton 's leave a moment to retire , Through colder realms as fled the heated mass , The melting mountains hiss 'd to feel him pass . This cause alone must always hence suffice For the diffusion of the polar ice . The Cambridge telescope I 'll straitway borrow , And go and take a squint at him to-morrow . To men of science what discernment 's given ! Astronomers discover fish in heaven . Enter Seraphina . Here comes my daughter . Estimable pearl ! How sweet is understanding in a girl ! New charms to beauty learning gives , and then Beauty to learning tenders them again . Ser . Servant These are twin graces , virtue is the third . Scep . Scepticus Excellent well  --  a volume in a word . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely union dwell the triple fair . Ser . Servant He who the graces painted , might of thee Borrow the colouring of soft flattery . Scep . Scepticus ' T is nature 's colouring , and it will endure . Ser . Servant In feeling grateful , but in language poor , I can not say how rich in my esteem Is your opinion . Self 's a dangerous theme ; We know not what we are , nor what we seem : Therefore a truce . To Linnus Sir , I 've been o'erturning The various books of fish and serpent learning , The name and character to ascertain Of the invented monster of the main . The first in history , ( here let me be brief , Author , alas ! of all our sin and grief  --  ) The first was he , who climbed in paradise , His shape uncertain  --  undefin 'd his size . Indeed some modern authors say as much As that he was a baboon , or some such  --  Linn . Linnus That 's the received opinion . On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Servant The next in old Campania appeared , And Regulus and all his army scared . The animal y'cleped Boa Constrictor , Cared not for Consul , Tribune , Oedile , Lictor ; In violation of the rules of war , He slew the sentinels  --  and wide and far A moving pestilence , with baneful breath , He spread around him universal death ; Till Regulus , collecting all his force Of infantry , artillery and horse , In a pitched fight , which did two days consume , Killed him , and sent his monstrous skin to Rome . Now if he were not dead  --  this might be he , Tired of the land , and bathing in the sea . Linn . Linnus It does not follow that he 's dead , my dear , For serpents shed their covering every year . A better proof of victory had been To send the snake himself , as well as skin . Ser . Servant Why , so it would , for Mr. Peake avows The highest evidence the case allows Should be adduced  --  especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horace says , nature is a stubborn thing , And should be met with ample reasoning . Scep . Scepticus The Roman , then , did not deserve his greeting , And got his triumph by an act of cheating , This proves that hoaxing , Is an art as old , As much in vogue too , as the love of gold . Ser . Servant O'er sad Laocoon , I with Virgil wept , And almost felt the reptile as he crept Around the dying group .  --  O ! hapless sire , To see thy children crully expire ! O ! wretched children , their dear sire to see Press 'd in the coils of deathful agony . Enter Servant . Serv . Servant Sir , dinner 's ready . Linn . Linnus Go and tell my wife  --  This eating is a dreadful tax on life ; There are sixteen waking hours in a day , One fourth of which on meals is thrown away , Ten years in forty in the noble work Of cutting meat up with a knife and fork . O ! Rumford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ardent learned and deep , Had'st thou but staid on earth a little longer , Thou would'st have found the means to starve out hunger . Ser . Servant If life could live without the toil of eating , That blockhead Malthus , who deserves a beating For writing against marriages , would see , How useless ' t is to war ' gainst heaven 's decree . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE SECOND . Gloucester  --  Justice 's Office . Enter Mayor , Justice , Painter , &c.; &c.; May . Mayor You are a limner , Sir , Pain . Painter That is my trade ! May . Mayor Welcome to Glo'ster , then , your fortune 's made ; Your name immortal with our loyal town Shall from the snake accumulate renown . Pain . Painter I 've brought two kegs of yellow ochre down , One of vermillion , one of Spanish brown ; Two casks of oil to keep the water smooth , That I may paint him to the very truth . May . Mayor Here is a spy-glass , fitted to discover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night-glass , for ' t is chiefly then , Wrapt in sublimity , he looks at men . Pain . Painter So much the better ; we have need of shade To keep off beauty , which without its aid Would burn with most intolerable blaze , And scorch the eye-lashes of those who gaze . May . Mayor Heres a kaleidoscope , another glass . Pain . Painter I 'll none of that , ' t is counterfeit  --  ' twont pass  --  It is the mirror of coquettes , where they Learn to allure , to flatter and betray . The very instrument would blush to know The constant changes it doth undergo . Look ye , ( the Mayor looks thro ' it )  --  What doth it seem ? May . Mayor A cone Of sparkling diamonds  --  now they all are gone . Pain . Painter Even in your grasp inconstant ; why an eel Would use more ceremony  --  you might feel Hnn move  --  but this sagacity defies Falsehood itself , a spectacle of lies . Jus . Justice Portly Yet in appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe than just , On circmnstamial proof to hang a thief , Making frail mind the standard of belief . As if we could ordain things , or could know What heaven above accomplishes below . We , upon whom this little tabe doth play Like Circe on the Greeks  --  yet who 'll compare , This trifling toy with earth 's majestic sphere ? And this unknown , in that the right assume , To tell what was , or is , or is to come . May . Mayor We are becoming serious and diffuse , They who lose time , says Frederick , all things lose . Pain . Painter Aye , time is every thing , had Grouchy been Where Bulow was , why quite another scene Had been thy scarlet landscape , Waterloo ! May . Mayor Now you begin on politics , go to . Jus . Justice Portly I think the point in issue is the snake , Whose likeness in extens you must take . You 've seen the young one and these writings here , With oral narratives you will compare  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then you will achieve the prodigy . May . Mayor Here is another glass , that magnifies Let Glo'ster seem at least of giant size ; As to the snake . Pain . Painter Your wishes let me know . May . Mayor It is not prudent to o'erbend a bow , So make him large , but give him room to grow : And whatsoe'er his stature you ordain , Why make the city half as big again . ( Retire Justice and Mayor . ) Pain . Painter Ye guardian powers , that crown the painter 's art , To me your dazzling radiance impart . By angel hands was blest Corregio led , And heaven taught Raphael how to paint a head ; Gave Titians colours their immortal glow , And formed that triple artist Angelo . Each in his sphere . Albani for the graces , In history Rubens , and Vandyke in faces . Lorraine in landscape painting did excel , In statesman Stewart , and Malbone in a belle . Snider in brutes , and Hogarth in a rake , But my ambition 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught Van Eyck the use of oil , Now guide my brush and recompense my toil ! For the great theme be all in me comprest , And shew a northern painter like a West . ( Exit Painter . ) Jus . Justice Portly There 's a new question for the lawyers here , Which they alone can competently clear  --  Whether the monster can included be , In the law phrase the " Perils of the sea ; " May . Mayor That point I 've sent for counsel to explain , My messenger I see returns again . Enter Timothy . Tim . Timothy As you desired , I asked the squire 's advice , Who seem 'd unwilling ' till he had his price  --  Which pocketing , a sudden light came o'er His face  --  like sun-beams rushing thro ' the door Of a dark room  --  expanding all the while  --  His visage grew an universal smile . May . Mayor What said he then ? Tim . Timothy Nothing , save by his looks , But straightway set about consulting books , First took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abbot upon wrecks ; To Jacobs then , to Jacobson turn 'd next , Then shook his head and stroked his chin perplex 'd . May . Mayor What gave he no opinion ? Tim . Timothy Yes he did , But so uncertain , ' t was a legal quid , ( Reading it . ) " A land-born snake ! encounter 'd in the sea , Can not a peril of the ocean be ; If ocean-born , it altereth the case , Desideratum , where 's his native place ? May . Mayor How could you solve a query so obscure ? Tom . Tom Codus Except with snake-root I do n't know , I 'm sure . May . Mayor Now does it move me to demand the fee , Or satisfaction of this mystery . Jus . Justice Portly The first you 'll ask in vain , ' t is ' gainst the trade Ever to give up what has once been paid  --  And as for mystery , why it is their sphere  --  The dark they covet , deprecate the clear ; Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless , save in cloudy weather . ( Exeunt omnes . ) END OF ACT SECOND . Act . III . SCENE FIRST . Large Picture of the town of Gloucester , and the big Snake . The little one in a glass case  --  other Pictures distributed about the room . Painter , Solus . Pain . Painter In water colours sweet Narcissus shone , And Niobe looked beautiful in stone . Congruity 's essential to design , We never mingle vinegar and wine ; Hence do we always place coquettes on glass , Wits upon copper , warriors upon brass , Judges on parchment of their own decree , And fops on their appropriate fillagree ; Hence tapestry teems with nobles and with kings , Stiff ancient broidered artificial things , Exploded now  --  But see , who have we here ? The sage Linnus and his daughter fair , His pocket full of minerals I 'll swear , Of fossils , fish eyes and the elephant 's tusk , Of osseous relics and the water kusk ; While she his modest daughter smiles to see Herself over looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linnus Well , Sir , is it done ?  --  my patience all expired , My horses foundered , and postillions tired ; We 've travelled post . Ser . Servant And had a dreadful shake , To see this full length portrait of a snake , ' T is in a lying posture  --  well desigu 'd , To gain belief  --  Pain . Painter Young lady , you 're inclined To sneer , ( and I 'm exactly of your mind ; But ' twill not do to quarrel with our food , So I must swallow all the snaky brood . Ser . Servant An ostrich could not more  --  and you are right To enrich yourself by this attractive sight ; Jugglers look serious , when they most deceive , Impostors never for themselves believe . Linn . Linnus What doubt you still , and are you yet mistaken ?  --  Is it not just exactly like the Kraken ? Ser . Servant What that tremendous northern ocean worm , Whose countenance like Jonah 's caused a storm ; Who made a whirl-pool wheresoe'er he sunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falstaff among worms ! whose very waist , One mile 's circumference at least embraced . But yet his back no such excrescence bore , Pain . Painter Nor this , for his was painted flat before ; They caught this young one , from whose form we gather , Materials for the picture of his father . ( During this time Linnus is employed in examining the little snake  --  and writing an account of him . ) Ser . Servant ' T is all imagination then , I see , A fancy sketch , Pain . Painter What other should it be ? Do you not know it is the artist 's duty , To make , wherever he ca n't find beauty ; How would the modern belles indignant stare At pictures , not more pretty than they are  --  Talking of belles , See here a modern beau ! ( Uncovers a picture . ) Ser . Servant I 've seen the thing , and can not fail to know Its likeness ;  --  What a mop of hair !

Painter Not so ; For the excessive quantity below Shews fashion 's whim , which ever is to be In unaccounted contrariety ; Ser . Servant The Amazonian women did assume A manly conduct , so did those at Rome ; The table 's turn 'd and now a-days the beaux Strive to look feminine in ladies ' clothes ; Advice is odious , otherwise I 'd say , Let nature take her unrestricted way ; Improve they can not , but deform they can , And make a johnny crook-horse of a man . I 'll tell you how I worried one  --  I dropt My handkerchief  --  he stoop 'd  --  then stopt  --  Tried not to see it  --  tried to stoop again ; His corset was so tight , ' t was all in vain ; Then ( if you laugh 'd not ) you wou 'd surely grieve , To see him blush and pant and take his leave , At war with ladies ' handkerchiefs , poor fellow , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painter Aptly described ! most excellently hit ! Folly is always lawful prize to wit . Ser . Servant Then let it cruise in ball rooms , for ' t is there The gaudy glittering galleous repair ; Freighted with trifles , bartering of sighs , Of sugar kisses , glances , winks  --  white lies ; Of dancing matches to the wise a riddle , How silly they world look without a riddle . Scene Changes . Enter Servant with a letter to Linnus . ( Linnus reading . ) Linn . Linnus " I send you this , post haste ; you have within , A sample of the great  --  sea serpent 's skin .

O ! precious fragment , O convincing sign Of the existence of the monster 's line ; O proof most coveted ! Ser . Servant Why , it is a tale , A counterfeit , and can it sure avail ; To take you in , whose pleasure ' t is and study To hunt for fish in waters clear and muddy ; Who , not cotent with names that Adam gave , Christen 'd anew the tenants of the wave . Linn . Linnus I do determine the said skin to be The covering of some creature of the sea . Pain . Painter On what immensely wide and deep foundations , Philosophers do build their ratiocinations . Ser . Servant In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the bony pike . Linn . Linnus ( Putting on his spectacles . ) Why so it is  --  so be it if you will  --  We 've proof enough about the serpent still . Nor is it here alone that nature teems With monsters . Ser . Servant Folly every where has dreams . Linn . Linnus The fair Albiness with her pink-set eyes , From solar beams to noon-day darkness flies . And in the south the pea-green mermaids lave Their coral tresses in the azure wave ; While learned Damons look unheeded by With philosophic curiosity . Ser . Servant Ah ! who shall fix the philosophic goal ? Linn . Linnus He who thro ' earth shall walk from pole to pole  --  A new sublime discoverer has found The world 's like Paris , hollow under ground ; Globe within globe ! and all in one comprest , Like Hingham buckets huddled in a nest .

Linnus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the youthful traveller await ; Blow at the key-hole till the yielding snow Admits the key . Ah ! he is entered now ! What wond'rous scenes appear on every side , Long hidden truths  --  experiments untried , Gold trees which young the pious Roman knew , But guessed not then the size to which they grew ; Mammoths entire  --  all Virgil wrote and more I see him soon with curious eye explore  --  Thro ' nature fly with philosophic wings , And pierce the whole reality of things . Ser . Servant But who shall be the daring traveller 's guide ? Pain . Painter How with provisions can he be supplied ? Linn . Linnus O , vulgar obstacles to men of mind , Where did Ulysses his directions find ? Who fed ncas in the caves below . And other heroes that the fables show ? All had been welcome , but they stay so late , We know not of their travels or their fate . With better omens their successor goes . And brighter lights his glorious path disclose . How does my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveller 's return , And all the internals of the globe to learn . ( Exeunt comes ) SCENE SECOND . Great Drumming . Enter Tom Codus and Molly . Timothy , reading proclamation . Tim . Timothy " Whereas there long has hovered on our coast A huge sea monster , who does make his boast , That he annoys and mars our fishing trade , And bolds our harbors under snake blockade . And ' t is not fit that we should still endure An ill , for which there can be found a cure ; Now , know ye all , if any shall ensnare The aforesaid monster , and shall bring him here , So that our fisheries shall thrive once more , And cod and mackarel shall frequent our shore , Five hundred dollars shall reward his toil ; And all , and singular the serpent 's spoil : Moreover , he shall have New-England 's thanks , And honored mention to Sir Joseph Banks ; His vessel , too , for such marked resolution , Shall moor ' long side the frigate Constitution .

( Sign  --  " Snake Rendezvous . " Enter Tom , Jonathan , Mate , Sailors , &c.; Tom . Tom Codus I say my lads , you never yet did flinch , Whether the foe was Englishman or French ; Your gallant enterprise the world admires ! Before your stars the Turkish moon retires : You 've heard what Burke hath said , he never knew Such an advent'rous and intrepid crew  --  That you are every where . One can not go To a bleak rock , or barren waste of snow , A burning mountain or an arid sand , But sees a yankee soon as he sees land . Hear too from Dessalines , that scoundrel black , If coffee was in hell , you 'd bring it back . Not that I think the compliment so civil , To say  --  that you have dealings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before our eyes , A snake our valor and our skill defies ; Eats all our fish , while we inglorious stay Ashore , our jawing tacks aboard all day  --  Forbid it Neptune . Quick then all aboard ! With nets ! harpoons ! and ammunition stored The devil 's in him  --  if he 's not secured . ( Exeunt and embark . ) ( Scene Changes . ) Enter Mayor , Justice , Molly , Scepticus . Scep . Scepticus The crisis comes  --  as when deep mists conceal We know not what  --  still fancy will reveal The hidden object  --  and its name declare , Guessing its size , and shape , and look and air , But seen more clearly as the mists disperse , It proves to be exactly the reverse ; So  --  with this snake , if caught at all , ' twill be What least of all we did expect to see . Jus . Justice Portly Caught or not caught , my occupation 's gone In depositions I confide alone ; If he is caught there 's no more use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've too many . Molly . Molly If he 's not caught then all my hopes miscarry . Jus . Justice Portly What are they , pretty maiden ? Molly . Molly Sir , to marry . Jus . Justice Portly Why then my occupation is notgone , I am chief minister near Hymen 's throne ; Cupid and I well understand each other , We 're so much like , they take me for his brother . Molly . Molly Then Sir , in case as how the snake is taken , And I am not by my true love forsaken ; You 'll marry us . May . Mayor Two sad conditions lady ! For snakes are treacherous , and men unsteady , As to the snake , I fear he 'll not be found , Being last heard from in Long-Island Sound . The revenue-cutter chased him , it is said , But as she hoisted sail the creature fled ; Having received that night from some kind stranger A friendly intimation of his danger . Molly . Molly His swiftness too , while it ensures his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scepticus Send envy after him  --  the swiftest thing , In ocean  --  earth  --  or air  --  with fin or wing ; This never tires  --  nor ever pants for breath , Nor yields its victim , even after death . ( Great firing heard without . ) May . Mayor They are engaged , now doth this novel fight , Fill all my veins , with unconceiv 'd delight ; Back scene rises  --  vessel at a distance , discovered firing , several boats manned  --  the Snake passes  --  a boat rapidly following in the rear , having harpooned him  --  a vapour seen rising about the Snake . Jus . Justice Portly Aye , there they are  --  thus Cleopatra flew , With Anthony  --  afraid of Csar 's crew . Molly . Molly What means that vapour ? May . Mayor ' T is the fatal charm , With which they 're wont their victims to disarm . First fascinate  --  then vanquish and then slay , See  --  they return , the snake has lost the day . ( Vessel seen coming up . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature 's caught . The agony is o'er . Enter Linnus , Seraphina , &c.; &c.; Linn . Linnus Clear the Museum  --  let the pin-stuck race Of flies  --  and butter-flies , give instant place ; Mammoth and Elephant their exit make , For who chaims precedence above the Snake ! Enter Tom Codus . More welcome far than Jason with his fleece , To the strain 'd eyes of all admiring Greece ; Or than the Roman soldier with his arms , As full as he could hold of Sabine charms ; Or famed Columbus , who the curtain drew , That hid one half this goodly world from view . Philosophy her daring son doth own , And decks thy conquest with deserved renown . Tom . Tom Codus The Snake is caught ! but marvel not  --  if he Seem smaller far  --  than he was deem 'd to be  --  Fancy and fear distort the human sight , And truth and reason scarce can set it right .

Tom Codus He 's only twelve . Linn . Linnus O ! then its all a cheat . It is not he , but some base counterfeit . Tom . Tom Codus I 'll swear it 's he , and so will all my crew , Who saw him often  --  and his features knew ; Swear that the fish I 've caught 's the very same Scep . Scepticus How will philosophy endure this shame ? ( Music . ) Enter persons , bringing a Horse-Mackarel , or some fish , as much like the Snake as can conveniently be procured . Ser . Servant See here the creature comes , O sad mistake , To call an Albacore an ocean Snake . Scep .

Linnus O , let credulity be banished hence , And in her stead reign sober common sense , Deem nothing true that is not proved  --  nor then Believe it all  --  but doubt and doubt again Falsehood 's a floating superficial thing , But truth is deeper than the deepest spring . Ser . Servant Be not distrest , one object has been won , The Snake has been at least  --  the source of fun . Pain . Painter And profit too  --  as I can testify , Dear as Mcenas to the artist 's eye . May . Mayor A short lived fame on Glo'ster he has shed , That mourns to see him shrivelled thus  --  and dead ; And would extend his life  --  to save her own , What is there left to signalize the town ? Jus . Justice Portly O , hopes dissolved : O , disappointment sore ! Who shall confide in affidavits more . Ser . Servant So fares it always with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ; Imagine miracles without their need , Look wise in fancy  --  but are dupes indeed . Back matter FINIS .
