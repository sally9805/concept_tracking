TO THE PUBLIC . This comedy was first represented eleven years ago , in the New York theatre , and was received with flattering attention and applause . Those who are well versed in old english dramatic literature , will perceive that the author has enriched his work from those obsolete sources without forfeiting his claim to originality in the composition . After the lapse of so many years as have flown between the writing and publishing , the author feels an honest pride , while reviewing his play , that he can recommend it to the perusal of every father , husband , wife and daughter . April 13th , 1810 DRAMATIS PERSON April 13th , 1799 .

Sun rises during the scene . enter LODOVICO and CARLO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) A plague of this early rising say I My lord 's merry-making will sit sadly on my brow , for my head aches most spitefully . One would think it was his wedding-day instead of the fourth anniversary , by the speed with which he hastens to the palace of his lady 's father . A plague of this early rising , still say I ! Carlo . Carlo Is it then four years since my lord Hippolito wedded his most excellent lady ? Lodo . Lodovico Four years this day . Carlo . Carlo There were uncommon circumstances attending the match as I have heard imperfectly rumored . For I was then a student at Vienna . Lodo . Lodovico Marry were there O , I have need to remember the time . For on the same day , lost I two co-partners in revelry . Thou know'st Beraldo ? Carlo . Carlo What ! he whom the duke obliged to marry the lady Astrabel , old Brazzo 's daughter ? Lodo . Lodovico Even he He , who now lies in fetters for a mortal wound inflicted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the duke , who does not relish such jests , has sentenced him to death for the frolic Poor Beraldo ! thou and I and Hippolito have had many a roaring set to . On the self same day that Hippolito married the duke 's daughter , was Beraldo married by compulsion to Astrabel . Carlo . Carlo But this concerns not Hippolito 's story . Lodo . Lodovico True . Yet they are in some measure allied . Hippolito , was , before his marriage with my lady Beatrice , as simple a gentleman as I who now confront you , and much the same for merit , except not so abundant in wit : and for personal beauty . I think , I ever had the advantage  --  be that so or not , the lady Beatrice cast her maiden affections upon him and spite of my lord the duke , married him . It stood some time in balance whether Hippolito would be taller by a ducal crown or shorter by the head ; but the duke 's affection for his only child prevailing over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Ah ! there was music in the trio 's which Hippolito , Beraldo , and Lodovico made . But so it turns with the wheel of dame fortune ; up goes Hippolito for a prince , down goes Beraldo for a beggar , while I stick to the hub of the wheel , and though constantly turning round , remain in the middle still . Here comes the lady Beatrice . enter BEATRICE and LEONORA . Beat . Beatrice Good day , good gentlemen . We stir betimes this morning . Where tarries my lord ? Carlo . Carlo We know not , my lady .

Leonora Does signor Lodovico ever think , madam ? Beat . Beatrice Troth , Leonora , I believe not And yet t is no slight operation of mind , to bring discordant images so happily together as to strike mirth out of the comparison . Lodovico is a wit . Leon . Leonora Not a dry one , I 'll swear , for he is ever drenched in wine . Beat . Beatrice Yet if not dry , why is he ever drinking ? Leon . Leonora He has a thirsty wit , I grant you , lady .

The truth is , my lord the duke , your ladyship 's father , sent me last night , twig of grace that I am , to say to you and my lord Hippolito , that he should wait your coming ere he broke his fast this morning . But being benighted and having too much faith in my mule  --  my old com anion your ladyship knows  --  I gave him the rein and composed myself to a nap . What were the beast 's intentions , I know not ; but certain it is by the sequel , that instead of coming hither , he turned up to my lord Brazzo 's , and finding the front door open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taps with a wand on the shoulders , which a vulgar fellow might call cudgel blows , having removed the skin which hang curtains from over my eyes .

Hippolito Thou hast gone nigh to speak treason , fellow , in suggesting that a prince 's ambassador may be a fool . Fool . Fool I cry you mercy , my lord , I hold just the contrary . For if the prince take a fool and make of the fool an ambassador , it is no longer fool , but ambassador . Hip . Hippolito What becomes of the fool ? Fool . Fool Annihilated , my lord ! annihilated . Make a fool wise and the fool is no more . In the plenitude of power is wisdom ; ergo , an ambassador plenipotentiary , is a wise man .

Brazzo Call you me friend , my noble lord ? t is now some years since old Michael Brazzo stood in the sunshine of the court . I did not suppose that the duke or his worthy heir would remember so slovenly an attendant as old Brazzo . Hip . Hippolito O sir , our friends should be unto us as our jewels are ; valued as dearly being locked up and unseen , as when we wear them on our hands . Braz . Brazzo T is nobly said , my lord . Hip . Hippolito Trust me , good Michael Brazzo , it joys my heart to see that the frosty fingers of age have not chilled your blood . The sickle of time hath passed over you , yet , still you are the same .

Hippolito Then let thy tongue bestow it on my ear . I wait for it . Braz . Brazzo Thus t is . He , that makes use of gold to bless the poor : He , that at noon walks past the sheriffs door : He , whom mens ' blessings lift above the grave : He , that is neither lord or lawyers ' slave : He , that counts youth his sword , and age his staff : He , whose own hand engraves his epitaph : He , that in truth and virtue puts his trust :  --  That man is happy  --  for that man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thank you for the picture . Braz . Brazzo After this picture , my lord , do I strive to have my face drawn . I am not covetous . I am not in debt . I have fought by the duke 's side , but I never cringed at his feet . No man I fear ; no man I fee . I would not die like a rich man , to carry nothing away save a winding-sheet ; but like a just man , that can look back on the path he has trod , then turn and smile in death 's face as he shakes his dart at him . Hip . Hippolito You are happy , and doubtless make those around you so . Your wife and children . Braz . Brazzo ( with a sudden change of countenance ) My lord !  --  I have no wife  --  no children . Hip . Hippolito Is your wife dead , sir ? Braz . Brazzo She hath long dwelt in heaven . Yet is she not from me . Here , she 's here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool are married , they walk together like bailiff and debtor ; and when death comes they are separated . But a good couple are never parted . Hip . Hippolito You had a daughter too , sir , had you not ? Braz . Brazzo ( with great feeling ) Oh , my lord ! this old tree had one branch , and but one branch , growing out of it . it was young , it was fair , it was straight . I pruned it daily , drest it carefully , kept it from the wind , helped it to the sun ; yet for all my skill in planting , it grew crooked  --  the fruit it bore was bitter and made me sick at heart !  --  I hewed it down !  --  what 's become of it , I neither know nor care ! Hip . Hippolito Then can I tell you what 's become of it . That branch is withered . Braz . Brazzo So it was long ago . Hip . Hippolito Her name I think was Astrabel . Her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him not . ( with furious emotion ) Hip . Hippolito She is dead . Braz . Brazzo ( changing to tenderness ) Ha !  --  dead ? Hip .

Brazzo Dead ?  --  my last and best peace go with her ! dead ? is she dead ! well , well , I am glad on'tl No drunken reveler will now at midnight beat at her doors . The grave will protect her from pollution ' t is well . She will sleep now  --  and in her grave sleep all my shame and her own ; and all my sorrows ! and all her sins ! Hip .

Hot , hot , burning and dry  --  and no tear came to quench the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fever of your rage is dead , and the feelings of nature are again alive within you . Man is not man until his passion dies . Your daughter 's worser parts are dead , my lord , but still she lives : her mind and body graced with beauty and with virtue . Braz . Brazzo Does she live ? ( with tenderness which he suddenly represses ) Hip . Hippolito She is not dead : but lives in misery extreme . Poverty sits on her threshold ; and with whips , composed of want , disease , scorn and reproach , chases away all joy . To crown her woes , her husband , lies in jail condemned to death . Join with me and we shall save him . Braz . Brazzo Does she live then ? I am sorry I wasted tears upon a harlot ! but my handkerchief shall drink them up , and water wash all out again . Is she poor ? Hip . Hippolito Trust me , she is . Braz . Brazzo T is well . It should be so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brazzo Seven winters have past away , and her seat by my fire side been vacant .

Hippolito Work with me to preserve her husband 's life . Braz . Brazzo No . Let him hang ! one half of her infamy will then be out of the world . Hip . Hippolito Nay , but good Michael Brazzo . Braz . Brazzo I detest her : I curse him ! she 's not mine  --  she 's  --  Hip . Hippolito You are now beyond all reason . Braz . Brazzo I am then a beast . Sir , sir , I had rather be a beast and not dishonor my creation than be a doating , fond , indulgent father , and hug vice to my bosom because it was of my own begetting . Hip . Hippolito But common charity  --  Braz . Brazzo Ha , ha ! charity ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs stretched upon a bier . I would not give the paring of my nails to buy her spirit back .

Hippolito Fare you well ; I will no further touch you . exit Braz . Brazzo ( after a long pause , during which he walks and stops by starts ) Alas , my girl ! art thou poor ? poverty dwells next door to despair ; there is but a thin and broken wall between them . Poor Astrabel ! I have kept thee from my heart too long : but thou hast now rushed in and filled me to the overflowing . Yes : I will go to her .

Astrabel Thou dost not hear me ? Ber . Beraldo Yes , faith , I do . ( not attending to her ) I wonder how the inside of a tavern looks ? Astra . Astrabel Thou knowest too well , Beraldo : and too dear hath thy knowledge cost thee .

Beraldo I will be porter . I will stand at mine own door and let the world see , that a jail can not hold a brave spirit . I shall soar again ! fly high ! exit Astra . Astrabel How wild is his behavior ! o I fear the inmates of the prison have not cleansed his soul from the stains which the tavern had thrown on it .

Brazzo Oh ! ! Astra . Astrabel From that hour , I believe , he never inquired of me , or would hear my name . Meanwhile stung to madness with the indignity which my father had offered him .

Hope buoy 'd my husband up : he thought that yet he might be call 'd again to take his place at court  --  even though my father should not forgive him  --  : but when all this little pleasant estate was gone or nearly so  --  then , alas !  --  the sense of too severe resentment and punishment  --  of merit and repentance unheeded and trampled upon  --  I know not what  --  but poor Beraldo was sadly changed .  --  And yet his heart  --  Braz .
