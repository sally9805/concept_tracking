The blissful condition of the inhabitants of St. Domingo , when that fine island as first discovered and devastated by the Spaniards , was perhaps inferiour to the state of the natives , in many of the islands of the Pacifick . The general characteristicks of beauty of person , of gentleness and goodness of character , which are common to so many of them , furnish one of the most striking illustrations of the influence of climate on the disposition and habits of men ; while the first peopling of those islands , and the progress they have made beyond most other savages in several of the useful and ornamental arts , give occasion to a variety of reflections . Some of their productions very much resemble the Egyptian , and though they have never produced any monuments , to compare with the imperishable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to their moie recent origin , their smaller numbers , and smaller population , than to an inferiority of talent ; since many of their structures are by no means insignificant , and sonic of their productions full of ingenuity and taste . Proofs of this , besides the relations of other navigators , are furnished by the edifices dj*scribed by Captain Porter in the principal island of the Washington groupe , as well as in many of the ornaments , and particularly by the delineations in their practice of tattooing . The Essex being at sea only for warlike purposes , not employed in a voyage of discovery , was of course unprepared for such an undertaking , having neither scientifick men nor apparatus necessary for such a purpose . The ship even was not fitted for the voyage , which was only the continuance of a cruise at the discretion of her commander . The important services rendered by captain Porter , in giving a partial protection to our valuable whale fishery in the South Seas , and the enormous loss inflicted on the enemy , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that trade ; and the termination of his cruise in the Bay of Valparaiso , by one of the most desperate and gallant conflicts on record , are all familiar to the // publick , and do not fall within our present purpose to notice , as they would lead to other topicks of discussion than those we have in view ; for the same reason , we shall not take up the question of the conflicts with some of the tribes in the island of Nooaheevah . The quarrel with the Happahs , it was perhaps justifiable under all circumstances to settle in the manner he did , particularly as it was attendcd with such trifling injury ; but the war with the Typees , we most stronjy protest against . Captain Porter has with great fairness stated all the motives that engaged him reluctantly , in the expedition against them , and the evils that followed it , to those unfortunate natives ; he was placed in an arduous and critical situation , and his conduct should therefore be judged with reference to all the circumstances . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judgment . Independently of all considerations respecting his right to wage war with that tribe , the imminent hazard to which he exposed himself and his men in that perilous undertaking , was of greater importance than the object he had to accomplish . If they had all perished , and from his relation it is wonderful that they escaped , the loss to their country and themselves would have been much more serious than the destruction of his prizes , which it was one of his objects to prevent . We shall commence our extracts with some account of Porto Praya in the island of St. Jago . Since the visit of the Essex , however , a new governour and a more numerous garrison have been sent to these possessions , and their treatment of the Constitution in her last cruise was very different from that shewn to the Essex . At 9 o'clock on the morning of the 28th , I waited on his excellency , accompanied by some of the officers . He was engaged at the time on some business at the custom-house , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 11 the second in command , however , major Medina ( who spoke such English as he was enabled to pick up from the captains and crews of such American vessels as touched at the Isle of Mayo for salt , where he was governour , ) entertained us during the interval , making offers of his services in procuring the supplies , of which we gave him a list ; and , after making the necessary arrangements , and fixing on the prices , we waited on the governour , whom we found at his house , dressed in all his splendour to receive us . His reception was of the // most friendly nature , and I am persuaded he was much pleased to see us in the port . He appeared astonished that I should have sent in for permission to enter the port . I inform* ed him , that as the Portuguese were the allies of Great Britain , I had entertained doubts whether he would feel authorized to give us protection against a British force , should it appear ; hut so soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those doubts were removed . He expressed much re gret that the war had deprived them of the advantage arising from the American commerce , as they had been cut off from all their supplies , and were now destitute of bread , and every other comfort of life , except what the island afforded , which consisted chiefly in live stock and fruit . He told me that a little flour , or any thing else we could spare , would be most acceptable to him ; and invited me to make my dinner with him , on such scanty fare as he was enabled to give me ; adding , if 1 would come on shore next day , he would endeavour to provide something better . I accepted his invitation with as little ceremony as it was given ; and although there was but little variety of meats , he had an abundant supply of the best tropical fruits I ever tasted . The oranges were very fine . We this day commenced watering ; but , after having to roll the casks about 500 yards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the heavy surf . On the 29th , I again dined with the governour , and from that time until the morning of the 2d of December , we were occupied in getting on board refreshments and water ; but of the latter we were only enabled to get about 5000 gallons . The beef was very dear , and very poor ; a bullock weighing 300 weight , cost 35 dollars ; sheep were 3 dollars , but very poor ; oranges 40 cents per hundred , and other fruits in the same proportion , and in the greatest abundance . It is supposed that the ship had not on board less than one hundred thousand oranges , together with a large quantity of cocoa-nuts , plantains , lemons , limes , casad* , &amp;c. &amp;c . Every mess on board were also supplied with pigs , sheep , fowls , turkeys , goats , &amp;c. which were purchased very cheap ; fowls at three dollars per dozen , and fine turkeys at one dollar each ; many of the seamen also furnished themselves with monkeys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thence the // ship bore no slight resemblance , *s respected the different kind on board her , to Noah 's ark . In the town of Praya there are nut more than thirty whites ; the rest of the population is made up of slaves and free negroes , making altogether not more than three thousand , of whom about four hundred are soldiers ; all the officers , cxcept three or four , are mulattoes , and their priest is a negro , who possesses considerable polish in his manners . The soldiers are generally destitute of clothing from the waist upwards , and it can be asserted with a certainty of adhering strictly to the trutb , that there are not five serviceable miiskets in Praya . Most of them are witl*out any locks , their stocks broken off at the breech , their barrels tied into the stocks with a leather thong , or a cord made of the fibres of the cocoa-nut ; and it was no uncommon thThg to see a naked negro mounting guard , shouldering a mu*ket barrel only . Their cavalry were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jack-asses , and armed with broken swords . The governour informed me , it bad been 10 years since they had received any pay , or supplies of clothing or arms . The guns of different calibres mounted about Praya , for the defence of the place , although in commanding situations , are in a state equally bad as the muskets of the negroes . They are placed on ship 's carriages , which are old and rotten , scarcely holding together , without platform , shelter , or breast-work , except a slight dilapidated one before the saluting battery , and another in as bad a state on the west point of the bay . The whole number of guns amounts to thirty ; and for them chiefly they are indebted to a Portuguese frigate that was lost by the negligence of her officers about three years since . Port Praya could be taken , and every gun spiked , by thirty men ' In his way to the Brazils he touched at Fernando de Noronha , and here finds a letter from Commodore Bainbridge to him , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Yeo ; this stratagem made use of to disguise their course is quite justifiable in war , but it is perhaps inexpedient to publish it , as it will in some degree defeat the success of similar plans on future occasions . His description makes this island ,  |p6o|pled  with convicts , and destitute of women , the most wretched spot on the globe // The Portuguese island of Fernando de Noronha , is in lat. 30 54 ' 28 " south , and l*ing. 32* 36 ' 38 " ivest from London . It is well fortified in eve cy part , and its population consists of a few miserable , naked , exiled Portuguese , and as miserable a guard . The governour is changed every three years , and during his term of se*vice in the island , has the privilege of disposing of its produce to his own emolument . Cattle in abundance , hogs , goal*s , fowls , &amp;c. may be had there , as well as corn , melons , coyoa-nuts , &amp;c. &amp;c . Ships , formerly , frequently touched there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months prior to the arrival of the . lcasta , none had been there . There are no females on the island , and none are permitted to be there , from what motives I can not conceive , except it 1e to render the place of exile the more horribie . The watering-place is near the beach , at the foot of the rock on which the citadel is placed , and it is with the utmost difficulty and danger that the casks can he got through the surf to the boat . The island produces wood in abundance , but the Portuguese do not permit it to be cut for shipping any-where , but on a small island to the east of Fernando , called Wooding Island . This island is in tolerable good cultivation , and produces their principal supply of vegetables . There is no boat in the island , and the only means of communication between Wooding Island and Fernando , is a small raft or catamaran , which is carefully kept in one of the forts , and is capable of hearing only two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little trouble with the hook and line . As clothing is not in use here ; as hunger may be gratified without labour ; and as there is an appearance of cheerfulness , those who are not in chains may be supposed , in some measure , reconciled to a state as good perhaps as any they had formerly been accustomed to . The governour caused his catamaran to be launched through a surf ( which twice filled our boat , and was near destroying her , ) and despatched it to Wooding Island for fruit for ns , but before she returned we had left this miserable Botany Bay of Portugal . ' pp. 40 , 41 . Having resolved , after his arrival on the coast of the Brazils , for reasons which he details , to go into the Pacifick Ocean , he took all the prccautions in his power to double Cape Horn with safety . His experience of this enterprise // makes him fully agree with those navigators , who have represented the undertaking as most painflul and dangerous . The whole account of his passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will have only room for one or two fragments at the close of it . It was with no little joy , we now saw ourselves fairly in the Pacifick ocean , and calculating on a speedy end to all our sufferings ; we began also to form our projects for annoying the enemy , and had already equipped , in imagination , one of their vessels of 14 or 1 6 guns , and manned from the Essex , to cruize against their commerce ; indeed , various were the schemes we formed at this time for injuring them , and had , in fancy , immense wealth to return with to our country : and , as the gale continued to blow from the S. W. every hour seemed to brighten our prospects and give us fresh spirits ; and on the last of February , being in the latitude of 500 S. the wind became moderate and shifted to the northward , the sea smooth , and every prospect of mild and pleasant weather . I consequently determined to replace the guns , and get the spars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wind had freshened up to a gale , and hy noon had reduced us to our storm stay-sail and close-reefed main-top-sail ; it in the afternoon , hauled around to the westward , and blew with a fury far exceeding any thing we had yet experienced , bringing with it such a tremendous sea , as to threaten us every moment with destruction , and appalled the stoutest heart on board . To attempt to convey an idea of the fury of this gale by description , would be fruitless ; let it suffice to say , that it was rarely equalled , and I am sure never was exceeded . Our sails , our standing and running rigging , from the succession of bad weather , had become so damaged , as to be no ionger trust-worthy ; we took , however , the best means in our power to render every thing secure , and carried as heavy a press of sail as the ship would bear , to keep her from drifting on the coast of Patagonia , which we had reason to believe was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whales , which I have heretofore found to be a tolerable sure indication of a near approach to land , and from the clouds to leeward , which appeared as if arrested by the high mountains of the Andes . From the excessive violence with which the wind blew , we had strong hopes that it would be of short con tinuance ; // until , worn out with fatigue and anxiety , greatly alarmed with the terrours of a lee-shore , and in momentary expectation of the loss of our masts and bowsprit , we almost considered our situation hopeless ; and to add to our distress , our pumps had become choaked by the shingle ballast , which , from the violent rolling of the ship , had got into them ; the ship made a great deal of water , and the sea had increased to such a height , as to threaten to sxvallow us at every instant ; the whole ocean was one continued foam of breakers , and the heaviest squall that I ever before experienced , had not equalled in violence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , done all that lay in our power to preserve the ship from the violence of the elements , which seemed united to effect our destruction , and turned our attention to our pumps , ( which we were enabled to clear , ) and to keep the ship from drifting on shore , by getting on the most advantageous tack ; we , however , were not enabled to wear but once , for the violence of the wind and sea was such , as afterwards to render it impossible to attempt it , without hazarding the destruction of the ship , and the loss of every life on hoard . The whole of the 1st and 2d of March , we anxiously hoped for a change , but in vain ; our fatigues had been constant and excessive ; many had been severely bruised , by being thrown , by the violent jerks of the ship , down the hatchways , and 1 was particularly unfortunate , in receiving three severe falls , which at length disabled me from going on deck ; the oldest seaman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gale . We had done all in our power to save the ship ( except throwing her guns overboard , which I reserved for the last extremity , ) and now patiently waited for the tempest to lull . It had already blown three days without abating ; the ship had resisted its violence to the astonishment of all , without having received any considerable injury ; and we began to hope , from her buoyancy and other good qualities , we should be enabled to , weather the gale . We had shipped several heavy seas , that would have proved destructive to almost any other ship ; but , to us , they were attended with no other inconveniences , than the momentary alarm they excited , and that arising from the immense quantity of water , which forced its way into every part of the ship , and kept every thing afloat between decks . However , about 3 o'clock // of the morning of the 3d , the watch only being on deck , an enormous sea broke over the ship , and for an instant destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both boats on the quarters stove ; our spare spars washed from the chains ; our head-rails washed away , and hammock stanchions burst in ; and the ship perfectly deluged and water log*ed , immediately after this tremendous shock , which threw the crew into consternation , the gale began to abate , and in the morning we were enabled to set our reefed fore-sail . In the height of the gale , Lewis Price , a marine , who had long been confined with a pulmonary complaint , departed this life , and was this mornin0 committed to the deep ; but the violence of the sea was such , that the crew could not be permitted to come on deck , to attend the ceremony of his burL I , as their weight would have strained and endanbered the safety of the ship . When this last sea broke on board us , one of the prisoners , the boatswain of the Nocton , through excess of alarm , exclaimed , that the ship 's broadside was stove in , and that she was sinking ; this alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , from the immense torrent of water that was rushing down the hatchways , had reason to believe the truth of his assertion ; many who were washed from the spar to the gun-deck , and from their hammocks , and did not know the extent of the injury , were also greatly alarmed ; but the men at the wheel , and some others , who were enabled by a good grasp to keep their stations , distinguished themselves by their coolness and activity after the shock ; and 1 took this opportunity of advancing them one grade , by filling up the vacancies occasioned by those sent in prizes , and those who were left at St. Catharines ; rebuking , at the same time , the others for their timidity . And now we began to believe , that the elements had exhausted all their rage on us , for the sky became serene , and we were enabled to make sail ; the wind shifted to the S. XV " . and brought with it the only pleasant weather we had experienced since we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived , for , before night , it began to blow in heavy squalls , with cold rain , and reduced us to close-reefed fore arid main topsails , and reefed fore-sail ; bitt , as the wind was fair , we consoled ourselves with the pleasing reflection . // that we were every i*oment receding farther from the influence of the dreary and inhospitable climate of Cape Horn ; and , on the 5th of the month , having passed the parallel of Chili , our sufferings appeared at an end , for we enjoyed pleasant and temperate weather , with fine breezes from the southward ; and , for the first time during our passage , were enabled to knock out our dead-lights , and open our gun-deck ports . The repairs of our damages went on rapidly , and by night the ship was , in every respect , excepting wear and tear , as well prepared for active service , as the day we left St. Caihirines . Our latitude at meridian , was 390 20 ' S. ; and we had a distant view of part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albatrosses were as usual about the ship ; several fish , by sailors denominated sun-fish , were seen ; and we frequently passed a white and apparently gelatinous substance , which we had not an opportunity of examining . There was every prospect of a speedy arrival in some port on the coast of Chili , and I directed the cables to be bent , using every means in our power to guard them from the effects of rocky bottom . ' But , before I proceed farther , as this journal may accidentally fall into other hands , I shall take this opportunity of offering some hints to those , who may succeed me in attempting the passage around Cape Horn ; and this I feel myself the more authorized to do , as we have effected it in , perhaps , a shorter time with less damage , and labouring under more disadvantages , than any others who ever attempted it ; and that too by struggling , at an unfavourable season of the year , against a constant succession of obstinate and violent gales of wind . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conceiving it to be of the utmost importance to navigation , to give any information , derived from experience , which may tend to enable navigators to overcome the obstacles which nature seems designedly to have placed , to deter mankind from all attempts to penetrate from the Atlantick to the Pacifick ocean ; and , as various opinions have been given on the subject , my advice may differ from that of others in several points : but as my measures have proved successful in the end , and as it is not founded on mere conjecture // and hypothesis , it is to be presumed , that it may deserve the attention of seamen , for whom alone it is intended . In the first place , 1 must caution them against those erroneous expectations , which the opinion of La Perouse is unhappily calculated to lead them into , and , perhaps , has proved fatal to many ships , by inducing their commanders to believe , that the passabe around Cape Horn is attended with no other difficulties than those to be met with in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking tl ) ose necessary precautions , which the safety of their ships , and the lives of those on hoard , require . He says , to use his own words , " 1 doubled Cape Horn with much more ease , than I had dared to imagiuc ; I am now convinced , that this navigation is like that of all high latitudes ; the difficulties which are expected to be met with , are the effects of an old prejudice which should no longer exist , and which the reading of Anson 's voyage has not a little contributed to preserve among seamen . " On the 25th of January , La Perouse entered the Streights of Le i*iaire , and on the 9th of February , he was in the Pacifick , in thc parallel of the Streights of Magellan , making his passage in 14 days . On the 13th of February , I passed the Streights of La Maire , and was in the latitude of those of in gellan on the 26th , making a passage of 13 days , a little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cape ; and as my passage , against such violent gales , was made in one day less than his , I am at a loss to conceive what should have occasioned his delay . I have the utmost respect for the memory of that celebrated navigator , and regret that I should have cause to differ with him in opinion in any point , and particularly on one of so much importance , as the doubling of Cape Horn from the east . Indeed , ample as has been the information he has given on every other subject that has come under his notice , I am almost induced to believe , that many of his observations on this matter have been suppressed by his editor ; and that the remark is the effect of national prejudice , which ever has , and ever will exist . The passage round Cape Horn , from the eastward , I positively assert , is the most dangerous , most difficult , and attended with more hardships , than that of the same distance , in any other part of the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vol. 1 . No. 2. // gudrd against accident , thaj prudence or foresight can suggest ) pp. 84-87,88-90 . After getting round the Cape , he called at Mocha to obtain some refreshments . There are great plenty of wild horses and hogs on the island ; they killed some of each , hut found the horses the finest eating . From thence , he steered for Valparaiso , and thus describes the appearance of the coast , and his first sight of that place . On the latter part of the 12th , light airs sprung up from the S. XV . and the weather began to clear off slowly , and every eye was engaged in searching for a sail , as the fog moved to leeward . Nothing , however , was to be seen but a wide expanse of ocean , hounded on the east by the @eary , barren , and iron-hound coast of Chili , at the back of which the eternally snow-capt mountains of the Andes reared their lofty heads , and altogether presented to us a scene of gloomy solitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds now freshening up , enabled us to make sail to the northward ; and as the weather was clear , I determined to keep close in with the coast , that no vessel might be enabled to pass between us and the shore unobserved ; but in the course of our run this and the next day we could discover no vessels of any description , or the least trace of the existence of a human being on the coast , except in one instance , when a fire was lighted in the evening in a small cove , probably by some indians , or persons engaged in smuggling , and intended , no doubt , as an invitation for us to land . On the morning of the 13th , we discovered that our main top-sail yard was badly sprung , and were compelled to get it down and replace it with another , which we were so fortunate as to have on hoard ; and on the afternoon of that day , we made the point three or four leagues to the south-west of the bay of Valparaiso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you come from the southward , may be known by its sloping off gently towards the sea ; and close to the end of it is a small rugged island , or rather large rock , about the height of a ship 's masts . About 8 P. 1*'l . I brought the point to bear N. N. E. distant about four leagues , and then hove to , with the hope of intercepting some vessel in the morning , bound to Valparaiso , as all vessels bound there endeavour to make this point ; but at sunrise , not discovering a // sail , I determined to look into the harbour , and see at once what hopes we had in this quarter , and accordingly steered away for point Quaranmilla under all sail , doubling it at the distance of half a league . After passing this point , we perceived some scattering rocks lying some distance from shore , and shortly afterwards opened a handsome bay , with a fine sandy beach , and perceived a few fishing boats engaged there in fishing ; and wishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English ensign and pendant , and a jack for a pilot , but none of them appeared disposed to come along side . In the bottom of the bay was a small enclosure with a hut , and on the top of the next projecting point was another small building , apparently covered with tiles ; and on the sides of the neighbouring hills were several cattle grazing . These were the only marks of civilization we had yet met on the coast , and nothing whatever appeared to indicate our approach to the most important city of Chili . With the exception of the few cattle that grazed on the arid rocks , the two huts before mentioned , and the miserable looking fishermen , the coast here had the same desolate appearance as the rest we had seen , and since we had left Mocha but little of it had escaped our observation . It was in vain that we sooght for those handsome villa*es , well-cultivatetl hills , and fertile valleys , which we had beer prepared to meet in this part of the world . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the perpendicular sides of which the sea beats with fury . At the hack of this rock , the country appears dreary ? beyond ( lescription : yellow and barren hills , cut by torrents into deep ravines , and sprinkled sparingly here and there with shrubs ; but not a tree of any size was to be seen on this whole extent of coast . When the weather was clear , we always saw the Andes ; and as they were never clear of snow , they were not calculated to give us a more favourable impression of the interiour . The next point which presented itself , on the top of which the afore-mentioned tile-covered house was situated , was the point of Angels , which I had learned formed the western point of the Bay of Valparaiso ; and as I l ) erceived some rocks lying off it , I doubled it with a stiff breeze from the southward , at the distance of nearly half a mile , keeping the lead going , // but got no bottom at the depth of sixty fathoms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass the city of Valparaiso , or some proofs of our approach to it : first a long sandy beach , on the opposite side offered itself to view ; next a large drove of loaded mules , coming down the side of the mountain by a zigzag pathway ; and , in an instant afterwards , the whole town , shipping with their colours flying , and the forts , burst out as it were from behind the rocks , and we found ourselves becalmed under the guns of a battery prepared to fire into us . The scene presented to us was as animated and cheerful as it was sudden and unexpected ; and had I not hoisted English colours , I should have been tempted to run in and anchor . ' pp. 98-100 . The manners and customs of Chili are not without their peculiarities , as will be shewn in the following extracts . There is a slight account of the government and state of parties in that remote province . It may be hoped that the emancipation of South America will eventually be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe . Agreeably to the governour ' s invitation , we attended his party , where we found a much larger and more brilliant assemblage of ladies , than we could have expected in Valparaiso . We found much fancy and considerable taste displayed in their dress , and many of them , with the exception of teeth , very handsome , both in person and in face ; their complexion remarkably fine , and their manners modest and attracting . This was our first impression on entering a room , containing perhaps 200 ladies , to whom we were perfect strangers . Minuets were intro ( luced ; country dances followed ; and the ladies had the complaisance and patience to attempt with my officers , what they had never before seen in the country , a cotillion . The intricacies of their country-dance were too great for us to attempt ; they were greatly delighted in by those who knew them , and admitted a display of much grace . With their grace , their beauty of person and complexion , and with their modesty , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own fair country-women ; but in one moment the illusion vanished . The ballas de tierra , as they are called , commenced : they consisted of the most graceless , and at the same time fatiguing movements of the body and limbs , accompanied by the most indelicate and lascivious motions , // gradually increasing in energy and violence , until the fair one apparently overcome with passion , and evidently exhausted with fatigue , was compelled to retire to her seat ; her rosy cheeks and fair complexion disappeared in the large dreps of sweat that ran trickling down her neck and bicast , and were succeeded by the sallow tinge which nature had bountifully bestowed . They daub themselves most lavishly with paint ; but their features are agreeable , and their large dark eyes are remarkably brilliant and expressive ; and , were it not for their bad teeth , occasioned by the too liberal use of the main , they would , notwithstanding the Chilian tinge , be thought handsome , particularly by those who had been so long as we out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The course of the ship was next directed to the Galiapagos Islands , and here an account is given of an Irishman , that , taken in conjunction with the scenery , is admirably suited to a pencil like Salvator ' s . These islands are all evidently of vokanick production ; every mountain and hill is the crater of an extinguished volcano ; and thousands of smaller fissures , which have burst from their sides , give them the most dreary , desolate , and inhospitable appearance imaginable . The description of one island will answer for all 1 have yet seen ; they appear unsuited for the residence of man , or any other animal that can not , like the tortoises , live without food , or can not draw its subsistence entirely from the sea . Lieutenant Dowues saw on the rocks with which the bay was in many parts skirted , several seals and pelicans , some of which he killed ; but , on searching diligently the shore , was unable to find any land-tortoises , though they no doubt abound in other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great numbers , and were so easily approached , that several of them were knocked over with stones . While our boat was on shore , captain Randall sent his boat to a small beach in the same bay , about a mile from where our boat landed , and in a short time she returned loaded with fine green turtle , two of which he sent us , and we found them excellent , it may be seen by captain 1*Iacy 's letter , that on the east-side ot the island there is another landing , which he calls Pats 's landing ; and this place will probably immortalize an Irishman , named Patrick Watkins , who some years since left an English ship , // and took up his abode on this island , built himself a miserable hut , about a mile from the landing called after him , in a valley containing about two arces of ground capable of cultivation , and perhaps the only spot on the island which affords sufficient moisture for the purpose . Here he succeeded in raising potatoes and pumpkins in considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold for cash . The appearance of this man , from the accounts I have received of him , was the most dreadful that can be imagined ; ragged clothes ; scarce sufficient to cover his nakedness , and covered with vermin ; his red hair and beard matted , his skin much burnt , from constant exposure to the sun , and so wild and ? savage in his manner and appearance , that he struck every one with horrour . For several years this wretched being lived by himself on this desolate spot , without any other apparent desire than that of procuring rum in sufficient qtiantities to keep himself intoxicated , and at such times , after an absence from his hut of several days , he would be found in a state of perfect insensibility , rolling among the rocks of the mountains . He appeared to be reduced to the lowest grade to which human nature is capable , and seemed to have no desire beyond the tortoises and other animals of the island , except that ot getting ( Irunk . But this man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither destitute of ambition nor incapable of undertaking an enterprise that would have appalled the heart of any other man ; nor was he devoid of the talent of rousing others to second his hardihood . He by some means became possessed of an old musket , and a few charges of powder and ball ; and the possession of this weapon first set into action all his ambitious plans . He felt himself strong as the sovereign of the island , and was desirous of proving his strength on the first human being who fell in his way , which happened to be a negro , who was left in charge of a boat belonging to an American ship that had touched there for refreshments . ' Patrick came down to the beach where the boat lay , armed with his musket , now become his constant companion , and directed the negro , in an authoritative manner to follow him , and on his refusal snapped ? his musket at him twice , which luckily missed fire . The negro , however , became intimidated , and followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on his way up the mountains exultingly informed the negro // he was henceforth to work for him , and become his slave , and that his good or bad treatment would depend on his future conduct ; but arriving at a narrow defile , and perceiving Patrick off his guard , the negro seized the moment , grasped him in his arms , threw him down , tied his hands behind , shouldered him , and carried him to his boat , and when the crew had arrived , he was taken on board the ship . An English smuggler was lying in the harbour at the same time , the captain of which sentenced Patrick to be severely whipped on board both vessels , which was put in execution , and he was afterwards taken 00 shore handcuffed by the Englishmen , who compelled him to make known where he had concealed the few dollars he had been enabled to accumulate from the sale of his potatoes and pumpkins , which they took from him ; and while they were busy in destroying his hut and garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself among the rocks in the interiour of the island , until the ship had sailed , when he ventured from his skulking place , and by means of an old file , which he drove into a tree , freed himself from the handcuffs . He now meditated a severe re* venge , but concealed his intentions . Vessels continued to touch there , and Patrick , as usual , to furnish them with vegetables ; hut from time to time he was enabled , by admistering potent draughts of his darling liquor to some of the men of their crews , and getting them so drtmnk that they were rendered insensible , to conceal them until the ship had sailed ; when , finding themselves entirely dependent on him , they willingly enlisted under his banners , became his slaves , and he the most absolute of tyrants . By this means he had augmerited the number to five , including himself , and every means was used by him to endeavour to procure arms for them , but without effect . It is supposed that his object was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taken her off . While Patrick was meditating his plans , two ships , an American and an English ve*sel , touched there and applied to Patrick for vegetables . He promised them the greatest abundance , provided they would send their boats to his landing , and their people to bring them from his garden , informing then ) that his rascals had become so indolent of late that he could not get them to work . This arrangement was agreed to ; two boats were sent from each vessel , and // hauled on the beach . Their crews all went to Patrick 's ha* bitation , but neither he nor any of his people were to be found ; and after waiting until their patience was exhausted , they returned to the beach , where they found only the wreck of three of their boats , which were broken to pieces , and the fourth one missing . they succeeded , however , after much difficulty , in getting around to the bay opposite to their ships , where other boats were sent to their relief ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other trick , saw no security except in a flight from the island , leaving Patrick and his gau* in quiet possession of the boat ; but before they sailed they put a letter in a keg , and moored it in the bay , where it was found by a captain Randall , but not until he had sent his boat to Patrick 's landing , for the purpose of procuring refi'eshments ; and , as may be easily supposed , he felt no little inquietude until her return , when she brought him a letter from Patrick to the following purport , which was found in illS lint . SIR , I have made repeated applications to captains of vessels to sell me a boat , or to take me from this place , but in every instance met with a refusal . An opportunity presented itself to possess myself of one , and I took advantage of it . 1 have been a long time endeavouring , by hard labour and suffering , to accumulate wherewith to make myself comfortable , but at different times have been robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paddock , w*mose conduct in punishing me , and robbing me of about 500 dollars , in cash and other articles , neither agrees with the principles he professes , nor is it such as his sleek coat would lead one to expect. * On the 29th May , 1809 , I sail from the enchanted island in the Black Prince , bound to the Marquesas . Do not kill the old hen ; she is now sitting , and will soon have chickens . ( Signed ) FATHERLESS OBERLUs . Patrick arrived alone at Guyaquil in his open boat , the rest who sailed with him having perished for want of water , or , as is generally supposed , were put to death by him , on his finding the water to grow scarce . From thence he // proceeded to Payta , where he wound himself into the affection of a tawny damsel , and prevailed on her to Consent to accompany him hack to his enchanted island , the beauties of which he no douht painted in glowing colours ; hut from his savage appearance , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and being found under the keel of a small vessel then ready to be launched , and suspected of some improper intentions , he was confined in Payta gaol , where he now remains ; an ( l probably owing to this circumstance Charles ' island , as well as the rest of the Gallapagos , may remain unpopulated for many ages to come . This reflection may naturally lead us to a consideration of the question concerning the population of the other islands scattered about the Pacifick Qcean , respecting which so many conjectures have been hazarded . I shall only hazard one , *hch is briefly this : that former ages may have produced men equally as bold and as daring as Pat , and women as willing as his tender one to accompany them in their adventurous voyages . And when we consider the issue which might be produced from a unio* between a red-haired wdd Irishman , and a coppercoloured mixt-hlooded squaw , we need not he any longer surprised at the different varieties in human nature . If Patrick should he liberated from durance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps ( when neither Pat nor the Gallapagos are any longer remembered ) some future navigator may surprise the world by a discovery of them , and his accounts of the strange people with which they may probably be inhabited ; and from the source from which they shall have sprung , it does not seem unlikely that they will have one trait in their character , which is common to the natives of all the islands in the Pacifick , a disposition to appropriate to themselves the property of others ; and from this circumstance future speculators may confound their origin with that of all the rest . ' pp. 140-145 . The description of the Gallapagos turtles is very extraordinary , and it seems that the whalers of the South Sea may enjoy a feast that would excite the envy of an alderman . Captain Porter in another place says , one remarkable peculiarity of this animal is , that the blood is cold . I shall leave it to those better acquainted with natural history to investigate the cause of a circumstance so extraordinary ; my business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , not to reason on them . ' From this he does not appear to be aware that there is a numerous class of cold blooded reptiles . The possession of these vessels , besides the great satisfaction it produced , was attended by another advantage of no less importance , as it relieved all our wants except one , to wit , the want of water . From them we obtained an abundant supply of cordage , canvas , paints , tar , and every other article necessary for the ship , of all of which she stood in great need , as our slender stock brought from America had now become worn out and useless ; and besides the articles necessary for the ship , we became supplied with a stock of provisions , of a quality and quantity that removed all apprehensions of our suffering for the want of them for many months , as those vessels when they sailed fron England , were provided with provisions and stores for upwards of three years , and had not yet consumed half their stock ; all were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supplying our immediate wants , the prizes were of the greatest importance to us . We found on board of them , also , wherewith to furnish our crew with several delicious meals . They had been in at James ' Island , and had supplied the nselves abundantly with those extraordinary animals the tortoises of the Gallapagos , which properly deserve the name of the elephant tortoise . Many of them were of a size to weigh upwards of three hundred weight ; and nothing , perhaps , can be more disagreeable or clumsy than they are in their external appearance . Their motion resembles strongly that of the elephant ; their steps slow , , regular , and heavy ; they carry their body about a foot from the ground , and their legs and feet bear no slight resemblance to the ammal to which 1 have likened them ; their neck is from 18 inches to 2 feet in length , and very slender ; their head is proportioned to it , and strongly resembles that of a serpent ; but , hideous and disgusting as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesome , luscious , and delicate food than they do ; the finest green turtle is no more to be cornpared to them , in point of excellence , than the coarsest beef is to the finest veal ; and after once tasting the Gallapagos tortoises , every other animal food fell greatly in our estimation . These animals are so fat as to require neither butter nor lard to cook them , and this fat does not possess that cloying // quality , common to that of most other animals ; and when tried out , it furnishes an oil superiour in taste to that of the olive . The meat of this animal is the easiest of digestion , and a quantity of it exceeding that of any other food , can be eaten , without experiencing the slightest inconvenience . But what seems the most extraordinary in this animal , is the length of time that it can exist without food ; for I have been well assured , that they have been piled away among the casks in the hold of a ship , where they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expiration of that time , were found to have suffered no diminution in fatness or excellence . They carry with them a co*istant supply of water , in a bag at the root of the neck , which contains about two gallons ; and on tasting that*found in those we killed on board , it proved perfeetly fresh and sweet . They are very restless when exposed to the light and heat of the sun , hut will lie in the dark from one year 's end to the other without moving ; in the daytime they appear remarkably quicksighted and timid , drawing their head into their shell on the slightest motion of any oh .. ject ; but they are entirely destitute of hearing , as the loudest noise , even the firing of a gun , does not seem to alarm them in the slightest degree , and at night , or in the dark , they appear perfectly blind . After our tasting the flesh of those ani .. mals , we regretted that numbers of them had been thrown overboard by the crews of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but a few days afterwards , at day-light in the morning , we were so fortunate as to find ourselves surrounded by about fifty of them , which were picked up and brought on board , as they had been lying in the same place where they bad been thrown over , incapable of any exertion in that element , except that of stretching out their long necks . ' pp. 161 , 162 . The second volume begins with his passage to the Washington Islands , so named by Captain Ingraham of Boston , by whom , and by Captain Roberts of the same place they were first discovered . The English and the French visited them the same year . By all these nations they have received different names , none of which we think so pleasing or sonorous as the name given them by their inhabitants . For instance , the principal island is called by Captain Porter Madison 's Island , // the English call it Sir Henry Martin 's Island , and the French Isle Baux . Now unquestionably the Americans have the best right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , to give them a new name , and . Madison 's Island reads better than Sir henry Martin 's , and much better than the bold , awkward , abrupt French name of isle Baux ; but we decidedly prefer the native appellation Nooa/ieevah , to either ; it is softer , sounds better , is less liable to be confounded with other places , and has more propriety in its favour . This trick of nicknaming every thin0 , so common with the nations of Europe as well as our selves , has many inconveniences , and it is particularly vex tious where a fine sonorous name is abolished , for some ordinary one , which is already given to several places . It will at least he going far enough to make a change when the aboriginal name is barbarous in sound , and difficult to pronounce . The island of Nooaheevah contains eight tribes , who can furnish about nineteen thousand fighting men . They occupy different valleys , and are frequently at war with each other , but these wars are generally bloodless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the former were assisted by Captain Porter , the number of killed was only five , and this was considered a very sanguinary contest . It would be interesting to know what are the checks to population . The climate is mild and serene , the inhabitants prolifick , wars are not destructive , and there is no emigration . Yet there must be some obstacle to the increase of the people , or the island would have been long since overstocked . Captain Porter speaks of two or three small parties that at different periods have set out to go to another island which they believe is at no great distance from them , but the existence of which is very uncertain , and none of the emigrants have ever been heard from ; it is probable that they perished . Captain Porter has given a drawing of . Illiouina , the chief warriour of the Tayehs , a very fine figure most curiously tattooed . The beauty and fancy of the lines and ornamenis are very striking , and his whole appearance strongly recalls the coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tayees is thus described . Soon after I had sent my present on shore , Gattanewa came on board in a boat which I had sent for him , accont* // panied by Mr. Maury . I had seen several of their wari*ours since I had arrived , many of them highly ornamented with plumes , formed of the feathers of cocks and man-of-war birds , and with the long tail feathers of the tropick bird ; large tufts of hair were tied around their waists , their ankles , and their loins : a cloak , sometimes of red cloth , but more frequently of a white paper cloth , formed of the bark of a tree , thrown not inelegantly over the shoulders , with large round or oval ornaments in their ears , formed of whales ' teeth , ivory , or a kind of soft and light wood , whitened with chalk ; from their neck suspended a whale 's tooth , or highly polished shell , and round their loins several turns of the stronger kind of paper-*1 cioth , the end of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a black and highly polished spear of about twelve feet in length , or a club richly carved , and borne on the shoulders , constitutes the dress and equipment of a native warrio ( ir , whose body is highly and elegantly ornamented by tattooing , executed in a manner to excite our admiration . This is a faithful picture of a warriour , and of the chief of such warriours I had formed an exalted opinion ; but what was my astonishment when Gattane**a presented himself ; an infirm old man of seventy years of age , destitute of every covering or ornament except a clout about his loins , and a piece of palm leaf tied about his head : a long stick seemed to assist him in walking ; his face and body were as black as a negro 's , from the quantity of tattooing , which entirely covered them , and his skin was rough , and appeared to be peeling off in scales , from the quantity of kava ( an intoxicating root ) with which he had indulged himself . Such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank freely of the kava before he made his visit , he appeared to be perfectly stupid . After he had been a short time on deck , I endeavoured to imprcss him with a high opinion of our force ; and for this purpose assembled all my crew : it scarcely seemed to excite his attention . I then caused a gun to be fired , which seemed to produce no other effect on him , than that of pain ; he complained that it - hurt his ears : I then invited him below , where nothing whatever excited his attention , until I showed him some whale&amp; teeth : this roused the old man from his lethargy , and he would not be satisfied until I had permitted him to handle , to // measure and count them over and over , which seemed to afford him infinite pleasure . After he had done this repeatedly , I put them away ; and shortly afterwards asked him if he had seen any thing in the ship that pleased him ; if he did , to name it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen nothing which had pleased him so much as one of the small whales ' teeth ; which on his describing , I took out and gave to him : this he carefully wrapped up in one of the turns of his clout ; begging me not to inform any person that he had about him an article of so much value : I assured him I should not : and the old man threw himself on the settee , and went to sleep . in a few minutes he awoke , somewhat recovered from his stupidity , and requested to he put on shore : he , however , previous to his departure , wished me to exchange names with him , and requested me to assist him in his war with the Happabs : to the first I immediately consented but to the latter request , I told him I had come to be at peace with all on the island ; ? that I wished to see him at peace with the Happahs ; and that I should not engage in any hostilities , unless the Happabs came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and his people . He told me they had cursed the bones of his mother , who had died but a short time since : that as we had exchanged names , she was now my mother , and I was hound to espouse her cause . I told him 1 would think of the subject , and did not think it necessary to make any farther reply to the old man 's sophistry . ' pp. 27 , 28 . Captain Porter gives an account of a singular ceremony among these people called tabooing . The substantive tabboo signifies an interdiction , an embargo , or restraint . ' An involuntary smile was excited , at the coincidence of finding a new word for embargo in Madison 's Island , ' and we shall ex .. tract the passage relating to it , humbly suggesting to those who are competent to decide , the proprietyof adopting it , should a certain series of measures ever be renewed , as the multiplicity of those acts made it very difficult to distinguish them . Though we most fervently hope that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth entering in the dictionary of our cabinet language . I am not acquainted with the ceremony of laying on these tabbooes , which are so much respected by the natives . They // are , however , laid by the priests , from some religious motive . Sometimes they are general , aud affect a whole valley , as the present ; sometimes they are confined to a single tribe ; at others to a family , and frequently to a single person . ryue word tabboo signifies an interdiction , an embargo , or restrai*t ; and the restrictions during the period of their existen e may be compared to the lent of the catholicks . They suPer , during this period , many privations ; they are not allowed to use paint , of which they are very fond , to ornament heir bodies ; they are neither allowed to dance nor sing ; the chiefs are bound to abstain from women ; nor are they in many instances , allowed to enter the houses frequented by them . They have tabbooed places , where they feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many of their trees , and even some of their walks are tabbooed . The women are , on no occasion whatever , allowed to enter their places of feasting , which are houses raised to the height of six or eight feet on a platform of large stones , neatly hewn and fitted together , with as much skill and exactness as could be done by our most expert masons ; and some of them are one hundred yards in length and forty yards in width , surrounded by a square of buildings executed in a style of elegance , which is calculated to inspire us with the most exalted opinion of the ingenuity , taste , and perseverance of a people , who have hitherto remained untioticed and unknown to the rest of mankind . When we consider the vast labour requisite to bring from a distance the enormous rocks which form the foundation of these structures ( for they are all brought from the sea side , and many of them are eight feet long and lour feet thick and wide ) and reflect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tools perhaps little harder than the materials worked on , for the appearance of many of these places strongly mark their antiquity , and their origin can no doubt be traced to a period antecedent to their knowledge of iron , and when we count the immense numbers of such places which are every-where to be met with , our astonishment is raised to the highest , that a people in a state of nature , unassisted by any of those artificial means which so much assist and facilitate the labour of the civilized man , could have conceived and executed a work which , to every beholder , // must appear stupendous . These piles are raised with views to magnificence alone ; there does not appear to be the slightest utility attending them : the houses situated on them are unoccupied , except during the period of feasting , and they appear to belong to a puhlick , without the whole efforts of which , they could not have been raised , and with every exertion that could possibly have been made , years must have been requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much from the houses helonging to individuals except in the degree of elegance with which they are finished . Those which I have now in view to describe are situated round a publick square , high up the valley of the Havvouhs , and are sixteen in number . Four large pillars , neatly formed of the hread-fruit tree , are planted in the ground* extending to the height of twenty feet above the surface ; in the upper end is a crutch for the reception of a long and slender cocoa-nut tree , which is neatly polished : this forms the ridge-pole of the houses , and is the chief support of the structure . From this ridge-pole , with the lower ends inclining out about five feet , are placed bamboos , of equal sizes , at the distance of two or three inches asunder , with the Lower ends planted in the ground ; and to give them additional stability they are neatly and firmly secured hy turns of different coloured sinnet to the well polished trunk of a cocoa-nut tree : across this row of bamhoos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rdws of smaller bamboos , placed in a horizontal position , and this forms a frame work for the hack part of the house , which also answers for one side of the roof . At the distance of five feet in advance of the aforesaid long pillars are fixed in the ground four uprights , extending eight feet above the surface , having also a crutch for the reception of a cocoa-nut tree , or sometimes a piece of hewn timber neatly fashioned for the purpose . This also extends the whole length of the house , and serves to support the front part of the roof , which*is formed of the same materials , and is secured in the same manner as the hack part of the building . The ends are , in like manner , closed in , as sometimes are the sides , for the distance of twelve feet , forming at.each end of the house a small room . The frame work heing completed , they proceed to cover it , first with the leaves of the palm // tree , and next with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising neatness and regularity , and give it an appearance of beauty , security , and durability not to be equalled hy our best mode of shingling . The building is then divided longitudinally into two equal parts , by placin6 from one end to the other , in the middle , the trunk of a cocoa-nut tree : the part toward the front is then neatly paved with smooth stones : the back part is covered with the finest mats , and is occupied as a sleeping place for the whole family : the middle tree serving for them to place their feet against , and a similar one placed against the back of the building serves them as a pillar . The external and more useful parts of the house being finished , they proceed to ornament it by covering the bamboos , which form the frame work , with different coloured cocoa-nut sinnet put on in the most fanciful manner , while the upright columns are covere ( l first by layers of their finest and whitest cloth , which is firmly seenred on by the sinnet aforesaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a short distance , the appearance of being handsomely and fancifully painted . Sometimes , indeed , the columns are richly carved in the form of gods , and give to the whole an air of grandeur and elegance which , although in a style differing from that of every people in the world , does not the less astonish. ' pp. 42-44 . The religious ceremonies of these people , as described in this journal , resemble , in the main , those practised in the other islands . The whimsical puerilities make the account interesting , but we have no room to extract it . He left them several kinds of seeds , and some wheat which he planted , and instructed them how to cultivate . From the fondness they discovered for bread , it may be hoped that they will succeed in raising wheat . From the gentle , and in some respects superior qualities of these savages to most of the aborigines of the continent , civilization may perhaps be gradually introduced among them . The first step among all nations emerging from barbarism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be wholly barbarous who are in the habit of eating bread ; when this becomes an article of food , the great bases of society , individual property , and permanency of habitation , are already laid . The fatter of these is forced on these natives by their insular situation , and Vol 1 . No. 2. *35 // their superiority to most tribes on the continent may be partly owing to this circumstance . Captain Porter frequently compares his situation with that of Lord Anson , and the different losses they experienced . But he should recollect the great superiority of ships in the present day , the greater experience in navigation , and the various improvements that have been made for preserving the health of crews , which are so salutary , that with proper precaution health may be preserved through the longest voyage . The Essex however was not prepared for this undertaking ; she was only fitted out for a common cruise , and neither her crew nor her stores were selected for a voya*e round Cape Horn . Under these circumstances , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her commander . He disclaims all pretensions to fine writing , and gives his journal to the world at the solicitation of those who had seen it , not as the premeditated labour of a regular voyage of discovery , but as the plain journal of a sailor , composed for his own satisfaction . If it pleases the publick , be says he will put it into the hands of some friend , to make a second edition of it more worthy of the publick . There is more fairness than policy in this mode of proceeding . A striking feature in the composition of this journal , is the frankness with which it is written . The author has narrated every thing , and as he has not disguised any thing , that others would have suppressed , he has laid himself open to those , who are disposed to judge him harshly . We have been sufficiently interested in the perusal of this work to wish that it might have a second edition , and be reduced to the compass of one volume . There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publick . There are several passages that should be expunged . There are occasional mistakes in the language , that want correction , some of them are perhaps errours of the press . For example , the word trend is obsolete . Johnson gives the authority of Dryden for it , but it is no better than tend of which be supposes it to be a corruption ; rig is used as a substantive ; herculian for Herculean ; bonetta for bonito , &amp;c. &amp;c . There are several plates that are tolerably executed from drawings by Captain Porter . On the whole , if he will put it into the hands of some one versed in the mystery of book making , to correct these little faults , and strike out the useless parts of it , 1 he work may form a very respectable addition to our books of travels .
