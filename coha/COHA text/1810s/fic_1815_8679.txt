General Jackson Herein I am informed , young soldier , ( shewing a letter ) of your first enterprise in this campaign , and do approve the spirit of the action . Edw . Edward Oakwood Your excellency overates the little claim I can have to merit in that atchievment . But without is one , a captive in the affair , for whom I beg your generous clemency . Jack .

Edward Oakwood With your permission I will lead her in . Jack . General Jackson By all means . Gallant and brave  --  there is something in the manner of that man , speaks loudly in his favor  --  his noble feelings for a captive enemy are volumes of commendation . SCENE 2.  --  Re-enter Edward leading Louisa and Child . Jack . General Jackson Madam , your servant  --  my young friend here , has possessed me of the particulars of your present situation , and I shall be happy to avert as far as possible the evils of captivity . Lou . Louisa I thank your excellency . The kind offer of humanity can render even captivity supposable ; and my heart tellsme , in this land of freedom , though yet a stranger and a prisoner too , they will not fail to reach me . Edw . Edward Oakwood The lady , general  --  permit me madam . Lou . Louisa Most certainly sir . Edw . Edward Oakwood Hearing our convent spoken of its quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Jack .

Louisa This condescention exceeds my hopes , indeed . Jack . General Jackson Lady , you flatter us  --  humanity in a soldier is but the common duty of a man ; and he is unworthy heaven 's best gift , indeed  --  who hesitates to give a woman honorable protection . Edw . Edward Oakwood Come , my little soldier , let us march together . Exeunt . SCENE 3.  --  An apartment in the house of Melville sen . Melville and O'Brien O'Flanegan . Mel . sen . Melville senior Weel capt . O'Flanegan . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Your honor . Mel . sen . Melville senior Here are aw the papers in order , ( giving papers ) and now that affair is dispatched , and your friend discharged from his obligation , will you answer my question , in regard to colonel Oakwood 's views ? O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Will your honor first allow me to propose one ? Mel . sen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please , captain . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Thank your honor , but one will answer the present purpose to match your 's . An Irishman never requires odds when the difference is not much against him . Mel . sen . Melville senior Vary weel , vary weel , captain  --  proceed , sir . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Then I would ask you , sir , what have you ever , discovered in the conduct of captain O'Brien O'Flanegan , that should induce your justiceship to suspect his honor , and call in question his integrity ? Mel . sen . Melville senior Integrity  --  captain ! O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Sure , now , you have not lived so long by the laws , without even a squint to that of honor . Mel . sen . Melville senior Really , captain  --  I do not perceive  --  O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Arrah sure enough  --  Justice is blind , and I think it would do some people very little injury  --  just to raise the bandage a bit and bother their good looking eye sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do nt apprehend ye ! O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Apprehend me !  --  O , by Saint Patrick , I 'll take good care of that jewel . But if you will have it in plainer terms  --  this it is  --  The miscreant who would betray the secrets of his friend  --  whatever country may claim the honor of his birth-place , by my soul , Old Ireland disowns him . And though he can be no soldier  --  both himself , and he who tempts him to betray his trust , are worthy candidates for an elevated command , touching his collar Mel . sen . Melville senior I see I must humor him , aside . No offence captain . I honor your sentiments ; if there is any impropriety ye ken . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Impropriety  --  look you , sir  --  I will just tell a small piece of my own private history , all the world is not acquainted with ; ( for I can always trust my own secrets where I can look well after them ) then judge yourself . Mel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Faith not much , sir  --  I am an Irishman  --  that is to say , by birth ; but I am an Irish American that is the adopted child of humanity . Mel . sen . Melville senior I ken ye ha ' gotten vary respectable connections , troth  --  O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan When I left my native country  --  oppressed , insulted Ireland  --  with an honest heart for my patrimony , poverty for my partner , and a plentiful stock of ill luck to begin business on . You will see I was not overloaded with good company . Mel . sen . Melville senior Vary true , vary true indeed . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan No matter for that . With a light heart and the world before me , I consigned my cares to he bosom of the Atlantic , and whistled to the tempest that drove me to the land of liberty and justice . Mel . sen . Melville senior Where you landed safe at last . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Aye , safe and sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Melville senior Troubles ! sure I thought you had buried them in the ocean . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan My old companions , honey  --  but I made new connections . Mel . sen . Melville senior No doubt they returned ; and would , had you conjured them into the Red Sea . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan You shall hear . Without friends patronage , or money , I arrived a stranger in America .  --  Before I could procure any employment , the disorders of the climate seized me ; and but for the humanity of one man , would soon have finished my perigrenations . In his own house , with the kind solicitude of a parent , he watched over me , administered restoratives , and like the spirit of pity charmed and soothed the burning rage of fever in my veins . My health restored , the friendly arm that raised me still supported , and enabled me to place myself in a situation that promised competence and independence  --  and now , sir , what should I merit for betraying so kind a benefactor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingratitude would be an act  --  O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan That you would have me perpetrate . Mel . sen . Melville senior How ! your friend surely was  --  O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Colonel Oakwood  --  under whose colors I have the honor to serve and when I abandon them or the Country they belong to , may I be driven from the ranks of honorable men , and roasted by the red allies of the Enemy . Mel . sen . Melville senior Bravo , noble captain , I heartily rejoice that this little trial of your loyalty so amply confirms my opinion of your integrity and spirit . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan No blarney if you please . If this trial as you call it , has discovered to you one Irishman who can not be a scoundrel to his friend , I hope this will be a hint among our neighbors of the highlands should they chance to hear of it ; that in future when they are merry with our eccentricities , they will not remember to forget , that though an Irishman 's head may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best qualities of the heart are at home in the bogs .  --  Sir , your humble servant . exit . Mel . sen . Melville senior Vary weel , vary weel , my fine spark , I shall find a time till take ye down a peg , for au your blustering impertinence . The fellow kens my aversion till this Col. Oakwood , whose son aspires till the hand of my daughter . This war has ruined the old man , and deel a baubee has the youth to bless himself . A very beggar  --  not a dollar ; and he has imbibed the political dogmas of his ridiculous old father , and presumes till chatter as fameliarly of my lord Castlereigh and Liverpool , and au the ministry at hame as if he were himself a nobleman , and initiated untill au the mysteries of the cabinet . it will never do . Charlotte must discourage his addresses . The blood of the Melville 's must na be contaminated . We sic on a beggarly allience , troth . Exeunt . SCENE 4.  --  The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Soldiers on duty , before the Markee of Sir Edward Packenham . Enter Sir Edward , followed by an officer , giving directions  --  bugle florish . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham It is well , and the officer will keep his command . Are those orders , dispatched to general Gibbs . color=redPage 11 Offi . Officer They are Sir . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham And the notes to direction . Offi . Officer All , please your excellency . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham Good , be vigilence , the word , to your duty officer . Exit officer . Thy maxims , Fabius , and thy cautious conduct , thy prudence , coolness and forbearing temper , hadst thou commanded in a war like this , would well entitle thee , to praise more loud , than yet , the world has lauded to thy fame . By heaven , this puny warfare , moves my indignation , and by the glory of my best fought field , I blush to see those troops before whose arms the valiant of the world have fled the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make their war on raw recruits a chance-collected mob , of various nations , differing in interest , moving by no concert , and led by men , as motly as themselves . Why it is Achilles armed against a guat ; no more . And when they are beaten , what 's the glory . Give them time and they 'll destroy themselves . Proud city tremble for thy coming doom , within thy bounds , beats many heart with life , that shall pour its purple current to appease the angry spirit of indignant Britain and ere three suns upon thy turrets sit , thy gorgeous domes will pass to other lords thy Halls receive my veteran warriors . Enter a guard conducting Theodore . Theo . Theodore Melville Is this your general , soldier ? Sol . Soldier It is and I dare say will do for you . half aside . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham Whom have you here ? Sol . Soldier A deserter from the fleet , taken near the camp . We would know your honor 's pleasure how to dispose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are you ? Theo . Theodore Melville A prisoner Sir as you preceive a Sailor , and as my accussers say deserted from the fleet . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham You tell your story with sang froid however . Are you aware this crime may cost your life ? Theo . Theodore Melville My life ; pray Sir to whom may that be forfeit ? Pack . Sir Edward Packenham Your country sirrah , which by this base desertion you have dishonered . Theo . Theodore Melville Pardon me Sir . I think my Country will applaud my conduct . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham No doubt it will do you Justice . Theo . Theodore Melville It never justified oppression . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham It never sanctifies disloyalty . Theo . Theodore Melville It has no cause in me . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham How , no cause . Theo . Theodore Melville It is just and merciful . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham The world allows it  --  it is the Briton 's boast . Theo . Theodore Melville Indeed ; yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now , a proof in chains , how they can violate and outrage either . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham Astonishing assurance ! I will hear no more . Theo . Theodore Melville Indulge me yet a little , you demanded who I was  --  to speak my wrongs at once , I am an impressed seaman , but not , as you may think , an Englishman  --  no , sir , that drop of blood , if any such there be within my veins , that holds communion , faith , or fellowship with Britain , while she rejects the laws of God and nature , trampling on both , is alien to my heart . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham Presumptuous wretch , beware , nor utter here treason against the government of Britain . Theo . Theodore Melville Pardon the libel ; it is the truth I utter  --  the language of indignant freemen , when nature 's rights by power are violated . The air I now inhale gives truth its energy , and I feel its influence at my hear What are to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooted hate ? When I am basely held an abject slave , where I have a right to be more free than you are . Compelled to bear the lash , or raise my arm in this unhallowed war against my country , and own allegiance to my soul 's antipathy . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham You say you are not an Englishman  --  the freedom of your speech declares against you . Submit , acknowledge , and return to duty , or  --  Theo . Theodore Melville Never  --  duty ? Hold , hold , sir , insult me not so far . My greatest boast is , I am an American citizen . It was my intention to return to duty . It is in your power to give a noble proof how just a claim you have to generous feelings , when in a captive enemy , you honor them . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham It was your purpose , then , to join the enemy ? Theo . Theodore Melville It was to join my countrymen ; my duty and allegiance there I owe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir Edward Packenham You refuse to return , then ? Theo . Theodore Melville I do . I am aware , sir , I am in your power , and am not ignorant of British magnanimity to prisoners . For three long years of cruelty and bondage , I almost cursed the sun that rose upon me , and loathed the light of heaven that saw my shame . Have prayed for darkness to enshroud the world . one general blank in nature to expunge me and my injuries from the rool of time . It is vain to tempt me  --  a thousand deaths on racks were welcome to me . If the alternative were British bondage , cooped with the bloodhounds of your boasted navy . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham Insolent railer , this virulence has fixed your doom . Guards , take him hence , and await my further orders  --  away with him . Theo . Theodore Melville Approaching vengeance arms my soul with fortitude , to bear what further orders may inflict upon me . Bring out your scourges , load me with irons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge yourself , how much superior to a British chieftain is the American who knows his duty ; how with heroie courage he endures even torture , when he is sure his country feels his wrongs  --  when he beholds her rising to redress them . Pack . Sir Edward Packenham Away with him  --  let a dungeon hide him . By heaven we 'll curb this hot impetuous spark , and learn him we have reins for restive spirits . Away , away . Exeunt . Theo . Theodore Melville Lead on , you hear his excellency 's commands ; I am ready to follow you . Sol . Soldier I had rather lead the forlorn hope than execute these orders , yet I dare not disobey them .  --  Well , well , perhaps his honor may countermand them . Keep a good heart , my lad . Theo . Theodore Melville It is easier already . I have unpacked a freight of fretful feelings , and my heart seems lightened of a heavy load . Now for my prison . Exeunt . SCENE 5.  --  In Melville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heigh ho , how dreary are these apartments I wish my father was returned , I am weary of being alone , since the family retired from the city and my dear Edward comes so seldom , The house seems for all the world like a deserted castle , my father 's company , tho ' I am sure of a lecture touching certain offences and misdemeanors of the heart , is some relief from this oppressive enuil , his plan of sending me to the convent during the troubles revives my spirits , I like it prodigiously , and who knows , but Edward like a hero in romance , may risque from the inchanted tower , his lady fair , and bring her off in spite of all the dragoons , the idea charms me , behind the veil methinks hope smiles and groups of loves and pleasures rally round her . I hear steps in the anti-chamber , they approach . Edward  --  Enter Edward Oakwood . Edw . Edward Oakwood Good morning my dearest Charlotte , so let me call you still tho ' father 's may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid mandates of unfeeling parents , time out of mind at war with holy nature , are all too weak to bind ingenuous hearts or force sincere affection into love or hate , as prejudice , caprice or interest dictates . Edw . Edward Oakwood This moment recompences an age of wretched absence , the heart is jealous of its joys , that loves believing all unsure ' till all is possessed ; I come to know my doom , from you alone , to hear it , then , tell me Charlotte thou wilt still be mine and fortune thy utmost malice , I defy , pronounce my destiny , yet you are silent , then am I lost indeed . Cha . Charlotte Needs must I pause , when so unkindly questioned . Edw . Edward Oakwood Pardon me lovely girl , for worlds I would not offend thee . Cha . Charlotte With most ingenuous truth , my heart I gave to him who doubts the principles that moved it , when Edward received the trifle , he believed it honest . Edw . Edward Oakwood He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune , and the worlds esteem , where his , nor dreamed he of the reverses , yet I could bear the change with fortitude , but that averted looks , even from my friends , speak to my heart , a falling off indeed from fortune , sharper than daggers , wound and rankle deeper . Char . Charlotte As heaven is witness , never to fortune , did I pay my vows , nor shall her fickle revolutions , change them ever . Edw . Edward Oakwood O words of extacy , now do I breath again , how impious to doubt such wonderous excellence , do I not know thy heart , the seat of virtue and the throne of love ? Thy mind , superior to all sordid objects , towers ore the groveling maxims of the world , and aims a flight beyond its little views ; here let me ratify again , that faith which was pledged by honor to my bosom 's queen . Kneels and takes her hand . Cha . Charlotte Now rise , true knight , comfirmed in sacred honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent our interviews I think but as he says for safety from the gathering storm to place me in the Ursaline convent . Edw . Edward Oakwood Inexorable man . Cha . Charlotte Yet trust me Edward . Hope whispers happiness will follow and when my orisons rise with holy sisters , Heavens blessing will attend my prayers and crown my wishes . Edw . Edward Oakwood Powerful the breathings of the humble heart , not prayers of saints before the throne of mercy more potent plead , or more prevail with heaven . During the latter part of this speech , Meville senior enters unperceived and listens . Charlotte turning sees him and rises . Char . Charlotte My father . Edw . Edward Oakwood Your obedient servant , sir , bows respectfully . Melv. sen . Melville senior Ye can make a very pretty speech Mr. Oakwood . But , sir , how can you presume till address it to my daughter , wha I ha ' possitively denied tlil your society ? Edw . Edward Oakwood Pardon me , sir , if the honor of a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melville senior Troth , I am not pleased with these intrusions . Char . Charlotte Dear Father , Mr. Oakwood . Mel . sen . Melville senior Silence hussey , I did not bid ye speak ; retire to your bhamber , immediately , go I say . Charlotte goes reluctantly . Edw . Edward Oakwood She goes in tears , O ! that he were not her father , aside . I am grieved sir , to be the cause of those harsh words . Mel . sen . Melville senior To break into one 's apartments , encourage my daughter 's disobedience , t is very ill treatment , sir , you knew I had forbid her to receive your visits , and will not be disgraced by their repetition . Edw . Edward Oakwood As a man of honor , I demand to know , what in my conduct , character or life , you find , that makes my visit here disgraceful to you sir . Mel . sen . Melville senior Have you not designs upon my daughters fortune , to repair your own . Edw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most honorable , nay , sir , I am proud to say , were I to receive her hand , from you a prize , I should esteem of courtless value , disgrace could never spring from that connection , unless it be disgraceful on my part , I could not buy her at her worth in gold . Mel sen . Melville senior What are your pretensions , let me ask ? are you not involved in difficulties , have you revenue to supply the wants of a wife , orin short , that rank in society , befits my heir and daughter . Edw . Edward Oakwood Fortune it is true , has dealt most hardly with me , and as the world fixes for her votaries , placed me in humble rank , from more exalted prospects . I hold a commission in the service of my country , and that I deem a grade of honor , higher than meer money gives , the wealthiest in the land . Mel sen . Melville senior ' T is a counterfeit , uncurrent coin , respect it buys not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor of it , a commission troth . Edw . Edward Oakwood Then sir , I have a noble title in reversion , I am heir to  --  Mel . sen . Melville senior Till what noble title , in a plebean country . contemptuously . Edw . Edward Oakwood A worthy man 's inheritance . Mel . sen . Melville senior How much mon , how much . Edw . Edward Oakwood More than the coffers , of your world of knaves , where ever stuffed withal , fair honor , shew me a title worthy of respect and grace your daughter with it . Mel . sen . Melville senior Fine words and fine possessions , troth ; get money mon , get money , and buy honor ; a muckle fortune , will do more at market , than aw the titles of your honorable ancestry ; henceforth , my locks , shall keep without the doors , one who would intrude without my invitation . exit . Edw . Edward Oakwood I would , the power to keep intruders out , were more extensive than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within their limits , thy unprincipled ingrates , that they disembogue , to heap their treasures , where they vent their venom ; then might we stop corruptions putrid tide , our country must be secure from foreign taint , nor lavish nurture on a reptile race , to knaw its vitals , and traduce its fame . exit . ACT II . SCENE 1 .  --  A Street in New Orleans . Enter Edward Oakwood and Capt . O'Flanagan , Meeting . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Good day friend Oakwood . Edw . Edward Oakwood Well encountered , my very wish to meet you . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan And mine no less , my heart is bursting with a freight of joy and labours . Edw . Edward Oakwood The cause of this emotion , I can judge , have you not seen the Tennessean troops . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan You guess it rightly . I was at the review , and never have witnessed such enthusiastic zeal before , never have heard , or read such warm devotion to the common cause . Edwd . Edward Oakwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harvest of rich honors . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Say but a tythe part that appears is proof the vaunting foe attacks a wall of brass , and leads an enterprize as full of peril , as did the Persian at the Spartan pass , when at Thermopyle the immortal band slew hecatombs of slaves , and died for freedom . Edw . Edward Oakwood The martial spirit that pervades all ranks defies defeat and promises protection . New Orleans now may boast of her Leonidas , and future times when they relate our story , will couple with our chief the Grecian hero . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan It seems as if heaven , propitious to our hopes , had from a host of veteran worthies called the man , complete in every warlike quality , to lead our arms , and crown our cause with victory . Edw . Edward Oakwood Illustrious man , most worthy of command , language is poor to speak his merit home . He seems endowed with more than human powers , and moulds men at his pleasure . Where wild confusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Materials opposite in nature meet , amalgamate , and move at his direction . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan The very soul of action , he towers , indeed , superior to a man , and rules the storm of battle . But tell me , Edward , were your scouts successful ? I hear you made some prisoners  --  it was a brave dash , and worthy of the leader . Edw . Edward Oakwood You flatter  --  we had some skirmishing o pickets , brought in some stragglers , and among them a prize of countless value . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan I rejoice to hear it ; an officer of rank ? Edw . Edward Oakwood Born to command , indeed ; but yet no officer . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Your enigma , pray , who may it be ? Edw . Edward Oakwood No other , truly , than a gentle lady . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan A female prisoner ? Edw . Edward Oakwood And a fair one . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Very handsome ; lucky rogue . Edw . Edward Oakwood Lovely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their opening leaves , or Titan breathes his burning kisses on them . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Bravo , faith , very gallantly hit off . Heroics are the order of the day . You will become the laureate of the camp , and wear the soldier 's and the poet 's wreath . Edw . Edward Oakwood Poets have never feigned a fairer face , nor famed Apelles , for his Paphian queen , conceived a form so exquisitely formed , indeed , though all the charms of Greece combined to aid him . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Now Venus animate this lovely picture , and like Pygmalion let me worship it . Where have you lodged this nonpareil of beauty ; say , Edward shall I kneel before the shrine ? Edw . Edward Oakwood With that devout respect that may become my friend , a soldier 's honor and a man 's humanity ; three powerful pleaders in misfortune 's favor . The bishop is her present guardian , whose mansion is the asylum of the unhappy . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan You throw cold water on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor of his friend , or think him capable of sporting with the wretched ? Edw . Edward Oakwood By heaven I do not . Pardon me , captain , I meant not to offend you . I know no heart more full of human kindness , and I am proud to share an interest in it ; but I have partly heard the lady 's story , and in my zeal forgot another pulse could beat as high for pity of a sufferer . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Edward , your hand ; there is no offence , indeed . How much I honor such a noble spirit .  --  What shouts are those ? Shouts heard . Edw . Edward Oakwood The general passes from the camp , and thus the populace welcome the worthy chief . Shall we walk on and see them ? O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan With all my heart ; but after that you must procure me a sight of the fair incognita . Edw . Edward Oakwood Most willingly . O'Flan . O'Brien O'Flanegan Allons  --  done . exeunt . SCENE 2.  --  British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lamp . Theo . Theodore Melville Am I awake indeed , or are my senses mocked with idle visions . Surely I am a prisoner here , and these are chains that hang upon my limbs , yet what has past and is , seems but the feverish fancies of a brain long , deprived of rest . Tyrants , aproach and learn a moral here . See that the victim of thy little spite unmoved can look at death and smile in chains . Like Regulus composed , ( when for his country suffering ) with firmness bear the malice of his fate , his heart unbent , unbroken , unsubdued . Ye can not reach the freedom of the mind . It is near the time the guard should visit me . I have some hope in him  --  he seems compassionate , and gentle pity like a clouded sun shines through the roughness of the soldier 's manners . Enter a Soldier . Sol . Soldier Young man , I bring you food . Theo . Theodore Melville Thanks , good friend , I hope I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope so too , and wish a pardon may relieve us both . Theo . Theodore Melville Death will  --  all else is hopeless . Sol . Soldier Still there is hope where life is . Theo . Theodore Melville Despair alone comes to the wretched captive of a British prison . My countrymen have learned what mercy to expect from officers well trained in British policy . ' T is their 's to  --  Sol . Soldier Spare me the shame of hearing this rebuke  --  perhaps in part correct , but yet uncharitable . Theo . Theodore Melville Speak not to me of charity , of British charity . What is it but remorseless butchery , cold-blooded assassination , chains , torture , scourging  --  have I not felt it , can not I prove it all ? Sol . Soldier This is the tempest of a noble mind , frenzied by wrongs and suffering . I am , you see , a British soldier , and  --  Theo . Theodore Melville I perceive  --  yet , thou seems't compassionate and kind . Canst thou not pity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  die like a culprit , rather than raise his arm against his country ? Sol . Soldier By heaven I can ! I do most heartily . Theo . Theodore Melville I pray you , soldier , sport not with me . I think thou bearest a heart unlike thy fellow ; for in thy eye the drop of pity trembles , and the soul 's eloquence speaks comfort in it . If to do me service be thy wish , indeed , aid my escape , and to a noble act of justice , which rewards itself . I have the means to give thee ample recompense . Sol . Soldier Think not a bribe could make me swerve from duty . Listen ; first know , I , too , am by birth an American . Though by a voluntary act I bear these arms , it was long before my country 's injuries roused her to war . It is now my purpose to escape a service grown hateful to my soul ; for never have I yet , and never will , in any manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brave countryman , with pleasure and surprise I hear this declaration . Sol . Soldier Be patient . I am resolved this night to quit the English camp . Say you will share the hazard of the flight , be my companion in the bold attempt , and life and liberty may still be yours . Theo . Theodore Melville Thanks , thanks , a thousand times good soldier , may heaven reward thy honesty and true allegiance . The city you beseige , contains my parents , kindred friends . Judge by your own , what are my feelings now ; give nature scope , and do a noble action . Sol . Soldier To night I guard your prison ; secreted with your food are implements to strike your irons off .  --  Determined to attempt your rescue , I shall be provided with disguises and the countersign , at midnight expect me , then fortune favor , and the day is ours Theo . Theodore Melville And if success but follow the attempt , my worthy friend will find a welcome home , and comfort grateful to declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent ; farewell till midnight . Theo . Theodore Melville And then farewell indeed . SCENE 3.  --  An apartment in the convent , Louisa reading . Lou . Louisa I can not read , my wandering mind , unsteady to the book , still to its own peculiar grief recurs , and fastens on its sorrows rising throws the book aside . O ! horrid war ! of heaven 's fell scourges worst ; wherefore dread demon from thy caves of night , stalkest thou , to breath contagious blasts on earth , poisoning its transient joys ; now o'er the fields , where teeming nature , late scattered her harvests with a bounteous hand , thy iron arm , the mild controul usurps , while smiling labour quits his peaceful reign . Now to the gleaming instruments of death , the plow and sickle yield , now man to man opposed , in deadly strife , with hostile menace , each to each , displays the glittering pomp , and proud ostent of arms , each swelling breast with emulation pants . Nature 's sweet sympathies are quite shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror ! horror ! spare me , ye powers of mercy , let me not think that way , t is madness , distraction .

Theo . Theodore Melville Come , come , my friend , these melancholy moralizing moods I well remember , when you were yet a boy . Since that time , tost about as I have been , on the stormy ocean of life , I have learned to calculate for sudden squalls and counter currents , as common occurrences in the voyage , and scarcely worth writing in the log . Edw . Edward Oakwood But should these squalls and counter-currents , drive you from your port , or wreck your hopes  --  Theo . Theodore Melville Wreck my hopes ; they are too well timbered Ned , easily to founder , and as to driving from port , I bring that up , by lee-way and dead reckoning , you see , come I hear , you have been unfortunate .

Theo . Theodore Melville I have enough to make us all happy , and tho ' you know my father discarded me , for my determination to enter the navy , which drove me into the merchant service .

Scene 3.  --  General Jackson 's Markee . A military Council  --  present , generals Jackson , Carroll , Coffee , &c.; Jack . General Jackson Worthy and valiant friends , the time approaches that must decide our destiny . Either our country rises from the shock , immortal , in a valorous daring spirit , or from the proudest height of glory fallen by mercenary hireling slaves thrown down , be blotted out forever . Cof . General Coffee Ere that shall happen , come the general doom , and nature find out chaos . Forget we now the fame our fathers earned , when this same foe they vanquished by their arms , and gave an empire freedom . Let not their memories rebuke our spirit ; again let foiled invaders feel the power that nerves the arm and feeds the heart of freemen . Again , O , Liberty , thy eagle eye blast and defeat their hopes . Jack . General Jackson In vain they swarm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assail our coast , if we resolve to guard our rights like men . What , shall this pomp of power , compel us yield the smallest natural priviledge we claim , to breath with them the common air of heaven ; when I am base enough to council this , may heaven 's own wrath overwhelm me for my crime , and blast my memory with a cowards name . Rather let desolating war rage uncontrouled and all the world against us come in arms ; let us alone sustain the awful shock , and bury us beneath the mighty general ruin . Car . General Carrol Ignoble terms , dishonorable conditions .  --  Chiefs of the war , the council spurns indignant ; what then remains ? Attack this giant foe and drive him hence ; or if we fail , still let us fail like freemen . Jack . General Jackson My friends we can not fail , if to ourselves we trust , to help ourselves , the aid of heaven will help us . With patient sufferance have we borne our injuries , till blushing shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions magnified within , dissentions nourished ; without scorn , insult , mockery trample us in dust ; a people 's greatness is their loyal virtues , and they unconquerable who will to be so . The eternal mind is free from mortal bondage , the chains of tyranny too weak to bind it , our cause is just , our means are ample , our country yet remains ; resolve , redress is certain .  --  Away with palsying doubts , lead on your power , chastise oppression , and redeem your honor . Now by that sainted name , who made our wars , when the republic first aspired to arms , and blessed a nation with the rights of man , I swear , till honorable peace and rights restored , return to bless the land , to banish all thoughts else , save vengeance on my country 's haughty foes .

General Jackson This our answer then , and so report : until his hostile bands retrace their march from hence , regain their ships and leave the land in peace , we break off farther parley , and henceforth , let force with force negociate , and decide in bloody combat for our sacred rights . So be our answer , and depart , in peace . Let him have honorable conduct hence . Farewell . Off . Officer Farewell , I grieve this summons should so ill succeed . exit officer . Jack . General Jackson Now chieftains close the council and retire . Invoke the Heaven 's to smile upon our country , conduct her safely through the gathering storm , to conquer in the conflict , fire every bosom with a holy zeal , and nerve our arms in battle ; let patriot virtue now sublime our feelings , its sacred influence possess our hearts and make us worthy of the place we hold . exeunt .
