INTRODUCTION In the spring of 1796 William Dunlap , casual portrait painter , occasional playwright and part owner of a china store , was induced to purchase an interest in the Old American Company , which , with headquarters at the John Street Theatre , New York , was one of the two principal theatrical organizations in the United States . Dunlap took this step partly in the hope of substantial monetary returns and partly that he might be in a position to bring out his own plays , but he was also influenced by a desire to develop a truly moral and artistic stage in America . The painful realization was soon thrust upon him , however , that money could be more readily lost than made in the theatrical business and that New York playgoers felt no irresistible impulse to witness his original dramas or to lend their support to a truly moral and artistic stage . But , once a partner in the concern , he was unwilling or unable to withdraw , and indeed within two years he found himself sole director and manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box office he almost immediately turned to the translation and production of the most popular plays by the European sensation of the hour , August Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue . " The German Shakespeare , " as his admirers sometimes labelled him , did not meet with Dunlap 's unqualified approval . The American took exception to his false philosophy and his unsound moral standards , but he recognized his genuine skill as a craftsman and he could not ignore his equally genuine drawing power . It should be said , however , that Dunlap expurgated his originals freely and left some of the more objectionable plays untranslated . The manager 's first adaptation from Kotzebue , The Stranger , based on Menschenhass und Reue , was brought out at the recently built Park Theatre on December 10 , 1798 . A year and a day later his fifth translation , False Shame ; or , The American Orphan in Germany , was produced at the same house . The cast was as follows : Baron Flachsland Joseph Tyler Captain Erlach John Hodgkinson Wieland Thomas A. Cooper Vicomte de Maillac John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hodgkinson Adelaide Mrs. Lewis Hallam Emmy Ellen Westray Madame Moreau Mrs. Charlotte Melmoth On the opening night False Shame , according to Dunlap 's account in A History of the American Theatre , " was performed with the utmost success .... This play , without scenery or decoration , by the plain dialogue and natural character , supported the theatre this , the second season of the author 's direction . As in the case of ' The Stranger , ' it ran through the whole winter . " While stating that the entire piece was well acted , the translator praises in particular Ellen Westray and John Hodgkinson : " Her youth and beauty contrasted finely with Hodgkinson 's figure and manner , which were so well suited to the veteran German officer who had borne her when an infant from the flames of Charleston  --  the exquisitely natural playing of both  --  made an impression never to be forgotten , and rendered the comedy useless to the theatre of New-York when they ceased to perform the parts . " For some reason Dunlap 's version of Falsche Scham was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . The play in English was printed three times in this country : at New York in 1800 , at Charleston in 1800 and at Newark in 1801 . But an examination of these editions proves that all three are exact reprints of the anonymous British translation published at London in 1799 . Dunlap 's rendering shows no trace of obligation to this English version and in fact , although not without awkward phrases , is a considerable improvement upon it in smoothness and colloquial ease . Except for the omission of several unimportant speeches or parts of speeches , which are cancelled in the manuscript and hence omitted in the present edition , he follows his author quite closely . Two characters undergo a change of name : the daughter Minchen becomes Adelaide , and von Hugel , the country gentleman , becomes Wieland  --  probably as a gesture of respect toward the recent novel of the translator 's closest friend , Charles Brockden Brown . The wave of prosperity in the New York theatre for which Kotzebue was responsible was only temporary , and early in 1805 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare himself a bankrupt . He now resumed his former profession of painting and almost completely abandoned playwriting until 1827 , when the manager of the new Bowery Theatre requested him to provide a series of plays to compete with those being offered at the Park . In his own words , he received " meager compensation for poor commodities . " The second of the three plays thus produced was Thirty Years ; or , The Gambler 's Fate . It is a translation of a then famous French melodrama , Trente Ans ou la ' Vie d'un Joueur , written by Prosper Goubaux ( who sometimes employed the pseudonym of Dinaux ) and Victor Ducange , and produced at Paris in 1827 . In an English translation by H. M. Milner called The Hut of the Red Mountain ; or , Thirty Years of a Gambler 's Life , it was given the same year in London . On November 15 , 1827 , the play appeared at the Park Theatre in an entirely different translation called The Gambler 's Fate ; or , Thirty Years of a Gamester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On February 22 , 1828 , Dunlap 's competing version was brought out at the Bowery and was repeated over a dozen times in the course of the year . The following incomplete cast was listed in the newspaper advertisements : George St. Germain George H. Barrett Warner Thomas Archer Albert Mrs. G. H. Barrett Amelia Mrs. Charles Gilfert Mrs. Birman Mrs. William Jones Of the three translations , all of which seem to have been independently made , Dunlap 's is much the closest to the original . He leaves unchanged the names of the characters , except that he substitutes St. Germain for de Germany , and he follows the outline of events carefully until the very end , where , perhaps to satisfy poetic justice , he causes George to kill Warner and himself instead of allowing them to be seized by soldiers in the midst of the burning cabin . Although the dialogue is not translated with literal exactness , it is faithfully rendered except for some condensation , especially in the longer speeches . The title-page of the manuscript bears the double name of The Gambler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamester . But the newspaper advertisements refer to the play as Thirty Years ; or , The Gambler 's Fate ; hence that name has been adopted for the present edition . In preparing these manuscripts for publication I have dealt somewhat freely with certain details of composition . In matters of spelling , capitalization and punctuation Dunlap seems to have been governed chiefly by caprice . It is not merely that he violates many of the canons of modern usage but that he is notably inconsistent with himself . Consequently I have taken the liberty of introducing such changes as would result in a reasonable uniformity of practice , while retaining in a modified degree some of his peculiarities , such as an extreme fondness for the dash as a mark of punctuation . Slight changes have also been made in the stage directions , likewise in the interests of uniformity . The language of the dialogue , however , has not been altered in any way , even by the correction of an occasional error in grammar . The text as here printed for the first time is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prompt copy , and therefore the acting version , of both plays . It is perhaps worth pointing out that the manuscript of Thirty Years is only partly in Dunlap 's hand . The second act is clearly his , but the first and third acts are in a more delicate script . Two sheets bear the signature of A. Gilfert ( Mrs. Charles Gilfert ) written diagonally across in a chirography very similar to that of the first and third acts , suggesting that the leading lady may have helped the translator in making a " fair copy " of his play . The manuscript of False Shame is entirely in Dunlap 's hand and is a beautiful specimen of penmanship throughout .

Frelon You may be endured perhaps in what concerns the kitchen garden , but , mon ami , you are totally destitute of taste . John . John Aye ? Fre . Frelon These trees , these hedges , these tulip beds , may be well enough in Holland , but they do not suit us ; we admire the grand , the striking , the surprising  --  hermitages , tombs  --  John .

All the flowers are cropt from their stocks . Not a rose left to perfume the air . Bar . Baroness What is it for ? John . John How should I know ? She is going to give a thing  --  the wind-bottle there that just skipt away named it in French , and Mounseer Rosat , the friseur , has translated it for me ; it is called  --  ha , ha , ha !  --  a dancing breakfast .

John Yes , yes , Content is a lovely little bird , but it sometimes disappears as suddenly as the swallow . The Baron sighs but seeks to hide it Do not take it ill of me , my lord ; I am an old grey servant . I stood by and devoutly looked on when you were baptized . As you grew you always wished to be by yourself ; and when the neighbors ' children played , you sometimes joined in their sports , out of complaisance to them , tho ' you had rather have been alone , and at such times you looked just as you look this morning  --  I mean no ill , my lord ; you understand me . Bar . Baroness Smil ing If the neighbors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more has a dearly loved wife ! John . John But that which is easy to the boy , may be a hard task to the man . The young tree bends , the old tree breaks . When one has jogged on peaceably in the same path , every day for a quarter of a century , one is not willing at the end to make a side-spring . Bar . Baroness I see thy meaning . But my wife is young ; I am already past forty , and must therefore double my complaisance . With warmth And does she not deserve my utmost confidence ? So good , so excellent ! John . John She is very well , if she would not meddle with the garden . Bar . Baroness How now , old man ! In what does she trouble thee ? John . John Alas , my good lord , the garden is my paradise . My father , God bless him ! laid it out ; I was born and brought up in it , and except a few years which I passed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely set my foot over the door .

Baroness Well ? Go on ? John . John There thought I thus to myself : if thou askest the favor of the good Baron , he will let thee be buried in this spot . Bar . Baroness It shall be so ! Good old man ! John . John Yes  --  but pardon me , sir  --  who knows how long the birch trees shall stand ? The Baroness designs many alterations . The wall shall be torn down and the meadow planted with young trees .

John . John Who shall protect the poor birch trees , when even these lindens shall not be spared ? Bar . Baroness Which lindens ? John . John Po inting to the trees Do you no longer know your foster-children , my lord ? You and your sister , my young Lady Phillipina , planted them on the birthday of your dear good mother . Bar . Baroness Oh , I remember it well ! John . John At that time you were both children , hardly as high as this rose bush . Your sister a little taller than you . After you had planted the scions in the earth , you stretched out your little hands and joined them over the twigs and kissed one-another . And your mother wiped her eyes and said to me : " John , take care of the little trees ! " And I have done it faithfully . They have become a pair of fine proud trees ! And now shall I cut them down ?  --  No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and my hands would tremble , if I should lift the axe against one of these trees . Bar . Baroness Who asks of thee to cut them down ? John . John The Baroness says that if one sits there in the bower , the linden trees obstruct the view of the village . Bar . Baroness Never mind . Nobody shall touch the lindens . It is my command . John . John Very well , my lord . Now let the Devil touch them , if he dare . Bar . Baroness Let them stand and entwine their arms and kiss each other to the sound of each murmuring breeze , when my sister and myself shall sleep far beneath the green turf . Let no one touch them ; they are all that remain of my sister . John . John Alas , yes ! Bar . Baroness But the Baroness knew not that . Mark , John . My wife knew nothing of that . John . John Possibly not . Yesterday was the first time she mentioned it . I believe that skip-about vicomte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was with her , and capered and played tricks around her , treading down here a cucumber and there a strawberry vine . I think the Baroness values him highly . Bar . Baroness With stifled feeling Think'st thou ? John . John He is always by her side . Bar .

To give to you would be but to return your gifts . What have I that comes not from you ? Bar . Baroness From me ? By no means , my child . You are indebted to me for nothing but the roof which shelters you .

Baroness So he writes me in his usual laconic style , a letter of three lines . I confess the news has surprised me , for it is not Erlach 's fashion to pay visits at the beginning of a campaign . Em . Emmy I can scarcely remember his face or figure . Oh , I wish he were already here . I will go to meet him . Which way must he come , dear father ? Bar . Baroness That is more than I can tell .

Baroness Now , my dear little American , let me hear it . Em . Emmy When on a fine evening I have stole away from your cheerful circle , to walk alone in the dark beech-alley , then have I built castles in the air ; then have I thought how I might repay my benefactor , might make the evening of his life serene  --  but I am a foolish talkative girl .  --  Happily for me , here they all come from the ball .

Pray , sir , why did you always stand aloof as if you were lame ? Wie . Mr. Wieland I am not accustomed to dancing in public ; and your city gentlemen seize every opportunity of turning us rustics into ridicule . Bar . Baroness False shame is the only fault I ever could find in my young friend . Ad . Adelaide But that is not all , papa . At table I sat near him and filled his glass for him and was very attentive to him I 'll assure you , and , whether it was the wine or my politeness which inspired him , Heaven knows , but the mute Mr. Wieland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoursed so interestingly , that I almost forgot we were in the temple of Folly . For Heaven 's sake , sir , why are you in general so covetous of words ? Wie . Mr. Wieland Because in large companies I find myself apt to say foolish things . Ad . Adelaide My dear sir , why that is the very use of large companies : they are public marts where each brings and exhibits his folly with impunity . What would be modesty in the smaller circle , would , in the great world , be false shame . There our clothes must shine and our words sound ; at home , we require warmth from apparel and instruction from conversation . Bar . BaronessWho has been looking about with uneasiness Where did you leave your mother ? Ad . Adelaide She thought you were still in bed , and hastened to your chamber that she might awake you with a kiss . Bar . Baroness Was she alone ? Ad . Adelaide Alone indeed !

Vicomte de Maillac Very gallant , a genuine French turn , upon my honor . Bar:ss . Baroness I will not leave thee the whole of this day for that speech .

The Baroness has most delicious ideas . Bar:ss . Baroness Curtsying My ideas thank you . Mail . Vicomte de Maillac Sincerely , ladies , I came to Germany with very low expectations . They had given me a horrible idea of the German ladies . A girl of fifteen , said they , blushes for shame , if she is obliged to take off her gloves , and sticks her hands under the dinner table ; she sits mute and imbecile near a man of the world or turns away , whispers and titters in the ear of one of her unmannerly companions ; a girl of eighteen always has moist eyes , swims in a sea of sensibility , affects to be in love , and calls it constancy to her lover when she treats a stranger with rudeness ; a woman of twenty thinks she proves her immaculate virtue by drawing back and childishly pouting when a young man approaches and says a handsome thing in her ear ; a woman of five and twenty  --  Bar : ss .

Ad . Adelaide Soon may the maidens of Germany carry you to the grave , that they may deck with garlands the tomb of their poet . Mail . Vicomte de Maillac It may to be sure be objected to my book in praise of German civilization , that it is the French emigrants who first began to polish the nation , and that the Revolution which has caused so much misery in the South , has been the means of extending taste and cultivation to the North .

Emmy Not here , not in company with the wise and good ; but you know upon what the world grounds its mistaken and superficial opinions . Erl . Captain Erlach Already , again , false shame . Dear Emmy , a maiden is nobly clad , when the vestments of innocence bedeck her . However , thou shalt want for nothing . I confess I like such an apron and pockets , it looks so domestic ; but the pockets must not be empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emmy Very much frightened No ! No !  --  For Heaven 's sake not !  --  You have misunderstood me.  --  You humble me  --  I have more than I want  --  if you love me put up the money again . Erl . Captain Erlach Well , well , only be quiet . Puts up his purse I did not manage it well . Pardon me , I am too downright . The art of giving is the finest of the fine arts ; but alas ! I do not understand it . Em . Emmy I intended to confess a weakness , and my words have assumed the appearance of effrontery . Am I not treated here as a daughter or a sister ? How often have they pressed me to accept jewels and costly clothing of every kind . But they would ill become me . I still perhaps have parents living , who languish in poverty and misery , and shall I clothe myself in satins ? I am perhaps only a common peasant 's child , and shall I hang brilliants in my ears ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , truly that thou art not ! Em . Emmy Hastily and anxiously You know perhaps something of my origin ? Erl . Captain Erlach Nothing , dear girl , conjectures  --  Em . Emmy Oh , impart to me your conjectures ! Tell me the history of my deliverance ! When you left us , eight years ago , I was a child and did not understand it . I will assist you with the obscure remembrances of my infancy  --  I will describe to you the figure of my mother  --  perhaps she still lives ! Gracious God ! perhaps my mother still lives ! Erl . Captain Erlach It is possible but not probable . We landed and surprised Charlestown in the night . Our people had overcharged themselves with drink and from soldiers became incendiaries . The town was soon in flames ; the fire spread from every corner ; those who escaped from the devouring element were cut down and trampled under foot . No command , no subordination . I unwillingly recall the remembrance of that night of Hell ! I made myself hoarse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain . At length the day broke and cast its light upon the scene of multiplied horrors . Covered with blood and dust , begrimed with smoke and embers , the soldiers lay scattered among the ruins and snored . All was desolate and horribly still . As I clambered , sword in hand , over the smoking beams , I suddenly heard a low , soft plaint beneath me . I listened  --  I removed the glowing rafters and half-burnt planks , when behold ! an infant 's lovely face ! The little eyes were fixed on mine and mournfully it cried , " Mother ! where is my mother ! " That helpless infant was thee , dear Emmy . Thy body half buried in the ruins , thy life had been saved but by miracle . I cleared away the rubbish as well as I could and one of your little hands becoming free , the first use you made of it was to waft me a kiss  --  the action touched me beyond expression ! " Patience , poor worm , " said I ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant was at no great distance ; I beckoned him to me , we gave thee air , and drew thee unhurt to the day . I took you on my arm ; you clung about my neck . " My mother ! " you cried in English , " take me to my mother . " " My mother ! " you repeated in French , " to my mother " ; and thinking I did not understand , you at last repeated in German , the same touching words . Em . Emmy My mother ! Erl . Captain Erlach " Who is thy mother ? " I asked . " Here in the narrow street , the good woman in the yellow house . " Alas there was neither narrow street or broad , neither house or woman . All my endeavors to discover something relative to you were in vain . With those who had escaped we had no intercourse . We were ordered on board our ships . What was to be done ? Should I leave you behind among the burning ruins ? I obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he was touched with compassion when he saw you  --  you were then such a little thing  --  that I can not conceive , for the soul of me , how you have become so tall . Em . Emmy Alas ! and do you know nothing more ? Erl . Captain Erlach Shakes his head We were fortunate enough to return safe to Europe , and you found a safe asylum in the house of my friend . Em . Emmy Not even my name ? Could I not lisp to you my name ? Erl . Captain Erlach Your first name , Emmy . Therefore I hold you to be the child of English parents ; but you spake French and German as fluently as you did English , from which I conclude that you are of no common family . On your clothing was marked A.M. ; nothing further do I know . Em . Emmy Oh , if I were but there , in America ! my native country ! If I should see my parents , surely I should know them again . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I shall never forget her figure ! She looked so pale , and often wept  --  perhaps she weeps now still oftener than then  --  and I can not mingle my tears with hers . She sobs Erl . Captain Erlach Cheer up , dear Emmy . I see the confused squadron sailing up the alley this way . Such tears are not for people who have just been sweating away in the dance the little feeling God gave them . Em . Emmy I can not now be cheerful . I pray your permission to withdraw . Exit R.H. Erl . Captain Erlach Lovely maiden ! What a pity it is , that she has grown so tall and handsome . The heart expands not as formerly , and the familiar appellations , so dear in childhood , now die upon my lips . I will , however , order my trunk to be brought . Enter L.H. the Baroness , Adelaide , Wieland and Maillac Bar : ss . Baroness Welcome , Captain Erlach ! heartily welcome !

A delicate turn ' pon honor . Erl . Captain Erlach Your wishes are very modest , my lady . Bar : ss . Baroness We have been waiting for you a time which , to our expectations , has appeared an eternity . Erl . Captain Erlach So much the worse for me ! He who is long expected , is commonly found much below expectation . Bar : ss . Baroness A hundred and a hundred times have I asked how you looked ? When I hear of persons who are interesting to me , I always endeavor to sketch to myself a figure corresponding to their character , but I commonly find that my portraits bear no resemblance to the originals . For example I have always painted you as a jovial man , with an open countenance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain Erlach Your most obedient , my lady . Bar : ss .

Baroness But , Mr. Soldier , when friendship has determined to take a heart by surprise  --  Erl . Captain Erlach Only the heart of a fool can be taken by surprise . Bar : ss . Baroness You are right ; conquer , I would say  --  she fears not the guards who stand on the outposts . In short , I am resolved to become your friend that I may no longer be your rival . Erl .

But tell me , my lord vicomte , why is your book called the " New Hlose " ? Mail . Vicomte de Maillac Probably a whim of the author 's , for in the whole book I do not find a single word of any Hlose . Wie . Mr. Wieland Smiling Indeed ! Ad .

Mr. Wieland Because I know by experience that he has lighter heels than I have . Ad . Adelaide It would be droll enough though if you were to fight a duel to prove Abelard seven hundred years old . Wie . Mr. Wieland Men have often cut one another 's throats for causes of as little consequence . Ad . Adelaide Yes . Or become martyrs . Wie . Mr. Wieland Obstinacy is a passion as well as anger ; and passion only wants to be put in motion , no matter by what . Ad . Adelaide That is a confession you should by no means make to a lady . Wie .

Forbid it Heaven ! for in that case I must marry tomorrow morning . Wie . Mr. Wieland That depends only on yourself . Ad . Adelaide On me ! That 's droll enough ! As if one could say , " Today will I give away my heart . " Wie . Mr. Wieland Why not ? Even as well as one can say , " Today will I not shut my ear to the supplicant ; today will I make glad the unfortunate . " Ad . Adelaide My reasonable sir , you overrate the worth of a maiden 's heart . Wie . Mr. Wieland I speak only of yours . Ad . Adelaide And of that you know nothing . Wie . Mr. Wieland I , not know your heart ! Then must the sweet remembrance of my childhood have flown without trace from my mind . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still resided at his country seat and lived in neighborly friendship with mine ! When oft times the sportive Adelaide sought the first strawberries to carry to her father or flowers to make garlands for her mother 's birthday . O Adelaide ! do I not know your heart ? Ad . Adelaide I never knew before that you were a poet . Wie . Mr. Wieland Chagrined O my heart ! Be mute ! The expression of thy feeling is taken for a fiction ! Ad . Adelaide I begin to be afraid of you . Enthusiasm is catching . Wie . Mr. Wieland Enthusiasm  --  I have been used to hear the pure effusions of nature and love so called . Therefore did I shut up my heart , but I threw not the key into the sea of the great world ; I preserved it sacred for the ideal mistress of my hopes and wishes . A maiden would I seek to whom the man without ostentation is of more worth than the fop who titters sneeringly as he skips by the plain country gentleman because he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent man with the fool .

This kind embarrassment proves a traitor and shows me your inestimable mind . Yes , with extacy have I often observed that when mingling in the confused noise of the gay world , the serenity of your forehead has been clouded with displeasure and disgust and that you became witty when you dared not be cordial and sincere . Oh , fly these deplorable circles , which are walls against reason , and cardhouses when opposed to passion . Where those call one another friends who cheat each other of their time ; where the rich man pities the unfortunate while he shuffles the cards , and before the third trick , has forgot him ; where selfishness marries interest , fear begets servility , and familiarity with vice hides its deformity . Fly , Adelaide , from this infected atmosphere to the seats of rural delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . We are cheerful without cards , and conversable without calumny . We dare not be ashamed to love the oppressed , or fear to call him loudly rogue whose actions deserve the appellation . I possess but a little piece of land which I can call mine , but if to the blessing which industry , fortune and my own heart have given me , Adelaide will still add love , there will be nothing wanting to my little paradise but to be walled around with towering rocks that it may be inaccessible to envy .  --  Are you silent ?  --  Does the lively Adelaide cast down her eyes and disrobe her nosegay of its leaves ? Ad . Adelaide I think , Mr. Wieland , that it is a proof of my esteem for you that my levity at this moment abandons me . Wie . Mr. Wieland Your esteem is my pride , but love alone can make me happy . Ad . Adelaide Before I answer you , avow to me sincerely  --  What part has my figure in your love ? Wie . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never examined myself . Ad . Adelaide Do it then now . It is of much consequence for me to know . Should I have been the object of your choice if I had been ugly or deformed ?  --  I demand a sincere answer upon honor and honesty . Wie . Mr. Wieland Be it so . I would love you even if you were ugly , but I dare not assert that I should have so ardently sought , or so quickly recognized , the beauties of your soul if it had been shrouded in an ugly cover . Ad . Adelaide And if now , suddenly , the smallpox should disfigure my face ? Or if I were not that which I appear ? Wie . Mr. Wieland I am willing to take the hazard . Ad . Adelaide You shall hazard nothing . She who can deceive an honest man , deserves not an honest man 's love . She takes his hand I  --  Mr. Wieland  --  I esteem you highly  --  perhaps something more  --  but  --  Wie . Mr. Wieland No but ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Wieland That your heart is promised ?

Adelaide Yes , yes , I will answer you  --  soon  --  but not now  --  this dance is a favorite of mine  --  come  --  come , you shall dance it with me . Wie . Mr. Wieland I can not possibly dance now . Ad . Adelaide Indeed  --  the music is so inviting  --  you will not ?  --  Pardon me then , I must find a dancer . Exit hastily L.H. Wie . Mr. Wieland Looking after her with astonishment Is it possible ! God ! Is it possible ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of a miserable dance . An honest man has she found , but she goes to seek a dancer ! Now then farewell , all faith in innocence and nature ! Go , Wieland ! Hide thyself under thy rustic roof ! Water thy cabbage garden , and frighten away each singing bird from thy borders , that his song may not remind thee of this accursed dance ! Exit R.H. ACT III . Enter Captain Erlach L.H. Erl . Captain Erlach Much eating and drinking , much laughing , and no true joy . He is not always glad who laughs . One laughs at his own wit , and , if he happens to be rich or great , the whole company force themselves to join in chorus . Another laughs at a double entendre which he alone finds out to be such , and then looks round upon the ladies to amuse himself with their embarrassment . Here a talkative mother recounts the ingenious tricks of her children and forces the hearer to mingle yawns with his laughter . There a chapter in the scandalous chronicle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the trees . When they go home , my Lord A. says to my Lady B. , " It was a delicious party ! How we all laughed !

If she knew how her husband consumes away in secret  --  but a little patience and she shall know it . When we shall have lived a few months under the same roof .  --  A few months ?  --  How , Erlach ?  --  Couldst thou swim so long in this strange element ?  --  Why not ? Flachsland is my friend , and Emmy is  --  Why dost hesitate , old boy ?  --  Daughter , sister , friend  --  it is all one which she is to me !

Emmy No , I seek  --  It is absolutely necessary that I speak with somebody who has hidden himself , I believe  --  Heaven knows into which bush he has crept . Your pardon . Curtsies familiarly and exit R.H. Erl . Captain Erlach Your most obedient servant ! Now that was not so handsomely done of her . She might have spared a few minutes , and a few words , if it had been only to tell me that the weather is fine , or the leaves on the trees , green . Hum ! Whom seeks she ?  --  Who is this somebody ?  --  And what has she that is so absolutely necessary to tell him ?  --  Somebody ?  --  That may mean a woman  --  but I will lay a wager it is a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus ?  --  Perhaps a secret of the heart ?  --  Well , what is that to me ?  --  How does it concern me ?  --  If I was really her father she would not have dared to put me off with a bare " somebody "  --  and I think I have deserved so much confidence , that she might have said in passing by , " This somebody is called so or so . " But so it goes when girls grow eight years older . Enter Baroness L.H. Bar : ss . Baroness Do you seek solitude , Captain ? Erl . Captain Erlach It is hard to find it here , my lady . Bar : ss . Baroness Is that praise or censure ? Erl . Captain Erlach I never dispute about taste . Bar : ss . Baroness I understand .

Erl . Captain Erlach And goes he with you ? Bar : ss . Baroness Seldom . Unless forced by my earnest entreaties . Erl . Captain Erlach What makes he alone at home ? Bar : ss . Baroness God knows . Sportively Perhaps he makes gold . At least , at my return he always receives me as if he had found a treasure . Erl . Captain Erlach Hum . I am sorry for it . Bar : ss .

How so ? Erl . Captain Erlach At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ss . Baroness Speak more plainly . Erl . Captain Erlach I had rather hold my peace . We are yet strangers . Bar : ss . Baroness Strangers ? When my husband gave me a right to his love , he gave me a right to your friendship . To please my husband is my inmost wish . Indeed the difference of our years is great , nor was it Love that conducted me to his arms , but invited thither by Esteem , Love overtook and made me his prize . We have played no romance with one another . No lightning has inflamed us , but the unclouded sun of matrimonial felicity has warmed us through by degrees . In full confidence of my feeling this warmth , speak . And if still , after this explanation , my presence embarrasses you , I will place myself behind these trees , you shall forget that I am near , and in your soliloquy you need not spare me . Erl .

Erl . Captain Erlach The narrower the better . Reason and Joy are a pair of guests who pass by without knocking when they see light in all the windows . Bar : ss . Baroness But Folly serves Reason as a foil . Erl . Captain Erlach She needs none , and if your husband has persuaded you that this manner of living is according to his wish , he has deceived you . Bar : ss . Baroness That would grieve me . Erl . Captain Erlach He thinks this complaisance due to your youth . Bar : ss . Baroness Then he little knows me . Erl .

Captain Erlach Nay he may still be called a man of property . But if his riches melt away as they have done the last three years  --  Bar : ss . Baroness Sir ! You frighten me ! Erl . Captain Erlach Where the expenditures so far exceed the receipts  --  Bar : ss . Baroness Is it possible ! Erl .

Captain Erlach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his estate in the country . Bar : ss . Baroness Willingly ! Willingly ! Even yet this evening ! Erl . Captain Erlach But he feared that to your youthful mind , the uniformity of a country life  --  Bar : ss . Baroness Oh ! how it grieves me , that my husband has not held it worth his trouble to learn to know my heart ; that a stranger has had more confidence in me , than the man of whose love I am proud ; that I should impoverish his children and rob him of repose ; that I should squander away what father 's care and mother 's love had gathered together ! Why did he not prove me ? What right has he to believe that a swarm of coxcombs can give me more pleasure , than domestic quiet and the society of a reasonable man ? O Captain Erlach , you men often reproach us with our weakness ; it is not weakness , it is flexibility of soul , and it only depends upon you to bend and attach it to the amiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women accords itself not with truth . You demand from them health of soul yet poison them with flattery  --  But I complain and reason when I should act . Your hand , Captain ; you shall hear from me , and avow that I have deserved your confidence . With emotion and exit L.H. Erl . Captain Erlach Right  --  That is my way . If she keeps her word , then will I dwell here . But if I dwell here , that girl must alter her behavior  --  she must not run away from me  --  must have confidence in me  --  I wish to know however if she has found her damned somebody . Enter Wieland L.H. , very thoughtful Here comes another who has escaped the gabbling , and wishes to gain the use of his ears again . Welcome , Mr. Wieland , I wish you joy . Wie .

Em . Emmy Condemn not too hastily , my good Mr. Wieland , or you may repent your rashness at the feet of my friend . Do you make no allowance for the embarrassment of a poor girl ? What would you say if Adelaide heartily loved you , but only avoided a certain avowal for fear of diminishing her worth in your eyes ? Wie . Mr. Wieland Smiling ironically You presuppose a case  --  Em . Emmy I presuppose nothing . There are things , Mr. Wieland , which our sex think of vast consequence , but which , happily , are not always so in the eyes of yours . Wie . Mr. Wieland Speak clearer . Em .

When an infant her nurse let her fall on the stairs . Her habit-maker has the skill perfectly to conceal it ; but in the eyes of her future spouse , she would not appear more charming than she is . Now you have the key to the riddle . False shame prevented her from telling you this , herself . Now you know all ; you know what you have lost in personal perfection , and gained in beauty of die mind . Softly whispered my friend in my ear , " Emmy , I love him ! but let him guess that .

"  --  Sighs  --  What was that ? Do I catch myself sighing ?  --  Yet sure I am no envy moves in my breast at the thought of my friend 's good fortune . No , no !

That is a pity ! Em . Emmy You are very kind , madam . How shall I mention you to the Baron ? M:M . Madame Moreau A poor old woman , nothing more . I hope I am in a house where that title will shut neither door or heart against me . Em . Emmy By that I understand that you already know the Baron . He will be here instantly , madam , for to the summons of the poor and the old he is never tardy . Exit L.H. M:M .

The rich find relations in every quarter of the globe , the poor are only allied to misery . It will be better not yet to disclose who I am , but observe his behavior first  --  perhaps I shall be more welcome as an object of benevolence than if I demanded assistance for a sister , which might then be given as a burthensome duty .

We resolved to wait a more favorable change of our fates from the all-reconciling hand of Time and by the scanty aid of a friend we emigrated to America . Bar . Baroness To America ! Em . Emmy To America ? May I ask in what town you settled ? M:M . Madame Moreau In Charlestown . Em . Emmy Charlestown !  --  Heavens !  --  Anxiously , with mixed hope and fear M:M .

Heaven tied our band of love still faster , by giving us two lovely children , a son and daughter  --  Em . Emmy A daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Moreau Ah , William , ask me not ! Heaven has punished me for the sorrows which I caused to my parents . The war in which America preserved her liberty by the sword , reduced us to beggary . Eight years ago we returned to Europe . Only the mother of my husband remained alive . She forgave him . We enjoyed once more a moment of rest , until the terribly tempestuous revolution of France again wrecked our fortunes . My husband was a warm patriot , and fell a victim to anarchy and avarice . My son  --  a poor deluded youth  --  emigrated to Germany with some French libertines of rank under the monarchy  --  . Alas , too well have they succeeded in making him a selfish , foolish coxcomb ; and in stifling within him the feelings of nature and duty . I confess with confusion that he was the first person that met me as I approached the gates of this town . Bar . Baroness This town ! M:M . Madame Moreau Yes , he is here , I have recognized him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to doubt . In the company of a crowd of wild young men he rode close by me . " My son !

" I heard one of his companions ask . I stretched out my arms , " I am his mother , " sobbed I. Alas ! he was ashamed of his kneeling mother . " The good woman is mad , " he cried , and applied the spur to his horse . Bar . Baroness Poor sister ! M:M . Madame Moreau The avenging arm of Providence is on me . When I saw from afar the house of my parents , the whole sense of my guilt rushed on me , and then , even then , the Almighty sent my son before me , to reward me like for like . I murmur not .

Madame Moreau In one terrible night was the town plundered and set on fire in every part . The inhabitants fled , I with the crowd , leaning on the arm of my husband , who carried our little daughter . The boy ran by our side . Before we had got clear of the town a falling roof o'erwhelmed my husband  --  the same moment the affrighted multitude rushed through the narrow pass and hurried me senseless out of town .

Let a man fall in love , and every misfortune under Heaven befalls him . He will leave me alone with her ? What ? Shall I speak to her ? No ! I will go my ways . Farewell , miss ! and if you should ever lie buried up to the neck in ruins again , I 'll be damned if  --  Erlach ! Erlach ! nothing in the world should make a man swear . She comes nigher .

Praise and fame may be the rewards for heroic actions , actions for the performance of which , scarcely one moment of intoxication is necessary . The noblest deeds are not the most brilliant .

Madame Moreau Does my brother know  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew nothing about it myself ten minutes ago . Bravo ! Flachsland my uncle  --  as such he may dare laugh at me and the nephew will say not a word . Come , dear Emmy , let us take courage . We will boldly look the scoffers in the face . Em . Emmy What have we to be ashamed of ? Erl . Captain Erlach I , that I was two and thirty years a fool ; and you , that you held it worth while to convert such a fool from his folly . Puts her arm within his and is going L.H. Enter Adelaide and Wieland L.H. arm in arm meeting them Erl . Captain Erlach Who comes there ? ad . Adelaide A friend ! Erl . Captain Erlach The countersign ? ad . Adelaide Love and Hymen ! Erl . Captain Erlach Bravo ! Everything pairs . That is just my way . Ad . Adelaide How , Mr. Captain ?

Who would believe that the man who entwines his arm so fast about thee is only thy foster-father . Erl . Captain Erlach What foster-father ? Damn foster-father ! She is my bride . And now laugh , laugh , I am armed against your raillery . Wie . Mr. Wieland Truly you are . If we laugh , ' t is a laugh of congratulating joy . Ad . Adelaide Little cousin , you say not a word .

Em . Emmy Have I known him then , only this morning ? Ad . Adelaide But what knows he of you ? Erl . Captain Erlach Bah ! When the spark falls in a powder-cask , in a moment all is in the air . Ad . Adelaide " Bah ! " I did not know that men 's hearts were powder-casks . However , we should make the best of past things , and since it has gone so far , let this solemn curtsy say  --  Begins a formal curtsy and stops short with great vivacity No  --  that 's worth nothing . Come here , my dear , dear Emmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kisses her heartily Do you understand me ? Wie . Mr. Wieland Giving his hand to Erlach Captain , I am heartily glad  --  Erl .

Adelaide For more than thirty years has he been making an ice-house of his head , and heaping cold sentences one on the top of the other ; but those blue eyes have pierced through the thick walls and the ice is all melted away . Bar . Baroness So much the better . Erl . Captain Erlach Sportingly Yes , dear uncle , if you have nothing against it  --  Bar . Baroness My dear nephew , you have more luck than you deserve . Erl . Captain Erlach The Spaniards sail to America for gold . I have brought from thence a treasure , beyond all comparison more precious  --  the innocent heart of a native ! Bar . Baroness I see with satisfaction that the gaudy swarm have fluttered away . Ad . Adelaide The Baroness pretended headache , and one after another glided off . Bar . Baroness Where is your mother ? She alone is wanting . Ad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shut up ? From us ? What does that mean ? Erl . Captain Erlach My sword to a shoetie , nothing ill . M:M . Madame Moreau She received me with the most heartfelt love ; she appeared transported at my unexpected return . " Heaven , " cried she , " pays me my reward beforehand I But , dear sister , " she continued , " leave me a little while , one hour must yet pass before I can make you truly welcome ; in one hour more , I hope to be worthy of this joy . " Bar . Baroness Inexplicable ! Erl . Captain Erlach What will you give me if I put you on the scent ? Enter John L.H. John . John Ah ! Good my lord ! Good my lord ! Bar . Baroness What ails thee ? John . John I have been half a century in your service  --  Bar . Baroness Well ? John . John When I was but a little boy , they put me here to cut up the weeds , long before you was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little and so stupid , that I remember me once , I rooted out all the parsley and left the weeds standing . Bar . Baroness Good old man , that happens daily among the children of six foot high . But why weepest thou ? John . John Because I now stand in danger myself of being rooted out like a weed and thrown over the wall into the street ; and  --  indeed , my lord , although I am no peach tree , yet am I no nettle in your garden . Bar . Baroness Who injures thee ? John . John Truly as yet they have spared me ; but when one tree after another is cut down the axe must hit me at last . Mounseer Rosat the friseur , Mister Beefsteak the coachman , Signer Macaroni the cook , and Master Manstmann the porter are all very civilly dismissed . Bar . Baroness How ? Erl . Captain Erlach Ah ha ! Bravo ! John . John One after the other is called in , receives a half year 's wages and must make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the room , and when she is dispatched then perhaps comes my turn . But consider , my lord , I am an old tree and can no longer bear transplanting . Besides , I have little sprouts around me  --  what shall become of them ? Bar . Baroness Be without fear . Thou hast carried me in thy arms , and hast helped me to climb for many a bird 's nest . As long as I live shall no one disturb thy nest , old man . John . John A thousand thanks . Indeed , my lord , it is no sparrow 's nest , one need not cover the cherries with nets on account of it . Bar . Baroness But I do not understand  --  Erl . Captain Erlach You soon shall understand it . Here comes your noble wife . Out , out of the way ! There will be a matrimonial scene played here which requires no witnesses . Come , let us see if the musicians have received their passport too . I hope not , for I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance to my own singing . Gives his arm to Madame Moreau . Exeunt L.H.U.E. all but the Baron and John John . John My old woman sits in the bleaching place and sprinkles the linen with her tears . I must go to her ; I must say , " Weep no more , old woman ! As long as we live will a cabbage-head grow for us in this garden . " Exit R.H. The Baron remains in deep thought and seems not to notice that he is left alone . Enter Baroness L.H. in a simple domestic dress Bar : ss . Baroness Approaches him without noise and lays her hand on his shoulder So deep in thought , dear husband ? Bar . Baroness Yes , but I thought on thee . Bar : ss . Baroness Indeed ! And looked so gloomy . Bar . Baroness Your appearance drives away every wrinkle , but those of old age . Bar : ss . Baroness Domestic content can smoothe even the wrinkles of age . Bar . Baroness Then must I look like a youth . Bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You deceive me . Seriously Bar . Baroness How ?  --  Do you doubt my love ? Bar : ss . Baroness No . But more appertains to a happy marriage than love . Bar . Baroness More than love ? Bar : ss . Baroness Love decks the spring of life , and marriage the summer ; but harvest time must also come to provide for a happy winter . O my lord , he who through present joy forgets to sow the seeds of confidence , how shall he dare in harvest time hope to gather domestic happiness ? Bar . Baroness Smiling What means this poetry ? Bar : ss . Baroness Poetry ?  --  Yes , call it so . Poetry is the handmaid of Truth and must decorate her mistress . Bar . Baroness The naked truth would I hear from your mouth . Bar : ss . Baroness Very gallant . While you are disposed to say handsome things to me , permit me to ask  --  how do you like me thus ? Bar . Baroness The simplicity and neatness of your dress makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than usual ? Bar . Baroness Far more handsome in my eyes . Bar : ss . Baroness Why then do you every moment load me with costly clothing ? Why do you force me to enter into every foolish fashion ? Bar . Baroness You go into company  --  Bar : ss . Baroness But must I go into company ? Bar . Baroness For your own satisfaction  --  Bar : ss . Baroness And who tells you , my lord , that I anywhere find more satisfaction than with you ? I know that this simple dress becomes me better than the glitter of courts  --  I have done it only to please you , my lord . Discreet , unassuming  --  Roguishly in the folds of this simple dress , the dust of jealousy can not lodge . Bar . Baroness Jealousy ?  --  I hope you do not hold me capable of jealousy ? Bar : ss . Baroness Why not , if you love me  --  ? Bar . Baroness But my confidence  --  Bar : ss . Baroness Ah , there , there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in me , and in secret torment yourself with the most frightful chimeras . Was I not right in saying that love alone suffices not to the happiness of marriage ? Bar . Baroness Embarrassed I  --  you do me injustice  --  Bar : ss . Baroness No , no , my lord ! I know all and spare you a confession . A painful place must be healed if possible without touching it . Let me however add , you yourself have thrust me forth into the gay world ; you yourself have set open your doors to fools and coxcombs . You were afraid that your young wife would be weary of your house and your conversation . That was false modesty . And when I conformed to your wishes , then did strange dreams torment you in secret and you were ashamed of them . That was false shame . Man and wife should not even conceal from each other their dreams . A sign would have been enough for me . I should perhaps have laughed a little at you ; but how willingly should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how many marriage ties have been sundered because the bands of confidence were not twined around both hearts ! How many discordant flames are past extinguishing , because husband or wife kept the first spark secret ! Bar . Baroness Pressing her in his arms Noble , excellent wife !  --  forgive me ! Bar : ss . Baroness I do forgive thee  --  but only on one condition  --  that you will make it your pleasure , from this time , to take no step without me . When you write , I must sit with my knitting work near you ; and when you have finished  --  we need not be sundered . Bar . Baroness Thou rewardest instead of punishing me ! Bar : ss . Baroness Oh , but I have thought of a punishment for you . You wish to be in town ; now I had rather be in the country . In three years , we have only been once on our estate  --  that is a crying sin ! And for your punishment , you shall pass the whole summer with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ! Bar : ss . Baroness I can not help you . And what is more , when there , you must content yourself with common fare , for I have dismissed our privileged poison-mixer , the cook . Bar . Baroness I hear that you have undertaken a great alteration in the house . Bar : ss . Baroness A formal revolution of state . Bar . Baroness Your convenience will lose thereby . Bar : ss . Baroness And my contentment thereby win . Husband ! husband ! must I also learn from a stranger , that the luxury which you daily recommended to me , was bought at the cost of your repose ? That I robbed your children to pay for the means of chasing away a chimerical ennui ? Bar . Baroness Has Erlach then  --  Bar : ss . Baroness Praised be Heaven that sent him to my salvation ! Without him I should have continued to stagger on with the unsteady pace of intoxication , and have opened my eyes to the precipice too late . Unkind husband ! And all owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteeming the worth of an honest man , unless , like the subjects of an eastern despot they always pay their court with full hands . Learn to know us better . A wife is prouder of a good husband , than of the most sparkling brilliants that ever blazed in her ears ; she would rather , unnoticed , carry on foot the esteem of her husband , than without it glitter in a phaeton to catch the admiration of the crowd . Bar . Baroness T hrows himself at her feet Caroline ! Bar : ss . Baroness Smiling Dear my lord , for the first time I must remind you that  --  you are forty . Kneeling does not become you . Bar . Baroness I have not known your worth I Forgive me ! Bar : ss . Baroness Raises and embraces him It is past . Now for a country life , and in a few years my prodigality will be forgot . Oh , how many a household goes to the ground , because the husband is ashamed to discover to his wife the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fully convinced me of this melancholy truth , that if I now stood before a numerous assembly , I would stretch out my arms to them and full of the spirit of philanthropy cry out to every father of a family , " Confide in thy wife ! Thou now , perhaps , standest on the brink of a precipice ; confidence in her may save thee ! Banish false shame , that monstrous offspring of bragging and vanity ! Confide in thy wife , thy friend , and thou wilt find consolation for the past , counsel and aid for the future ! " Bar . Baroness Wife ! What a spirit of wisdom speaks from thy lips ! Bar : ss . Baroness I were indeed an ordinary wife , if love and duty could not inspire me . Bar . Baroness I could be ashamed that a woman of five and twenty should teach me this lesson  --  but that would again be false shame , a vice which I banish for ever from my heart ! From this day , like unto God , shalt thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fain shun the light will I whisper in thy ear . If a weakness would hide itself , the remembrance of this hour shall drag it forth  --  that thou mayest kindly smile and pardon it . Bar : ss . Baroness I thank thee , Heaven ! It has succeeded ! My husband is again mine ! Bar . Baroness Thine for ever ! But , dear Caroline , do not think that my circumstances are so deranged , that there is a necessity for you to bury your youth in the country . I am still rich . Bar : ss . Baroness Bury ? To enjoy oneself and nature , men call burying . Well , be it so , and the nightingales shall sing my funeral dirge . Bar . Baroness You are not used to solitude . Bar : ss . Baroness For the sake of her husband , a wife can adopt a new mode of living with the same ease that she adopts a new fashion . A few years ago I thought no hat became me but a large one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find this fashion abominable , and can only be pleased with a hat that is small . So will it be with this . Four weeks in the country and the town life will appear like a great hat and I shall wonder how I could ever endure it . Bar . Baroness Well then if you are in earnest  --  ? Bar : ss . Baroness Here is my hand on it . Bar . Baroness I grasp it with extacy ! Bar : ss . Baroness Economy be our joy . Bar . Baroness And repose in the bosom of my  --  family . Bar : ss .

Baroness Through confidence regained  --  Bar . Baroness Clasping her in his arms Never to be lost again ! Bar : ss . Baroness Never ! Enter Erlach L.H. Erl .

Captain Erlach I could hardly keep my cane from dancing about his ears . Bar . Baroness Of whom do you speak ? Erl . Captain Erlach Of the dearly beloved Vicomte de Maillac , my fine brother-in-law . Bar . BaronessAstonished Thy brother-in-law ! Erl . Captain Erlach Yes , the scoundrel has the honor of being Emmy 's brother , and is ashamed of his poor mother . Even now skipped he into the garden . As soon as Madame Moreau perceived him , she exclaimed , " My son ! " with a voice that would have melted a flint . The idle rascal started and seemed frightened ; but his beloved shamelessness did not leave him in the lurch . " The lady is mistaken , " snuffled he through the nose . We were all astonished , and every one explained the story to him in his own fashion . Emmy called him brother  --  and I , rascal ! His mother , meanwhile , stood with trembling and uplifted hands , and seemed only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ss . Baroness Unfortunate mother ! Erl . Captain Erlach " Indeed it was always my wish , " lisped out the damned monkey , " to be allied to the family of Flachsland , but if this is the only mode which they leave to my choice  --  " And then shrugged his shoulders , twisted himself like an eel in a mud-pond , and darted out of the gate . " Mister , " called I after him , " of all the kinds of false shame that is the most shameful which makes a man ashamed of his own poor parents , because he has not courage to defy the miserable railleries of fools . " Bar . Baroness My poor sister ! Where is she ? Erl . Captain Erlach The maidens are striving to dry her tears . She comes hither . Behold how suddenly the grief of a mother bleaches a woman 's cheeks . Enter Madame Moreau , Wieland , Adelaide and Emmy L.H. Bar . BaronessMeeting Madame Moreau affectionately Good sister ! M:M .
