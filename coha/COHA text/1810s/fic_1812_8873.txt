Main text SCENE I The Mother sits knitting . Enter Son Ichabod . Son . Son Ichabod Mother , I wish you would get my shirts done by the time vacation ends ; for I must go to College then , shirts or no shirts . Moth . Mother Why , child , if I thought you larnt any thing , there would be some sense in working for you . Son . Son Ichabod Why , mother , there is not one at the College that learns faster than I do . Moth . Mother Well , child , I am desput glad to hear it ; but I had much rather hear your tutorer say so : For your father says that you were always consaited . Son . Son Ichabod Mother , it is not tutorer , it is tutor . Learned people would laugh to hear you say it tutorer . Moth . Mother I think you do n't larn much manners , Ichabod , or you would not contradict your mother , as you do . Son . Son Ichabod Why , mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you must not think you know as much as I do . Moth . Mother You saucy fellow ! you know more than your mother ? what do you know worth going to College for ? What think your tutorer would say to that question ? Son . Son Ichabod Tutorer , again ! why mother  --  Moth . Mother Hold your tongue , you sas-box ; and tell me what you have larnt . And if you ha n't more manners I 'll tell your father , and as true as you are a boy , he 'll give it to you . Son . Son Ichabod What do you think I care for father ? Moth . Mother Tell me , I say , what you have larnt . Son . Son Ichabod I have learned a thousand things . Moth . Mother What are they ? Son . Son Ichabod Why , the sun is ten hundred times bigger than this , our majestick globe . Moth . Mother Majus globe ! what is a globe , pray ? Son . Son Ichabod Why this world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have learned . Moth . Mother What 's that ? The sun is a hundred times bigger than this world ? Son . Son Ichabod Yes , mother , a thousand times bigger . Moth . Mother That 's a lie , I know ; for I see the sun every day , and it is no bigger than a cart-wheel . Son . Son Ichabod That is owing to the fallaciousness of vission . Moth . Mother Fallaciousness of provision , you great fool , you ! Son . Son Ichabod Vision , mother , vision ; not provision . Moth . Mother Well , what does your wision mean you seem mighty fond of using your high flown words . If that 's all you larn at College , you had better stay at home for time to come .  --  But , pray what does your wision mean ? Son . Son Ichabod Fallaciousness of vision means when we see an object at a great distance , we can not tell whether it be great or small by viewing it . Moth . Mother It means I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own eyes ? Do n't I see the sun every day ? and tell you it is n't bigger than a cart-wheel . But what else do you know . Son . Son Ichabod What else ! Why men live in the moon  --  the sun stands still , and the earth turns round ; and a thousand other things which you know nothing about . Moth . Mother No , not nobody else , I believe !  --  Men live in the moon , ha ? And do you think I 'm fool enough to believe the world turns round ? If it did , when it got bottom upwards , we should all fall off . Enter Husband . You husband , you never seed such a fool as our Ichabod is , sence he has got to be a sackimore . He has been telling me a heap of lies , He says men live in the moon . If they did , they would , sartainly fall off and beat our brainses out . Fath . Father How do you know that , Ichabod , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling bigger lies yet : he says the sun stands still , and the world turns round  --  turning to Ichabod  --  Go , Ichabod , and see if the pot biles .  --  Exit Ich.  --  Now , husband , if that 's all he larns , I beg you 'd keep him at home , for time to come . Fath . Father He always was a consaited rascal . I wonder what has filled his head with maggots now  --  that the world turns round , and what not ! If he knows so much more than any body else , it is quite time to see what can be done with him . Ichabod , come here . Moth . Mother Call again , husband , he do n't hear yon . Fath . Father Ichabod , make haste here , I say . Son . Son Ichabod I am coming , father . Moth . Mother Does the pot bile , Ichabod ? Son . Son Ichabod No ma'am , not an atom . Moth . Mother Then the pudding wo n't be good for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nonsense you have been telling your mother about ? Have you nothing better to larn at College than this ? Son . Son Ichabod What is better to learn than philosophy ? Fath . Father Flassofy ! what is flassofy ? Son . Son Ichabod Philosophy teaches us the periodical revolutions of the planets  --  Fath . Father No more of your nonsense about lellovutions ; I 'll hear no more of it . Moth . Mother Returning Ichabod , what did you say the pot did n't bile for , ha ? It biles hard . Son . Son Ichabod The pot do n't boil , mother ; it is the water that boils . Moth . Mother The pot do n't bile ha ! I suppose you think you are desput cunning , do n't you ? Fath . Father Where did you get your knowledge about the sun and moon you have been telling of , ha ? Son . Son Ichabod I learned it at College . Fath . Father Yes , you had better been asleep .  --  My money is all lost . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half dollars . How much does that make ? Counts on his fingers . No  --  Yes , eighteen dollars ! And there was two new books which cost two dollars and three quarters , besides a pistareen which you spent for punch on the road , like an extravagant villain . But there was a lucky hit ; I kept you at home half a week , and that saved four and sixpence . Son . Son Ichabod Yes , and if you keep me at home again they will fine me . Fath . Father You sha n't go again , you shall go to work . Son . Son Ichabod I 'll go to sea then , for I will not work ; then upon your Red Sorril Farm . Fath . Father Red Sorril Farm ! What do you mean ? Son . Son Ichabod Why , I mean , Father , that your Farm wo n't bear any thing but sorril and white beans , and why should you wish me to spend the best part of my days in fruitless labour .  --  Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be in a situation to get a genteel living . Fath . Father How the dogs do you expect to get a living by learning such nonsense . Son . Son Ichabod Why , in the same way , that other men of liberal education do . There are three learned professions , Law , Physick and Divinity ; and , should my abilities prove suitable for neither of these , I might perhaps commence a teacher , or get a birth in a Compting Room  --  you know Col. Ringleys two sons  --  one kept a school in South Carolina a few years , and brought home 5000 dollars , and that is enough to buy 500 just such farms as yours . Fath . Father Poh  --  poh Ichabod . Moth . Mother Why you natural fool , Ichabod , you think our farm a n't good for nothing do n't ye ? Son . Son Ichabod Yes , Mother , it is a great deal worse then nothing . Moth . Mother Why you do deprived of all your senses . Husband , if you let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain him . I 'll go and get his open this moment . Exit Moth . Fath . Father Why Ichabod , you talk like a lunatick ; how should I have maintained you and me , if my farm is worse than no farm . Son . Son Ichabod Why you worked hard for your father till you was twenty one , for sixty acres pole plain , did'nt ye . Fath . Father Yes , and what then . Son . Son Ichabod And you have worked on it ever since like an old spaniel and lived something like rich mens pigs , and you are not worth no more now than you was then , that 's doing well father . Fath . Father Well what could I have done better ? Son . Son Ichabod Quit your father and his old pig weed farm , if he would let you , when you was free , or sooner , as I would , and be took yourself to your books , got an education , entered a Compting-Room , and then a voyage or two would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Look at George Tingley . William Baffel , and Leonard Kay , what have they done . Fath . Father Yes , yes , but my father was poor and their fathers were rich . Son . Son Ichabod Well then look at Sawney Freeman , and James Seeds , whose fathers are not worth any more than yours ; and there is Afel Ring who had neither father nor mother nor money , and where do you find a Doctor , a Lawyer , or a Merchant , that is their superiour . Fath . Father Yes , yes , but they are men of great natural abilities . You do n't suppose that I could have made a Doctor , a Lawyer or a Merchant  --  you must not be proud , truth is truth  --  your poor old Father was not made for a Philosopher , Ichabod , no , no  --  my head and brains are not like theirs . I be a Doctor  --  a Lawyer , no , no . Son . Son Ichabod Well , that is no proof that your son can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would make a Doctor , Ichabod . Son . Son Ichabod Yes , or a Lawyer , or a Governor for ought I know . Fath . Father Ah , you are a consaited boy  --  make a Governor , yes , yes  --  you have got fine maggots enough in your head , yes , yes . Enter Mother , with a suit of old clothes . Here you crazy headed boy , put on your Clothes and go to work . Son . Son Ichabod Takes them and throws them down . Not I , Mother . Moth . Mother Yes you shall , yes you shall . Son . Son Ichabod No I sha n't Mother  --  I 'll never work here upon your red sorril farm as long as I have legs that will carry me 10 miles a day ; for away mother . Exit son . Moth . Mother Law , husband , he 's going to run away , as true as you live . Fath . Father Yes , yes , he 's going to sea  --  oh lord he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ichabod and Henry . Hen . Henry Well , when do you return to the old Castle . Son . Son Ichabod Never . My father and mother have forbid my returning , and insist on my going to work ; but that I am determined not to do ; but what to do , I know not , I confess , Hen . Henry What has occasioned this sudden change ? Son . Son Ichabod Why , to tell you the truth , their great ignorance leads them to believe that a little learning will spoil me and make me crazy . Hen . Henry Ha , ha , that is curious indeed . I say , Ichabod , I 'll help you out of this difficulty  --  you pretend you are quite crazy already , and I 'll happen in and tell them the only remedy will be to let you return to your studies . Son . Son Ichabod It is done , Henry , I 'll give them a try . I 'll go  --  you come in directly  --  act your part well now . Hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as crazy as Bedlum . Son . Son Ichabod Yes , yes , come on . Exit both . Enter son . Son . Son Ichabod Now for an inhabitnt of Bedlum.  --  Let me see , what shall I say , how shall I act and what shall I do . Oh , I 'll jabber a little latin , that will be sufficient , yes , yes , now . Enter Father and Mother . Son , Hoc nomine deornmque omnium O dignisime pater et O dignisime mater . Moth . Mother Lord , Lord , husband , he 's raving destracted . Fath . Father Stop your nonsence directly and put on these clothes . Son . Son Ichabod Takes the clothes and puts them on his head.  --  Tole vocem , tole vocem , tole vocem , pater et mater leather apron in caput . Moth . Mother Lord , Lord , what shall we do ( stamps at him ) be still Ichabod . Fath . Father I 'll go and get a horse whip , I 'll whip the devil out of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrem and matrem ( flies at them with his leather apron and gives both of them a drubbing ) Flagelo flagelare flagalavi flagelatum , &c.; Enter Henry . Hen . Henry What 's the matter , Mr. Dunkirk , what 's the matter . Fath . &; Moth . Father , Mother Matter , my son is distracted  --  Oh dear , poor Ichabod is ruined , is ruined , is ruined  --  Oh dear , oh dear , that awful College , that awful College has ruined him forever . Hen . Henry College , College does not make men behave so , madam . Fath . Father Yes it does , it has ruined him . Moth . Mother Poor child , wo n't you put on these clothes and go to work like a good boy . Son . Son Ichabod Oh detestisime omnium rerum terisque celisque . Fath . &; Moth . Father , Mother Oh dear , what shall we do . Hen . Henry But what does he do with the apron , and these old clothes . Fath . Father We were determined not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to get his clothes so that he might go to work ; and when we were come back , he was as crazy as a Loon . Hen . Henry Ha , sir , that is it  --  it was the sight of those detested clothes that has deprived him of his reason , take them away and let him return to College , and I 'll assure you he will come to his reason . Moth . Mother Ah , dear sir , I would give all the world , I would consent to let him go to College forever , if he could only have his sences again . Hen . Henry Take away these dirty duds . There , a n't you got your reason , Ichabod . Son . Son Ichabod Oh , yes , how fare you Henry . Moth . Mother Oh , dear son , how glad I am , you may go to College forever and forever more amen . Fath . Father Yes , go to College , yes , and be Governour of Bedlum an you will , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
