Main text Scene Edmund , Walter , and Finhah . Scene  --  A pleasant Forest about three miles from a village .  --  Time  --  As Autumn morning . "  --  diem cantu prdixerat ales : " Moretum . WALTER . Walter This is an early hour , but we shall find , While sluggards doze , he rises with the sun . EDMUND . Edmund The good old man , so aged , yet so strong . And yet , I wonder , Walter , he should live So like a hermit , in this wood , alone . I 've heard strange stories told that brought him here Some say  --  he hath been cross 'd in early love , That he his rival slew , and felt remorse . Others  --  that midnight studies hurt his brain . Some  --  that mistaking zeal urged secret penance . Our parson thinks him a philosopher , Who came to give his thoughts a wider range . His maiden sister shrugs , and , looking wise , Says  --  wizards take the shape of holy men . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walter There , Edmund , look  --  do not you see him now , ' Neath the large rock that juts above his cell ? He watcheth how the glorious sun doth rise . How calm he looks , and leans upon his staff . How white his bowing shoulders with his locks , And gray his reverend beard  --  yet fresh his cheeks . Divine old man ! death shows respect to thee , And in thy presence I should fear no harm . EDMUND . Edmund See  --  now he beckons with his palsied hand , And forward moves  --  fast as his years permit . We joyous greet thee , venerated Sire . FINHAH . Finhah Draw near , my sons .  --  Although I live retired . I love to have young friends come visit me , And , in my cell , partake what Nature gives . EDMUND . Edmund Heaven bless thee , Father , healthful in thy years Thy speech and mien are not like rustic swains . Pray tell us all thy life 's long history . WALTER . Walter And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lone forest , where men rarely come ? FINHAH . Finhah View me about , my sons , and mark my change . How few can tell the pains of eighty years . Yet half those years were spent among these trees . See those two yews , that shadow o'er my cell ? They grew since I came here  --  I set the slips  --  Two gloomy trees , and so I love them more , For I am sorrowing , and can mourn with them . In youth  --  and ye 'll not count an old man vain ?  --  I trimm 'd the wakeful lamp , and fledg 'd for song . I sung of Man .  --  How this delves mines of lore , While that , in wars , wears laurels stain 'd in blood . How one , to either zone , whitens the sea , And , on the reeling shrouds , sings to the storm ; Another , risks , on fluttering wings , to rest High , on the windy , slippery dome of Fame . And how the wheel revolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man may sumptuous live . How some though slaving , starve  --  some idle , feast . How men oft chide their Fates  --  themselves in blame . I sung the sister Arts , all hand in hand . I Virtue praised , and pointed where she led . My Muse was humble  --  but was all to me . At last , my friends all died  --  all died save one  --  And he  --  I thought him friend  --  but spare the dead ' Betray 'd my charge , and all my fortunes wreck 'd . Oh ! ' t was too much !  --  that he , to whom I gave The keys of all my heart  --  Oh ! it stung deeply .  --  Unfriended by the world , I fled from men . Long , poor , disguised , in comfortless despair I wander 'd , till at last I rested here . With many a sun , have I , in quest of food , Travers 'd the thickset woods , and oozy bogs , And up the hillock 's brow , and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and roots , and fruits , And , for the winter , gather 'd autumn stores . I trap , and hook , the hare , and bream , and thrush . And line my cell with moss , and yellow leaves . At morn , I kneel  --  at eve , I hymn my praise . Love virtue , and you can not die too young . Wisdom old Finhah sought too late  --  but found : WALTER . Walter I love thee , Father , and am loath to leave thee . EDMUND . Edmund Nor will we e'er forget thy various years , Thy studious youth , and patriarchal age . FINHAH . Finhah Farewell , dear virtuous youths , a long farewell ! For Finhah 's very old , and something tells , That when ye come again , ye may not find me here .
