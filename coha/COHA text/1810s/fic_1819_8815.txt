First represented at the Theatre Royal , Drury-Lane , On Thursday evening , December 3 , 1818 , and at the New-York Theatre , Monday evening March 15 , 1819. from the London edition of 1818 . DRAMATIS PERSON . Table : 3Kb Those passages marked with inverted commas , thus , " " are omitted in the representation . PREFACE . This tragedy is submitted to the public with the most grateful sense of the kindness with which it has been honoured . It was originally intended to be published as sent to the theatre ; but the omissions and changes consequent on its being performed , were numerous . The reader will now find it in every respect a copy from the prompt-book . The imperfect lines which sometimes occur in the verse have arisen from the determination to make the conformity complete . Seven plays upon the subject of Brutus are before the public . Only two have been thought capable of representation , and those two did not long retain possession of the stage . In the present play I have had no hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seemed likely to strengthen the plan which I had prescribed . This has been so done as to allow of no injury to personal feelings or private property . Such obligations to be culpable must be secret ; but it may be observed that no assistance of other writers can be available without an effort almost , if not altogether , as laborious as original composition . I am reluctant to select peculiar objects of praise , when I found zeal and politeness so universal .  --  But I must be permitted to add my gratitude to the public admiration of Mr. Kean 's most masterly and splendid performance of the principal character .  --  Mrs. Glover , too , has claims on me which must not be forgotten .  --  The play was introduced by her to the theatre , and its share of public favour must be largely attributed to the critical taste of this very amiable and intelligent woman . To the Sub-Committee and the Manager , I also beg to return my grateful thanks . 4 , Southampton-street , Covent Garden , December 9 , 1818 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. H. Kemble . By unknown Time rushes o'er us ; thick as evening clouds Ages roll back :  --  what calls them from their shrouds ?

If later , luckless arts that stage profane , The actor pleads  --  not guilty of the stain : He , but the shadow flung on fashion 's tide  --  Yours , the high will that all its waves must guide : Your voice alone , the great reform secures , His , but the passing hour  --  the age is yours . Our pledge is kept Here , yet , no chargers wheel , No foreign slaves on ropes or scaffolds reel , No gallic amazons , half naked , climb From pit to gallery  --  the low sublime !

The younger , Lucius , Then on his travels , ' scap 'd the tyrant 's sword But lost his reason at their fearful fall . Luc .

Now twenty years are past , Or more ,  --  since he sent for me from my farm .

Hor ( To VALERIUS . ) Tell me , will he answer If we do question him ? Val . Valerius I think he will : Yet sometimes when the moody fit doth take him He will not speak for days ; yea , rather starve Than utter nature 's cravings : then anon He 'll prattle shrewdly , with such witty folly As almost betters reason .

Titus Tho ' the goddess , In her blind bounty should unthrone the world , To build me one vast empire , my ambition , If by thy love unblest , would slight the gift : Therefore of fortune I have nought to ask  --  She hath no interest in Tarquinia 's heart , Nature , not fortune , must befriend me there .

Ti . Titus Oh ! neither name , nor nature , nor the voice Of my lost father , could he wake to reason , Not all the wrongs that tyranny could pile On my afflicted head  --  not all the praise That patriot gratitude could shower upon me , Can shake the faithful purpose of my soul To sever it from love and my Tarquinia .
