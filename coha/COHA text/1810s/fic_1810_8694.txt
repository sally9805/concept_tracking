"  --  This even-handed Justice Commends the ingredients of our poison 'd Chalice To our own lips . " Shakespeare 's Macbeth . DEDICATION , TO DAVID RAMSAY , M. D. OF CHARLESTON , SOUTH-CAROLINA . DEAR SIR , AGREEABLY to your kind permission , I dedicate to you this first attempt at the Drama . Were the names of Patriot and Native Historian insufficient for me to desire that honor , the name of Friend would more than claim it . You did advise me , Sir , once more to present it to the managers , as its success ( if any ) would greatly be enhanced upon the stage , and its merits and demerits , more pointedly exhibited . But as I was already weary of their trifling arrogance , I must candidly attribute to CHANCE the favour of its performance : since no exertions of mine tended to that effect . You , Sir , who never visit the theatre , have drawn your opinion of this frail production from the perusal , and not from the performance .  --  I thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my native city , who , after three short years ( mirabile dictu ! ) had the generosity to make my subscription list equal to the expence of publication .  --  Thus , sir , both our wishes are crowned ; mine , that this work should see the light : and yours , that Literature in this City should receive so wonderful an encouragement ! Believe me , Sir , your sincere admirer , and humble Servant : ISAAC HARBY . PREFACE . "  --  Tamen monstrosa res. " etc . Ex Luciani dial . Proteus &; Menelaus . The origin of this , my first essay in the Drama is the " Secreto Maligno " of some unknown Italian novelist . The ground work of which furnished the imagination of Mr. Ireland ( though he does not own it ) with the materials for his " Abbess , " and by the aid and circumstance of midnight assassinations , dreary vaults , mysterious warnings , horrors , and the inquisition , he has deck 'd out his terrible story in the true spirit of Germanic romance . The principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken from that noval , but no farther .  --  for , in pursuing Nature , I found my road to be widely different from the path followed by Mr. Ireland . And , if the gentle reader , or rigid critic , has leisure enough and folly enough , he may amuse himself in tracing the shadow of resemblance between us ! Indeed , the novel has been of service to me as a beacon , since it presented to my view , and warned me to shun some great monstrosities , and , by reasoning diametrically opposite to it , and making the motives and actions of my characters , to contrast it in every point , I generally gained in an inverse ratio , a nearer approach to truth . So much in what I am indebted to others for . As for what I myself have thought and written , let the play speak for itself  --  had I believed it needed any other apology than youth , I should never have preferred it before the eyes of the public . If I thought it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall hereafter attempt to earn an honest reputation by the drama , I would let them know somewhat of the history and adventures of these " Causes and Effects . " The play is somewhat altered from what it was three years ago , when I presented it to the Manager of our Charleston Theatre ; after I had waited a month , I called upon him , and was informed he had forgot to read it , but would make it this business to do so the ensuing week . At the end of which , he met me in the street , said he had read the play , but would defer giving me his opinion of it till to-morrow . Having a shrewd conception , that , to-morrow , and to-morrow , and to-morrow , as Shakespeare says , would creep in this petty space from day to day ; I requested that prince of comedians , the excellent Hatton ( since dead ) to use his interest for me ; and , as he expressed a high opinion of my drama , its stage effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manager ( after come curious demurrers ) deigned to accept it . The ice was now broken , and in his leisure moments , he would entertain me with his opinion of my attempts . I say entertain me ; for ( although Mr. Placide is an humorous , sensible man , and is very well conversant with the effect and propriety of stage business ; yet as he is unfortunately not learned in English , or in English authors ) the manner of his critiques , no less than the matter , ( like some innocent experiments in chemistry ) were amusing rather than instructive . He mentioned first its beauties ; the plot , on account of its bustle , pleased him much , the characters more ; the speeches were passionate , and he was glad to find I had left none of my persons in the lurch , but had bestowed them , in some shape or other , &c.; &c.; He then enumerated the faults and commented on them in a very singular manner ; he had observed , in reading the manuscript , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own words ? No ; for the inaccuracy of a rough manuscript may have led to misconstructions which it would be ungentlemanlike in me to mention . Spring however had began to breathe her warm breath upon our faces ; Hercules had performed his twelve labours ; and I had already consented that my flights of Poetry should be reduced to the level of propriety , and the coutume de theatre . Mr. Placide who is always sociably disposed ; was kind enough to consult me with regard to such speeches as were to be cut out , and such dialogues as were to be shortened . Well knowing , I presume , that the mahereuse garcon of an author had frequently bit his nails in polishing a line , which the laws of the play ( or rather of the players ) would condemn to the fate of La Perouse.  --  Thus smooth the current was running  --  the characters were cast &c.; when , all of a sudden the benefits began , and so did the summer  --  which made the actors scamper as fast as they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down and have awaited the next season , as I had the word of the manager that it should then , with pleasure , be brought forward . But a gentleman of my acquaintance , who was about going to Phladelphia , and who almost convinced me , that his name alone among the actors , could raise a spirit  --  conjured me to trust the manuscript with him , and assured me , if I would confide in what he said , and in what he could do , he would undertake in the course of the next season , to procure me an excellent benefit , and a round sum for the copy right . I consented , and in the course of the ensuing season , learnt if his letters are to be depended on , that Mr. Warren after refusing , accepting , altering and frittering away the play , at last cast the characters , and had the parts studied . But here , the unfortunate plot intruded on the nicety of his nerves , and he pronounced it damnable , as not tallying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! and did he please himself with the idea that the play was presented to him for his decision ? Let me undeceive you , sir . The many portals that open to the Temple of Fame , are each guarded by a keeper , whom indiscriminate Fortune too often chooses from among the ignorant , or the injudicious ; so that the claimants to her favors , whatever be their worth , are obliged to speak fairly , and sometimes falsely on the vestibule , are they can act footing in the sanctuary . Now , what particular thing acted against me in this case , I can not take upon me to pronounce . How soic ' qui mal pense . But nevertheless , this was the issue ; any expectations ( which were very faint ) or what is less , the gentleman 's influence ( which could with justice extend only to the prompter and call boy ) or what is least . Mr. Warren 's word ( which was as variable as his opinion ) " all melted into air  --  into thin air . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my manuscript , and feeling no inclination to offer it again to the Managers I had the very gracious alternative of making a bonfire , or of making a publication . I decided for the latter  --  how wisely , time will show . But in the very heat and progress of typography  --  an actress , whose problematical conduct would have confounded Euclid , requested of me the manuscript , to be performed for her benefit .  --  After some demurs , I consented .  --  Well , the parts were written , cast and studied ; and the unlucky wight of an author was called upon to exhibit what the players term " a reading , " before their august highnesses . He entered the Theatre  --  to reverse the expression of friend Knickerbocker , during the " uncertainty of twilight " which magnified the shadows before his sight , and gave a double gravity and size to the looks and figure of the " acting manager , " who threw into his countenance all the importance of which it was capable . All were seated  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his impudence together , began to read the part of Hubert , for which he was unfortunately and necessarily cast . Such reading ! But it passes description .  --  Then Mr. Green began his Marcello , interlining sneers and jeers , to the infinite amusement of his audience ; then Mr. Sully read , ever and anon , uttering such sheer wit , as the taste of the gallery has rendered him celebrated for . Then Mr. Green replies . Then Mr. Sully rejoinders . Till , at last , the " acting manager " cried out , out , " Damn it , Sully , you 'll keep us here ' till twelve o'clock ; let Mr. Harby read his own play . "  --  Accordingly , the patient Harby ( who all this while , kept penciling in his mind these capricios of man , when " drest in a little brief authority " ) began to read . But Mr. Sully preferred reading himself ; and when the author , good-naturedly , informed him that a word , containing two syllables , logically contained more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the utmost pomp &; magnificence of manner , said , " Sir , I am manager here ; and if you are determined to teach an actor in my presence , I am determined not to submit ! " Upon uttering which , he went off . The confusion and dismay this excited might suit Hogarth to describe , or some future comedy ( should I be fool hardy enough to write one ) but here I shall not attempt it . For , altho ' I kept pursing up my lips with all the nerve I was master of , I could hardly refrain from bursting into a fit of laughter . However , I must compliment my philosophy ; for taking up my hat and manuscript , very calmly , I bid the gentlemen and ladies buenos noches , and came home to my supper . Thou short liv 'd inspiration of lovely genius ! Dear Tobin ! can I , who handle so rude a pencil ,  --  can I complain , when that thy flashes of wit , thy vivid portraiture of passion , thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf neglected , Footnote : 1Kb  --  ' till thy fine intellect had ta'en its flight , and left its earthly tenement ! But an immortal fame has risen , like a Phoenix from thy ashes , and thy name hereafter shall be coupled with thy great original ! " Thus can the Demi-god , Authority , make and unmake ; on whom it will , it will , on whom it will not , so . " At the first representation of this Play , the two principal characters were read ! and were I to mark with inverted commas what was omitted , I fancy the reader would be puzzled to account for the shifting of scenes ; and upon the exits and entrances of persons , would wonder " how the devil they came there ! " At the second representation I was much gratified with the performers , to whom and to the manager I return my sincere thanks ; &; to Mr. Rutherford in particular , for the beauty and spirit with which he performed Alphonso ; they all acted greatly to my satisfaction , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play for her benefit ) who refused to perform Clara for me ,  --  and for no other cause that I could perceive except her having imbibed into her system , a superabundance of vitriolic acid  --  which , heaven knows , was not my fault . The work is now published as it was originally written . Were I , at the age of twenty-two , to correct the effusions of eighteen , I should be obliged entirely to " retrace my stylum , " as Horace calls it . With little or no correction , therefore , I submit them to the publick . I can not call them candid and discerning  --  in too many instances they prove otherwise . But I do believe that the generality of my countrymen have sense enough to decide upon the merits and demerits of this play : and that their patrotism will feel somewhat concerned when native productions , even so humble a one as mine , are kept and elbowed from their proper sphere of exhibition . Let them look to it . The cold which almost withered a rose-bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might shelter , and whose branches ornament the soil it grew on . To critics I have only to say that I invite their rigour and their impartiality . I prefer one judicious censure to a thousand indiscriminate praises . I request them not to bind me down by the rules of Aristotle , or Scaliger ; of Bossou or Voltaire , or of any pitiful Frenchified critic whatsoever , who would not or could not understand SHAKESPEARE ; and , above all things , not to decide upon me by comparison with the generality of American productions of this kind . Were I to anticipate what shall be said of this work , now published , from the applause it received when performed , I should be very silly , and ignorant of human nature  --  I should throw away that humble , that very humble conceit I have of myself  --  if nothing should be written agains. this play  --  For it is as direct a corollary , as ever was drawn by Archimedes , that the lustre of any excellence must , by contrast , render any defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my judges will pronounce the plot romantic and confused , and the dialogue lame and tedious .  --  But I also draw another conclusion , that when truth and nature decide upon me , I shall not despair of gleaning a few fresh laurel leaves . As I transfer to the reader 's the emotious of my own breast , let him pronounce my sentence . I shall conclude this preface , ( which to every reasonable man , I presume will serve both for prologue and apilogue. ) with one observation ; ' t is this : Dramatists , too often think their task completed , if they have justly described the local manners of man . I have preferred to picture him in his general nature . On that basis has rested the immortality of Shakespeare ; and , I am proud to own , I write for fame . ISAAC HARBY .
