txt AlIT . VI . Reports of cases , argued and adjudged in the Snpreine Court of the United States . By Henry Wheaton , Counsellor at law . Vol. i. - Matt . Carey , Phil . 1816 . THE Court , whose decisions are reported in the volume before us , derives from the constitution an extensive and important jurisdiction . Every subject of judicial cognizance , which can in any manner affect our external relations , or our domestick peace , is submitted to its judgment , an ( l that judgment is fimial . Not only does it contribute , with all the other powers in the government , to the general purposes of the confederacy ; it is , in a more peculiar sense , the guardian of constitutional sanity ; the power which pre // serves all others in their due and wholesome exercise ; which checks their excesses , corrects their disorders and mistakes ; and , like conscience in the moral system , vindicates the authority of the laws , when they are in danger of violation or neglect . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal . Its restrictions , however clear and positive , would be ineffectual to control the ambitious , and even the errours of men in power would be drawn into precedent , and would gradually undermine the political structure . In maintaining the permanency of our civil institutions , therefore , the agency of the Judiciary is of the highest necessity and moment . The importance of uniform decisions in matters of common interest , and the real or supposed danger of partiality in the courts of the States , are well known to have been among the principal objects , for which the jurisdiction of the tederal courts was given . Iii the words of Chief Justice Marshall , * " the constitution itself either entertains apprehensions on this subject , or views with indulgence the possible fears and apprehensions of suitors . " Whether these apprehensions are well or ill founded , they seem to have been felt , as soon as an attempt was made to unite in a confeder. ated republick . Within a few months after the commenceinent of the revolutionary war , t Congress exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to erect courts for the purpose of determining concerning captures , and to provide that all trials in such cases be had by a jury , " allowing in all cases an appeal to Congress , " or to such person or persons , as they should appoint for the trial of appeals . " - The articles of confederation , ratified on the 9th July , 1778 , provided that Congress should have the sole and exclusive right " of establishing rules for dcciding in all cases , what captures on land or water should be legal , " and of " appointing courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and establishing courts for receiving and determining finally appeals in all cases of captures . " The same article provides , that all disputes between States , concerning boundary , jurisdiction , or any other cause , and all controversies , concerning the private right of soil , claimed under different grants of two or 5 Cra. 87* t 25No* ' . 1775. // more States , should be decided in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present more national form of government was adopted , the enlargement of the legislative powers made a corresponding extension of the judicial authority indispensable . " A good law without execution , " says Bishop Taylor ; is like a promise unperformed . " Such was the fate of the laws , or rather recommendations of the Congress , deriving its powers from the articles of confederation ; and such , without a court of commenstirate jurisdiction , must have been that of the most salutary acts of legislative power , under our existing constitution . Whether the present organization of the federal judiciary be the most convenient and proper , and what danger there may be of an inordinate increase of its authority , we have not time to examine . There are certainly very serious objectiojis to some parts of the system , and the example of English courts established originally for special and definite purposes , but by means of fictions , and the consent of parties , gradually embracing in their jurisdiction almost every kind of controversy , may lead some to apprehend a similar growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far there has been no indication , sufficiently unequivocal to be a just cause of alarm , of a disposition in the federal judiciary , to extend its authority beyond those limits , which are sanctioned by the fair and legitimate construction of the constitution . Whenever such a disposition shall be apparent , a powerful barrier against encroachment will , we trust , be found in the courts of the several States . Among the means , which may best serve to keep both the federal and state , courts within their proper bounds , corcect reports of their respective decisions may certainly be numbered . Conflicts will be less likely to arise , when each knows the limits , which the other assigns to its authority . They will mutually enlighten and assist each other in the construction of that constitution , under which they act , and either may draw back when it finds that incautiously or from the natural love of power , it has stepped upon doubtful and disputed ground . From the peculiar structure of our government , the national and state judiciaries are both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbiter . And hence the importance of preventing controversies , of which the end can not be foreseen . // For this reason , as well as on account of the general interest which belongs to the reports of a court , in which so many novel and important questions are discussed , we heard - with real pleasure of the appointment of Mr. Wheaton to the office of reporter , and of the resolution of Mr. Cranch to publish the cases from the close of his sixth volume to the commencement of Mr. Wheaton 's labours . These last , as well as Mr. Wheaton 's volume , are now before the publick ; but our limits , and the imperfect examination we have been able to give them , will admit of our noticing them but slight ly . The duty of a reporter was formerly much more arduous and responsible , than it now is . He was obliged to eatch the words , as they fell from the lips of the judges , and to transfer them to his page , there to remain as a guide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration of justice . It was not strange , that he should often err , and that many of the limitations and restrictions which accom .. panied the opinion should be omitted in the report . We are told by Master iPlowden , " that there were anciently four reporters of cases in law , who were chosen and appointed for that purpose , and had a yearly stipend from the king for their trouble therein ; which lersons used to confer all to gether at the making and collecting of a report , and their report , being made and settled by so many , and by men of such approved learning , carried great credit with it , as indeed it ought . " This cautious method , however , continued but a short time . Of late years , the practice has been for the judges themselves , upon questions of any importance , to reduce their opinions to writing . Very little is left for the reporter , but to give a clear statement of the facts , and an accurate and faithful account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course be as limited as his exposure to blame . But what the reporter loses in reputation is gained to the piiblick in the increased assurance of the fidelity of the report , the more full exposition of the reasons , on which the decision is founded , and the more exact definition of its extent and boundaries . Mr. Whieaton , however , has not confined himself within the humble limits , to which the mere exercise of his duty as a reporter would have restricted him . With a laudable ambition . he seems resolved to assert a higher claim to reputat*on , than would be consistent with the hare d*liueation of // arguments , which are not his own , and for the ability or defeds of which he of course is not responsihie . He has scattered through his volume notes upon some of the most important points connected with the cases reported , in which he has given a compendious view of the law , as it is to be found in the most approved foreign writers . Most of these relate to maritime law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of prize and revenue . They are in general well executed , and will be valuable aids to the student in directing him to the sources of legal information . Two notes of considerable length are inserted in the appendix . The first , containing a sketch of the practice in prize causes , will be found useful , if we should unfortunately be engaged in another war . The other is an historical deduction of the rule of war of 1756 , from its origin down to the late orders in council . This note contains much useful information , and discovem* an ingenuity and extent of research highly creditable to the author . Its object is to prove , 1 . That the rule had not been recognized or applied at any period earlier than the war of 1756. 2 . That in its origin , it was confined to cases of such complete identification with the enemy 's interests , as to give a hostile character to the property . s . That the rule , whatever it was , was suffered to slumber during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war of the French revolution , " the sphere of its activity was enlarged , " beyond even the instructions of the executive government . How far Mr. W. has succeed ( led in proving these points , is a question which it would be inconsistent with the object of this review to discuss . There is , however , reported in this volume a case , which we are apprehensive will be employed as a powerful argument against our neutral claims , in the event of a fuhire European war . We allude to the case of the L*ornmercen , ( p. 38 ' ? . ) The question in this case was , whether this vessel , being Swedish , and having been captured in transporting ' grain , the property of British subjects , from Irelaud to Spain , by the special permission of the British govermmnient , and as appeared from the papers , for the use of the British forces there , was entitled to freight . The claim of the neut*a1 owner for freight was rejected by a majority of the court. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not profly four judges against three , Marshall , Livingston , and . Johnon dis . senting. // fess to be founded upon the principle , that no trade is to be allowed to the neutral in war , which is prohibited to him in peace , but upon the ground , that being engaged in transporting provisions for the use of the forces of our enemy , though not acting against us , but in another and distinct war , he is to be considered as much incorporated with that enemy , as if he had been carrying his despatches , or transporting his troops . It would not become us to question the correctness of this reasoning . But there are certainly arguments of no inconsiderable weight , which may he opposed to it by the future belligerent , when our own citizens shall be in the situation of the Swedish claimant . These arguments can not be better expressed , than in the words used by C. J. Marsh all , ( p. 402 ) in explaining the reasons of his dissent . " The inquiry , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was employed , would , if performed by his government , have been considered an act of hostility to the United States , and might rightfully he so considered , is material to the decision of the question , whether the act of the individual is to be treated as hostile . Great Britain and Sweden were allies in the war against France . Consequently , the king of Sweden might have ordered his troo.ps to cooperate with those of Britain , in any place , against the common enemy . lie might have ordered a reinforcement to the British army on the peninsula , and this reinforcement might have been transported by sea . An attempt on the part of the United States to intercept it , because it was aiding their enemy , would certainly have been an interference in the war in Europe , which would have provoked and would have justified the resentment of all the allied powers . It would have been an interference , not to be justified by our war with Britain , because those troops were not to be employed against us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of provisions was to be furnished in that part of the allied army , which was British , would that alter the case ? Could an American squadron intercept a convoy of provisions , or of military stores , of any description , going to an army engaged in a war common to Great Britain and Sweden , and not against the United States ? Could this be done without interfering in that war , and taking part in it against all the allies ? If it could not , then any supplies furnished by the government of Sweden , promoting the operations of their common ivar , whether intended for the British , or any other division of the allied armies , had a right to pass unmolested by American cruisers . It is not believed that any act , which , if performed by the government , would not be deemed an act of hostility , is to be so downed if // performed by an individual . Had the provisions , then on board the Commercen , been Swedish property , the result of this reasouing is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Being British *property , it is confiscable ; but the Swede is guilty of no other offence than carrying enemy 's property , an offence not enhanced in this particular case by the character of that property . He is , therefore , as much entitled to freight , as if his cargo had been of a different description . " It ought to be stated , however , that the Chief Justice declares that it was not without difficulty he came to this conclusion . Among the constitutional questions , which have been agitated from time to time in the courts of the United States , by far the most interesting and momentous is that of the power of those courts to take cognizance of crimes and offences not defined by the constitution , or by statutes made in pursuance of it . In the case of an indictment before the Circuit Court of Pennsylvania for attempting to bribe a commissioner of the revenue , ( 2 DalI. 393 , ) Judge Chase declared that , in his opinion , " the United States , as a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indictment could be maintained in their courts for offences merely at the common law . " The point has been argued on several occasions since that time , and particularly in the celebrated trial of Col. Burr before the Circuit Court at Richmond . It had not , however , been decided by the Supreme Court until the case of the United States vs . Hudson * Goodwin , reported in 7 Granclt , 32 . This was an indictment for a libel on the Congress of the U. S. and the question of jurisdiction was certified on general demurrer from the Circuit Court of Connecticut . Pinckney , Attorney General , for the U. S. and Dana , of counsel for the defendants , both declined arguing . The court decided against the jurisdiction , and Judge Johnson delivered an opinion , explaining the reasons of this decision . It was supposed that the question was then at rest ; but in the volume now under review , in the case of United States vs . Goolidge , ( p. 415 , ) it is brought again before the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet from the intimations of several of the judges , the point may be considered as still open for discussion . It can not , be too much regretted , that a question of so much importance , should thus remain unsettled ; especially as it involves the existence // or non-existence of an entii*e code of criminal justice . In this uncertainty and division of opinion , we can only refer such , as take an interest in the subject , to the able and learned opinion of the Hon. Judge Story in favour of the jurisdiction , reported in 1 Cir . Court Rep. 415 , and to the opinion before mentioned of the Hon. Judge Chase , to the arguments in Burr 's case , and a note of Judge Tucker , annexed to his edition of Blackstone , for the reasoning in support of the opposite doctrine . We had intended to give a view of the arguments on each side of the interesting question which arose in the case of . Alartir&amp; vs . Hunter 's lessee , reported in this volume , ( p. 305 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article . We will merely inform the reader , that in the case referred to , the constitutionality of that section of the judiciary law , which authorizes the revision in certain cases of the decrees and judgments of courts of the States by the Supreme Court oK the United States , was contested by the Court of Appeals of the State of Virginia ; who refused to obey a mandate for the Supreme Court , reversing their judgment in a cause of great magnitude , involving the title to a large tract of land , which the State of Virginia had seized , during the revolutionary war , and bad granted to several purchasers . An elaborate opinion was delivered by Story J. the result of which was , that the court , in pursuance of the powers given by the statute , proceeded to execute its own judgment without a second mandate to the Court of Appeals . This has therefore become a controversy between Virginia and the United States . It remains to be seen , wheth. er that State will , as Pennsylvania did in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the execution of the decree . We are disposed to say very little as to the manner in which Mr. Wheaton has reported the arguments of counsel . " Nec enim reprehendere libet , nec laudare possumus . " Their general defect is in stating positions , rather than the reasoning and illustrations , by which they are supported . In some instances , they are very fully and ably reported . Mr. Wheaton*s own argument , and that of his antagonist in the case of the 4ntonia , and Mi ' . llitnter 's in that of . /lmmidon vs : Smith * at . may be mentioned as examples . Mr. Wheaton has , we think , been unfortunate in attemptbig sometimes to preserve the coruscations of fancy , with // which the orator has soughtto decorate his discourse . These , however proper and becoming at the bar , are entirely out of place in the report of a law case . It is hardly possible to retain tht*m'tu*curately , and their effect depends so much oft what precedes and follows , that a figure , very beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brief sketch , to which a reporter is limited . We felt this p*infulIy ' in reading the succession of indistinct and confused images , which close the argument of that eminent civilian and orator , who was of counsel for the defendant in errour in the case of . Mitrtin vs . Hunter 's lessee. * We believed that though here and there might be a word of his pronouncing , the whole could be but the mutilated likeness of his eloquence ; the broken and disjointed limbs of a form once beautiful . Who , that has been accustomed to the oratory of Mr. Dexter , can suppose the following sentences to have passed his lips . " I have long inclined to the belief , that the centrifugal force was greater than the centripetal . The dan*er is , not that we shall fall into the sun , but that we may fly off in eccentrick orbits , arid never return to our perihelion . But though I will struggle to preserve all the constitutiqnal powers of the national govern ment , 1 will not strain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is danger too on that side . The poet describes the temple of Fame as situated on a mountain covered with ice . The palaces of power are on the same frail foundation ; the foot of adventurous ambition often slips in the ascent , and sometimes the volcano bursts , and inundates with its lava the surrounding country . " Who does not perceive , that though some few strokes of the picture may be from the pencil of that distinguished master , yet it wants the tint and colouring , which were the chief constituents of its beauty ; which softened its glare , and gavI* consistency and harmony to the whole ? - We do not mean , however , to accuse Mr. Wheaton of any want of skill in the execution of this attempt . We believe very few would have done it so well . The truth is , that a painter may as well hope to imitate on his canvass the changes of the evening cloud , as a law reporter to preserve , in their force , distinctness and beauty , the displays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . // Upon the whole , we are well satisfied with the manner , in which Mr. W. has commenced his labours , and shall look with impatience for a second volume .
