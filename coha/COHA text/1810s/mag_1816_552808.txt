txt On Models in Literature . " Yet still uppermost , Nature was at his heart , as it he felt , Though yet he knew not how , a wasting power In all things , which from her sweet influence , Might tend to wean him . " WORDSWORTH . When I lay down the reviews , or go home from a party of fashionable criticks , I pity the whole iace of authors . If they would be the favouiites of the age they live in , they must stand in awe of its opinions and taste , however various or chilling . They are surrounded by tribunals and judges in almost every class ; and all put in their claims to special deference and respect . The frivolous and gay , one would think , had no concern with The depths of the heart , nor even with the landscape , any farther than the tints that overlay it . Still they are readers and judges . They lay up a little poetry or wit , for conversation 's sake , or at least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Then again , we have exact scholars , who require a sustained fau*lessness and elegance in every thing . They are shocked with blemishes or occasional dulness , and judge a man by failures that are merely accidental , and which do not indicate in the least , the original cast or defects of his mind . They never look at gleams , or regions of clear azure , in a sleepy sky . They laugh at foolish simplicity , till they can not discern the real , which is very often in the neiThbourhood. - There is too , a great middling crowd of readers , whose vocabulary of criticism extends little further than to " unnatural , out-of-Ife , ' ' &amp;c. ; and words of this sort they are sure to level against every man , who ventures upon the marvellous , wild , and unreal . These are the pi ' *scti ( *al men , who judge exery thing , by what they call common sense . They laugh at the folly of encouraging men in the indolent luxuries , and unprofitable excesses of im%ination and feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be useful , to conquer the vices , and bring home the Wan ( lel'ings of the mind. - Other readers , however , are so fastidious and ethereal , that they can not bear to see a Poet in the streets or workshops . // And shall authors then never he allowed to lose sight of the motley race , who are to judge them ? A heavy day it will be for poetry , when society is made the school of genius , instead of solitude . You might as well take a man from the quiet , unconfined seclusion in which he has lived , arid rioted from infancy , ' and fit up a cell for him in the inquisition , in some large city , where the tread of the tormentor is heard above , and the laughter of the world without the walls . I*Te may differ in our tastes as much as we please . It is a way to encourage all sorts of mind , and bring to light every thing fitted for poetry . But we must get out of the bad habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up in our own way . Genius is not willing to be interfered with , and told how to work , where to travel , and what to admire . And yet there are men , who go so far as to hold up models for imitation , and standards of taste , for writers of every age and country , let their minds be ever so lofty and original . We shall say a little of this interference , for it appears to be the most mischievous of all . It may be well for minds of a common cast to read and obey . They may profitably give themselves up all their lives , to the superiour intellects about them . They are not made nor wanted for authors , and they only leave a gap in the busier parts of society , when they venture to be such . It is the great men of a country , who are to make and support its literature . And to tell such men that they must give their days and nights to any models , ancient or modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius . It is to make men look at creation and society , through another man 's eyes , and communicate all that their hearts labour with , by the help of a remembered manner they learnt in the schools . It is to educate different men by one rule , and force all minds to one taste and pursuit . It comes in the way of nature , and reduces all her irregularities , crooks , and violence , her endless change , into straightness , smoothness , and harmony . It is to make the difference of country , of habits , and institutions wholly ineffectual as to literature , and to bring the native of the mountains and plains , of the inland arid coast , to a lifeless similarity of taste . Where is a mind , thus trained , to get its food and excitement ? It is irksome and exhausting to walk in the dusty // track of an earlier traveller , especially when the whole world , in " morning freshness , " lies open to the observing , intrepid , and ardent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own seeking . Their imaginations are filled with bright forms of unattained excellence , kindling enthusiasm and hope , for a man to dream about , when he grows tired of what others have done , and burns to make more perfect what he attempts himself . Such men owe their power over the reader , chiefly to something all their own in their notice of things , their manner , feelings , partialities , and taste . There is a savour of genius and individu* ality in all they say . they write from the heart , and we know them every where . They sit alone and work by themselves , leaving friends unconsulted , enemies neglected , and doing nothing , merely because it has been pointed out . They speak with freedom and infant fearlessness , as if they were alone in the world , and had all to themselves . They are never dried up by the fear that nature is failing , but feel that something is left for them every where . The imitator , the man who gets his stock of thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrained , and mo ( lelled lhronghout . Every thing , even to his enthu* sia*mn , seems disciphued and artificial . He will have no sins of overgrowth to repent of . He seems under a careful lrocess of emaciation , to keep in the fashion of grace and slenderness . His business is to select amid trim , where others , with the prodigality of invention , have thrown heaps and masses . He burnishes old jewels or sets them anew , and submits cheerfully to other labours about as generous and nourishing to a hungry mind . When he is among the great , either of the living or dead , he does not feel him* self in society . He does not come within the touch of greatness . There is no friendly action of other minds on his own-no level on which they can meet , and be happy and useful together . He goes as a worshipper , to wonder and obey , not as an equal , to question , value , and surpass . Is this the way to make writers of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy from themselves ? The reader will tell you that works fashioned by models , or infected with books , are but old stories , the more tedious for the finish and elegance which is intended to make imp for free* ( loin and originality . They have no carelessness nor waste thought about them-no indication that the mimid was the // lighter and happier for throwing off its constant grpwth . The writer has the stiff , genteel way of a man who is trying to entertain strangers , and is afraid of committing himself , and so prepares himself for the occasion . There is none of that gracious , fearless familiarity which one feels with those of his own borne , whom he has seen every hour , and whose characters have rather grown upon him than been studied . If the borrowers and imitators are only encouraged , the swarm will go on thickening . There is enough now in the stores of poetry , heaped up by others , to serve them for ages . They need not once look out of doors to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of taste , books of practical criticism , and approved standard*i of language , to make one go right and safely . And surely it is very ea. *y for men ( except those who have the indignant freedom of genius , ) to write with suca helps . Besides , it looks hard now.a-days , to be original , when so many have already gone over the land of poetry , and soiled and made common all that lay on the surface , or in secret . Alas , when the world grows rich , heirs will be indolent ; and we should not wonder at it . The habit of living on other minds , naturally creates a spirit of self indulgence , and at last of weak timidity . Instead of being kindled into effort by what others have done , the heart sinks into cowardly admiration . It is content to relish what it dares not rival . It sets much by a refined , artificial taste , and thinks it enough to be exquisite in criticism , and eloquent in praise . You will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in ecstacies before I ) ictul'es and statues . The student sits at his window with a book before him , but he never looks out upon the fields . Knowledge must now be drawn from libraries and collections . The ( lifficulties of acquiring which were once encountered , are now done away , and with them the wholesome and invigorating labour . We need not confound ourselves any longer in the wastes and thickets , which our fathers so eagerly plunged into . We have masters and schools at our very doors , to teach us every thing , and to reduce every thing to system and simplicity . Here then is the very mischief of learning-the way to turn great men into confectioners an ( l second-hand caterers . Their minds are surfeited with what other men have said , and toiled hard and all alone , to come at . No wonder that they grow sickly , acquiescing , and unproduc-tive4 // Let us just look at one or two ways , in which freedom and originality of mind are assailed or endangered . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and asserting their supremacy in literature . By some means or other , the ancients have exerted an enormous influence among literary men , and in nations too , that have had hardly any thing of real congeniality with them . And many a lover of his own home , of the domestick fame and character of his country , has , in his fits of vexation , been tempted to wish that the Barbarians had either done their work more faithfully among the fair fabricks of Greece and Rome , or else left those illustrious nations to live , and provoke the res of the world to independent greatness , instead of being Iheir school or nurse . As it now is , the old nations survive , in a sort of mixed state of grandeur and desolation . We grow tender among ruins and fragments . We love to soften down the errours and grossness of the fallen , and to extol and venerate the remains of their greatness , without making a very scrupulous estimate of its real worth . The grave-yard is common ground , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no rancour nor heartburning there . We can all give praise with generous complacency , when no pretensions are set up . The Romans worshipped Greece , after they had conquered her . Besides , the earliest nations in letters have a sort of patriarchal claim to the reverence of those who come after . Nothing remains of them but their finished and best works . We have no records of their early attempts and failures-. nothing to inspire pity , to lessen admiration , or to encourage us when we fail . They seem to have started up at once , as if by an " over-night creation , " into elegance and beauty , full of the ease , delight , and earnestness of men who draw directly from nature . They are set off from the earlier world , and connected with every after are , by appearing to be the very beginners of literature . They become the lights and helps of other nations , who are slower and later in attention to the mind  --  and even when their followers have surpassed their guides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortune for themselVes , it is still hard to throw off the veneration and deference which all have felt , and which gives them something common in their taste , pride , and obligations . // The boy at school ( in the best , but most complying hours of hi* life ) is set to work upon the ancient tlassicks . He hears and reads of the god-like people , who began and finished the world 's literature . This is taken in with his rudiments , and along with it , indifference towards his own language , which he acquired as unconsciously as he grew , and thinks too familiar for study or respect , while every thing ancient is brought home to him in solemnity and wonders , and fastens itself upon him more closely than his prayers . The effect of this is , in many cases , to make what is foreign , artificial , and uncongenial , the foundation of a man 's literary habits , ambition , and prejudices . It is hardly possible that a man , thus trained and dependent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing vulgar at home . But it ought to be remembered , that the question is not upon the merits of , the ancients , or any models whatever* Men will always settle this matter for themselves , according to their own taste and feelings . What we contend for is , that the literature of a country is just as domestick and individual , as its character or political institutions Its charm is its nativeness . It is made for home , to be the luxury of those who have the feeling and love of home , and whose characters and taste have been formed there . No matter for rudeness , or want of systems and schools . It is enough that all is our own , and just such as we were made to have and relish . A country then must be the former and finisher of its own genius . It has , or should have , nothing to do with strangers . They are not expected to feel the beauty of your old poetical language , depending as it does on early and tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and inspiring an inward and inexplicable joy , like a tale of childhood . The stranger perhaps is only alarmed or disgusted by the hoarse and wild runsick of your forests , or sea-shore , by the fran tick superstition of your fathers , or the lovely fairy scenes , that lie far back in the mists of your fable . lie can not feel your pride in the splendid barbarism of your counti* " , when the mind was in health and free , and the foundations of your character arid greatness laid for ever . All these things are for the native . They heip to give a character to hi* *oiintry and her literature , and lie loves them too well , to be o*nce*ned at the world 's admiration or contempt . // So long then as a country is proud of itself , it will repel every encroachment upon its native literature . Improvements will offer themselves under a thousand forms . Intimacy with other nations , especially if they are polished , and the leaders of t*shion , will tempt men to imitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep itself at home , and value the things of its own household . It will have but feeble claims to excellence and distinction , when it stoops to put on foreign ornament and manner , and to adopt from other nations , images , allusions , and a metaphorical language , which are * ) perfectly unmeaning and sickly , out of their own birth-place . The most polished will be the dreariest ages of its literature . Its writers will be afraid to speak the language that God has given them , till they have mingled the rough torrent with the allaying streams of a softer region . A strange idiom will be introduced into style . And the whole literature of a country will be mere gaudy patchwork , borrowed from every region that has any beauty to lend . It may be well too just to hint , that it is not foreign models alone which are to be feared . We must also be shy of ourselves . For men of real genius and independence will sometimes introduce dangerous novelties , and make errours and corruptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And besides this , there is good reason to fear that every country , as it falls into luxury and refinement , will be doomed to have an Augustan agc , a classical era of its own , when fine writers will determine , what shall be correct taste , pure language , and legitimate poetry . A dornestick master may not be as alarming as a foreigner , and long before a man has ceased to study and love the early literature of his country , he may expect to hear that the 01 ( 1 language is barbarous and obsolete , and re ; ecte ( l by all chaste authors , who wish to keep the national literature uniform and pure . As to all this , a man must judge for himself . And one would think , that if there must be models , a writer would do well to go as near to the oriainal as possible , even to the very fathers of poetry . If there is luxury for him in such society , and if his books can find readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him turn to the rougher and more intrepid ages of his country , before men troubled themselves about elegance or plan , and wrote right on as they felt , even though they were uttering a thought for the first time , feeling probably very little concern // whether a softer age laughed at or worshipped themwhether they were to be ranked among the classicks , or barbarians of poetry , whether theirs was to be called an Augustan era , or merely the plain old English days of Elizabeth .
