PREFACE . I CAN NOT offer this tragedy , with my name affixed to it , to the people of America , without saying a few words that may , in some degree , express my sense of the generous manner in which it has been already received by the inhabitants of this city . Whatever may be its success hereafter , I shall never forget that as the work of a nameless author , it was accepted by the Theatre of New-York , and received with applause by an American audience . In affixing my name to this tragedy perhaps I am a second time putting to the proof the generousity of the American public . A stranger  --  a foreigner  --  a young and unknown woman , my name can draw no attention to the title-page , and give no weight to the work itself . Yet I do not so wrong the people of this country as to apprehend that it will influennce them unfavorably . Should it occur to them , while perusing Altorf , that they are perusing the work of a foreigner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigner has sought their country uninvited , from a sincere admiration of their government , a heart-felt love of its freedom , a generous pride and sympathy in its rising greatness . I know not if my wishes influence my judgment , but I can not help believing that this country will one day revive the sinking honour of the drama . It is I believe generally felt and acknowledged , by the public of Great Britain as of America , that the dignity of English Tragedy has now degenerated into pantomime ; and that rapid movements , stage tricks and fine scenery have filled the place of poetry , character , and passion . The construction as well as the management of the London Theatres perhaps present insurmountable obstacles to any who might there ambition to correct the fashion of the stage . No such difficulties exist here . But this is not all : America is the land of liberty . Here is the country where Truth may lift her voice without fear ;  --  where the words of Freedom may not only be read in the closet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshackled press : but there is not a stage in England from which the dramatist might breathe the sentiments of enlightened patriotism and republican liberty . In America alone might such a stage be formed ; a stage that should be , like that of Greece , a school of virtue ;  --  where all that is noble in sentiment , generous and heroic in action should speak to the hearts of a free people , and inspire each rising generation with all the better and nobler feelings of human nature . I am far from supposing myself equal to the forming such a theatre as my imagination has conceived , but if I might only hope by my example to encourage other and more gifted minds to employ their powers in this work , and thus to effect and complete what I could only imagine , I shall feel that I have not wholly laboured in vain , and merit perhaps to leave my name in remembrance with the people of this great country ; which , in its infancy , has brought the art of government to perfection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its maturer age , to foster and advance every other art , and be at once the land of liberty and of genius . New York , March , 30 , 1819 . IT may perhaps be as well to advise the Reader that , both as to persons and plot , the Tragedy of Altorf is altogether fictitious . It may be the more necessary to advise him of this , as from the allusions to historical events , and the story being as it were interwoven with a national revolution , he might incline to search the Swiss annals for the name and life of my Hero , neither of which he will find there . The story of the insurrection of the Swiss Cantons in the fourteenth century ; the violent and wanton tyranny exercised by Austria and her Deputies over that intrepid race of Mountaineers , and the spirit and heroic firmness with which they rose against that tyranny , and again and again engaged with and overcame the formidable armies by which it thought to terrify and force them into submission  --  all this is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary as a preface to the victory of Morgarten . The opening of the drama supposes that victory achieved , and the Swiss bands , encamped on Mount Sattel , watching the motions of a second division of the Austrian army , that threatened to advance into their vallies . It only remains for me to apologize for an error , which perhaps the generality of readers might pass over without detection , or at least without comment . I have more than once throughout the piece styled the house of Austria Imperial . Perhaps the epithet might admit of defence , not only on the ground that two of that house had already filled the imperial throne , but that even at the time of Leopold 's invasion of Switzerland the struggle between the Austrian and Bavarian candidates continued undecided : Frederic no less than Lewis claiming the title of King of the Romans and Emperor elect . I must confess , however , the propriety of its application to Duke Leopold , a younger brother of Frederic , to be more than doubtful , and , admitting the inaccuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York , Feb. 17 , 1819 . PROLOGUE TO ALTORF . By Wolfe-tone , W. T. BY W. T. WOLFE-TONE . No royal pageantry this night displayed Crowds your Columbian stage with vain parade . The pomp of courts , the empty cares of kings No kindred feeling to your bosom brings . A nobler inspiration wakes the lyre , ' T is liberty 's unconquerable fire ; That liberty for which our fathers bled When Washington their free battalions led . Like them , Helvetia 's sons , a hardy race , Toiled at the plough , or laboured in the chace : Obscure but blest , until a tyrant 's hand Stretched its unhallowed grasp over their rugged land With generous indignation fired , they sprung , And the rude horn along their vallies rung ; And , at the call , each peasant mountaineer Rush 'd down his hills , and shook his rustic spear . The haughty foe , whose chivalry with pride Rolled up the vale war 's undulating tide , He stood  --  firm as his native Alpine rock Each peasant stood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred name , Rushed fearless on to victory and fame ; Whilst from each mountain echo swell 'd the cry Of justice , vengeance , Switz and liberty . And shall the tale of liberty be told To ears unwilling and to bosoms cold ? Could self-accusing despots bear the sight Of Austria humbled in Morgarten 's fight ? Oh , no  --  Columbia , to thy sons belongs The muse of yet unprostituted songs ; That never yet with mercenary fire , Strung for a Monarch 's ear the adulating lyre . Freedom , that roused the poet 's kindling art , Will touch the springs of each Columbian heart , And will associate with a magic spell The name of Washington with that of Tell . EPILOGUE . By Farmer , H. T. BY H. T. FARMER . Spoken by Mrs. Barnes in the character of Rosina . Wak 'd by the grateful tribute of applause , I burst my bonds , and spurn 'd death 's icy laws ; Methinks e'en now I see Elysium beam  --  But soft , ye fair  --  and I 'll repeat my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Dryden crown 'd me with a wreath of flowers , While Otway wept ! for that sad pilgrim knew The bliss of genius  --  and her curses too  --  How soon , alas ! that fleeting bliss expires , She dreams of roses , but she sleeps on briars ; Convenes in robes , a magic court of air , Then wakes , and finds her wilder 'd bosom bare ! Nay , more  --  though lorn and weary and distress 'd , Suspense , that vampyre , banquets on her breast , While sleepless Envy , with her shuddering brood , Relentless dips a dagger in her blood . Ye who award to sterling worth its due , And love the flowret that your garden grew , With heart , with impulse , and with fostering hand , Greet this sweet scion of your native land ; The lovely dew-queen , in succeeding years , Shall bathe its future buds in sparkling tears , Unnumber 'd leaves its cherish 'd blossoms shed To deck the Patriot 's grave  --  and virgin 's bed .

Yet not from land so distant , but I know The tale of your atchievements ; how the pride Of Austria is quell 'd ; her noble chiefs Her marshalled legions , scattered on the field Food for the birds of Heaven . How the song Of proud emancipation rends your Alps , And every peasant child , as on their sides Watching his flock , or wandering herd , he sits , Teaches the traveller , and mountain echoes His country 's freedom , and de Altorf 's praise . All this I know , but have yet farther heard That on Mount Sattel still the watch is held By Altorf and his troops . This seemeth strange .

By heaven , these rebel churls Shall cope with peers and princes in the art Of noble war ! Austria , who would have thought That thy imperial head should yield its laurels To shepherd mountaineers ? but tremble , Switz . There is a weapon stronger than the sword , Whose subtle edge can strike into the marrow , Sap the foundation of the grandest empires , Disjoint their strength , and heap them all in ruins .

While I accost the sire , seek you the son . Or one or other I will win or perish . Eustace . Eustace How look you to succeed ? Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg By art or bribe . Albeit my kinsman wear these stoic virtues , None know what cause of secret discontent May be the parent of them . Blighted hopes , Ambition disappointed , or sick envy , Hath made more sages than philosophy , Saints than religion , patriots than virtue . Eustace .

Your face , your form , your voice , are all familiar To thousands of the rebels . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg I risk not this . Pass you into the camp ; seek out young Altorf . Be not too hasty to declare yourself , But watch him  --  watch him silently and closely ; Observe his temper , ask of it from others . I know that he was proud and hasty somewhat ; And I should deem that in his present station Of captain to a band of mountaineers , His pride would meet some rubs . Take you your pipe . ' Twill gain you easy passport ' mong the rebels . And , I remember me , De Altorf loved To list the wild notes of our mountain airs When my fair daughter played them .

Before three hours be past I shall be there , And linger ' mong the rocks until you join me . A whistle be the signal  --  now farewell . exit Eustace . Voices ! perchance ' t is Erlach .

Methinks all nature Knows our tale of freedom .

Oh , my fond heart ! Thy aged pulses beat as quick with pleasure As ever bridegroom 's on the nuptial day . My gracious maker ! thou hast bless 'd me fully , Old Erlach now hath not a prayer to utter , He can but only praise thee , bless and die . Rossberg comes forward and stands considering him in deep silence . Stranger ! Whence comest thou ? What would ye friend ? Why read you thus my face ? Rossberg Rosina de Rossberg ( considering him as before ) The priest , the moralist , and dreaming poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or novel of the thoughts of men That might be now disputed ? Erlach . Erlach Who may this be ? Stranger , where tend thy words ? Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg To this they tend ; That if men hear for market-place reports Of crested monarchs who put off their state , And sell their purple for a begger 's rags , Their palace for a stable , and their realm For leave to pace the highway , cap in hand , Craving an alms for love of charity , They need not cry " God 's mercy ! " They who see My noble kinsman changed to what I see him , Might hold such tales for just intelligence . Erlach . Erlach That voice chimes in familiar to my ear . That eye  --  that brow  --  I 've seen such heretofore : Count Werner , as I live ? Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg I marvel not I read amazement in the face of Erlach . That Rossberg 's lord should , through a land of rebels , Pace in this mean disguise to seek a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon , count ? Who calls this land rebellious speaks not here . Ere that I ask the motive of your journey , Resolve to name with honour this free country , Or part in peace unquestioned . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg Free call ye it ? Licentious rather say . Is it for peasant churls and mountain shepherds To frame out laws , and mock the word of kings ? Erlach . Erlach Hist , lord of Rossberg ! leave injurious words : Speak quickly to thine errand . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg You know this signet ? ( shewing a ring ) Erlach . Erlach Austria 's : proceed . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg Thus saith Imperial Leopold to Altorf : Albeit the measure of his crimes be full , That in the eye of nations and of men , He stands arraigned and forfeit to the law . Yet doth he hold to him his gracious pardon , Secure to him his lands , his wealth and station ; Nay more  --  so he return to his allegiance , Count of the Empire I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks , my lord ! the snows of age Have bleached them o'er and o'er .  --  Art not asham 'd To bear such message to so old a man ? Go ! tell him that sent thee , not his empire Could buy the voice of Altorf from his country . Go to ! I know the drift  --  I know you deem My voice hath weight among this artless people . And you are right : it hath : I 'm proud to say it . Tush ! you have chosen ill  --  you should have sought Some hot brained boy , fresh from his mother 's apron , To catch your bait  --  wealth , rank , and station , count , All these I had , and freely parted with . My wealth ! I 've pour 'd it forth to arm my country ; My rank ! I 've learned to know it but a name , And thrown it to the winds  --  My station ! that ! Behold I 've fled for aye the throne of kings , And found it at the pedestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thought enough ; yet I 'll speak further . Erlach . Erlach No further , count , if that your drift be treason . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg Treason ? In Erlach 's mouth that word sounds nobly . Erlach , who 's broken oath and loyalty , And rung rebellion 's clamour through the land . Erlach . Erlach Speak not of these things , count , they are beyond thee . I tell thee , Rossberg , thou cans't not understand The cause of freedom , nor the patriot 's motives . Why  --  did I show thee all I think and feel ; All that I 've done and would do in this cause , Thou'dst call me moonstruck and beside my reason . Rebellion ?  --  Treason ?  --  Thou'rt the rebel , Rossberg ! Thou , who prefer'st the interest of one man , And that a base , and mean , and sordid interest , Unto the weal of thousands . Thou , who stoop'st A servile knee unto a thirsty tyrant , Whose hands are dropping with thy country 's gore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . Oh , Rossberg ! Rossberg !  --  Talk no more of this , Thou'lt break my aged frame with indignation : It ill becomes so old a man as me To swell with anger . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg Lay it then aside ; And let me claim an answer calmly from thee . Who hath more cause for wrath  --  or you or I ? You , who have broke your faith and solemn pledge  --  I speak not now of any public matter  --  Or I , who took that pledge , and found it rotten ? Erlach . Erlach I know to what you point , my son 's alliance ; Before this country 's wrongs cried up to heaven , Before a Tell defied a Gesler 's fury , Before a Furst , a Stauffacher , and Melchthal Held up in Ruttle 's field their conjoined hands , And called their God to look down from his throne , And register their oath in his great record , Erlach was Rossberg 's kinsman and his friend ; And if he is not still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice , honour call him . Had Rossberg sided with his injured country , Our children 's loves had not been crossed thus rudely . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg Had Erlach not espoused a rebel cause  --  Erlach . Erlach A truce to this !  --  Count Werner sure must feel That he and I have now no thoughts in common ; And , being so , certain he could not wish To join his child and mine at heaven 's altar . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg There you say true  --  The untainted blood of Rossberg Certain shall never mix with that of rebels . But say  --  Hath Erlach , with the peasant 's garb Put on the peasant 's mind ? What ! all the fame , The grandeur , honour , potency forgot , Of his long line of fathers ? Forbid it , Heaven ! My friend , think better of it . Trust my words ; These churls , for whom you sacrifice your all , Will , when you most attend a good requital , Turn foul upon you with the canker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To look among the base-born and the poor For virtues of the noble , were , as if We should demand from mules the courser 's mettle , Or lion 's magnanimity from foxes . Erlach . Erlach Methinks , when you and I were younger somewhat , In Mantua 's learned halls , that we did read The golden annals of the men of Greece ; When we did say , that , spite of all their errors , Their pride , their clamour , and their thanklessness , We rather would have fought , have bled , have died Upon the hallowed field of Marathon , That sat an Alexander on Darius ' throne . So felt we then , so feel I now , Count Werner . While that my son and I take up this quarrel , He aiding with his sword , I with my counsel , We ask , we wish , we merit none requital , But that sweet payment of approving conscience , Of which , nor thankless world , nor frowning heaven , Nor slanderous tongues , nor dungeons , chains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cords , and gibbets  --  The patriot 's single heart shall e'er billeg . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg You do refuse , the , Austria 's proffered bounties ? Erlach . Erlach I wed in life or death the cause of freedom . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg You are fixed on breaking up our children 's loves , Breaking our ancient friendship and our contract ? Erlach . Erlach So fate and duty have compelled , my lord . For know , a bar which only death can break Stands ' twixt my child and thine  --  my son is marriage Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg How ? Erlach . Erlach I 've said the truth  --  ' T was a hard struggle , count , For my poor boy : but to a father 's prayers At length he yielded . I knew his love How great , how nourished from his boyhood up , For your bewitching daughter  --  And I feared His love should prove a tamperer with his honour , Should stand betwixt him and his struggling country , And in this fear  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt not Altorf 's heir Hath found a wealthier and a nobler mate Than my half-portioned child . But know , false kinsman ! Though Rossberg 's lands and titles pass by law Unto thy son as to the next male heir , Yet there is wealth , and wide estates too , baron , My daughter can inherit . Erlach . Erlach Hear me , count ! Your wealth I never sought . ' T was not for this I wished to join our children  --  And your title With the fair lands annexed to it  --  by heaven ! I covet neither  --  I claim neither , Rossberg ; I , nor my son . Doubt not my honesty , Nor deem I make parade of costly virtues : This wealth and rank , authority and station , Have now so little lure to tempt my envy , That , yielding them can scarce lay claim to merit , And barely asks your thanks . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg My thanks ?  --  not mine . Rossberg hath yet too much of human frailty , Of honour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monkish apathy , Or swell the hosannahs of a base-born rabble To self-deposing lords . Erlach . Erlach Nay , scoff not , kinsman ! Albeit opinion make us public foes , Let us in private wear the heart of friends . Wilt please you take refreshment ere we part ? Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg I thank you , baron , here my mission ends . Erlach . Erlach Speed quickly then  --  For I expect each moment Some soldiers from the camp ; and , were you found , My voice might barely serve to shield your life . Exit Rossberg . SCENE IV . Erlach alone  --  afterwards GIOVANNA . Erlach . Erlach Why , what a riddle is the soul of man ! How grand and how contemptible !  --  Now shining In such full majesty of godlike virtue , In thought so high , in feeling so devoted , In scheme so vast , in action so sublime , It seems , upon earth 's theatre , not less Than the Creating Spirit , when it moved O'er the blank face of chaos , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being  --  And then again  --  and , oh my God , how frequent !

Erlach Quick to thy tale !  --  What is the matter ? speak . Giovanna . Giovanna Now , by my troth ! I dare not give it breath , Lest you should swell my words beyond their meaning And pluck disquiet from a childish matter .

Who like the old and wise can stem the storm Of bickering passion in the young and thoughtless ?

Let but thy voice be heard in yonder tents And love and concord shall again be with us . Erlach . Erlach What , is our camp divided ? Holy Heaven . Is Switz undone , betrayed , and all so soon ? Giovanna . Giovanna Nay , God forbid ! It is not thus , my father . ' T is but a little strife , a soldier 's quarrel , Betwixt my brother and thy noble son . Erlach .

Erlach . Erlach Where lies the mischief in a plan so wise ? Giovanna . Giovanna Do you not see , that , if the foe delay Some few days more , your son 's command expires , As he complains , in useless , shameless idlesse ; And , when the day of danger comes , he quits His foremost post , as if afraid to hold it .

And , when our parents made the marriage up ' Twixt thee and my dear sister , did I not Receive you with a brother 's open arms  --  Try all I could to win your trust and love ? Then , if you only met my love half way , Was it my fault ?  --  If , when I jok 'd and laugh 'd You look 'd the graver , was the fault with me ? If , when  --  Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Truce to your ifs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is grave , my temper gloomy : ' T is my misfortune : but the man who mocks it Might never be the brother of my bosom . You say that I but met your love half way : I told you why I did not  --  why I could not . You were the laughing Spring , I  --  the cold Winter . You lov 'd the dance , the song , the eye of woman , I  --  none of these . Even in arms we differ 'd : You lov 'd the life , the brilliancy , the pride , The dash , the spirit of the soldier 's fortune : I only sought , setting our cause aside , The danger and the drowning noise of battle . De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal You do me wrong : I never mock 'd your ways : I 've thought them strange , as who on earth would not In studying you , I find all things reversed . Why , there 's a bridal ; i ' the world before I took it for a festival ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of penance . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Tush ! De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal Nay ; do you know , de Altorf , you have taught me That beauty , grace , youth , wit , and loveliness , Are things to shun in women . When I wed It shall be some old dame , whose wrinkled cheeks Retain no flush of youth , no blush of love ; Whose eye  --  no fire ; whose voice  --  no tenderness ; Whose heart  --  no hopes , no warmth , no kindliness . I would not , by my soul ! crush the fair bud Of trusting , open-hearted , kindled beauty ; No  --  not for Austria 's throne ! what say you , brother ? Should you not marvel if there were a man Whose face a lovely woman could not brighten ? Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Again , if such there be , ' t is his misfortune . I rather pity him , than blame him for't . De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal So do not I. Altorf . Eberard de Altorf And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half way . You see we do agree in nothing , brother . De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal I know not how you call your temper hot : You answer very coolly to my speech . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Yes ; for , tho ' rude , its cause does not offend me . You are the brother of a woman such As Europe scarce might match  --  That you should love her , And loving her , should of her peace be jealous , Is right and natural ;  --  that you should blame The man who seem 'd too careless of her peace , Cold to her beauties , blind to her perfections , Is natural also : yet you are mistaken . I am not blind nor careless , only cold . De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal Cold !  --  then you own you do not love my sister . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf I have not said so : nor am I bound , I think , To answer every question you may ask . De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal Whate'er your temper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will not fight , I must not quarrel . One thing before I go ; you marvel doubtless To see me here . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf I marvel nothing , sir . I should have known before I gave my orders , They would not be obey 'd unless they pleas 'd you They have not pleas 'd you , and  --  are not obey 'd . SCENE III . ALTORF , DE RHEINTHAL , GIOVANNA . Giovanna . Giovanna Both frowning . Fie ! Rheinthal , is this your promise ? Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Fear not , Giovanna ; we are both quite cool . De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal ' T is false ! For one at least , I am not cool . Giovanna . Giovanna Then do not speak . Come , I 've a word for you . This way a moment .

Erlach Art thou worthy of it ? Altorf . Eberard de Altorf How ! worthy ? Erlach . Erlach Ay , son . It is a feeble hand , and old , Shrunk up from service of the sword and spear . And yet its thin and shrivell 'd palm is worth The grasp of noble men ; I would not give it , Old as it is and useless , to the touch Of him I did not honour . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Ha ! Erlach . Erlach I like the sign ; That start of wonder , and that flush of pride Give me my son again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Altorf Wrong 'd me , indeed , and cut me to the core .

Altorf . Eberard de Altorf You 've heard it wrong  --  you 've heard it but in part . Erlach . Erlach That I should hear't at all ! Oh ! senseless boy !

Altorf . Eberard de Altorf I may not stand before so pure a judge . Perhaps , my father , I have something err 'd ; Perhaps , when dashing in the tide of battle , I 've thought upon myself , and felt that death Would , while it gave my name to future ages . Release me from a life rough and uneasy . A thirst for honour I will not deny ; I feel it and I prize it : do you blame me ? A sick and aching heart too , I confess , This may be weakness  --  is it sin , my father ? Erlach . Erlach I do not chide , I love your thirst of honour . There 's no great soul without it . For your sorrows ! No , no , my boy ! I do not chide you here . Yet if you lov 'd your country as you ought  --  But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your duty . Now hath my son no errors unconfess 'd ? Altorf . Eberard de Altorf You 've heard , I see , th ' amount of my offences , And heard more than the truth . Am I to blame Because some like me not ? Men 's tastes are free . Must we push thro ' the thronged road of life And cry " well met ! " to every fool we jostle ? The short of my offence is  --  I offend The brother of my wife : I speak too little , Am grave at times , or on his sister 's beauties Look with too cold an eye . And , when I answer , My face is as God made it ; that my tongue Speaks when it finds occasion : for my eyes , If they be blind , the loss is to myself ; That I am past the days of tutorship , And do not wish a spy upon my steps , He chafes and throws his gauntlet ; I refuse it ; He nurtures up disdain within his breast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who could take these things with a still pulse ? I am not saint , nor yet philosopher ; Nor do pretend such power o'er myself As not to feel , and not to show my feelings . Erlach .

Shame , shame on thee ? Go  --  and throw off that plume , Throw off your sword , and get you hence to school . There learn again what ' t is you owe to virtue , What to yourself , what to your fellow men , What unto God , and , more than all , your country . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Enough ! enough !

Thou soon wilt lose me ; Then if thy stormy passions do awake , What voice shall lay them ? Oh , bethink thee well ! My sand is so near run , this may , my son , This may be the last lesson I shall give thee . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf ( striking his breast ) ' T is graven here . Fear not , my honour 'd parent ! Whene'er my proud heart swells , I 'll con it o'er , And be  --  and be all you could wish , my father . ( throwing himself at Erlach 's feet ) Your blessing ! Erlach .

De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal With all my soul . Erlach . Erlach Why , that 's well said , and comes from a warm heart . De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal Most worthy sir ! I bless you for your present . Before I had a brother , now a friend . But ( turning to Altorf ) I hope here 's no constraint . I would not owe My captain 's love all to a father 's prayers ; No , tho ' that father were the honour 'd Erlach . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Freely I gave my hand : nor am I wont , To give my hand and to withhold my heart . De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal The word 's enough . And from this hour be banish 'd All strife , all coldness , all reserve , all gloom . Altorf .

Nay , frown not , sir , ( to Erlach ) Nor arch your brows , De Rheinthal . To be friends And to keep friends we both must yield a little . I do not ask that you should change your temper . Ask it not then of me . Your hand again ! De Rheinthal . De Rheinthal There ! ( giving it coldly ) Altorf . Eberard de Altorf You are not hurt ? De Rheinthal .

Oh ! had I known thy worth before I wedded , No  --  never , never would I so have wrong 'd thee ! Giovanna . Giovanna Thou hast not wrong 'd me . Be content ! thou has not . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Yea , but I have . Oh , it hath weigh 'd upon me , Weigh 'd on my heart like lead ! ' T is now too late : To tell thee now , what , had I told before Had saved us both a cup of agony , Might now seem insult when the cup is drank And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cold , so gloomy , so unkind , And thou hast such a claim to confidence That I could almost  --  Giovanna . Giovanna Spare yourself ! I know it . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Know it ? Giovanna . Giovanna Yes ; the father was more generous than the son . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf I merit that : but why conceal this from me ? Giovanna . Giovanna I would not seem to know what you wish 'd secret . Sometimes indeed I 've thought to touch upo n't , But fear 'd to pain you when I wish 'd to ease . Oft when I 've seen you shrink at my approach , And try to smile and say some idle thing , I 've long 'd to bid you pour out your vex 'd soul Into a sister 's bosom . Oh , my Eberard ! I ask not love  --  I do not wish your love , I only ask your confidence and friendship . Do not refuse me these ! unload your heart , I know it 's high to burst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget I am your wife , And make me as your sister . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Generous woman ! Come to my heart !  --  my friend , my sister , come ! Giovanna . Giovanna My Altorf , talk no more of wrongs or pardons ! I am repaid thrice o'er . Yet could I chide thee , For that thou didst not sooner know my nature , And trust in it for sympathy , and ruth . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf And thou dost pity me who never saw her ? Who never heard her speak , nor had her love ? But , pardon me ! your sufferance , I pray you ! It shall be cur 'd  --  yes , yes ; it shall be cur 'd . Giovanna . Giovanna And thus the cure shall work . I will sit by thee , And thou shalt count me all her beauties o'er , Teach me her look , her smile , her air , her motion , Her voice , her accent , all her little ways , And what she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach me thus until I fancy That I have seen , and known , and loved her too ; And we will hold our converse then in common ; In common think , in common feel , and weep . And thus by slow degrees your anguish 'd spirit Shall find relief ; and patient , gentle sadness , Steal in the place of agony and ravings . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Great God ! how could'st thou give me such a woman . And not a second heart to shrine her in ! Oh , my Giovanna ! with a friend like thee , And with a country bleeding under wrongs , I were a wretch if of myself I thought : No ! ' t is on her I think  --  on her who sits Alone and comfortless in Rossberg 's towers , And takes no sleep by night , no food by day , But wastes , and sickens in her early prime , Breaking her heart , on Altorf 's broken faith . Giovanna . Giovanna Oh , had I known it sooner  --  Had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never should'st thou have sworn away thy freedom . Our fathers might have pray 'd  --  pray 'd on their knees , I never would have yielded : Shall I confess , And wilt thou not despise me ? when I heard My destin 'd husband was the brave de Altorf , My conscious heart beat high . Yes ! I had seen thee , Seen thee returning from the wars of Savoy , And said , as on thy noble form I gaz 'd , If e'er I lov 'd it should be such a man . It was an idle thought , and might have vanish 'd : But busy fame , spreading abroad thy praises , Fix 'd it and shap 'd it in my youthful fancy ; Till all my dreams by night , or idle day , Were of the man I saw ride by from Savoy . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf What , did you come to me a lover then ? Giovanna . Giovanna Fear not  --  ' t is past . Altorf . Eberard de Altorf Past ? you lov 'd me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tale is here ! and have I founder 'd Another peace , another virgin heart ? You lov 'd me , and ' t is past ! But I deserve it . Yet wherefore follow me ? why share my fortunes ? Why bear with the unkindness of a man You lov 'd , and love no more . Giovanna . Giovanna Did I say that ? You sure mistook my words . I follow you , Not with a weak and sickly woman 's dotage . Hearts are not won by importunity , Nor , if they were , would one so gain 'd Suffice to do me pleasure . No ! I have followed you For that I saw your stricken soul requir 'd The tendance of a friend , and for I thought You had no friend on earth so true as I. I do not say that I now love you , Eberard , As when you led me blushing to God 's altar , And took my maiden troth . No ! that is gone . The burning flame of love , if left uncherish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love That I do think beyond the love of woman . One that will wear out my poor husband 's days , Or last me to my grave . Altorf .

ACT III . A wild place among the mountains . The Swiss camp visible upon the tops of the rocks in the distance . SCENE I. Enter ROSSBERG , disguised as before . He gives a loud whistle , which is answered by EUSTACE , who suddenly appears among the precipices , and descends them rapidly towards Rossberg . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg His ready answer flatters my best hopes . Eustace , what fare ? Eustace . Eustace My pipe hath served me well : All gather 'd round me , boys and bearded men , And silver headed ancients . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg But de Altorf . Eustace . Eustace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment , Watching my time , I stole from out the crowd , And seating me alone beside his tent , I took my pipe and play 'd a gentle air , That I had sometime heard your daughter play , When Altorf came a wooer to your castle : When he would sit , I saw it more than once With breath restrain 'd , and cheeks all flush 'd with rapture , And eyes that rain 'd down tears : that air I play 'd ; And , to my thought , scarce had I breathed a prelude , When forth unto my side he troubled came ; His cheek was pale , his look most strangely wilder 'd , His eyes suffus 'd with tears : and , when I ceas 'd , Such store of pitying sighs he pour 'd me forth . As if I 'd sent a death-knell o'er his heart . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg He spoke to you ? Eustace . Eustace No ; he but cast his gaze up to the sky , As if he thought the harmonist was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever and anon , Press 'd on his heart his hands . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg He loves her still . Eustace . Eustace A bootless love then : know you he is married ? Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg More hope in that . Love grows with obstacles . Let Hymen weave him chains against his liking . He 'll seek the mistress but to fly the wife . Eustace . Eustace But how would you propose  --  Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg List ! I 'll explain . I 've interest with Austria and Rome : Seduce him from this cause , divorce is easy ; And , tho ' the father be so iced in virtue , The son 's young blood may show some sin to work on . Wealth , honours , love ! Eustace , I 'll have him yet ! Eustace . Eustace But is it worth the risk ? Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg ' T is worth all risk : This Altorf is my kinsman , and my heir . Eustace . Eustace Austria will null the claim . Rossberg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebels prosper : we have learnt The chance is possible . And shall I bear To let the titles and the power of Rossberg Pass from my line into a line of rebels ? For what tho ' Erlach nor his son should claim them , Will not their heirs ? nor need we wait for this . Have not these peasants conquer 'd at Morgarten ? Soon may we see the lands of Austria 's friends O'errun , and ravag 'd by these lawless robbers . No ! we must win their chief , divide their councils : If we can sow dissention in that camp , The day is ours . Eustace . Eustace How have ye hope of this ? Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg Nay , here I look to thee . Caught you no sound Of jealousies , intrigues , of stirring envies ? No quarrel current ! caught you none of this ? Eustace . Eustace Something there was Altorf and young de Rheinthal  --  Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg What ! his wife 's brother ? Eustace . Eustace Yes . And it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of late That they have differ 'd often . Yet the breach , Whate'er it be , I judge nor wide nor deadly . I saw them stand together ; heard them commune , Coldly indeed , yet with much master 'd ease And careless courtesy . Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg I like the news . Take you this paper : ' t is address 'd to Altorf ; Meant for the father , but ' twill serve the son . It is from Austria 's duke , and bears within it Offers of high preferment . Watch your time And throw it where de Rheinthal 's hand may find it . Eustace . Eustace Where shall I meet you ? Rossberg . Rosina de Rossberg Here . Hush ! Some one comes . Hie quickly to the camp . Ere midnight I 'll expect you . Exit severally SCENE II . A young PILGRIM enters and seats himself at the foot of a rock , afterwards ALTORF . Altorf .

His promise past , His flight , my proffer 'd friendship , Rosa 's love , And , stronger yet , his pride and temper chaf 'd By Rheinthal 's passion , and the camp 's suspicion  --  All this must fix him ours .
