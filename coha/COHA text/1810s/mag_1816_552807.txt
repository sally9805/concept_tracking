txt FOR THE NORTH-AMERICAN J*URNAL . On the Fine Arts* There are , perhaps , few subjects more grateful to our na* tional pride , than the progress the fine arts have made Under the genius and industry of our countrymen . There is a welcomeness in the reflection , that we have done something in this elevated department of the mind . We feel that we shall live in the works of art we have accomplished , we shall live in the sentiment which . for ages has consecrated the canvass , which places the ancient painting in close company with the most elevated and venerable mental labours ; which associates the most recent with the most remote age , and which promises to bear us along in perpetual remembrance . We feel a pride in these reflections , because they assure us , we shall not be forgotten : we feel , that when time shall have confirmed the decisions of nature , our age may constitute a venerable antiquity . It is grateful to know , that in the brightest periods of the mind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While some men were giving language to thought , and words to nature , by one species of signs ; others were occupied with giving character to the marble , or perpetuating passing events , by the species of painting then in use . Now , if // with us the arts have preceded literature , it is merely because the peculiar circumstances under which we exist , have prevented great literary enterprise ; nren of genius have not been able to command foreign efforts of art , but have laboured to supply themselves by their own industry and talent . But with all our native spirit , and love of the arts , there has not been yet a great deal done , to keep alive the zeal , or to cherish the affection . Before , however , inquiring into the state of the fine arts among us , it would be well to consider some of the motives which have influenced so many of our artists to leave us , and to make European galleries the depositories of their best works . The inquiry is of some importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , has been yielded to other nations . In England , for instance , patronage has superceded birthright . But who will dispute the title to the fame our artists have been instrumental in bestowing on England ? Is it not a fair exchange , for the protection that country has afforded our own genius ? There are many reasons why our artists should not have remained at home . One , and that involves all the rest , is the youthfulness of the country . From the total want of appropriate institutions in some places , and their infancy in others , we can hardly be said to possess adequate means of cultivating the arts . Our artists have gone abroad to contemplate and study the master works of their favourite art , which were not , and could not be afforded them at home . They have gone abroad , to live under the inspection , the discipline , the influence of men who have devoted their lives to the study of the best specimens of art , and who have been eminent patrons of the arts themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could not support ' the genius we were vigorous enough to produce . I grant that the cry of poverty may have deterred individuals from hazarding a support , for the uncertain immunities of f*.me ; but if we were possessed of the means of inteltectuak*u*pport , our artists would have run the chances of patronage . Another important reaso6 who iir* artists leave us , is , that in this country the publick are somewhat deficient in a refined taste for their labours . The publick with us can not yet discriminate accurately , between the various specimenM of the fine arts presented to them ; we*j*ak here of their comparative merits . The artist mayet*i*w*e fear to trust // *imself , or rather his works , either to inspection or comparison . They may not please by their own merits , and comparison may result in a very unjust and unfortunate award . It is not meant that we want taste , or power of discrimination . Very *ew people among us can be found at all refined , who are not p*eased with just delineations of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real enjoyment of what is true to nature , is founded either in a relish of nature itself , or in an habitual contemplation and study of the best icture landscapes . We may love these without ever haying studied , or even been delighted with the real landscape . but to love them with a genuine and lasting affection , we must have given our hearts in some measure , to the exquisite combinations of the painter . To that rnagick of group . ing , which brings together in perfect harmony , the beauties of the heavens and the earth , the cloud and the mountain , the stream and the wood . The pleasure afforded by works of art , is thus strictly and purely an intellectual enjoymenL It is not merely an instinctive , or natural perception . The ridiculous , the monstrous , the absurd in art , have ever had the most admirers . The genuine lover of nature , and of delineations of nature , must be one who has observed for himself , or studied the observations of others . If he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have received nature at second hand , his criticisms will not be the less correct , if his standards have not been so . He will very often be a better critick than the mere copier of woods or hills , and defect a fault where every branch is in its place , and a thousand , where every cliff is most geographical . ly detailed . In London men love the landscape , and know how to estimate the labours , of Turner . They look at his exquisite skies with delight , not that they have had the most favourable opportunities of studying nature , but chiefly be*anse they have seen fine representations of nature , and are as good criticks of what is natural or not so , as if they had uot inspired the eternal fogs and smoke of the city , but had lived for ever in the woods or fields. * It is not meant here to speak of the perception of what appears after nature in the picture landscape , for many may possess this power , but of the genuine relish of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow , that to enjoy what is truly beautiful in art , it is necessary that the mind be deeply susceptible of what is beautiful , from habitual observation of it . It would // appear , that it is necessary that the mind should have been presented with unequivocal standards of excellence in art , or attentively observed the beautiful in nature . In fine , thai the mind should have been instructed how to perceive , if it may be so expressed , by the previous sanctions of taste , that a given production of the fine arts , is , as far as it is susceptible of perfection , perfect . If then a majority of those who among us at all patronise painting , are only delighted with the reserdAance picture landscapes may bear to their conceptions of nature , but are to a degree unsusceptible of those higher pleasures 9f 1:ste , which flow from a genuine relish and understanding ot the effects of genius , operating on the materials offered it by muture , we have an additional reason for the emigration of our artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means the only , or the most important conclusion , to which the above remarks lead us . If they are true , we are led at once to the great importance of an institution , which shall not merely instruct artists , but which shall in itself give , and improve taste-Which shall in our own country afford our artists , the salutary , corrective influences of sound criticism , which , first acquired by the contemplation and study of the best works of art , shall , in its perfection , be able at once to trace th' faintest approximations to excellence , and to discover and point out every deviation . Perhaps no country ever presented a more noble opportunity , for affording this support to genius than our own . Artists of merit appear every day on the stage ; an honourable pecuniary patronage , it is true , is afforded them , in the purchase of their works . All that they now want are standard works in their profession of study , and men of taste to love , or correct the pro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject has been more insisted on , because it appeared deserving of more regard , than has hitherto been bestowed upon it . Where this kind and degree of cultivation of taste for the arts are entirely wanting , the artist is in some danger , as well as the publick . The publick will ever be easily satisfied , with the decisions of the presently existing taste . Now if early efforts ame admired , and ordy early efforts , the publick may be called upon to be pleased with but indifferent works at best , and the artist in some danger of resting in a medic*ri* i , hich he finds regarded with admiration . Let us for a moment // suppose this state of things to continue here , that the finer details of genius are not introduced from abroad among us , or more distinguished artists do not appear , how slow will be the progress to great excellence , how hardly possible will it be for that excellence to b ' * obtained . It must not be concealed , that the above remarks are true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean in this country to make progress with other nations in the fine arts . If our artists mean to labour with them , they must refer to the same or similar standards , and submit to a similar tribunal . It : nay however be a favourite project with some of our artists , to labour to give their works an original character , and by striving for a species of individuality in their labours , to found a new school in this country . They may turn from examining the specimens of the Flemish school which may lie in their way , which owe so much of their reputation to their admirable delineations of national manners , and calculate on a similar fame with their authors , if they are as successful in their illustrations of the scenery and pastoral life of their own country . But is there not some hazard in indulging a sentiment so honourable in its final cause , as this appears to be ? Have we in fact enough that is peculiar in this country , to trust one 's reputation exclusively to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every variety of surface , and the vegetable productions of all climates . Its mountains are lofty , and its woods majestick-Its lakes are lost in distance , before the eye which would paint them . But would not the landscape painter , who should leave the regions of cultivation , to give his pencil to the simple service of nature , be in some danger of returning to us with his canvass loaded with a thousand woods , or washed by an , interminable sea ? Would there not be some hazard , that amid such luxuriance in nature , such magnificent confusion , an indistinctness of mental vision would be produced , or that the best exertions that genius might make , would be sacrificed to an affected fidelity ? Suppose , on the contrary , that an artist , really possessing distingmished talents , to submit his mind to the instructions which the best efforts of genius afford , to l , ay in fact a foundation in their careful , but independent study , with what clearness of perception , with what powers of discrimination and combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have our pea* santry individuality enough to insui*e the artist , who may // study and delineate their habits , a lasting fame ? Is there enough that is peculiar in their costume , their manners , their customs and features , to enable an observer at once to recognise them in a picture ? The great claim of delineations of this kind , consists in their striking truth ; or in their novelty , their originality . We can ascertain their truth by our knowledge of their originals only . But for them to delight us by their truth and originality , their correctness will perhaps not be taken into the account , they must be new to us , and still bear a resemblance to what has , or does exist . We are interested in the new costume and new countenance , because they in some sort extend our knowledge of human society . And when the foreign artist descends to the detail of the amusements and mechanical occupations , to the domestick economies of his countrymen , we are still more indebted to him for the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short a most interesting historian , of all that most delights us in the outside of human nature . Now many of these sources of interest must be wanting to the native artist , who confines himself to our own country . His pictures will want novelty-They will not extend our knowledge . And unless we have observed the inhabitants of our villages with more than a casual glance , unless we have caught their faint , but distinctive characteristicks , the whole claim of native peculiarity will be wanting , and the painter , for us , will have gleaned them in vain . With all the difficulties , however , that the artist under supposition may be surrounded , it may be worth an effort to do all with the scenes and beings around him , which their nature and characters will enable him to do . If there be not much that is peculiar , if nothing neiV , he will not fail of his reward , or be disappointed of his fame , if he gives us nature as it is , and manners as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lessons which the works of the great masters in landscape teach , he studies our native scenery and manners , his labour will not be the less , because he finds a profusion of materials ; his labour of selection will be the greater , because the objects offered him are the more numerous . His imagination will not be allowed repose , because his eye meets new objects on every side it turns . He must be true , and at the same time original . He must give us time landscape of nature : hut if he means to delight // cultivated taste , his own genius must not be allowed to slumher , and his own invention must labour anong the things which are made . These remarks are suggested , not to depress that honourable enterprise , which would detain a man of real genius among the scenes , or manners of his native country ; they have been made , because these scenes and these manners have been adverted to by some , as the best studies for the young artist , and because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better objects for study , than the management of nature in other countries , which flue picture landscapes consist in , and those delineations of foreign manners , which distinguish I ) eculiar schools . It may have been tho*ght , that the painter of our own country would have an y road to fame . It has been attempted in the above r* ia*ks to show , that the labours of genius are efforts of mind , and that he who seeks for reputation in feeble exertions , or at best but mechanical skill , is in some danger of be:a* disappointed of his fame . He may be a gainer at ho fe , but he viii be a loser abroad ; and above all , his fame will not be safe , even in his own country , provided its maturer age be blessed with a better taste . Having at some length , inquired into some of the inolives which may influence our artists to leave their own country , thc ' question returns upon us , with which these remarks comnenced , what is the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general aniver to this question , we may reply , that we are rich in our treasure of genius , but are somewhat deficient in taste . This may be c.dled a ne*&gt;stive state , and it may be said , that a capacity to produce great works in the fine arts , can only be inferred fron what has been already done , and that if such works exist among us , on our owa principle , their influence must have been , to have given and corrected taste . As imposing however as the reply may seem , and as unsatisfactory as our remarks may appear , a few considerations may shew that they are not altogether unfounded . Some of our best artists , perhaps for the reasons assigned in this paper , have left us . Should any one doubt that they are men of extraordinary powers , they have only to visit for a . uoment the regiotms they now inhabit , and they will return fully satisfied . What modern European gallery is there , which has not been enriched by their works ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who // 201 is he who already seems to have borrowed his mantle of this venerable father ? These are our countrymen , and their works speak to us from abroad , and yield us the fame of genius , if we have been unable to offer in exchange the protection of taste , and of patronage . Mr. West , in a conversation with the writer , remarked , that America was a nursery of artists -- That he , at his advanced age , recollected many a schoolfellow , who discovered at school indications of genius for the fine arts , which , if cultivated , might have challenged for them lasting fame . But that we have genius , we need not go to our countrymen abroad for evidence . In this town , for instance , we have artists who , though purely the children of nature , and the best specimens of the fine arts , for whose contemplation and study are their own works , have , notwithstanding , laboured for an age , beyond their own , and will furnish abundant evidence , that theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of our greatest artists , are , however , beyond our reach , and their salutary influences of course denied us . Thoseofouryounger artists are few in number , and are too much dispersed to afford them beneficial ins tructions . If it therefore he proved , that we are rich in genius , our deficiency in taste is an inductive prol*ability . And this conclusion rests on this simple supposition , that the works of genius , their contemplation and study , are the legitimate sources of taste , and that the reaction of taste , viz. its powerfully corrective influences , are essentially necessary , or at least , among the surest means of the best developeruent of genius itself . If what is contained in these pages be true , if such be the actual state of the fine arts among t is , there is nothing reproachful in the truth , or melancholy in the condition . It would appear ; on the contrary , that there was every thing to excite to the most liberal exertions , and the best grounds for expecting a successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be encouraged , if they are excited to those efforts , which the powerful simulus of the finest works of art would call forth , and to which their constant reference to their own works can hardly be expected to awaken them , we shall not long be deficient in taste , nor our country despoiled of the fame which is her natural and legitimate right . The institution now in contemplation in this place , has all these objects in view , and an effort so hononrable , it is trusted , can not but succeed .
