txt FOR THE NORTH-AMERIcAN JOURNAL . THE following report , * was printed by order of the Legislature for the use of its members . The subject is a very important one , and we have introduced it here , in the hope that those who read it , may feel the necessity of having a building for the use of our learned societies . In Europe , the governments not only build palaces for their libraries and museums , but they bear all their expenses , and give adequate salaries to numerous professors and learned men who have the care of them . Nothing was asked in the present instance but a building , that would afford shelter and security , to extensive libraries and cabinets already existing ; which are constantly exposed to destruction from fire , and which ate so confined for want of room that their increase is checked . The Bill which was introduced , with its amendments , it may safely be pronounced , was the most liberal in its views of any , that has ever been brought before the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but on the contrary , a noble disinterestedness , and superiority to all sordid motives of personal vanity and interest , in the members of these Societies . The Bill provided that the officers of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , the Historical Society , the Agricultural Society , the Massachusetts Medical Society , the Bnston Atheneum , and the Linnean Society should form a body politick and corpoDrawn by the Hon. Mr. Quincy. // rate , by the name of the Massachusetts Institution ; that the State should authorize a loan of 50,000 dollars at 5 per cent . to erect a building , which building should be the property of the Commonwealth-that all these libraries , and collections belonging to these various societies , should be deposited in it . That the Governour , Council , President of the Senate and Speaker of the House for the time being should be perpetual visiters of the Inshiutionthat the members of the Legislature during its sessions , should have free access to all parts of the establishmentthat the Governour , Council and Senators , should each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit and consult the libraries and cabinets  --  and that one nay in the week the library and museum should be thrown open to the publick. - This Bill was refused a third reading in the Rouse , 119 to 12 . But this vote is no criterion of the feeling of the Legislature with regard to this object . It was rejected in the present session not on the ground of its own merits , but as a question of political expediency ; the heavy expenses occasioned by the war have so burthened the State , that in the present condition of the Finances nothing should be done that would increase taxation . When these embarrassments should be removed , all the leading individuals of all parties fully agreed in the powerful claim of these societies , from the services which they had already rendered , and would in future give to the State . The friends of science and literature , and*all those who feel for the honour of the State , may therefore look forward with confidence , to seeing this great and most desirable object obtained at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REPRESENTATIVES , January , 15 , 1816 . ORDERED-That Messrs . TUDOR , of Boston , KNAPP , of Newbu* ryport , and TRAsK , of Brimfield , be a Committee , with such as the ilonourable Senate may join , to make inquiries into the actual state of the following Scientifick arid Literary Societies  --  the American Society of rts and Sciences , the Massachusetts Historical Society , the Linnean Society and the Boston A theneum , and any other Scientifick Societies , that the Committee may find it advisable to include in their investigation ; with leave to report . Sent up for concurrence . TIMOTHY BIGELOW , Speaker . // IN SENATE , January 15 , 1816 . Read and concurred , and the Honourable Messrs . QUINCY and FUL .. LER are joined . JOHN PHILLIPS , President . The committee , appointed to make inquiries into the actual state of the following literary and scientifick SocietiesThe American Academy of Arts and Sciences  --  the Massachusetts Historical Society  --  the Linnean Society-and the Boston Atheneum , and any other scientifick societies , that they might deem it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service ; and , having had a full and free communication with the officers of each of said Societies , in relation to their pecuniary funds , and their other property  --  to the legislative patronage , heretofore extended to any of them  --  and to that , which might yet be wanting for the protection and advancement of their respective interests , ask leave to make the following statement , as the result of their inquiries . The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was established in the year 1780 , in the midst of our struggle for independence . The only legislative patronage it has ever received , besides its act of incorporation , is the permission , which it had to occupy one of the rooms in the present state house , from the time of its building , until the year 1812 , at which time it was removed , for the accommodation of the office of the Adjutant General . Since which lime , their library and collections have been deposited , at a rent of one hundred dollars a year , in a room neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , at every moment , to be ejected , at the will of a landlord . The library of this institution consists of more than twenty-five hundred volumes , many of which are works of great value , and elsewhere , in this country , not to be obtainedconnected with it , is a collection of many rare and valuable mineralogical specimens , of other objects of natural history , and of models of new invented machines , and of the arts . The whole of which has been deposited in a building , exposed , like the common buildings of a city , to the ordinary accidents of fire , and in a situation , in case of the happesing of such an event , as would render any exertion for saving this important property . almost hopeless . The funds of this society are invested in three per cent . and six per cent . stock of the United States , and in a state note of // Massachusetts , the total amount of which stock and note constitutes a nominal principal of three thousand andninety-seven dollars ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars and eighty-five cents , leaving , after deducting one hundred dollars for rent , the net sum of thirty-four dollars and eighty-five cents , to be annually applied for the promotion of the gre at and general objects of that institution . All these funds , such as they are , have been the result of the bequest , benefaction , or voluntary contribution of individuals , and have , in no part , been derived from legislative grant or bounty . The Massachusetts Historical Society was founded in the year 1791 , and , excepting its act of incorporation , has received , from that time to the present , no other legislative patronage , except the grant of the copy right of a map of the state , and which produced the society , after fulfilling all the obligations , which were the condition of the grant , the net sum of three hundred dollars . The library of this society consists of at least three thousand volumes , besides newspapers and manuscripts , and a mineralogical cabinet . All of them articles rare , curious and valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , absolutely , irreparable . The whole connected with the history of our country , and containing evidence relative to the land titles of individuals , which experience has proved is no where else to be found . This precious collection is deposited in the third story over the Arch in Franklin Place , exposed on both sides to fire , and in a situation also , which would preclude all hope of saving them , should such an accident happen . This society , without other patronage from the legislature , than that which is abovementioned , and limited by its charter to consist of only sixty individuals , one third of which are clergymen of extremely restricted pecuniary resources , have been able , by the voluntary contributions and exertions of its members and friends , not only to amass this valuable collection of books and historical documents , but to raise and expend nearly seven thousand dollars in pnblishing and distributing thirteen volumes of historical collections-works of no common interest , and of great publick importance . The present active funds of the society , applicable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // in the hands of their Treasurer , amounting to the sum of fourteen dollars and twenty-eight-cents . The Boston Atbeneum , while , on the one hand , it has at no time received from the legislature any patronage whatsoever , its charter of incorporation excepted , it has on the other , yielded to the Governour and Council , and to the members of both branches of the legislature a full and free a ( lrnission to every right and privilege , in the use of their library , which the proprietors themselves exercise . This library consists , at present , of ten thousand volumes , and , in point of value , is inferiour to none upon the continent , that of Hat yard Uni*'e*'sity only excepted . All this valuable collection of books the state of their funds has obliged them to deposit in a wooden building , in a central part of the town of Boston , connected and surrounded with other buildings of similar materials . Its exposure to loss by fire is , of course , imminent , and excites in the proprietors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library , a proportionable anxiety for its safety . This institution was founded in the year 1807 , by the voluntary contribution of individuals . The whole amount of subscription was forty-two thousand dollars . Of which thirty-two thousand dollars has been expended in the purchase , alterations and repairs of a building , in incidental charges , and in the purchase of books . The sum of ten thousand dollars remains subject to the ordinary purposes of the institution . The income from this balance , being insufficient , with the annual subscriptions of individuals , to meet the ordinary expenditures of the institution , the funds are , on this account , in a gradual state of diminution and decay . The greatness of the sum necessarily invested in a building , precludes the directors of it from making any important addition to their library , and thus one great object of their institution , the gradual accumulation of books , and thus extending the sphere of its usefulness , is in a great measure frustrated . As this institution has , in appearance , the aspect of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to state that it is , both in its origin and on the principles , on which it is conduc ted , almost exclusively , publick . The object of its establishment was to lay the foundation of a great publick library for the use and resort of all our citizens . It is capable of proof that of the one hundred // and fifty indivi*luals , who subscribed the great sum , which constituted its original funds , more than one hundred have never received any personal benefit from it , other than what results to every citizen of the state from the promotion of literature and science . Being merchants , occupied in professional pursuils and having little time to devote to objects of general literature , their subscriptions can be viewed in no other light than that of benefactions , liberally granted on general principles for objects altogether of publick utility . All the citizens of the commonwealth are in fact admitted to the enjoyment of its advantages , upon terms more advantageous than the proprietors themselves , since admittance to annual subscription may be obtained for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital paid for a share in the institution . The Linnean Society is , at present , considered but as branch of the Atheneum . It is , however , one of the most laudable and flourishing institutions of our country . Its object is to collect a museum of natural history , particularly of the ndtive animals , vegetables and minerals of this continent . It has existed only about a year , and the great progress it has made in its collections demonstrates the zeal , intelligence and learning of its members . The present value of this collection may be estimated at four thousand dollars , and it is constantly increasing . The further progress of this interesting institution is , at this moment , checked , by the want of a suitable place of deposit and arrangement . Your committee are induced to say the less concerning the Agricultural Society of Massachusetts , because it has received a patronage from the legislature to the full extent of its wishes . It receives an annual sum from the government , which is expended , exclusively , for purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the nature and objects of which are ascer* tamed previously to the sanction of the expenditure , by a committee of the le*islature . This society has also a library , small in point of number of vohitnes , but important to the agricultural interests of our country , which for want of other place , is now deposited in the Atheneuta , liable to all the exposure to which , as has been stated , the library of that institution is subject . This society has also a considerable number of models of // approved machines for the use of agriculture , many of which have obtai*ed the premiums of the society ; but which , for want of room to exhibit them , are deposited in different places out of the sight and knowledge of the publick , whereby a great part of the advantages contemplated from obtaining them is lost . It ought , perhaps , to be noticed , that of all the officers of these diflerent institutions , not one receives any pay or emolument for his services ; nor have , at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purposes of a private ' , or personal nature . On the contrary , in the discharge of their offices , they are exposed to labour and constant expense . Having thus ascertained the state of those societies , which the order of the senate and house of representatives indicated , your committee deemed it their duty to direct their attention to the mode , in which legislative aid might be given , if any were iequired , for their further encouragement and ad*ancernent . They found on inquiry of the officers of those institutions that at present , no direct contribution to their funds was expected ; but that one object was Lonsidered , unanimously , by those societies , as so important , and essential as to be absolutely indispensable , to the progress of all , and necessary , almost to the existence of some of them . This was a building proof against fire , sufficiently extensive to embrace all the present libraries and collections of the respective societies , and to leave room for that increase and expansion , which was row rapidly advancing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and art was essential not only to their safety , ( since some of them , if lost it was impossible to replace , ) but highly important to the promotion of the general objects , to which all those societies were devoted . Trlieir present dispersed and restricted state cramped the members in all their ope rations ; and by rendering resort to them difficult , in a great measure deprived the publick of the advantages of the use of those libraries and collections , which if properly located they could , with facility , command . Resides , could they be brought under one roof , the resources of each society might be combined in the support of proper persons to superintend the whole establishment , whereby not only access to them would be rendered more general and easy to the publick , but their management more perfect and economical . It was agreed , nri*ni* // mously , by all the societies , that such was the state of their respective funds , and private rnunificen* had been so fre* quently taxed and was so much exhausted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hope of obtaining such a building . This state of the interests of these societies , has led your committee to turn their attention to the duty and interest of the commonwealth , in relation to this sub , je*t and to the means and principles , on which an object of such general importance and concern might be effected . Your committee refrain fom making any remarks relative to the duty and interests of a state to patronize and encourage the exertions of literary men , particularly where these have for their objects the collection and preservation of literary works , and of monuments destined to promote and improve the arts , the manufactures , the agriculture , and the natural and political history of a country . The principles relating to these topicks are so general and to such men as compose the state legislature so familiar , that to repeat them would be useless . For like reasons your committee do not deem themselves justified in recapitulating the examples on the continent of Europe , with which the history of both ancient and modern times abounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , similar in their nature and character . Nor will they recur to the fact , as obvious as it is encouraging , that the greatness and prosperity of states have always been proportionate to the degree , in which publick patronage , of the nature contemplated , has been extended to such institutions . They ask leave , however , to state , one or two facts , in relation to some of our neighbouring states , which may place before the legislature the conduct of cotemporary governments , and exhibit the comparative patronage extended by Massachusetts to these publick objects , in a light well suited to excite a sentiment of honourable emulation ; and which may lead to an enlarged policy , worthy of her political , physical and statistical importance . More than fifteen years since , the state of Pennsylvania grante ( l to Mr. Peale , the proprietor of a private museum , the free use of the whole of their state house and land adjoining , comprising an area and a mass of buildings , which , considering its local situation , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred // thousand dollars . This building he has from that time to the present , occupied free of all rent or interest . An amount of patronage more than thirty times greater , in each year , than the legislature of Massachusetts have ever extended to all the literary societies abovemeritioned , in the whole course of their existence . Yet these societies hai e been engaged in collections , exclusively publick . Whereas those of Mr. Peale were for his own private emolument and directed exclusively to that object , and in which the publick had no farther interest than what results from the general duty of patronizing enterprise and merit ; and the interest , which the legislature of Pennsylvania deemed itself to have in preserving , in the metropolis of that state , a collection of specimens of natural objects at once so useful and valuable . The legislature of New-York , in addition to the tuany and great endowments it has granted to the universities of that state , purchased in 1810 , Dr. Hosack 's bota*ick gai*-den , for which it paid eighty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has granted at two different periods , a sum amounting in the whole to fifty thousand dollars , besides an annuity of five hundred dollars . To the New-York Historical society it granted in 1814 , soon after its establishment , twelve thousand dollars . All the above sums were direct payments out of the treasury of the state . It can not be doubted that both those states have already derived and are deriving a reward equal to the whole value of their liberality , in the encouragement , which , by these and other instances of their munificence , has been given to the arts and sciences , with whose protection and extension the prosperity and reputation of all states are essentially connected . The resort of five hundred medical students to the city of Philadelphia , some of them from the remotest parts of the union , must very materially contribute to the prosperity of the metropolis , and to the reputation and grandeur of the state . Your committee can not here refrain from observing , that the citizens of Massachusetts have been distinguished beyond the citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other state , for the number and amount of their contributions to literary institutions . Yet by a strange fatality , the patronage they have received from the legislature of Massachusetts is incomparably less than that , which // similar institutions have received from the legislatures of other states . To this it may be said , and truly , that none of these institutions have ever , heretofore , directly applied to this l*islature for such patronage . And it is on the present occasion a fact , peculiarly grateful to your committee , that this investigation originated wholly from the liberal suggestion of the legislature , without any solicitation from those societies . A circumstance , which can not fail to render any patronage it may see fit to bestow , doubly gratifying to those societies , as well as honourable to the state . Your committee have therefore deemed it lheii ' duty to suggest to the legislature , the expediency of adopting measures for concentrating as soon as possible those societies , their libraries and collections , * in one central and convenient place , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property of the state , and the use of which should be granted to these societies upon certain distinct principles . For the purchase of the land and erecting a building sufficiently safe and capacious for the objects proposed , the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars was deemed requisite , and in the opinion of all the officers of those societies would be adequate . In relation to the mode in which such a sum could be obtained , three courses were suggest ed : - The grant of eastern land ;  --  a lottery ;  --  and the permission to raise , on the credit of the commonwealth , the requisite amount at an interest of five per cent . Should the le*islatnre be of opinion that the interests of the commonwealth required that the property of these institutions should be taken under its protection , it seemed desim able that as little ( lelay as possible should be permitted to occur before it was extended . For such a purpose , the grant of eastern land was dilatory and inefficient . The same objections occurred to the proposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this mode of raisins funds for publick purposes . It resulted , that either the idea of efficient protection for these monuments of science and the arts must be abandoned , or a resort be had to the proposition for a loan . As your commit lee were satisfied that this was the only mode boUt practicable and efficient , they have deemed it their duty to present a bill modified upon that principle , for the consideration of the // legislature ; and also embracing principles , not only extendin* protection and encouragement to the property and exertiot1s of these societies , but securing to the state privileges in relation to them , highly beneficial and important . Your committee will no ' conceal , that , in common with other members of the legislature , they feel a repugnance at the idea of a debt to be createt Yet a little consideration has made it apparent to them that this debt will be scarcely- more than nominal , and that it is justified by maxims of prudence as well as by calculations of publick profit . The debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be invested in lands and buildings , which are to be the property of the commonwealth . The amount of the actual burden will be five and twenty hundred dollars a year , for so long a time as the state shall permit these societies to enjoy the occupation of the building . In return for whi&amp;h patronage , the libraries , the collections , the monuments of the arts abovementioned , will be rescued from their present state of insecurity , and comparative inutility , and placed in a condition not only of safety , but of increast , d usefulness . All these , are , in name , the property of these societies , but in fact , the whole is publick property , expressly devoted upon the most liberal principles to publick use ; of which these societies are but trustees for the commonwealth . In the present situation of these libraries and collections , exertion is in a great degree deprived of its stimulus , by the dan*er to which they are exposed , as well as cramped for want of room suitable for their deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be questioned that the natural and inevitable increase of this publick property under such new and favourable auspices . would , in the course of ten years , greatly exceed the whole amount of the principal and interest of the expenditure contemplated ; without taking into consideration , the irreparable nature of the loss , if for want of the proposed protection they should be destroyed ; and without making any estimate of the honour , which would result to the common wealth should they , thus , be protected . Under impressions of this kind , your committee ask leave to report the annexed bill for the consideration of the legislature . By order of the Committee , JOSIAH *4U1NCY , Chairman .
