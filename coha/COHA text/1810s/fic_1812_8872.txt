Stran . Stranger Ah ha ha , then you went a courting last night , that accounts for your being so confounded cross to day . This country way of courting turns one upside down for a day or two .

Stranger Well , well , we wo n't wrangle about that ; but I wish you would let me know where your master is . I have come four miles out of my way to bring this letter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay me for't . Enter Pufpace . Puf . Pufpace Jake why the dogs ha n't you to work ? Three o'clock and here you are lounging in the house like a drone . Jake . Jake Master Pufpace , here is some body wants to see you . Puf . Pufpace Ah like enough ; I am full of business . Jake , you stop at Lawyer Quicksite 's and tell him to call over here immediately , to go with me to neighbour Meanel 's and make enquiry for the horse : I expect some rascal has stole him . Jake . Jake Yes , yes , yes , daddy , I will tell him  --  going . Puf . Pufpace Jake , here . Is the mill-pond frose hard enough so that we can cross ? Jake . Jake Yes , I came over this morning . Puf . Pufpace Ah the dogs then , you went a galling last night . I told you not to go but once a fortnight ; you'l be nodding and droaning about all day . Yes , loud souls , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jake . Jake A n't I got a beard , a n't I going to have a wife . I 'll go and see honest cloudy Molly as often as I am a mind to , old daddy . Puf . Pufpace Ah you have had your head too much , you scoundrel , yes you have , in fact you have . To the stranger . Well sir , what is your business with me ? Stran . Stranger Is your name Jacob P. Pufpace , sir ? Puf . Pufpace Why that was my name when I was christened . Stran . Stranger Is that not your name now , sir ? Puf . Pufpace Why I 'll tell you good friend  --  they are always plaguing the rich with titles and commissions , &c.; Our company of soldiers , that is , our militia soldiers , close me , because I have such a good voice and step so well takes out his watch it is half past 3  --  notwithstanding , &c.; that I am pretty old they chose me captain . So eversince , altho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty expensive and take up some time , &c.; yet they call me Captain Jacob P. Pufpace , Esq . Stran . Stranger Excuse me Captain Jacob P. Pufpace , Esq . but it seems you are not quite portly enough for Captain and Esquire too . Puf . Pufpace Ah clouds souls I know that and it fills me with mortification . I have tried every way to get a little fresh on my bones , and to make my belly as big as Esquire Seavens . Last year was an excellent year for potatoes . I had a thousand bushels , or so , of good rusty coats , yes I had , and I ate about a peck at a meal for a fortnight together ; but , notwithstanding , &c.; I could not perceive my belly grow a bit . a noise is heard without . Well , I believe the Lawyer is coming , I must be in haste ; what is your business with me , sir ? Stran . Stranger I have a letter which , I suppose , belongs to you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who desired me to deliver it to you myself . I promised him I would , and have come 4 miles out of my way to fulfil it . Puf . Pufpace A young gentleman at Cambridge , reads . Mr. Jacob P. Pufpace . Ah yes this letter is directed to me ; but I 'll warrant you the man who sent it do n't want to borrow money , or he would have put the Esquire to it just to do me a little honor , &c.;  --  yes , yes , he would have said on the back , Captain Jacob P. Pufpace , Esq . Yes laud souls , people , when they want to borrow money are very careful to give me my proper title , yes they be . It would make you laugh sir , to hear how many ways they speak to me  --  some say Captain Pufpace , same Esquire Pufpace , some say Colonel Pufpace , and some say Rev. Mr. Pufpace , &c.; &c.; yes they do . Stran . Stranger Yes , and some call you skinflint , crabstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aside . Esquire Pufpace , I suppose you will consider me a little for my trouble in bringing you the letter . Puf . Pufpace Reads . Kind Father . Oh the draggon , this letter is from my son at College , I 'd warrant thebooby wants money , ( reads . ) Ah laud souls yes , money , money , money , the blockhead will undo me . He spends more in one quarter at College than I do in five years . after a pause , an extravagant villain . Laud souls yes I gave , I gave him ten dollars when he was at home , about three months ago , and now the spendthrift wants more . The world has got to a strange pass , yes , yes ; in fact the world is upside down , but I will soon turn it back again with my son , yes I will ; he shall live as I live , and wear such clothes as I wear . Oh the draggon , I know how it is , he must go into company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while I am here to work with all my might to get something aforehand , he is spending it in this unuseful way . Why it is more healthy to live as I do . Half peck of potatoes a day is enough for any man . If my son would take pattern by me I could lay up something handsome ; I should grow rich apace , so that if Bonaparte should come over to fight us , notwithstanding , &c.; that I am pretty old , they would choose me , that is by way of honor , they would choose me to command the army . Enter Lawyer . Well Esquire Quicksite I have been waiting some time . I wish you to take good care that you proceed exactly by law ; there is so many rogues and spendthrifts about now , that , it stands us in hand , I say Esquire , it stands us in hand , who have money , to take care of it , yes in fact it does . I have just received a letter from my son at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him know that my money was got too hard to be thrown away , yes I will . Esq . Quicksite Why sir , you cant expect to give your son a polished education , without parting with some of your money  --  all the time the Lawyer has been in the house , he has been looking over his papers Here sir , I have prepared the writings as far as I was able , without seeing you . I do not comprehend the matter fully , and should like to see you and Mr. Meanell together , before I commence a process . Puf . Pufpace Why , the thing is plain enough ; five years ago Meanell owed me 500 dollars , and I wanted to be secure , and I made him give me a mortgage deed of his farm . The mortgage was up last night , and I mean to take possession to day , yes I do . Esq . Quicksite Well , but Mr. Pufpace you do not mean to take possession of the whole farm for 500 dollars . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm  --  why not  --  it is lawfully mine . Esq . Quicksite Yes , but it 's not honestly yours .  --  Mr. Meanell is an industrious man . It would be cruel to distress him . He was very imprudent to give a deed of the whole for so trifling a sum . Puf . Pufpace Yes , yes , I know that , but he was obliged to comply with my terms , or pay the cash down . The one he would not do , therefore he was obliged to do the other . Why there 's no cruelty about it ; if he had paid the money before the time was up , he might have saved the farm . Esq . Quicksite Perhaps he intended to take up the mortgage still . Puf . Pufpace But it is now too late . Esq . Quicksite Perhaps it slipt his mind . If he pays the money to day I presume you will not be so hard hearted as to take the advantage , that the law gives you . You know Mr. Pufpace , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mine . If he or you or any body wants the farm and will pay me 2500 dollars , cash down for it , they may have it . Laud souls , I a n't under obligation to give Meanel a farm , nor any body else . Why to be sure , I wish neighbour Meanel well , yes I do squire , I wish him well , yes yes . Esq . Quicksite So it seems .  --  Come , sir , let us go to the office . Exuent . Stran . Stranger ( Looks after him till he is quite gone . ) Well , I have heard of the devil upon two sticks , but I am sure I never saw his worship before , and when I go 4 miles out of my way to carry his excellency a letter , I presume he will have so much compassion on a poor weary traveller , as to make him some kind of compensation ; either by asking him to eat , drink , or , at least , to sit down and rest himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has so many names  --  but if this for of Belzebub , in his flutter should come back and find me here , he might take it into his head to charge me room rent , just to do himself a little honor  --  and therefore , &c.; to use his own phrase , it is best for me to make off . Exit . Re-enter Stranger , Charles and Uncle . Char . Charles Strange , strange , but did not my father offer you any thing for your trouble . Stran . Stranger No , sir , he did not so much as inquire if it had put me to any trouble , or not . Char . Charles How far have you come out of your way ? Stran . Stranger About 4 miles , sir . Char . Charles Here , sir , take that , it is all the money I have at present  --  perhaps at some future day I shall be able to compensate you more amply . Stran . Stranger A great plenty , a great plenty , sir , I thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on my way , good by , takes his hand . Char . Charles Stay one moment , sits down and writes a billit . Altho ' I am at home , yet I can not order things as I would ; it is my misfortune , sir , to have a father who is governed more by avarice , than by the dictates of reason . Please to take this , and by calling at the next Inn , and giving it to the Landlord , you will be furnished with what you wish to eat and drink , at my expence . Stran . Stranger Sir , you are very kind indeed . Exit . Char . Charles My peculiar situation in life , you know uncle Goodel , has often obliged me to call on you for advice . Uncle . Uncle Yes , Charles , that is very true . Char . Charles I hope , sir , I have not been a burthen to you in that respect . Uncle . Uncle By no means , it is always a pleasure to advise , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why what have you now , Charles , that you wish to consult me about ? I hope , you will never hesitate to advise with me upon any subject , and at any time ; if you do , you will deprive me of a great source of happiness . I had the greatest regard for your dear mother , nor shall I have less for her son , while he behaves with that circumspection , for which he is so much distinguished . Char . Charles I hope you are not flattering me Uncle . Uncle . Uncle No Charles , I shall be as ready to censure you , when your conduct is censurable , as I am now to praise you . Char . Charles Is it not disobedience to parents a crime ? Uncle . Uncle It certainly is . Char . Charles Well , sir , is it not a crime to let one of our fellow mortals perish with hunger or cold , when it is in our power to relieve them ? Uncle . Uncle Indeed it is one of the greatest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see any in distress . You know , Uncle , my father has often forbid me giving away a cent to any one . Uncle . Uncle Why , when parent 's commands are unreasonable , I humbly confess , children are not under obligation to obey them : For instance , if your parents should command you to cut off your own head or your neighbour 's , or to refrain from eating or drinking , on in short , in doing any thing whereby your health or happiness , or that of your fellow creatures would be endangered , I believe you are not in duty bound to obey them . This is a delicate subject , and when I have a more convenient , opportunity I will enter more fully upon it . But what made you introduce this subject  --  why do n't you come to the point at once ? Char . Charles I will , Uncle ; about three weeks since , as I was on my way from Cambridge to Millborough , just before I entered the pine woods , I saw a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross road . He made signs to me to stop ; as I accordingly did , after some hesitation . Uncle . Uncle Why did you hesitate ; this poor man I suppose  --  why did not you go to him ? Char . Charles Why , Uncle ; he was coming towards me on horse back , upon the full trot , and I did'nt know but he had some evil designs upon me . However , I waited ' till he come up , when after paying the usual compliments of strangers , he gave me his story of what he had met with the preceding night  --  Uncle . Uncle Ah ! he met with a robber , I suppose , and lost all his money  --  poor man .  --  Ah , I wish I had been with him , I would have knocked the dog 's head to pieces , like a glass bottle  --  a rascal  --  a villain . Char . Charles No , no , he did not meet with a robber , Uncle , he  --  Uncle . Uncle Ah , fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay out in the snow all night . Poor man , I would have carried him a mile on my back . Char . Charles Oh no , be did not break his leg . When he entered these woods , the night before , he missed his way  --  Uncle . Uncle Ah , the poor man travelled all night thro ' the swamps , exposed to the wild beasts , or fell into some hole and be drowned or froze . Why do n't the town have guide boards ? they ought to be fined . Char . Charles Why it was one of the best things that ever happened Uncle . Uncle . Uncle What is that  --  the poor man got lost . Why I suppose he has a family . How would his dear wife and children have mourned , if he had perished ; poor woman and poor children ;  --  I would have taken them all into mine own house . Poor children they would have cried ' till this time . Poor woman , what a misfortune , to loose her dear husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever happened . Char . Charles Why it was the means of saving a poor woman and her children from perishing , uncle . Uncle . Uncle Ah terrible ! he found them in the snow or lost in the woods . Char . Charles Oh no , Uncle ; if you wont interrupt me , I will tell you the whole story . Uncle . Uncle Well , go on then  --  sits down in his chair . Char . Charles Directly after unfortunately leaving the main road he came to a public house , where he tarried all night . Early the next morning he went on his way , expecting soon to reach the main road . But mistaking the directions of the Landlord , he took a wrong road and after passing on for some hours , without seeing any inhabitants , he , at last come to a very small house  --  alighted from his horse  --  called at the door , with an intention to enquire , but , hearing a very low inarticulate found from within , opened the door , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost distress . He begged of me , if I had one spark of humanity left , to fill my Portmanteau with some kind of cordials and provisions , which could be obtained from a shop hard by , and go to her relief . I went immediately to the house and found the family in a more deplorable situation , if possible , than was represented . She was a young woman about 25 years old  --  the picture of despair . She had two daughters , one 7 the other 5 years old , fiting by her side on the hearth  --  her little son in her arms , sick of a fever . The house was open in many places , and the weather was extremely cold . She had no wood but two little sticks , which were almost consumed . She looked me full in the face , but gave me no answer , when I asked her a question , but often cast her eyes , which were red with weeping , on her pale son and half starved daughters . I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portmanteau , offered her all the money I had in my pocket , but she refused it by shaking her head .  --  Ah heavens , uncle , it was too late , money would not do . She was unable to move herself from her feat ; and her little girls were so imaciated with cold and hunger , that , had they been old enough , they would not been able to have obtained any assistance with their money . She told me afterwards that she had then taken her son in her arms , placed her little daughters by her side expecting they must all soon perish . In a moment I bethought myself of my Portmanteau and instantly took out the contents for their relief . I took off my great coat and put it over her shoulders and told her I would return . I went directly to Mr. Bickard 's , a friend of mine , and hired a convenient room . I took a close carriage with two women and removed the poor woman and her children , the same day , to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sick child . In doing which I spent all my money , and was unable to pay the bills which became due at College . I therefore wrote my father for more , but fearing the letter by some accident might miscarry , I have come myself ,  --  but dare not see my father . I know my father will be angry with me , and instead of money , give me one of his philosophical lectures , as he calls them , and send me away entirely destitute .  --  Now , uncle , I wish you totell me , candidly , whether I have done right or wrong ; then I shall know the better how to proceed with my father . Uncle . Uncle Philosophical lectures . He must be worse than a savage , to find fault with your conduct this time . I am happy , very happy to hear you cherish such good principles . Whether you have done right or wrong does not admit a doubt . Char . Charles I know I have done right , but the difficulty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped me many times , in my younger days , for giving a little beer and piece of bread to a poor traveller , who was about starving . Uncle . Uncle Poor creature ; why did you not fend him to my house , poor creature , met with some misfortune , no doubt , why did you not give him something to eat and drink ? Char . Charles I did , uncle , and got a found drubbing for't . Uncle . Uncle Ah , we have too many among us whose minds are tinctured with those abominable doctrines , which are a disgrace to human nature . We must govern ourselves by the dictates of reason and conscience , rather than by the whims of avarice . This insatiable thirst of gain , brings a man almost on a level with the beasts . Enter Jake without observing them , and sings . Jake . Jake Tol de doll , foll de toll , dol de doll , observing , Luckers whimping , whimping . Why is this you Charles ? Char . Charles Why Jake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , who the dogs , I did'nt think of seeing you here ' till New Year 's day . Uncle . Uncle Well , Charles , I must go . I shall expect you at my house before you return . In the mean time , I will take the matter into consideration , and be ready to advise you how to proceed . Char . Charles I will , sir .  --  Well Jake , what is the news ? Jake . Jake News . No news  --  tatoos enough  --  rather scant o n't for old coniac cider . Char . Charles Well , how do they do at Mr. Meanel 's . Jake . Jake Aye yei , aye yei , Mr. Charles , aye yes . I know what you mean , you want to know how his daughter Eliza does ; that 's right , she is a fine girl . Char . Charles Why , I want to know how they all do . Jake . Jake Butter my boots , pegs and all . Now Charles , I , I seriously and truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole world , But some says she is a little proud , tho ' she is always a reading or at work .  --  Some folks say she 's turning christian , for she stays at work for her father as steady as a deacon . Char . Charles Well , are they all well there ? Jake . Jake After a pause . Why some thing pretty bad happened there this morning . Char . Charles Ah , what was that ? Jake . Jake Why , that old crabstick of a fellow , your father and my master , took it into his crabbid old head to take away Meanwell 's farm from him  --  an old scurvy booby . Char . Charles Indeed !  --  Where is my father ? Jake . Jake I left him in the orchard counting his apples . Exit Charles  --  Oh , I wish every body was as clever as Charles  --  fags , he is no more like his father than stick your hand in the fire  --  there . Let 's see , I must take a little cider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go without , takes his bottle and drinks , hears a noise , hastes the bottle away and exit . ACT II . Enter Pufpace and son . Puf . Pufpace You must remember , son , that money is hard to be got , and I have to work hard  --  live poor  --  wear poor clothes  --  rise early  --  set up late  --  and after all , it seems as tho ' I could'nt get any thing aforehand . You must be sparing , son , you must be sparing . But how much money do you want this term ? Char . Charles Why , sir , my expences were much greater than usual . At the approach of winter I was obliged to get some new clothes . Here , sir , is a bill of my expences since the term commenced , which was the 23d of September . Pof . Pufpace Thirty dollars ! Oh the draggon , this wont do , this wo n't do . You have got to be a prodigal 's son , in fact , yes you have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when you was at home before ? Char . Charles Why , I hope , sir , you will think I made good use of it . There was a poor woman in the town who seemed destitute of friends and every thing that was necessary to preserve life  --  Puf . Pufpace And so you gave her that money . Char . Charles Yes , sir . Puf . Pufpace Oh you scoundrel  --  what business have you to give away my money ; have I not forbid you time and again ? A fine time a day , give away my money to every vagabond you meet . Oh laud souls , I shall be the poorest man in the town at this rate  --  yes , and you must needs get fine clothes  --  oh you blockhead . Char . Charles I have ever meant to do that which is right , and if I do not , I should wish to be told of it in rather smoother terms . AS for clothes , I could not appear decent not comfortable without them . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , you would have some reason to be angry with me ; and as for giving away money , sir , I will always relieve the unfortunate , the sick and needy , whenever it is in my power . I have often felt the sting of your whip for doing my duty . Puf . Pufpace Duty , you blockhead . Char . Charles Yes , sir , it is the indispensible duty of the rich to relieve the distresses of the poor , and no threat or whip shall ever deter me from fulfiling it . Puf . Pufpace Ah hah , ah hah  --  I know how it is , you have been hearing your tutors talk religion  --  if that 's all you learn at College , you had better stay at home .  --  Learn to give away money ha ; and wear fine clothes , ah hah , fine time a day . Come come , I know what must be done , you must stay at home and go to work with Jake . Char . Charles I am willing to do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my duty toward my fellow creatures . But if you do not let me return , you must pay my bill at College . Puf . Pufpace Not a farthing , unless I am obliged to , by law . Jake .  --  Calls.  --  If they were fools enough to trust a poor boy , they may get their pay as they can . Jake . Calls again . Jake . Jake Here . Char . Charles No , there will be no need of going to law , if I go to work I can pay the bill myself . Puf . Pufpace Yes , yes , but mind , you are going to work for me . Jake  --  Calls Louder . Jake . Jake Here . Enter Jake . Puf . Pufpace Jake it seems you are deaf . Go and call lawyer Quicksite here . Jake . Jake That all , old daddy ? Puf . Pufpace All , yes ; go quick . Jake .

Jake Lawyer Quicksite you must come in and see my  --  Puf . Pufpace None of your nonsense you scoundrel . Char . Charles I will go , sir .  --  Exit Charles . Puf . Pufpace Jake you have got rather too saucy , too saucy , yes you have . Jake . Jake Oh no. you 're mistaken master Pufpace , you know I like to have a little fun , once in a while ; but I never mean to be saucy ,  --  au  --  au  --  master Pufpace , I have got something in my head which I want to communicate into your head . Puf . Pufpace Communicate  --  do n't try to be so learned  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why it is one thing you know to appear to be a fool , and another thing really to be one . But what I was going to tell you , was , I think it will be better for you , as well as me , to live a little better . I can perceive that you fail every day . See , master , you are all pined away to nothing ; I think you look pale to what you did ; only see your legs ; ah , master , they are just such legs as my father had , when he died with the consumption . Why , only see , you are nothing but skin and bones ! Besides I heard the Doctor say , the other day , he thought you looked very low . Puf . Pufpace Ah , Jake , I am not so easily frightened as you are ; you tell about my little legs , why it is no matter how small they are , if they are stout and strong : why butter it all , I am almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dances about . Jake . Jake Oh no , there you are mistaken again .  --  Kicks about too , and as if by accident throws the old man down . An accident master Pufpace , an accident . Puf . Pufpace Yes , you blockhead , but it was done a purpose , and you had like to have broke my back . Enter Lawyer Quicksite . Lawyer Quicksite , I want to know a point in law . Law . Quicksite Well , sir . Puf . Pufpace My son has been running me in debt , and I want to know if I must pay the charge by law . Law . Quicksite It depends on circumstances . What articles did he purchase , sir . Puf . Pufpace New fine clothes , an extravagant villain ; he has got to be as proud as Lucifer .  --  To Jake.  --  You must take care how you kick me about , you had like to have broke my back .  --  To Lawyer.  --  Yes , the proud villain got fine clothes , and without my consent too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe you are responsible for all the lawful debts that your son contracts .

Quicksite Cry him down . Puf . Pufpace Well then , I will cry him down . You mean to put a piece in the paper , forbiding all persons trusting him , and the like of that . Law . Quicksite Yes , sir ; but you must remember Mr. Pufpace such an advertisement would materially injure your son 's character , in the opinion of that part of the publick in which your character and his are not truly known . They will suppose him to be a vagrant , a sot , a villain or some other ignominious character ; for it is not to be expected that any person , and especially a parent , will expose one 's character , in the publick prints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enormous crimes in a servant , unwarrantable deeds in a wife , and insufferable misdemeanors in a child , as Blackstone expresses it .

I 'll forbid the world to trust him any more , yes I will . Law . Quicksite You had better not be too hasty Mr. Pufpace , you will ruin your son in this way , and he is a very promissing young man . Puf . Pufpace Yes yes , he promises fair to spend all I am worth , yes yes ,  --  thirty dollars in three months .  --  Come write me an advertisement ; I 'll put an end to his prodigality , yes I will . Law . Quicksite Mr. Pufpace you surprise me . I thought at first you was jesting , but since you are not , let me tell you , I shall not write any such advertisement . I will not be an instrument in ruining so good , so virtuous a young man . But , Mr. Pufpace , you 're too hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pufpace Ah , I 'll take care of that . I can make him work . Law . Quicksite You ca n't oblige him to work . Besides you will have to maintain his family ; for by such a rash step you will sink his spirits irrecoverably , and give a deadly blow to that laudable ambition , for which he is so much distinguished ; and thereby render him incapable of providing for himself or family . Puf . Pufpace He sha n't have a family , no in fact he sha n't . Law . Quicksite Sha n't have a family !  --  Let me tell you , sir , it is not in your power to hinder him ; and if I am rightly informed , the is in a fair way to have one in a few years . Puf .

By the devil , the slut a n't worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worle for that . Besides it will happen just right ; you have just cheated her father out of a large estate , and it is no more than justice that you be obliged to maintain his daughter . Puf . Pufpace Ah I know what must be done . It is well ? have a little sense of my own . I know what must be done . Law . Quicksite Well , sir , you must do as you please . But I am surprised to hear a man of your property talk so unreasonable . You have money enough , and enough  --  spare a little to your son ; for a little is all he wants  --  he is remarkably frugal , and spends not a cent unnecessarily . Spare him this little and let him return to College , and he will make a citizen that will do honor to his Father and his Country . Puf .

Meanel Harry here , take this letter and carry it directly to Mr. Pufpace.  --  ( Giving him a letter . ) Har . Hardy That old leather briches man , that eats so many potatoes ? Mean .

( A knocking at the door . ) Mean . Meanel See who is at the door . Enter Lawyer . Law . Quicksite Mr. Meanel , your most obedient , how is your health to day , sir . Mean . Meanel Why low , very low indeed , sir . The pain in my back last night was excessive . I am wholly unable to go out , which is very unfortunate for me , at this time , as I have some business to transact with Mr. Pufpace , which ought to have been done yesterday . But as my disorder rendered it impossible for me to leave my room , I hope he will consider me and not take the advantage , which the law , by this delay , has put in his hands . Law . Quicksite I was informed of your indisposition this morning , and tho ' I wished to meddle with other folks business as little as possible , I thought it my duty , as a neighbour , to give you the earliest information of Mr. Pufpace 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you desired it , to lend you my advice and assistance . Mean . Meanel Mr. Pufpace 's determination ! Is it possible he can be so cruel as to take the advantage of me for only one day 's delay . The money is all ready for him . Law . Quicksite He sent for me this morning with a design to come and take possession . This business with his son , who has unexpectedly come home , may prevent his puting into execution his cruel design to day . But I am confident , unless something is done to prevent it , he will take possession of your farm to-morrow . Mean . Meanel Is it possible ! Mr. Quicksite , is it possible , that Mr. Pufpace can be so cruel . I was this moment going to send him a line , requesting him to call and receive his money . Law . Quicksite Well , sir , send the line , and I will do all in my power that he takes no advantage of you . Mean . Meanel Do , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  Go carry this letter  --  ( To Lawyer )  --  and the situation of my family , should I be taken away , and I can not stay here a great while , my disorder increases daily . Should I be called out of this painful world , and Mr. Pufpace takes possession of what little property I have , by industry , accumulated , what would become of my poor child  --  my dear Eliza  --  left a beggar , without a father or mother !  --  Oh Mr. Quicksite you have children , you know how to feel for me on this occasion . How can I leave her , poor creature , fatherless , motherless and pennyless.  --  ( Affected . ) Law . Quicksite Depend upon it , sir , I will do all in my power for you and your amiable child . Mean . Meanel Mr. Quicksite , one word more . I have something of a confidential nature , which I think you ought to know before you proceed to measures in this business . It is something also of a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stand to each other , and the honorable principles by which I believe you always to be actuated , I can proceed to tell you without a blush . Two years ago Charles Pufpace called on me to obtain permission to visit my daughter .  --  From the knowledge I had of him , I did not hesitate to grant his request . He has visited my house ever since , and they appear to be very happy in each others company . I have reason to fear that Eliza 's affections are deeply rooted in this young man , and should this affair with his father operate to break the match , my daughter will be miserable , and my unhappiness will be complete . Law . Quicksite Mr. Meanel , I have a daughter too  --  I know how to feel for you on this occasion . I will not give over ' till your grieveances are in a more favourable train , and your fears done away . Pufpace is old , ignorant and wicked . I never knew such a one but that a lawyer could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or argument . And as for young Charles , I will vouch for his honor and constancy . There is not his superior in the circle of my acquaintance . Compose yourself , I will return soon , and let you know the result of my endeavours . Exit . Mean . MeanelSolus . All this may be , and it may not be . Lawyers , sometimes , do great things . But a wicked unprincipled miser , what wo n't he do , when it is in his power ?  --  ' T is in Pufpace 's power to undo me  --  to take away my last penny , and to deprive my daughter of her bosom friend . Oh my dear child , if all this takes place what will become of you . In a short time , perhaps a few days , you must follow me to the grave . Then , oh , unhappy child , your parents in their graves , your little fortune stolen from you by an heaven daring Miser ; and to crown the whole , and make your misery complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your arms . Oh Eliza  --  soon you will be  --  fatherless , motherless , pennyless and friendless . Dear Eliza , my grey locks will go down to the grave in sorrow .  --  Sits down in his chair and weeps . Enter Eliza . Eliza . Eliza Papa , will you come out to dinner . Papa what is the matter , are you more unwell .  --  Goes to him.  --  What , weeping ! What is the matter papa ?  --  Turns away , and them turns to him again.  --  Dear papa what is the matter , are you more unwell ?  --  Pulls away his hankerchief.  --  What shall I do  --  shall I get you some drops , papa ?  --  What does all you  --  what shall I do for you ?  --  Dear papa , why wo n't you tell me what I shall do for you . I 'll call Molly .  --  Calls . Enter Molly . Molly here is papa , sying and weeping bitterly , and I ca n't make him say a word to me.  --  Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa are you more unwell . Do try to make him speak Molly . Mol . Molly talks very low and earnest to Eliza , but so as not to be understood . Eliza . Eliza Papa shall we send for the Doctor . Mean . Meanel takes away his hankerchief.  --  No , I am somewhat better to day . Mol . Talks again to Eliza , so low as not to be understood . Eliza . Eliza Papa why do you moarn so much for Mama ? you can not bring her back again . Mean . Meanel No , my dear child , I do not want to bring her back again . She has gone to that world , from whose bourn no traveller can return . I have no reason to doubt of her being happy ; and , therefore , do not wish her to revisit this troublesome world ; where Knaves and Villains will make us miserable in spite of all our honest exertions to be happy . I expect soon to follow . Eliza . Eliza Why , papa , we must all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let that trouble you so much . You may live many years yet , papa . Mean . Meanel ' T is not the thought or fear of dying that troubles me , but the thought of leaving you , my dear child , without a father to protect you . Eliza . Eliza Is there nobody who can protect a woman but a father ? Who protected mamma ; her parents died a great many years ago . Mean . Meanel Ah  --  a husband  --  but girls ca n't always obtain a husband , when they please ; at least one that would protect them . I know your expectation but in this mutable world all things are uncertain , and Charles may find some young lady more worthy of his affections , or his father may force him to leave you . If you are disappointed in a husband , what will maintain you ? Eliza . Eliza Why , I am sure papa , what you will leave me , with my own industry , will maintain me genteelly , if I do n't get married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the cause of my trouble to day . Mr. Pufpace has a mortgage deed of my farm ; the mortgage was out yesterday . It is now in his power to take the whole farm ; the mortgage was not a sixth part of its value . I can not say , possitively , that he will put his threats into execution . But if he should , we should be reduced to the most abject poverty . I am past labour . How shall we get the comforts of life , and when I am gone , what will become of you , fatherless , motherless , pennyless , and , for aught I know , friendless ? Eliza . Eliza While I can use these singers , papa , you shall not want the comforts of life . I expect to be left fatherless and motherless , but I can not believe that Mr. Pufpace will take away our farm ; for if he has no regard for conscience , I think he will have some feeling and regard for his only child ; but even if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall not be of a father 's blessing , which is far preferable . I beg , papa , you would not trouble yourself about me ; I have many friends , and some that will be more than a friend to me . Mr. Pufpace ca n't live forever  --  Charles is sole heir to his estate , papa .  --  Pensively . Mean . Meanel Ah , Eliza , you argue the case very well , and I hope you will not be disappointed , in your expectations ; but it is the part of wisdom to be always prepared to have our most sanguine expectations destroyed . This world is full of changes . The cloud no bigger than the hand often thickens to a tempest . The pleasantest morning , is sometimes followed by the darkest night . Eliza . Eliza Yes , but papa , you have always told me , that all events took place under the inspection of Deity , and , therefore , whatever misfortune befalls us , we ought cheerfully to submit . Mean . Meanel I tell you the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your mind , ' till you need them to support you . Exit . Eliza . Eliza Well , Molly , what do you think of all this , do you think that Charles will prove inconstant ? Mol . Molly I do n't know what Charles will do , but if Jake proves inconstant to me , I 'll pull every lock of hair out of his head , yes I will  --  I 'll make his old head look like a blue dye tub . Enter Jake , puffing and blowing . Jake . Jake Lack ladies , how fare ye . I am almost dead . Eliza . Eliza Why Jake , what is the matter ? Jake . Jake Why , old crabstick has run mad ; he is going to publish Charles in the news-paper , and swears by human smut , it I go a courting again , these six months , he 'll turn me out of the house .

Charles I am pleased to find you in health , and should be happy to tarry with you to day , but my business obliges me to be at home . I would speak to your father a moment . Exit . Eliza . Eliza Looks astonished.  --  Ah , how now ! Not a single smile , but all , as indifferently  --  well , if he has !  --  if he has !  --  Re-enter Charles . Char .

Do not suffer , my dear friend , jealouses to make you unhappy ; for I am confident that time will prove to the world , that I am yours , invariably .  --  If possible I will return in the evening .  --  Takes her hand and kisses it  --  exit different ways .  --  Jake and Molly come forward .

I will not go , not leave , for one moment , this inestimable treasure , the only treasure that averice can not ravish from me.  --  ( He takes her hand and she puts her hankerchief to her eyes , they stand some time in silence , Jake and Molly weep also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here they are all in tears , all in tears , poor children , all in tears .  --  ( Takes out his hankerchief and wipes his eyes . ) Law .

Eliza , tell your father to rest perfectly easy ; his last days shall be his happiest , I 'll pledge my honor . Exeunt different ways . ACT IV . Pufpace , alone . Puf . Pufpace Begone , you saucy scoundrel , yes you puppy , begone and meddle not with my affairs . I know what I am about , yes I do . Ah hah , advise me to take care how I deal with my son : I know what to do with my son , and my money too , yes I do . I defy the whole herd of ye , poor vagabonds ; come advising me , yes lawyers and all . But I 'll let them know , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if they get the one , they must deprive me of the other , yes they must .  --  It is hard to teach old dogs new tricks , or catch birds with chaff . I defy the whole herd of them , put all their heads together , to cheat me out of my money . Enter Lawyer . Law . Quicksite Mr. Pufpace I have been considering your affairs and find that you are right . Puf . Pufpace Oh , you 've come to your senses have ye ? Law . Quicksite Mr. Meanel must loose his farm . Puf . Pufpace Yes , faith , I knew that , yes I did . Law . Quicksite Your son too , I think , is not altogether right . Puf . Pufpace Oh ho , now you talk reason , yes yes . Law . Quicksite And there 's your brother-in-law .  --  Puf . Pufpace Curse his old grey wig , I 'll make him repent , yes I will . He tells me that I sha n't live long , an old scoundrel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to death with his dreams . Yes , laud soles , I ca n't set down to the table , but I think of some of his foolish dreams ; they are against me , all against me . Law . Quicksite Yes , it seems they have all combined against you ; they may lay some plan to trouble you . I advise you to consult Mr. Jargon , he has detected several plots of Beltret and Nettle . Puf . Pufpace Jargon , who 's he ? Law . Quicksite A celebrated fortune teller from Germany . He 'll bring them all out , tell every knave among them . I 'll call him in . Exit , Puf . Pufpace Ah , there 's another plan to get my money .  --  He that tells fortunes always wants money for't , yes yes . I 'll teach you law , yes yes , yankee doodle , yes yes . I had better consult Mr. Jargon , ha ha . Re-enter Lawyer , and Jake in the habit of a Conjurer . Law . Quicksite Here is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , never was in the county . He can conjure as well as the best of them . Puf . Pufpace Yes , but he must be paid for't , yes yes  --  I understand  --  another plot to get away my money , yes yes . Law . Quicksite Mr. Pufpace I brought you this man out of pure friendship . I knew that you had many enemies , and some that would gladly strip you of every farthing you have . Now if you think that I have done this to get your money , I 'll pay him myself . He can tell you , Mr. Pufpace , every thing you are to meet with ' till the time of your death and even how long you will live . Puf . Pufpace Well , if you will pay him , that alters the case . I 've met with a great deal of trouble of late , and Goodel tells me I sha n't live a great while . I feel pretty well , but notwithstanding , what he told me troubles me a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a little of your witchcraft . Con . Conjurer Well , sir , if I tell your fortune , I must first tell you what has past , and then what is about to come hereafter . Puf . Pufpace Why , Lawyer Quicksite , I do n't believe he knows any thing , he looks just like my Jake . Law . Quicksite The only way to know , is to try him ; if he can tell you what is past , you will believe he can tell you what is to come . Puf . Pufpace Yes yes .  --  Well you may proceed to tell me what is past  --  but you'l pay ' squire ? Law . Quicksite Yes yes  --  you have my word , sir . Puf . Pufpace Proceed , proceed Mr. Conjurer  --  now we 'll have it ' squire , ha ha ha . Con . Conjurer Makes some ado , and takes out his materials , &c.]; Let me see your hand .  --  Firstly , then you are a very rich man , and you got your riches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows , to wit , or namely  --  first , by cheating and oppressing the poor  --  second , by living on potatoes and poor beer  --  third , by patching your coat and wearing leather breeches . You have an hired man , whose name is Jake , and he is courting a lady , by name Cloudy Molly , so called because she is rather dark round the eyes  --  and I perceive this Jake is a rogue ;  --  Puf . Pufpace Yes he is . Con . Conjurer For once , at a certain time , you and he were crossing a river , and he caused you to pass over a place that was not froze hard enough , and you fell in.  --  Puf . Pufpace Ah , yes  --  zounds I 'll pay the rascal for that , yes I will  --  I had like to lost my life , yes I did . Ca n't I take the law of him ' squire ? Law . Quicksite Yes you can . Con . Conjurer You have a son , and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you do not treat him as you ought , and if you continue to treat him as you do , you may expect some dreadful judgment upon yon .  --  You have had two wives  --  Puf . Pufpace No , there you 're wrong  --  that is the first thing you have mist  --  no no , one wife , one wife , Mr. Jargon . Con . Conjurer You have had two wives  --  emphatically  --  and the first was not your wife . Puf . Pufpace Ut tut , how 's that , a flat contradiction . Con . Conjurer The last has been dead four years and two months  --  she was a good woman , but your conscience tells you that you did not use her as you ought , and you ca n't sleep nights , because your conscience tells you how you have abused her and many other of your fellow mortals . But more especially  --  more especially  --  when your wife was in her last sickness , you  --  Puf . Pufpace Ar , ar  --  you  --  I am well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' squire . Law . Quicksite Exactly , Mr. Pufpace , exactly . Puf . Pufpace Mr. Conjurer I am satisfied with your skill  --  you may now tell what is to come . Con . Conjurer Makes a great fuss.  --  All must die ! !  --  Men are at cunning as serpents  --  but thanks to the Black Art I can detect them . Puf . Pufpace Well , detect them , detect them , I 'll pay you for't . I suppose they are going to murder me , ' squire . Con . Conjurer There are four men contriving matters so that if you die without a will , they will take from you your money  --  but thanks again to the Royal Black Art , I can detect them . Puf . Pufpace Well , detect them , I 'll pay you for't , yes I will . Con . Conjurer In the first place it must be determined how long you are to live , or in other words , how long before you must die . Here is the black wand of life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the equilateral triangle , which you see marked out on the table . You must step three paces forward , put your hands behind you , step backwards and touch the end of this wand with your finger , and according to the explosure , or noise , which it shall make , I must judge how long before you must die . You may make the trial .  --  The old man steps off and walks backwards , and at the moment he touches the wand the lawyer gives a blow on the table with his cane , as tho ' the wand had made a noise  --  the old man is so frightened that he falls on the floor  --  the conjurer talks latin all the time . Puf . Pufpace How long ? how long ?  --  Oh Lord ! Con . Conjurer You must transfer all your property to your son , or all is lost . Puf . Pufpace How shall I do it ? Oh Lord . Con . Conjurer By note , deed or will . Law . Quicksite Note will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do write Mr. Quicksite , do . How long , how long ? Con . Conjurer I 'll tell you directly directly . Puf . Pufpace After a pause.  --  How long , how long ? Con . Conjurer Directly .  --  Crossly . Law . Quicksite How much do you suppose you are worth , in all ? Puf . Pufpace About ninety thousand dollars . Law . Quicksite Suppose we call it a hundred and then we shall be sure . Puf . Pufpace Well , call it a hundred .  --  How long , how long ? Con . Conjurer Directly .  --  Crossly . Law . Quicksite Here sigh this in presence of us , and all will be well . Puf . Pufpace Signs and they witness it.  --  How long . Law . Quicksite Goes to the door and calls in Charles and Mr. Goodel.  --  Here , Mr. Pufpace , give this to your son , if you please . Puf . Pufpace Here , my dear son , I have abused you , I acknowledge , take this and forgive your dying father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ? Con . Conjurer throws off his disguise.  --  I guess you 'll live a good while yet , old daddy .  --  All laugh . Puf . Pufpace Ah you rascals , I 'll have you all hanged , yes I will ; you had liked to have frightened me to death , in fact , yes you did . Law . Quicksite Mr. Pufpace level all your rage at me : it has all been done under my direction . I saw , sir , you was going to pain your son , and ultimately yourself . I thought it my duty to interfere . A part of your property is now in good hands . Your son knows how to treat a father , if you do not know how to treat a son . You may now , therefore , be happier than before , and let me tell you , it is neither Jake nor any one else , that has frightened you , but your guilty conscience . Jake has neither said nor done any thing that would have frightened an innocent man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes from Jake without trembling , what must be your condition if you was sommoned to appear before your Maker ?  --  Mr. Pufpace , although what has been told you , about your dying , is a mere joke , yet , sir , it is my serious opinion that you can not live a great while . Puf . Pufpace An , you have all turned against me  --  I am a poor old man , not a friend in the world  --  you have all turned against me , and I suppose you mean to kill me , like enough . Jake . Jake Oh no , master Pufpace , I would not kill you , and if I should see a man going to murder so good a man as you are , so kind to Charles , so willing to let him have money , so willing to let him marry Miss Eliza , because he loves her and because she is so fine a girl , so willing that I should marry Molly because she is so handsome  --  I say Mr. Pufpace , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would get out of the way as soon as I would , yes I would . Char . Charles Jake , you are not to insult my father . Dear father , I beg you would hear one word from me . All that I ever asked of you , was money enough to procure the necessaries of life , and relieve the distresses of my fellow mortals , and to suffer me to act , without restraint , were nature has made me free  --  I mean , sir , in the choice of a partner for life . But if I can not obtain these without extortion , I 'll do as well as I can without them . You shall never have it in your power to say , that your son has turned against you . Take back what you have given me , I 'll trust to Providence for means to finish my education , and maintain a family . Take your obligation , I 'll starve in the arms of virtue before I 'll violate the duties of a child . There , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I am a beggar . I 'll marry the dear girl of my heart , and if we can not live rich , we will live poor and if we are reduced to want , I 'll look , to any turn , for that charity in others which I always have myself bestowed , and always will while I possess the means . Enter Captain Hardy . Har . Hardy Does Mr. Pufpace live in this house ? Puf . Pufpace My name is Pufpace . Har . Hardy Have you a son who is lately from the University ? Puf . Pufpace Yes , that is he . Har . Hardy Are you the person who took pity upon a woman and three poor children , who were perishing with hunger and cold , about four weeks ago ? Char . Charles At the Four Corners , sir . Har . Hardy Yes , sir . Char . Charles I am . Har . Hardy Give me your hand , my name is Hardy , I am her husband . You have saved their lives , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no demand on you Mr. Hardy . As a Citizen of the World I did my duty , and all the reward I ask , is , that if ever you find my wife and children in like circumstances , do them the same kind office that I have done yours . Har . Hardy I have made a voyage to the Eastern Isles , and by some misfortune I have been absent about four years . I expected to have returned in two , and left my family with means accordingly , for I was then poor . After my wife had spent all , she applied to her neighbors , ( if they deserve to be called neighbors , ) for assistance , and they sent her away empty , telling her to work ; but this was impossible , for she was out of health . I have now money enough , yet my wife and children are my only source of happiness . Had it not been for you they must have all been in their grave , for ought I know , and I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , through life . Oh , my dear sir , how shall I reward you ? Char . Charles Deeds of charity , Mr. Hardy , need no a ward  --  they reward themselves . I feel happier on this occasion , than the possession of all the gold and silver of India could have afforded me , had I suffered your family to perish for want . Har . Hardy We are strangers to each other at present , and I know of no other way in which I can exhibit my gratitude , than by presenting you with a little money , not as a reward for what you have done ; for no sum in this world , could be sufficient  --  you must wait with patience to receive it in the next . Here , sir , is one thousand dollars , and if you have enough of your own , yet accept of it , and distribute it among widows and orphans , and especially in their education ; for one dollar spent in this way is more beneficial to society , than ten thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Char . Charles On those terms , Captain Hardy , I accept it , and return my harty thanks . Har . Hardy To Pufpace.  --  I congratulate you , sir , on being the father of so noble , so benevolent a son . He is the father of all the happiness I expect in this life . Accept of this  --  Presents him with a bank note  --  and encourage him in his laudable pursuits . It is impossible for me sir , to express to you , what your son has done for me . Law . Quicksite Now , Mr. Pufpace , what do you think of your son 's giving away money to vagabonds ? Puf . Pufpace He is one of the strangest men I ever saw  --  I do n't know what it all means . Law . Quicksite Why , it means this , sir , that Charles , by giving away that money , which you have made such ado about , saved this man 's wife and children from petishing . Only think , Mr Pufpace , how much good he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very thing you threatened to ruin him forever . Puf . Pufpace Ah well , I do n't know but I have done wrong . I believe , brother Goodel , I acted unwarily . Good . Goodel Well it is not too late to do good now . Jake . Jake Ah yes , Master Pufpace , there is time enough you to be as wife as Lucifer . Puf . Pufpace Ah , well I 'll tell you what I 'll do . Jake bring me my box , and call Eliza and Molly here .  --  Exit Jake.  --  These transactions make me feel somewhat different from what I ever did before in my life . I have got to be pretty old , and I believe I have not done right ; but I am determined what to do , yes I am . Enter Jake with the box , Eliza and Molly . Here Charles , is all my notes , deeds and money , and if you will promise me three things , they shall all be yours  --  yes all I am worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart , for every wrong action ; the second is to restore to Mr. Meanel his farm , and pay five hundred dollars to a man whose name I will tell you at another time ; the third is to marry the girl you now have by the hand , and give Jake the little farm over the river and let him get married as soon as he will . Jake . Jake Oh , ho ho , you are  --  I 'll be your everlasting and eternal servant , yes I will . Puf . Pufpace Can you promise ? Char . Charles I can . Puf . Pufpace This then is yours .  --  Now I am happy . Good . Goodel Mr. Pufpace I can once more call you brother . Law . Quicksite Give me your hand , in me you shall always find a friend . Jake . Jake In me you shall always find a Jake , yes you shall . Law . Quicksite Well , I think we have had a disagreeable fray , and in order to render the reconciliation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all go home with me , it is almost tea time , and we will send a carriage for Mr. Meanel , and , undoubtedly , we can spend the evening agreeably , if it be agreeable to you all . All . All Perfectly agreeable , ' squire . Puf . Pufpace Well , hear , good friends , one word from me . And then we 'll go and drink our sea . You know I am an old poet , yes I am . Jake . Jake Yes , old dad , but mind ye too , I 'm almost as good as you ; ' T is true old dad , there 's no mistake , For both our names begin with Jake . Puf . Pufpace Ah very well , but stop your prating Left the tea for us be waiting . Well fags , I do nt know as I have made a rhyme before these ten years . Jake . Jake Nor I , old dad , but since we 're here , And nothing else our hearts to cheer , And all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I that cast the spell , I 'll tell you how we 'll end the fray . I 'm sure there 's not a better way . Puf . Pufpace Well , how 's that ? Jake . Jake I 'll clear out my pipes and sing a short song . Puf . Pufpace Ah well , well , be quick ; for its time we were gone . Jake . Jake Well , you join in the echorus . SONG , BY JAKE .  --  Tune  --  Black Sloven . My name it is Jake , and in fact that a n't all , I 'm courting a lady by name Cloudy Moll ; And cleaver and happy and free from all harm , We 'll soon be united and live on the Farm . Come brave master Pufpace , pray give me your hand , I vow by Tarngassuck , that by you I 'll stand ; For since you 've seen sit to give Charles up the whole , I like you much better than ever , by jole . Come now Mr. Goodel you 've , done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness of heart ; And if ever a man dare to insult your gray wig , I vow , by Saint Peter , I 'll hit him a dig . We surely must render a great share of praise To good Mr. Quicksite , who 's joined in our frays ; Since he 's been so crafty , without a mistake , As to make a good Conjurer out of a Jake . To brave Captain Hardy , his Children and Wife , We wish all the pleasures and comforts of life ; Since all his endeavors are crowned with gaine , At home with his wife may he always remain . Now Charles and Eliza may banish their fear , And wipe with carresses the sorrowful tear ; May Heaven propitious protect them from woe , Thro ' life up to Heaven they 'll hand in hand go . Come now altogether your hand and your heart , In quarrel we met , but in friendship we part ; For reason affirms , that ' t is friendship and love , That 'll make us all happy in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
