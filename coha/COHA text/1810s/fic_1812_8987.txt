" Honor 's a sacred tie , the Law of Kings , The noble mind 's distinguishing perfection , That aids and strengthens virtue where it meets her , And imitates her actions where she is not : It ought not to be sported with . " Cato PROLOGUE , By unknown WRITTEN BY A FRIEND , And Spoken By Mr. Green . No tales of wonder bid the curtain rise , And point a spectre to your straining eyes : No royal crimes , in sable colours shown , Make you detest , who never saw a throne ; Truth , homely truth , directs our Author 's plan ; Life is his picture , and his portrait , man . Though not to him the mystic art be given , To paint rial forms ' twixt earth and heaven ; To catch a ghost , who stays beyond his time , And lead him captive in the clogs of rhyme  --  Manners and men his humble aim may trace , And prove the heart 's connexion with the face . When first the day of chivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His fiery soul , with sweet emotions warm , Felt a new passion and a heavenly charm . ' T was honor 's impulse , reverenced in song , As virtue sacred , as religion strong : It breathed its fascinations o'er the mind , It softened , polished and improved mankind  --  Hail ! holy subsitute for law and right , Guard to the weak , and to the savage , light ! War smooths his front , is gentle in thy train , And mercy trickles from the Lion 's mane , While beauty leans her lovely form on thee And triumphs in the world 's idolatry . But lo ! emerging from the Gothic den , To heaven obnoxious , but beloved of men , False honor comes !  --  the savage foe of life ! Her god is Moloch , her Religion , strife . Beneath her wings , are hell 's terrific brood ; The widow 's tears she drinks , the patriot 's blood ; To deck her shrine , what crowds of youth are slain ! How many virgins , mourn their loves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And nations , clad in woe , her power proclaim . To drive this monster from the light of day , Our Author bends the forces of his play ; Feeble his skill , his colours far too faint , To paint with words , what words can never paint . His picture still , may manly feelings raise , A single spark , may fire a general blaze ! Shuddering himself , he sounds the notes of fear , Points to the bloody field , and cries  --  Beware !

Caroline How can a mother but be truly blest , When , in the sunshine of a husband 's love , She sees her precious offspring blithe around , With not one void to lessen her delight ! Dev . Charles Devalmore What wealth , what grandeur , my dear Caroline , With that pure , heaven-born pleasure can compare , Which glows within the souls of those who love !

Caroline My loved Maria , if the roses ' bloom Flush on your cheeks with their accustomed hue , Ne'er rose the sun on mortals half so blest . Mar .

Charles Devalmore He writes in health and spirits you shall hear . " Dear Charles , After a rough and tempestuous voyage , I have at length landed safely on our native shores of happiness and liberty . I am in excellent health , and in as good spirits as the prospect soon of seeing you , and the beloved object of my heart , can render me . For want of a suitable conveyance , I shall unfortunately be detained here a few days . Intending to surprise my friends , you may keep my arrival secret , save from our worthy friend Forsythe , to whom I have written . For the present , farewell . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

We hail him with fraternal tenderness , And chearfully look forward to the day , Which is to crown our hopes with happiness , Mar . Maria If you my brother , count that day auspicious , Then , would that it might come with swiftest wings . But ah , those hours of promised bliss I fear , Will ne'er arrive to crown my anxious hopes . Car . Caroline These doleful tones , are like the turtle dove 's , Which mourns the absence of her constant mate , In plaintive notes , reproaching his delay . Mar . Maria How shall I chase those frightful forms away , Which sick imagination conjures round me ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , longer to conceal that truth , Were idle affectation : yet , I tremble , Still know not how I can assign a cause , I tremble at the thought of his arrival . Car . Caroline Such idle dreams dear girl , will vanish all , At the approach of reason 's sober light . ' T is natural to a tender mind like yours , Just on the eve of an important step , To tremble with like fears , to sink with like Solicitude . Dev . Charles Devalmore Then banish all such thoughts . Woodville is one , on whom we may rely , For fadeless joy and lasting happiness . I 've known and tried his steady virtue long : In all the variegated scenes of life , Have found him ever true . Trust me , that man , Who proves like him the faithful constant friend , When adverse fortune marks us for her own , Possesses what the world can not corrupt , An honest heart , more rich than mines of gold . Mar . Maria Oh think not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my own affections : But something gloomy overclouds my soul , Which to indulge , I know is criminal ,  --  Car . Caroline For each indulgence of a gloomy temper , Makes resistance which you fain would offer , Weaker and weaker , ' till it fruitless proves . Mar . Maria So let me strive to dissipate my fears , And calm my anxious spirits . Dev . Charles Devalmore Then wake To mirth , for Woodville soon will hasten to our arms ; And should we meet him with dejected looks , ' Twill seem sad omen of his future bliss . Car . Caroline Give all those modest charms their full expression ; For sure , more brilliant prospects , never dawned On woman . Dev . Charles Devalmore Now do you my Caroline , Instruct Maria that , she prize th ' approach Of this auspicious day . As for myself I must away , to gain some further tidings Of our friend and brother .

Mar . Maria Proceed , and I will follow you , so soon As my perturbed spirits will permit . Car . Caroline Behold this tempting babe , how sweet she smiles , Extorting a thousand kisses from me  --  What words can mark the transports of a mother , Whene'er she casts her eyes upon her babe And sees its visage beam celestial love ! Methinks I here , can well discern Maria , In these soft , malting features of my Clara , A striking resemblance of her Father . Mar . Maria Ah no , I think she more resembles you ,  --  Those eyes , that nose , those lips are all your own Charles has I think , the features of my Brother . Car . Caroline This open , brilliant front is surely his . Mar . Maria Suffice it Caroline , nor covet more  --  Your children bear the badges of you both , So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own . Car . Caroline Sweet enchantress of my soul Let us away  --  I 'll wait you in the garden . ( Exit Caroline , with the Child . ) Mar . Maria What can these wild perplexing thoughts portend ! Why writhes my soul with agonizing woe ! Why am I terrified by fears , which sure , Seem groundless as the fabrick of a vision , Yet which distract me more , than evils , marked And frightful as the grave  --  The grave ! Ah no ,  --  The grave imparts no fears to me . Cheerful , For refuge would I seek its peaceful shades , And hide me there , from all the ills of life : For be my fears , real or fictitious , They quite unnerve my soul . Support me Heaven ! And grant me strength to bear thy dread decrees With dignity and well becoming grace . ( She seats herself , buried in meditation . ) ( Enter Forsythe . ) For . Forsythe Alone !  --  She seems involved in thought profound : Ah would that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am forgotten , Though daily in her view , while one , who far In distant regions wandering , unmindful Of sighs so tender , which she often breathes , In full possession lives of all her love . ( Advancing towards Maria ) How does Miss Devalmore ? Mar . Maria Forsythe ! ( Rising hastily ) For . Forsythe Although I 've thus disturbed your solitude , My presence will not be pronounced I hope , Intrusive . Mar . Maria Undeserving should I be Of all my brother 's tenderness , should I Pronounce a visit from his friend intrusive . For . Forsythe How could I expect from so much virtue , As marks the character of Miss Devalmore , Words suited less , to lips which give them breath . Mar . Maria I owe you thanks . ( Courtesying distantly . ) For . Forsythe Of women , far most fair ! Do not suppose I mean to banter praise , With one whose soul looks down contemptuously On words , which soft tongued flattery affords , Unmeaning , insincere , yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman are , Whom on this earth , with rapture I adore . Mar . Maria Those vows might once have pleased my vanity And when first offered , did from me receive , Their due returns of gratitude : but now , When oft , in candor I 've declared , my heart Was pre-engaged , it is ungenerous , ' T is persecution to pursue me thus . For . Forsythe O pardon me , if once more at your feet , I throw myself , imploring at your hands , Not happiness alone , but even life ! Behold then , Miss Devalmore , on the earth , The man whom you alone possess the power To save , from endless ruin . Mar . Maria Pray sir , rise : It sure comports not with your dignity To bow thus low to me . Such condescension To behold , but gives me pain unspeakable . For . Forsythe Then give me hope , that I may covet life . Mar . Maria Should I unsay , what I 've declared so often , I should be undeserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , and deserve it more . Mar . Maria Never , whilst reason rules my firm resolves . For . Forsythe Bestow it then , upon the undeserving ! ( Rising from the floor . ) Mar . Maria Sir ! For . Forsythe On one , who now regardless of his vows , Loiters his days in foreign climes , nor cares , While in soft dalliance with the guilty fair , Who nightly join his round of idle mirth , That , here , the fairest of the works of heaven , Pines at his lengthened stay . Mar . Maria ' T is all in vain  --  No power on earth can bring me to believe My Woodville false , and this poor , vain attempt , But proves how false are you . For . Forsythe Ha  --  is it so ? Mar . Maria I once considered you my Woodville 's friend ; The man , in whom he fondly took delight , And for whose sake , I held in high esteem . I deemed it rash , when you assailed my heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But thus to slander him , is infamous ! For . Forsythe Be guarded in your speech  --  Remember well , That you a woman are , whose boasted virtue Hangs by most slender threads : the slightest breath Might tarnish , e'en your fairest fame . Mar . Maria Begone ! For . Forsythe The roses which in yonder garden blow , Are safer than a woman 's reputation . Mar . Maria No lot is safe , when the perfidious friend Creeps in , to murder and destroy  --  Eden Was lost , when Satan found admission . For . Forsythe Ay .  --  Though not ' till woman , by her rashness fell  --  Th ' extremes of love and hate are near allied : Rouse not my hate , it is implacable  --  Mar . Maria That ' t is implacable , I may admit , But that ' t is impotent , your rashness shews . Far . Far Rash girl , too late you may repent , perhaps , Expressions so unguarded and servere . Mar . Maria My brother 's arm , my Woodville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect : While they , or either of them live , Maria May defy your arts . For . Forsythe I fear I 've gone too far :  --  I must pursue another course . I 'll win , And then destroy . ( Aside . ) Mar . Maria Mister Forsythe , I deemed A man of honour and integrity ; One , who would sooner die himself , than kill , The honor of his bosom friend  --  But ah , This interview , has undeceived me wholly . For . Forsythe Pardon , beloved enchantress of my soul , This indiscretion . Think not I harbour Ill towards Woodville 's honour ; but have been lead , Perhaps by too much self-love , to declare What now I blush to own . But on my knees , I expiate my crime , and wash it out With this full flood of tears . See on your goodness Here I throw myself , imploring pardon : To forfeit your esteem , were worse than death . Mar . Maria Although your conduct has surprisied me greatly , This warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my Woodville 's friend Humbled thus low . ( Raising him from the floor . ) For . Forsythe Most generous of women ! This but makes me love with newer rapture , And chains me closer unto you forever  --  But you 're my Woodville 's , and I must subdue This passion , should it cost my life : Henceforth Believe me , I will deem my bliss complete , To be accounted ' midst your foremost friends . Mar . Maria But let your conduct prove your words sincere , And I shall have slight memory of the past . For . Forsythe I owe you gratitude unspeakable . Mar . Maria Permit me for the present to withdraw . A letter which my brother just received From Woodville , gives us to expect him here , Perhaps this very night . For . Forsythe Among his Friends , I 'm sure myself will earnest be , in greeting His return . Mar . Maria Confident of that I feel ; As also that no joy will equal his , When clasping to his breast his constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature 's simple child !  --  How easily entrapped By bland , unmeaning words !  --  Imprudent girl ! You have too little known me  --  Though ere long , You shall have cause perhaps , to know me better , And though you will not love , you shall at least Find cause to tremble at Forsythe .

Flaurence Well , here I come , from my accustomed sport  --  Your pistols are as true as fate itself : Destruction seems to perch upon their sights . A few more weeks will render me , I trust , Your rival . For . Forsythe Practice will ensure perfection . Excellence , believe me , I attained not , Save by incessant and unwearied toil . For years , the pistol was my matin song , My noontide sport , my evening 's recreation ; Nor did I hold my life or honor safe , ' Till it was pastime , to bisect with ease , My ball , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In these rude days , the only safeguard To a man of honor , is the pistol . For . Forsythe The pistol has more civilized the world , Than all the pratings of your grizly sages . It makes the just equality of life . Levels the lofty and imperious mounds , Which birth and fortune rear . Promotes the peace By the severe and dreadful penalty It brings on him , who wages causeless strife : The manners softens , polishes , refines , And oft hath armed the holy champion 's cause , Telling to mortal man , the will of heaven . Flau . Flaurence Who but admires such philosophy , When every day 's experience shews its wisdom ? And who can doubt , his days to pass in ease , Whose boast it is , to wear the diamond 's lustre , With the diamond 's edge . For . Forsythe We daily find the ancient prejudice , Which once prevailed against this useful practice , Wearing away . Flau . Flaurence ' T is every day 's resort Of age and wisdom in deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives to meanest acts an air sublime . But cast our eyes around , and sure we need No argument from rule or precept drawn , To hold it sanctified among mankind . The foremost characters in all our land , Are sage upholder 's of its usefulness . For . Forsythe Where is the gentleman , the man of honor , But will at once stand forth its advocate ? Some paltry cowards may decry the practice , Yet even such , when driven to the test , Shew that their wisdom all consists in precept . Flau . Flaurence Where , let me ask , can gentlemen resort , Their honor being wounded ?  --  Unto Judge And Jury ?  --  For . Forsythe Farce , too shallow for a child  --  Let boys and cowards , if they will , pursue Your dull rotine of Courts ; your writs , your pleas , Rejoinders , and demurrers : Gentlemen Should scorn to follow in this idle round , And sue for , through the tedious lapse of years , What in a moment , should be grasped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a graduated scale , To measure feeling , as you ascertain The proof of wines  --  What skill can heal the wound . Which oft a look , a smile , a gesture makes Upon the honor of a gentleman . For . Forsythe How just your sentiments !  --  He twice is wronged , Who to another yields the avenging of his wrong :  --  What are your courts , but records of disgrace ? Where boisterous rudeness in the garb of Law , And cold contempt , assail the coward , herald Of his own defeat . Juries were made , my friend , When from the heart , immortal valor fled , And manly strength forsook the heroe 's arm . Flau . Flaurence Besides we know th ' opinion of the fair , As it relates to these important points : It is indeed the fair who legislate On all nice points of honor . Their decrees Our fame or infamy , forever fix . For . Forsythe For who 'd exist beneath the fair-one 's scorn : The cutting smile of pity or contempt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than wear the badge of Coward , Fastended upon you by a woman 's scorn . Enter a Servant . Ser . Servant Mister Devalmore calls and waits without . For . Forsythe Well , quickly shew him up . ( Exit Servant . ) Flau . Flaurence Truly , Forsythe , Your pistols are the choicest in the world ; One seldom finds their equal . Enter Devalmore Dev . Charles Devalmore Forsythe ! For . Forsythe Ha ! Devalmore , I am glad to meet you well . Dev . Charles Devalmore Flaurence too ! how fare you both ? Flau . Flaurence You see me , And at once you have your question solved . Dev . Charles Devalmore But say , Forsythe , what news ? Accounts have you Of Woodville ? For . Forsythe No , not e'en a syllable . I have received no early tidings , though He oft has given pledges of his love , By warm assurances of constancy . Dev . Charles Devalmore Business , no doubt is his apology . For . Forsythe I own I take his seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him excuse , In the momentous cause of his departure . Flau . Flaurence Woodville 's gay and lively disposition , Should ever plead in his behalf . I know He loves his friend , though I believe , he loves His pleasures more . Abroad , he doubtless gives Full scope to his indulgence . Dev . Charles Devalmore I presume , However Woodville may indulge his taste , He 's not the man to sacrifice his virtue . For . Forsythe Indeed ! ( Ironically ) Flau . Flaurence It may be so .  --  ( Ironically ) For . Forsythe ' T is venturing A great deal for one 's friend  --  Dev . Charles Devalmore And would you not In friendship 's cause such bold assertion make , Of him you 've known from earliest infancy ? On whose fair name , the breath of calumny Could never cast the slightest imputation ? For . Forsythe How few can hearken unto pleasure 's voice And not be caught by her alluring strains . O'erwhelmed like him , in European pleasures , In honied draughts , which tyranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I were wonderful indeed should he escape Virtuous and untainted . Dev . Charles Devalmore Were he that youth , just launched into the world , Warm from the bed of luxury and ease , The fatal consequences might be such , From those temptations which surround him there . But long ago , the gristle of his virtue , Has been hardened by experience : ' T is not By every slight temptation to be warped . Flau . Flaurence He will return no Joseph , I 'll be sworn . For . Forsythe From certain intimations I 've received , ( Through sources not to be discredited , ) In points , I fear , by men deemed more important , He will be found less perfect . Dev . Charles Devalmore Gentlemen , It is disgraceful , thus to sport and trifle With the honor of an absent Friend . You do astonish me by heaven , nay , Shock my soul , by such insinuations , Which more than wound  --  they murder e'en my Friend . For . Forsythe Why make this matter serious ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends  --  For . Forsythe And equally Concerned in preservation of his honor . What passes here between us , goes no farther . I could not listen , were his honor doubted , And not resent the insult as my own . ' T is true , the voice of slander has assailed Our friend , ( but let me ask , who can escape In these degenerate days ? ) his honor , still , No man living can be bold to question . Dev . Charles Devalmore Woodville 's a man , whose most indifferent acts , Wherever moral conduct is concerned , Would challenge and defy the tongue of slander . Why speak of honor as at points with conduct ? The conduct of a man of real honor , Will bear in all things the most rigid test : His virtue pass the strictest scrutiny ; And like the diamond 's lustre , brighter glow , The higher mount the flames which would reduce it : Such is the honor of my Friend . For . Forsythe Errors So slight , are natural consequents of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Woodville , taste each pleasure as it flows ? Wherefore wealth , if not to purchase pleasure ? Wherefore health , if not to taste , when pleasure Holds the cup and bids us drink  --  Why , Woodville Sports , drinks freely , to the fair is liberal , If they prove not ungrateful in return , What crime is there in this ? Flau . Flaurence Sure men may gamble , Drink deep , and toy with every fair they meet , And yet preserve their honor I presume . Dev . Charles Devalmore This is a doctrine , quite of modern date , Crept in , since I forsook my college walls ; And if such precept be received as true , Unlearn thyself , thou sage and moral world ; Put off thy snowy mantle Virtue , and assume The Ethiop 's hue  --  The universe is stained ! Flau . Flaurence But pray , how long Devalmore , is it since , You have become so wondrous sentimental ? For . Forsythe Since he 's become the Benedict : no doubt , For wondrous changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flau .

Charles Devalmore So , gentlemen , I bid you a good evening . ( going ) For . Forsythe Devalmore , stay , I can not suffer this . ' T would seem as though you had conceived offence , At words which only sportive lips have breathed . Dev . Charles Devalmore I should be sorry by my presence , sir , To mar the pleasure of convivial moments , By dull , untimely sentiments , adduced In vindication , even of my friend : But such my temper is , I can not stand A silent auditor . When slander bites His reputation  --  Gentlemen , farewell . ( Exit . ) Flau . Flaurence He 's blunt enough indeed  --  For .

Flaurence Your words delight and quite enchant my soul . For . Forsythe Then be prepared  --  You must devise some mode To scale the window from the garden side  --  Flau .

Forsythe Now , should this undigested plot succeed According to my hopes , my ends are sure . Should Flaurence 's Quixotic scheme prevail , My terms I dictate to this stern enchant ress ;  --  Though let him fail , I play a certain game :  --  For then ' twill serve to rouse the jealousy Of Woodville and to alienate his love ; Or move at least the babbling tongue Of slander , which , most stubborn constancy May weaken , then subdue . For oft it is , That , those who greatest shew of virtue make , Few motives have to hold appearances , Save that it yield some few prerogatives Of preference and respect , which if destroyed , Their boasted virtue , as a thread-bare garb , They cast aside as useless .

One aimed a blow , which would have reached my heart , Save for the foldings of my cloak . For . Forsythe Indeed ! Ah ! how did you escape ? Wood . Henry Woodville By Miracle . I seized one villain by the throat , and then , ( For with Herculian strength I seemed inspired ) Dashed him senseless to the ground . His dagger Saved me from destruction ; for his comrade , Preparing to set on me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless bear , Even to his grave . For . Forsythe May Heaven protect you ! How in my soul I joy at your escape ! Wood . Henry Woodville I feel your warm concern  --  But now my friend , Relieve the throbbings of my anxious soul , And briefly state , that all I love , are well . For . Forsythe Excellent well ! ( Affecting an air of mystery and sorrow . ) Wood . Henry Woodville My ' loved Maria too ? For . Forsythe Ah , she is well ! Wood . Henry Woodville Forsythe , you frighten me . In friendship 's name , explain those looks , those words ; Which seem to struggle ' twixt your love and duty , Whether the truth to hide , or blast your friend  --  Say , does she linger on the bed of illness ? Or tell the worst  --  is my Maria dead ! ( Forsythe is wrapped in deep thought . ) What can such mystery portend ? Tear me , Tear me , Forsythe , from this most cruel rack , Lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild distraction !  --  Heaven support me ! For . Forsythe My friend , my friend , compose yourself , for need You have of all your fortitude , to stem This tide of overwhelming woe . Wood . Henry Woodville Forsythe , Your object doubtless is to drive me mad . For . Forsythe Friendship perhaps has carried me too far  --  I humbly cry you pardon : pray forgive My over-anxious zeal in your behalf . Wood . Henry Woodville I charge you tell me , if one spark of love Glow in your bosom for your wretched friend , Whence is this thunderbolt , prepared by fate , To blast my views forever !  --  Quickly say , That all my future hopes I may resign . For . Forsythe Compose your mind . I will another time  --  At present you had better seek repose : Retire . Tomorrow , I can better tell , And you have strength to hear , the horrid tale , Which I am bound in friendship to disclose . Wood . Henry Woodville Can you suppose your friend that brute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head ? By heaven , you shall straight disclose it to me , Yea , this very night , although it cost me Tears of blood  --  Unfold it to me now  --  yes , Now , while in proper mood prepared to hear . For . Forsythe I 've wound him to the proper pitch indeed . This , this is the moment for my purpose . ( aside . ) Wood . Henry Woodville Behold Forsythe , your miserable friend ! Pity the man whom once you loved  --  Save him From the rack of horrible suspense ! O Rather turn the beetle of destruction Full upon him , that he may die at once ! For . Forsythe Too late I find th ' imprudence of my zeal ! How shall I breathe this secret in your ear ? Why rather not , like some more tender friend , Though unlike on of true fidelity ; Have drawn a veil across this horrid scene , And still have let you dreamt of happiness ! Wood . Henry Woodville Such friendship were far worse than perfidy ; You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . For . Forsythe And therefore is it that I use the knife , While others might have strove to save the limb , Yet , thereby lost the better part . Wood . Henry Woodville To work ! I will not wince , though it should cost my life  --  Is my Maria false ? For . Forsythe Ay  --  False as hell . Wood . Henry Woodville Then , ruin be my portion ! ( Falling senseless to the floor . ) For . Forsythe This will do . The poison takes  --  ' Twill answer all my views . The prospect lies as open as the day : To night , I will complete my grand design  --  Flaurence ! The Ladder ! Garden ! All conspire , To crown my project with success unequalled . ( Noise without . ) Who 's there ?  --  Who dares intrude upon me thus ? ( Enter Shadwell through the private door . ) Destruction seize you ! What can bring you here At this untoward moment ? Fly , begone , Or ruin is our portion ! Shad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed e'er this  --  He has escaped . ( Forsythe points to Woodville . ) ( Shadwell draws his dagger and advances ferociously . ) For . Forsythe Madman , desist  --  or we are ruined men . Shad . Shadwell What can this mean ? For . Forsythe I will explain anon . Look , he revives , Where is your comrade , Moore ? Shad . Shadwell Half dead without . For . Forsythe Let him be treated well at my expense . If life you value , instantly begone . Wood . Henry Woodville Forsythe ! ( Forsythe pushes Shadwell out and fastens the door . ) For . Forsythe It grieves me to behold you thus . Arise , dear Woodville , and compose your spirits . Wood . Henry Woodville One hope I have still left , that ' t is a dream ! For . Forsythe Woodville , look up . ( Raising him a little from the floor . ) Wood . Henry Woodville And dissipate my hopes ! Forsythe , Forsythe , why rouse me to perdition ! For . Forsythe Permit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood . Henry Woodville To my chamber ! No  --  The floor , the earth is soft enough for me . Here let me lie and ponder on my ruin ! Like some lost wretch unfit for human grief , Rather let me , naked , roll upon the earth , And howl my sorrows , till I sink in death . O that the villain 's steel had pierced my heart ! For if Maria 's will it be , her will Be done ! For . Forsythe Base and insidious syren as she is : By her , those villains were , no doubt  --  Wood . Henry Woodville Spare me . In nature 's name , commiserate my woes ! For . Forsythe Well  --  for the present then , I 'll say no more . The deeds which have occurred since your departure I will disclose , anon  --  They 're only fit For your most secret ear . Let me conduct you hence  --  Lean on my arm . Come , come .

Forsythe Let 's take our stations here , beneath this bower . You soon shall witness such a scene , as sure Will curdle at your heart the vital stream , And make you war with nature . Wood . Henry Woodville I am sick , Quite sick at heart , and almost dead with grief . Procure me rest , or I do faint . Forsythe , Lend me your arm . For . Forsythe Be seated on this bank . ( They seat themselves . ) Wood . Henry Woodville Upon this very bank , a thousand times , Have we exchanged our vows . ' T was here that first Maria owned to me her love . ' T was here , That last I drank the nectar from her lips , And heard her vow , in presence of that moon , Which then with pleasure seemed to beam upon us , That she would ever love me , while she lived . For . Forsythe But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . ( Maria comes to the window , and leans on her hand . ) For . Forsythe She speaks , listen  --  Mar . Maria Ah would that thou wert come , Dearest of my soul , to sooth the troubles Of my aching heart ! Wood . Henry Woodville Whom can she speak of ? For . Forsythe We 'll learn anon  --  but give attentive ear . Mar . Maria ' T is now eleven , and too late , I fear , To hope for his arrival  --  Whence that noise ?  --  It was the owl , the watch-bird of the night , Which flitted by , to seek yon distant grove . No noise I hear , but all my soul is up , In anxious expectation of his coming . Wood .. Henry Woodville Base , O perjured woman ! For . Forsythe Pray you , sit down . Mar . Maria Did he but love me , as I doat on him , With pinions , swifter than the eagle 's wings , Would he have hastened to Maria 's arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forsythe Look there , and doubt no more . Towards yon thicket , do you not perceive , The figure of a man ? Wood . Henry Woodville Hide me , hide me ! My heart is broke , I wish to see no more . For . Forsythe Nor I  --  ' Twill break my heart as well as yours . Let us retire . Wood . Henry Woodville No  --  I will not budge , Till I the consummation of my woe , Have fully witnessed . Mar . Maria I resign him then . O guard him heaven with thy watchful care ! Waft to him sweet breeze this kiss ! Maria Sends it thee , from her own lips . Wood . Henry Woodville Lascivious  --  Wanton woman ! Enter Flaurence disguised , with a light ladder . Flau . Flaurence True to her engagement , She waits at her window for my coming . ( Maria puts out her light . ) To be more unobserved , how prudently Has she put out the light !  --  An angel 's form ! Wood . Henry Woodville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thus tamely look upon this scene , And basely sanction such depravity ! For . Forsythe One moment hold  --  be not so rash as yet . Flau . Flaurence She leaves the window , and invites me in : Ye powers of love , assist thy votary ! ( Flaurence places the ladder against the window and ascends a few steps . ) Wood . Henry Woodville Thy life shall pay the forfeit  --  Monster , die ! ( Woodville rushes upon Flaurence with a drawn sword . Maria shrieks and retires  --  Flaurence leaps from the ladder , defends himself awhile , and at length flies . Forsythe advances to Woodville . ) For . Forsythe In heaven 's name , desist ! Do not shed blood . Wood . Henry Woodville Heaven will not behold this hateful scene , Without avenging such dark perfidy ! Infamous woman !  --  Yet I will not heap , More grievous shame upon that guilty head , Than that which must depress it to the earth  --  No tongue shall whisper thy depravity . No ear shall listen to the tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us now I pray begone . Wood . Henry Woodville Whither would you have me go ?  --  rather here , My sorrows let me to the moon bewail , Which will with sullen dignity attend Unto my frantic and despairing cries : Like some wild beast the desert let me prowl , And ' gainst the human race , wage ruthless war ! For . Forsythe Let us be gone while yet we can escape : We 'll be surrounded else by their assassins . Wood . Henry Woodville Fly if you will  --  The assassin to my arms Would welcome be : I 'd throw my bosom bare , And his keen knife receive with transport . For . Forsythe Look  --  We are undone  --  Fly , or I must leave you . Wood . Henry Woodville Here I unmoved do stand , though at my feet Perdition yawn , and pealing thunders burst Around my head . For . Forsythe To stay is certain death : I will provide myself and quick return . ( Exit . ) ( Woodville in great agitation retires into the bower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several Servants bearing torches . ) Dev . Charles Devalmore What means this terrible confusion ,  --  say ? 1st Ser. 1st Servant From this direction seemed to come the noise . 2d Ser. 2d Servant We heard men 's voices as they spoke in warmth And something like the clashing of their swords : Beshrew me , some one has been murdered here . Dev . Charles Devalmore Look carefully along the walks . Be sure You lay safe hands on any one you meet . 1st Ser. 1st Servant Look here , behold this ladder , here , look here . Dev . Charles Devalmore How timely then , has this discovery been . Let strictest search be made . The villains doubtless Lurk within the garden . This is clearly An attempt to rob . 2d Ser. 2d Servant Behold the villain  --  Here he lies , hoping to conceal himself . ( All the Servants collect around Woodville . ) Assist  --  lay hands upon him , drag him forth  --  Wood . Henry Woodville Whoever lays his finger on me dies .

Henry Woodville Him who was once a man , but now a wretch ; A wretch , too vile for pity . Dev . Charles Devalmore See I Woodville ! Wood . Henry Woodville No  --  his semblance merely ! ( Devalmore waves to Servants , and they retire . ) Dev . Charles Devalmore Woodville ! my mind was not prepared for this . Wood . Henry Woodville And know , I blush to own it , that , for this , Devalmore never should have been prepared . Dev . Charles Devalmore But come , let 's drop this idle sport of words : Unfold the cause of this strange interview , Which calls too loudly for an explanation . How came you here ? By whom that ladder placed Against the apartment of my sister ? Wood . Henry Woodville Go ask your sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lips , divulge the tale . Dev . Charles Devalmore Think not thus you can elude my vengeance : Confess your guilt , abandoned libertine , And thereby expiate in part your crime . Wood . Henry Woodville I am an angry scorpion : venom lies Even in my glance ; death , within my grasp . Dev . Charles Devalmore Begone ! Already have you stabbed my soul , Tarnished the valued lustre of my name , Tore down the sacred barriers of love , Trampled the mounds of honor in the dust , And aimed to blast the virtue of my sister . ( Woodville laughs indignantly . ) Unfeeling profligate ! How dare you thus Insult the man , whom basely you have injured . Wood . Henry Woodville Vile pander of thy sister 's shame  --  away . Dev . Charles Devalmore Damning , foul and infamous aspersion :  --  Tremble madman , while you give it utterance . Wood . Henry Woodville Rash and imprudent man , regard thy words . Dev .

Maria Almighty powers , save me or I faint . ( Falling into Devalmore 's arms . ) Dev . Charles Devalmore Base man , behold what infamy has wrought . Mar . Maria O let me perish in my Woodville 's arms ! Dev . Charles Devalmore Maria , suffer me to lead you hence . Mar . Maria Then would you drag me from my Woodville 's presence ? Wood .

Do I both hear and see , What passes , or what seems to pass before me ? Are you my Brother , and is this my Woodville ? Ah ! why not then infolded in his arms ? ( Rushing into Woodville 's arms . Devalmore turns aside in great agitation . ) Wood . Henry Woodville Did not my eyes bear witness to her guilt , I now might taste the luxury of doubt . Mar . Maria Woodville ! Wood . Henry Woodville No further confirmation can this need . Mar . Maria Woodville ! Wood . Henry Woodville What is the matter ? Mar . Maria Tell me truly , Why are you here ? wherefore this fierce conflict With my Brother ?  --  Why roll your eyeballs thus ? Why from your brow start those big drops of sweat ? Why do you tremble so ?  --  Why frighten me , With horrid indications of despair ? Wood . Henry Woodville Begone , begone  --  Girl , I am mad ! Mar .

Give ear Maria , to a Brother 's voice ; Fly from the embraces of that monster . Mar . Maria O spare those epithets ! some magic spell , Surely intervenes , by which you neither See , nor hear , nor understand correctly , What passes now before you . Fell sorcery Misguides your judgments altogether . Dev . Charles Devalmore Go  --  Woodville and I , have business to transact In private  --  Leave us  --  My Sister leave us . Mar .

Maria takes their hands and with a distracted air attempts to join them . ) Dev . Charles Devalmore May cramps contract it , till each sinew crack ! Eternal curses blight and wither it ! ( Dashing it away disdainfully . ) Mar . Maria Then be it mine , to moisten with my tears . ( Pressing the hand of Woodville to her lips . ) Dev . Charles Devalmore I charge you stay no longer here  --  begone This instant , if my love you value aught Mar . Maria O kind , sweet brother ! what a conflict this Between my duty and my love . Dev .

( The Servants carry off Maria . ) Do I exist ? Or is this not some vision Of a drowsy night , which haunts my sickly mind ? Is this my Woodville ?

The tender partner of my bosom sleeps , Dreaming little , that , perhaps , we meet no more . From her sweet lips , I stole one parting kiss , And on my knees consigned her to my God .

No one suspects The dread design on which my mind is bent  --  I may accomplish all before they rise : Then must I begone :  --  And yet I can not go , Till I 've imprinted on my childrens ' lips Their father 's last adieu  --  How soft and quietly they rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom lies , And knows no higher bliss , whilst my loved Charles , Tranquil , as innocence can make him , sleeps , Dreaming of joys to-morrow may bring forth .

Caroline Heaven smiles benignant on your office And will reward you with eternal joy . Car . Caroline On every side we turn our anxious thoughts , Unequalled horrors overcloud our view , And cast a dampness on our future hopes . Each onward step , the prospect thickens fast , And in perspective , nothing I behold Save one blank waste of cheerless misery . The morn of joy will never dawn again , Upon this miserable , aching head , Unless propitious Heaven hear my prayers , And save my husband ! Mar . Maria Fate 's relentless storm Has burst upon us , with unequalled rage . Where can we turn ? Ah how shall we escape Its unrelenting fury ? Car . Caroline Confide In Heaven : for sure the arm which raised the storm , Can quell its fury  --  How could Devalmore thus deceive my heart ! How trifle with his loving , loving wife !  --  When last you clasped me to your anxious breast , Did you not in heavenly accents murmur , The love unbounded which you bere for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips Have so deceived his doating Caroline ?

Maria Calm yourself a moment  --  from the casement I will o'erlook the scene , and quickly bring Account of what is passing . ( Exit . ) ( Caroline alone . ) Car . Caroline Wo is me ! How flat and fading are the joys of life ! The most substantial blessings , shadows , all ; Our hopes , than shadows , even still more vague .  --  The slightest accident may frustrate one , The others vanish , e 're the flippant forms By quickest thought can be embodied  --  Ah ! But yesterday , and all the light of heaven Sparkled around my head , though , sad reverse ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trun ! But yesterday , The blithesome mother and the joyful wife ; To day , far worse than widow , and far worse , Than had I never heard the name of mother . ( Maria shrieks without . ) Ha ! Then all , all is lost ! ( A pause . ) O scene of horror ! What is this I see ! ( She remains tranfixed , while the dead body of Devalmore is brought in on a bier  --  Caroline rushes forward in frantic ' despair , and throws herself upon the corpse . ) ( A pause . ) Enter Woodville distractedly  --  his face pale with horror . Wood . Henry Woodville Is there no ray of hope , no spark of life , Yet lingering on this side the grave !

Caroline What whimpering parasite art thou indeed , That fain would me surpass in grief ?  --  All woe Is luxury compared with mine  --  Away , You only play the child . How dare invade My province , and presume to share my grief ? Wood . Henry Woodville The vilest wretch that ever crawled the earth , Is prostrate at your feet  --  O would to heaven That he , not only could thy sorrows share , But bear them altogether . Car . Caroline Begone !  --  begone !  --  Fly where thou wilt , dishonour still be thine . Thy blood stained hand , no distant climes can bleach , No holy waters purify .

Henry Woodville Lost man awake , Awake and chase this horrid dream away ' Which else will drive thee mad  --  ( He approaches the body with a distracted air . ) Miserable wretch ! what have I not done ? A tender husband killed , a father butchered , Slaughtered a kind brother , murdered a friend  --  But still the bloody scene shall not close here : Fearful revenge shall first be satisfied : So look to it Forsythe .

( Catching Charles in her arms , she throws herself upon the corpse , while Maria leans over them in mingled horror and despair . ) ACT V. SCENE .  --  A thick wood . Enter Shadwell and Moore . Moore . Moore We can not be mistaken in the spot . Shad . Shadwell This is the place I 'm fully confident , You recollect , perhaps , he marked the ground By those wide spreading oaks , and that dead pine , Which towers above us on the hill hard by . Moore . Moore I do  --  I wonder what detains them thus ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shadwell No fear , no fear  --  I know his spirit better . He is a man not easily put off From such determinations . Once offended , As well might you the ocean ' tempt to quell , As sooth his angry spirit . Moore . Moore That is right : I like a man of resolution well . The challenge was accepted ? was it not ? Shad . Shadwell Could you once doubt it ? Moore . Moore No  --  I never did : His courage I have always heard unquestioned . Shad . Shadwell He 's never fought , but he has killed his man . His pistol is most certain death : I feel A chill of horror for the wretch , who falls Beneath his anger . Moore . Moore You can tell no doubt , How many men he 's met within his time ? Shad . Shadwell This coun 's the twelfth  --  if I mistake me not . Moore . Moore But hold . Look yonder  --  who approaches there ? Shad . Shadwell Woodville , the man himself :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot him as he passes . Could we dispatch him , and preserve thereby our patron 's life and honor , we might touch A round reward . Moore . Moore Perhaps we might  --  But yet , I do not like this work of murdering men . Shad . Shadwell What !  --  are you afraid ? Moore . Moore You know me better , But from the first , I liked not this employment . In honest truth , I can not reconcile it With my conscience . I passed a wretched night , Last night . Shad . Shadwell In fact , I did not pass a better ; Though I 'm accustomed to it now , and sleep . But we must resolve on something quickly . Moore . Moore Then I 'm resolved to have no hand in it  --  No scruples would I have to take his purse , But , at the thought of shedding human blood , I tremble every joint . Shad . Shadwell Go  --  you are young  --  But look  --  ' twill not be safe , he has his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deed , Alone  --  Let us be off  --  or lurk about Until our purpose suits  --  Moore . Moore Off , off ,  --  the 're here Upon our heels . Shad . Shadwell So now , collect yourself . ( Exeunt . ) Enter Woodville and Hanmer with pistols . Han . Hanmer This is the ground . Wood . Henry Woodville It suits our purpose well : We here may be unseen by mortal eye . You have selected prudently the spot :  --  Well , with the silent solitude of nature , Accords our sable drama . Han . Hanmer Woodville , O Ponder yet upon this fatal measure . Permit the anger of your mind to cool And give the dictates of religion sway . Trust me , my counsel leads not to disgrace , But will conduct you to the very shrine of real honor : The portals leading there , Are closed upon the duelist . Wood . Henry Woodville Hanmer , Too deeply wounded has my honor been , Ever to repent this resolution . You 've heard my injuries detailed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hanmer Well knowing the extent of all your wrongs , ' T is therefore I conjure you to be calm . Let reason take her station in the breast , And who need fear the raging of the storm , Though fiends of hell bestride the angry blast ! When ocean heaves its foaming waves most high , Th ' xperienced mariner governs the helm , And tranquil smiles at dangers which surround him . Wood . Henry Woodville The fury of my soul has long subsided , Leaving a fixed determination here . When calmly I reflect on this vile deed , I 'm driven almost frantic ! Tell me then , Where 's my redresss , save in the pistol 's reach ? Shall this detested monster go unpunished ? Shall I be made the murderer of my friend , And not cry loud for vengeance ?  --  You mistake Your Woodville 's character , if you belive , He can pass by such matchless injury . Han . Hanmer How can you reach this viper in his cell . When e'en the steady arm of Law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wood . Henry Woodville What would you have me do ? Han . Hanmer Resign your cause To that all-seeing judge , who surely will Avenge your injuries . Give the base wretch , Unto the goading stings of conscience . Leave him To self corroding misery , which feeds On its own vitals , ever supplying food for self-consumption . True , you find not this Consistent with the rules of Modern Honor , But ' t is authority from higher source ; Derived from that religion we adore . Wood . Henry Woodville Yes , my Hanmer , like a god you counsel ; Were I less a man to profit by it ! Han . Hanmer Reflect , my valued friend , on what you do . Wood . Henry Woodville Reflection almost drives me mad . Wretched , Miserable man ! Whither shall I fly For respite from myself ?  --  This bloody hand Stiff with a brother 's gore , can never more Be clean . Han . Hanmer Fly to the fountains of religion ; The waters flowing thence , will wash it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sainted spirit of my murdered friend , Hear thy distracted Woodville 's frantic cries ! Ah , could he hear , his manly spirit sure , Would nobly pardon me . But orphans ' cries , And widows curses have o'ertaken me ! Then come Forsythe , come and end a life , Which now drags on in misery . Han . Hanmer Why not , My noble friend , resign yourself to heaven ? Shall mortals like ourselves , pretend to wield The thunderbolt , and mark the path of fate ? Shall we presume to draw the sword , and poise The scales of Justice in our trembling hands ?  --  Beware this step ; tremble at your rashness . Wood . Henry Woodville I am a wretch , already lost ! Speak not Of reason , for I can not hear : Speak not Of heaven , for I 'm lost already ! Han . Hanmer Such impious speech , thrills every vein with horror : We must converse no more upon this subject  --  Compose awhile your agitated mind , For your antagonist will soon be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onset , let him come . Han . Hanmer Then , since ou 're thus resolved , I pray my friend , ( As well I know th ' implacable resentment Of your envenomed soe , will never rest , While in his breast , one spark of life exists , ) Collected be , lost you a victim fall To his superior art and temperance . He knows that , in his butchery , his skill Unrivaled stands : On this , he rests his hopes , And counting all the chances in his favor , Ventures like a brave man to the conflict . Wood . Henry Woodville I know his steady and unerring hand , And count myself as lost  --  Yet , better far , To die ten thousand deaths , than live beneath The tortures of the soul . Han . Hanmer Did all end here , I , as your friend , would lead you to the brink , And plunge you in eternity 's abyss : But hence , behold that terrible hereafter , Which should cause the Duelist to tremble . Wood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Han . Hanmer How can this act , one step advance your cause ? In what your honor profit any thing ?  --  Should you this monster slay , the task is still T ' expose his horrid crimes : What should prevent Th ' exposure while he lives ? But should you fall , You leave your loved Maria , honor , fame , All in the power of that very man , Whom neither love nor fear could influence . O vile , O mad infatuation this , It can not stand the test of sober truth ! Wood . Henry Woodville Should I from this guilty field retire , Who 'll vindicate my honor with the world ? Han . Hanmer What is the world to you in competition With your soul ? Wood . Henry Woodville Ah nothing ! yet  --  yet , every thing !  --  How shall I meet the friends whom once I knew ? How brook the killing smiles of pity ? How Bear up against th ' unfeeling laugh of scorn ? How stand the sharp reproaches of Maria ? How ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How pass through life , with coward on my brow ? Ah me ! no door , no hiding place is left , Saving the silent mansions of the grave !  --  You argue , Hanmer , to the heedless winds : Trust me , I 've made my fixed determination . Prepare the pistols . ( A pause . ) Let me indulge some moments solitude . I will not stray beyond the reach of call . ( Exit . ) Han . Hanmer Honor , mystic name !  --  to lengths how boundless Wilt thou conduct thy votaries ! ' T is strange , That , through the fear of temporary ill , Which merely a day , an hour can endure , They should the hazard run of endless ruin !  --  Where is the active energy of law , That sanctioned murder stalks abroad by day , And unabashed , holds up her bloody hand ? Will no immortal patriot arise , Inspired with legislatie energy , To drive her from the land : A monster sure Turned loose on guilty man , to fill the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter Forsythe and Flaurence with a case of pistols . Flau . Flaurence Your most obedient . Han . Hanmer Gentlemen . ( bowing distantly . ) For . Forsythe I hope You have not long been waiting our arrival ? Han . Hanmer Not long , Sir  --  No : T is just about the hour . For . Forsythe I much admire punctuality In every thing , and should be truly grieved Should I have kept you waiting e'en a moment . It is unpleasant to sustain suspense . Flau . Flaurence We should have reached the ground much sooner , but Our surgeon was not in the way by times : We 've been compelled at last to come without him . Han . Hanmer Further apology I deem as needless . Flau . Flaurence Where is your Friend ? Han . Hanmer I call , and he 's at hand . We may prepare and measure off the ground . The distance is ten paces , is it not ? Flau . Flaurence The combatants in turn , take aim and fire , As we command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flau . Flaurence Your friend is first entitled to the fire . Han . Hanmer He is  --  though much he does not estimate Such an advantage . For . Forsythe Yet  --  ' t is proper sir , That men participate all fortune 's favors : These slight punctilios , I rejoice are settled ; As nothing should be left to clog these moments Save th ' important business we 're engag 'd on ; Enough completely to employ the mind . Flau . Flaurence The time flies on apace , t is coming late  --  Where , I ask again . is Mister Woodville ? Han . Hanmer Hard by  --  But e'er I bid him , suffer me To call upon you in the sacred names Of reason and religion , so that before Too late it prove , they both may interpose Their high authority , and thereby save , From everlasting ruin your friend and mine . Flau . Flaurence Mister Forsythe lends ever easy ear , To those who sue for peace . Han . Hanmer Do not mistake The language which I hold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you here , A volunteer in nature 's holy cause . Think not I 'd turn a traitor to my friend , For if th ' appeal I make , should fruitless prove , I 've still performed my duty to my God . Flau . Flaurence What would you then propose ? Han . Hanmer Any measures Short of alternatives so desperate . Flau . Flaurence Well , name your terms . For . Forsythe Proper reparation , Ample as the wounds my honor has sustained , Sustained from him whom once I called my friend , Must first be made . You may not listen else . Han . Hanmer Farther negociation then betrays His honor and my own . I have no more . For . Forsythe I wait the presence of the Gentleman . Flau . Flaurence ' T is strange he should be absent at this time . For . Forsythe Bear witness then  --  I have been waiting long : The Laws of Honor will not bind me here Forever . Flau . Flaurence You already have complied With the strict letter of the Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field At pleasure . Han . Hanmer But one moment longer wait ; Hold me pledged meanwhile for his appearance . Woodville  --  Ho ! ( Exit . ) Flau . Flaurence So , our redoubted knight , faints At thoughts of meeting you . For . Forsythe I long foresaw How this affair was likely to conclude . The moment Hanmer spoke of his appeal , And such like stuff , I knew his trembling Friend Would fly the course . Flau . Flaurence There 's nothing like true spirit . Had we a moment wavered in our terms , He would have come a very bully forth . For . Forsythe I know his disposition well enough : He 's not the man of firmness . Flau . Flaurence Clearly not . For . Forsythe If Moore and Shadwell have but done their duty , I may have little now to apprehend . ( aside . ) To tell you truly , much I would not wonder , Should he attempt to palm some trick upon us , Thereby this duel to evade . Flau . Flaurence But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull-ring ; now Let us prepare to bate him well . Enter Hanmer , and Woodville leaning on his arm . Han . Hanmer I fear My Friend is wounded . For . Forsythe Shallow artifice ! ( Aside to Flaurence . ) Wood . Henry Woodville You have preserved my life most narrowly : I left the deep recesses of yon wood , And was returning here , when a ruffian , The same I think from whom I ' scaped last night , Lept from the mouldering trunk of yonder tree , And close beset me  --  Had you not arrived , I surely must have perished by his steel . Flau . Flaurence Such art will do when nothing better can . ( Aside to Forsythe . ) But gentlemen , the time is wasting fast , We must to business . Han . Hanmer Not this moment , sure : You are too generous to urge him forth In the condition that you now behold him ! For . Forsythe I wait the pleasure of the gentleman : For in conformity with his commands Here am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him the amends which he requires . Wood . Henry Woodville Who dares to speak of making me amends ? Can that base monster speak in such a sort ! Flau . Flaurence We meet not Sir , to deal scurrility . For . Forsythe We must delay no longer . Gentlemen , Perform your duty . Flaurence , unto you I look for justice  --  No more will I add . Wood . Henry Woodville I scorn a favour at your gilty hands : So measure off the ground . I am prepared . Han . Hanmer Against such strange proceedings I protest ' T were foulest murder should you fight this duel : My friend is not in fit condition now , To take the field . Wood . Henry Woodville Feel no solicitude . The wound is slight , it needs no moment 's thought , Prepare the pistols  --  I am in proper mood for such a deed . And while th ' impression of my wrongs is fresh , Give me revenge  --  steep me in human blood ! Han . Hanmer You shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will  --  For deadly vengeace boils within my soul . Perform your duty Hanmer , measure off The ground . We meet not to negociate . I come resolved to vindicate my wrongs , Or perish nobly , in the vain attempt . ( Flaurence steps off the distance . The seconds load the pistols . Flaurence and Forsythe speak a few words in private .  --  Forsythe takes off his coat , and prepares himself very deliberately . ) Flau . Flaurence You understand the terms on which you fight ? For . Forsythe I do . Wood . Henry Woodville And so do I. ( Hanmer signifies to Woodville to prepare as Forsythe has done , but he declines .  --  The seconds give Woodville and Forsythe , each , a pistol . They take their respective stations opposite each other . The seconds arm themselves and take their positions . ) Flau . Flaurence Are you prepared ? Han . Hanmer Make ready . ( Woodville levels his pistol at Forsythe . ) Fire ! ( Woodville fires . ) Flau . Flaurence Mister Forsythe , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Fire ! ( Forsythe fires . ) ( A piercing shriek is heard from without . Woodvilie drops his pistol and staggers. hanmer flies to his assistance . Woodville falls into his arms . Flaurence hastons to Forsythe . ) For . Forsythe Now let 's begone . Behold you earriage stops ; ' T would not be safe perhaps to linger here . Flau . Flaurence At first , ' twill raise great clamour in the world , But soon , like matters , die , and are forgotten . Is that Maria who approaches there ? her grief augments her beauty : But no more , At present leave her . Now the course is clear  --  She will hereafter fall an easy prey . For . Forsythe He has it to his heart 's content  --  Away ! ( Exeunt . ) Han . Hanmer Lie quietly , till I can assistance . Wood . Henry Woodville Hanmer , leave me not , this wound is mortal . Han . Hanmer Let me seek for surgical assistance . Wood . Henry Woodville Ah no !  --  No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then its will has thus made known , Do you my honor vindicate . Too late , I find , the ground which I have ventured on , Will not establish what I die to prove . When slander 's tongue is busy with my name Do you stand forth its friend and advocate ; And crave at least the tribute of a sigh , For my misfortunes . Han . Hanmer Cheer your soul with hope ; Do not despond at this momentous time . Wood . Henry Woodville Hanmer ! Han . Hanmer What would you say ? Wood . Henry Woodville My gentle friend , My heart 's too big for utterance , ' twill burst If I attempt to give my feelings vent  --  Yet make one promise to your dying friend , And then his soul regains tranquillity . Han . Hanmer Name it ; your wish with life will I fullfil . Wood . Henry Woodville Then prove a friend unto my loved Maria , And a Father to Devalmore 's Children . Han . Hanmer Yes , my Woodville ! So assist me Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing fast upon me . Han . Hanmer How can I act to alleviate your pains ? Wood . Henry Woodville Begone Forsythe !  --  Thou monster leave my sight !  --  So now I die in peace !  --  Devalmore , come , Caroline !  --  Thy Children !  --  Thou Maria ! ( Dies . ) ( Noise Without . ) Enter Officers and Attendants in haste , leading in Moore . Maria following , supported , pale and distracted with horror . Offi . Officer Alas ! alas ! we have arrived too late ! Mar . Maria My fears are realized . All hope is gone  --  My Woodville , my beloved is no more ! ( Throwing herself on the corpse , while Hanmer leans tenderly over them . ) Offi . Officer Pursue the murderers ; see where they fly . ( Exeunt several Officers . ) This villain has disclosed their horrid crimes , And fixed the charge of murder on their heads . Han .

Officer When will this modern Moloch be appeased  --  When glutted with the blood of human victims ? When will the light of reason dawn on man , And shew this custom its deformity ? Han . Hanmer The deadly fiend sits proudly here enthroned , And round her throws her mantle steeped in blood . At her cursed footstool , thousands bend the knee , And basely stoop to her supremacy  --  Ye mothers then , who melt at human woe , Ye generous youth who bow at virtue 's shrine ; Ye husbands , fathers , in whose bosoms dwell The steadier precepts of maturer thought , Stand forth , and in the majesty of truth , Assert your sacred rights : Indignant frowns Let fall upon this midnight hag , which would erect , Despite of Reason 's and Religion 's voice , Her cruel empire o'er this HAPPY LAND .

Come forth his friends , the combatants prepare , Measure the ground and see the duel 's fair : Let one by one the dubious contest try , Let every critic take a shot and fly . Yet , who shall dare withstand the critics rage ? Who use all weapons , every warfare wage : With broad-sword , small  --  sword , pistol , dagger , knife ; Think all things lawful that are foes to life : Wound in the dark , lash , lacerete and kill ; And even seem to drink the blood they spill .
