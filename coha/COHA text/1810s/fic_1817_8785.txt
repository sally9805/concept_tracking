Enter Sir Credulous , followed by Emily . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Fire and furies ! you are enough to drive me mad  --  marry a pauper !  --  a beggar !  --  Emily . Emily You once thought highly of him . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy That 's more than I do now  --  And to cut the matter short , I forbid you to mention the name of Belmont . Emily . Emily Has then my Belmont 's sudden reverse of fortune wrought this change in your sentiments . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy To be sure it has  --  if he was as knowing as Pluto and Polyphemus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about  --  the word poverty would knock all his merits in the head at once . Emily . Emily And pray , sir , what sort of a husband would you recommend me ? Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Why , zounds , a rich one to be sure . I have one in my eye for you  --  aye  --  and one that has loved you a great while , tho ' he never told any body a syllable about it . Emily . Emily And may I ask the name of this Adonis  --  do I know him ? Sir . C. Sir Credulous Testy Hum  --  you have seen him . Emily . Emily How old is he ? Sir . C. Sir Credulous Testy Why  --  he 's  --  he 's  --  about  --  aye  --  about my age . Emily . Emily Your age ! ha ! ha ! ha ! a husband of your age for me sir , ha ! ha ! ha !  --  who is this precious rich old hunks ? Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy No names miss , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and your fortune by your father 's will goes with my recommendation  --  you will please to remember that too , my young lady  --  and if you do n't like him the better for trying to please you , why he will take you without it  --  for him you must and shall have . Emily . Emily Whether I will or no sir ? Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Yes , miss , whether you will or no  --  or you shall have neither husband or fortune . Emily . Emily Why , really , sir Credulous , from some hints lately fallen from you and your present conversation , I might be led to think you intended to honour me with some matrimonial proposals on your own account . Sir . C. Sir Credulous Testy Ah ! if you were not joking now  --  if you really would think such proposals an honour  --  egad I do believe I should be tempted to make them seriously . Emily . Emily Ha ! ha ! ha ! Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Why what d'ye laugh at  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray ? Emily . Emily Abundantly . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy And pretty enough ? Emily . Emily Undoubtedly . Sir . C. Sir Credulous Testy Oh ! that I could say young enough . Emily . Emily Nay , sir , do n't hesitate ; If I have any scruples on that head , it is becasue you are  --  too young . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Too young ! how so ? Emily . Emily Why Sir , when a young woman marries a man past a certain age , the older he is the sooner she may hope to be a widow ; and next to the delight of sparkling as a bride , is the pleasure of ogling for a second husband in weeds  --  that is , sir Credulous , when a young woman has been simple enough to marry an old man . Enter John . John . John Mr. Pigeonwing is below , sir . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Mr. Pigeonwing  --  go to him directly Emily  --  you see how attentive I am to your pleasure  --  you have often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have now sent for one of the best London can produce  --  I did not tell you this before , because I wished to surprise you agreeably ; he is to teach you the last new step  --  a-la-mode de Paris  --  as he calls it  --  I 'll follow you presently  --  and d'ye hear , see that he teaches you nothing a-la-mode de Belmont . Exit John conducting Emily . And so this foolish young jade imagines that her being in love is a sufficient reason why I should throw her and ten thousand pounds away on a fellow not worth a groat : but when once a woman has the indiscretion to ride post with master Cupid , she travels so rapidly that nought but Hymen can stop her . Exit . SCENE II .  --  A room in the house of Sir Credulous Teaty , a fire place with a chimney board . Plotwell , dressed outre as a dancing master , discovered beckoning to Belmont , who enters with caution . Plot . Plotwell All is safe  --  " thus far we run before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Credulous Testy 's house , free from detection  --  Oh ! what an advantage it is to a master to have a servant who can scheme well  --  an invaluable servant sir , is , in my humble opinion , the most invaluable of all invaluables . Bel . Mr Belmont Come , come  --  a truce to prating , let us to business . Plot . Plotwell True , sir , let me see  --  removes the chimney board get you in here  --  at a convenient moment I 'll deliver you letter to miss Emily , and apprise her of your situation . Bel . Mr Belmont Who have we here ?  --  by all my hopes ' t is my Emily . Enter Emily ,  --  ( on seeing Belmont , she screams and falls into his arms . ) Plot . Plotwell There sir , there 's a damper for you  --  without that your fit would have been too strong . Emily . Emily Belmont ! Plot . Plotwell Aye  --  there  --  its all the sweeter  --  now a little interruption in these matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tartness . Emily . Emily How can you be so rash  --  should my guardian discover you . Bel . Mr Belmont Do not call it rashness . Plot . Plotwell Call it whatever you please madam , but in the name of every thing that 's bewitching , comical , and intricate , hear what I have to say and then stuff you captivated youth up the chimney . Emily . Emily How !  --  Bel . Mr Belmont Sir Credulous , has forbidden me the house , and my letters I understand are intercepted . By mere accident my servant , Plotwell , heard that sir Credulous meant to send for Pigeonwing , and dressing himself off for the dancing master , and whilst the servant announced him , he stole down to the street door and let me in . Sir . C. Sir Credulous Testy(without) Is the dancing master gone up stairs ? Plot . Plotwell Aye , here 's a little more acid . Bel . Mr Belmont What the devil shall I do ? Plot . Plotwell Here , sir , quick , quick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now , madam , leave the affair to me  --  hem  --  hem . Enter Sir Credulous.  --  ( Plotwell receives him affectedly . ) Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Emily , my dear , this is Mr. Pigeonwing , recommended to me by a gentleman as learned in his profession . Plot . Plotwell Learned ! O ! fy !  --  what a term was that ! learned indeed ! a downright reproach , sir  --  skilful , if you please . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy It is no affront to call you learned , I hope . Plot . Plotwell Pardon me , sir , the greatest affront imaginable . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Let me tell you sir , solid learning can do no man harm  --  no  --  not even a dancing master . Plot . Plotwell ' Pon my soul I blush to hear you say so , sir Credulous  --  ' t is the greatest mistake possible  --  allons  --  turnez  --  sa  --  sa  --  jumpez  --  caporez  --  sa  --  ( burlesques modern dancing. )  --  Believe me , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agility and learning  --  they are worse enemies than oil and vinegar . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy The devil they are ! Plot . Plotwell To be sure . We gain applause by the lightness of our heels and the taperness of our toes . If our heads were crammed with solid learning we should be top heavy  --  it would be dangerous to cut six , lest we should turn round in coming down , and like a shuttlecock fall on our heavy end . Emily . Emily Excellent ! Plot . Plotwell Learning sir ! It is the very bane of our profession ;  --  what are all your Colleges ?  --  mere nurseries for melancholy and hospitals for spleen  --  they never yet produced a man that could stand with one leg horizontal for an hour . America we hear , encourages , the arts , promotes learning , builds colleges , and already boasts of her manufactories  --  ' so , sir , dancing masters are soon expected to become articles of commerce  --  Is not this a disgrace sir ? ' ' Sir C. Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Plot . Plotwell No disgrace ! why zounds , if she goes on in this way we may soon expect to hear that ' she produces native soldiers , sailors , merchants , statesmen , farmers , and mechanicks  --  and with such a band , she will dare to stand forward to defend her flag against the united efforts of the world in arms . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy These are tolerable valuable productions , I think . Plot . Plotwell Mere nullities , never found in fashion 's catalogue  --  every thing valuable comes from foreign countries  --  there 's not a high cape  --  or cosmetick  --  a cropt tail  --  or perriwig  --  a pudding cravat  --  or elixir  --  a new play  --  or a dancing master , but we are under obligations to strangers for . Emily . Emily After all your ingenuity I confess I must advocate the cause of erudition . Plot . Plotwell The mere prejudice of education , my dear miss  --  But attend to me for two minutes , and I 'll prove that the heel , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plotwell My dear Miss , you 're quite in the wrong , By learning you never can rise , Attend and I 'll prove by my song , The heel  --  not the head  --  wins the prize . Your genuine wit , Pray , miss , look at me , Is seraped from the kit With a fiddle de dee , Fi diddle diddle diddle dee .

" Your genuine wit , &c.; During the verses he dances  --  but particularly the last  --  at the end of which he stumbles against the chimney board and discovers Belmont . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Zounds and the devil ! A rascal concealed  --  some plot to rob the house  --  egad , by this fellow 's look I suspect a confederacy . Plot . Plotwell Confusion ! discovered and blown to the devil  --  well  --  egad I 'll prove myself a complete dancing master and make the best use I can of my heels ( runs off . ) Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy But other folks may chance to be as nimble as yourself , Mr Jackanapes  --  here John ,  --  Tom ,  --  Gregory  --  Geoffry. ( runs off . ) Bel . Mr Belmont ( comes forward ) What 's to be done ? where can I conceal myself . Emily . Emily Here , quick  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him coming back  --  he goes in , she opens the window and throws herself in a chair . Enter Sir Credulous . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Plague on the fellow , he has given me the slip  --  well , sir , and pray  --  heigh day , where 's the other scoundrel ? Emily . Emily Oh , sir , I am frightened out of my wits , on my screaming he threw up the sash and jumped into the street . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy I hope he has broken his neck  --  but why do you distress yourself ,  --  I hope Emily you have had no hand in this plot ? Emily . Emily You are always , sir , cherishing ungenerous suspicions . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Well , well  --  retire and compose yourself , and  --  by the by , we 'll talk a little further on the subject . Emily . Emily Heavens ! if he should go in there , we are undone . Exit . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy My life o n't she 's at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jenny Where 's my young lady , sir . Sir C.

Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Yes you  --  ma'am . Jen . Jenny Bless me sir , who do you think would trust me with letters ? where 's the good of being so suspicious  --  and if I did know any thing do you think , sir , I would blab ?  --  I 'd have you to know I can keep a secret , and where I undertake to be a friend , I can be a very useful and discerning one .

Jenny Oh dear , I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm almost ready to go into a fit . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Why , what 's the matter ? Jen . Jenny Oh , sir , I thought I saw a ghost . Sir C.

Plot . Plotwell Thereby hangs a tail , as the man said , when he took his wig off ; but as I am a condescending sort of snob , I 'll tell you a dismal story all about love and murder  --  but hold tho ' , it 's a song , so I 'll try , if I ca n't sing it  --  Song .

Lady Candour And so , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had departed , comes a messenger from my wise brother-in-law , requesting to see me immediately , for , as he was going to commence a course of studies in astronomy , he wish 'd my opinion as to a proper tutor  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! Emily . Emily But what does he mean by this new whim ? Lady C. Lady Candour And are you really so blind , that you ca n't see its drift ? Emily . Emily Not I indeed . Lady C. Lady Candour Listen  --  sir Credulous is aware that you devote the chief part of your time to the study of Astronomy , ' And having an idea that reciprocal sentiments , may lead to a reciprocal affection , ' he has determined to try this new experiment , to draw your affections from Belmont to himself . Now I think we may take advantage of this new whim of his , and bring about a marriage between you and your lover , in spite of sir Credulous . Emily . Emily How so ? Lady C.

Emily Ha ! ha !  --  why if we can but contrive to shut the light out , it will frighten the old gentleman out of his senses . ' Lady C. Lady Candour And to complete the preparation , I have communicated a large electrical jar , with the handle of the door , so that it may discharge its contents , on the person who touches it  --  you must draw him on to examine the fly , ' the rest will follow of course , and while his senses are bewilder 'd , I will have Belmont ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps give his consent to your union . Emily . Emily Heigho ! I wish the scheme may prosper , for between ourselves , my dear lady Candour , my guardian 's preposterous ignorance , joined to his extreme tyranny , render the pangs of separation from Belmont doubly poignant . Lady C. Lady Candour Never fear success  --  and the bitters of separation , my dear Emily , seem only to make more sweet the meeting of lovers . Exeunt . Enter Sir Credulous , and servant . Sir C.

Plot . Plotwell I remember once , when we were shut up together , criticising the latin edition of Shakespeare , we differed about the meaning of some word , but by referring him to the signification of the passage in the original greek copy , he immediately discovered his errour , and dropping on his knees before me , exclaimed most pathetically , " you have the advantage of me in every way  --  I am a man of fortune  --  and I am obliged to move in a sphere , where fashion engages my whole time , whilst you !  --  " Sir .

Plotwell No ! its a sign you are not used to cramp hands  --  writing greek and latin , has ruined my round hand . Emily . Emily It wo n't be amiss , I think sir , to write the meaning underneath , by way of memorandum . Plot . Plotwell But come sir , we trifle time , with your leave I will give the young lady a lesson by herself , just to prove what I am  --  and see what she knows  --  What shall I do  --  shall certainly has not recognized me , and I shall be found out .

Emily I 'll humour the scene , if its only to expose this imposter ( aside )  --  well , sir Credulous , if the choice lays with me  --  you know my favourite science is astronomy . Plot . Plotwellaside Astronomy ! I know as much about astronomy , as an elephant . Sir . C. Sir Credulous Testy What ! musing , sir , Plot . Plotwell I beg pardon sir , my imagination was warmly engaged in the skies  --  I hope it may' n't be cooled , before I go into the horse-pond. aside Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy The skies ! well then , sir , let us proceed without further ceremony , to attack the stars and planets . Plot . Plotwell Oh ! with all my heart , sir  --  hem  --  stars you see , sir , are  --  stars  --  now , the stars that are out of sight , we can not see , because , sir , these stars being out of sight , they are not discernable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testy I beg pardon for interrupting you , sir  --  suppose you were to hear a little of what Emily knows  --  merely to shew  --  Plot . Plotwell The young lady 's proficiency  --  an excellent proposal , sir  --  now miss , we are all attention . Emily . Emily That the stars are bodies of fire , we know by their twinkling , and that the planets are opake bodies , is evident , from their dull reflected light . Plot . Plotwell Very well indeed  --  I could not have explained it better myself ; and pray madam , how far do you suppose the stars are off . Egad , I 'll continue to ask her questions , which will prevent her from asking any of me. aside . Emily . Emily It is supposed , sir , some are so very distant , that their rays of light will be many thousand years coming to us . Plot . Plotwell Now curse me , if I know whether she is humming me or no. aside Upon my honour , sir Credulous , the young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you she 'd surprise you . Plot . Plotwell She has , upon my soul  --  and puzzled me too  --  aside  --  we are all attention , madam . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Aye , now  --  tell us the planets , Emily . Plot . Plotwell Yes , ma'am  --  the planets  --  the planets . Emily . Emily The superious planets are Mars  --  Jupiter and his belts  --  Saturn and Herschell . Plot . Plotwell Her shell ? No  --  no  --  His shell , if you please , madam . Emily . Emily Sir ? Plot . Plotwell Excuse me , madam , for putting you right ; but you know , sir Credulous , Satan was not a female ; consequently , you should have said , Satan and his shell , as well as Jupiter and his belts . Emily . Emily I was speaking of the planet Herschell , lately discovered by the famous astronomer of that name . Plot . Plotwell I beg your pardon , for noticing such a trifle , her shell or his shell  --  its all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses it in one of the dead languages  --  slackjawibus  --  yankedodelisimo  --  lapsus slingum . Emily . Emily A precious fellow this  --  but I 'll expose my philosopher presently  --  aside and now , sir , I have told some little of what I do know , I must request you to explain to me what I do not know . Plot . Plotwell Now , for my death-warrant , aside ma'am ? Emily . Emily I wish to know the nature of gravity or attraction . Plot . Plotwell What the devil shall I say , aside do you mean the gravity of the planets , madam ? Emily . Emily Yes , sir  --  that gravity which sir Isaac Newton supposes , keeps our system in such wonderful order . Plot . PlotwellStarting up Wonderful indeed , madam , yes ! sir Credulous , sir Isaac Newton was right  --  it is wonderful  --  I never think of it without astonishment , and am at this moment bewildered in a labyrinth of extacy ! he struts about . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy What I have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might Homer exclaim  --  frigid  --  zoni  --  hoc poloni  --  bacono and beefibus . Emily . Emily But pray , sir , what has all this to do with gravity . Plot . Plotwell Oh ! the malicious hussey  --  Gravity , you will take notice , is a principle law of nature  --  now , the gravity of the planets is  --  you remember what you heard just now about their being dull , and steady , and all that . Emily . Emily Yes , sir ! Plot . Plotwell Very well  --  now dulness is a nickname for gravity . Emily . Emily I 'm thunderstruck ! at his assurance aside . Plot . Plotwell As to attraction , this dull appearance of the planets , attracted the notice of the philosophers , and so gave rise to the word attraction . Emily . Emily Ha ! ha ! ha ! What a definition . Plot . Plotwell Suffer me , sir Credulous , to explain myself by a familiar example  --  are not dull people grave , and if I say you are grave , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gravity . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Certainly . Plot . Plotwell And if you look at a thing , does it not attract your notice  --  and if it attracts your notice  --  you will certainly allow it has attraction . Emily . Emily Pray , sir , will you give me leave to ask you another question . Plot . Plotwell Twenty , if you please , ma'am . Emily . Emily What is the reason , that the hot weather in the dog-days , should be owing to the dogstar Sirius ? Plot . Plotwell Damn that dog , Serus . I wish he was here , to bark for himself . ( aside ) Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Aye ! I remember . you shewed him to me one night , and told me he was the largest of all the stars . Plot . Plotwell Yes , sir  --  he is the largest , and of course must be the hottest . Emily . Emily Ha ! ha ! ha !  --  Plot . Plotwell Besides , sir , it is the peculiar quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emily . Emily Surely , sir , the stars can have no such influence over us  --  all the heat we enjoy , is from the sun . Plot . Plotwell I must beg your pardon , ma'am . Emily . Emily Nay , sir  --  then , why do n't we feel their heat at night . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy That 's true  --  how do you make that out , sir . Plot . Plotwell Why , sir , the only plausible reason I can give  --  is  --  the heat is so long in coming to us , that we do n't feel it ' til the next day  --  She 'll ruin all . aside . Emily . Emily Ha ! ha ! ha ! ( Plotwell winks and supplicates ) here 's impudence , why I declare . ' Plot . Plotwell Belmont ? aside . ' Emily .

Emily . Emily Well , gentlemen  --  I will leave you to yourselves , and under your present learned tutor , you must improve every hour , sir Credulous  --  to Plotwell you know your cue . Plot . Plotwell Perfectly  --  my master has told me all . aside . Emily . Emily You 'll excuse me sir  --  exit . Plot . Plotwell Oh ma'am ! bows obsequiously . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy And now sir , for your discoveries  --  Plot . Plotwell True sir , about the return of the comet , that has just passed us , and , of an enormous monster in the sun , seven thousand times larger than the earth . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy A monster in the sun , seven thousand times larger than the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plot . Plotwell I , sir , with all my knowledge , am as much astonished as yourself , and hardly know how to account for it  --  but , so is the fact . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy If such a monster were in the sun , it must have been seen before . Plot . Plotwell Not exactly sir , for it is the general opinion , it has been dropped there , by the comet , for you know , the comet supplies the sun with fuel ; but you have a telescope here I see , and you may have occular demonstration . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy That 's true  --  look and see if he is there now . Plot . Plotwelllooking through the telescope . Aye sir , there he is  --  egad , he seems in a damned passion , quick , quick , look sir ! Sir C. Sir Credulous Testylooks through the telescope . Mercy on us ! starting back Plot . Plotwell Well sir , what do you think now ? Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy I am petrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a terrible looking fellow it is  --  what wings and blinkers he has got ! Plot . Plotwell Wings sir ! aye , and look at his eyes , why sir , he is large enough to breed a famine in any christian country ; the mammoth , by the side of him , would only appear like a fly placed against an elephant . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Zounds what a sweat I am in  --  I wish I had remained in ignorance  --  astron my has done nothing but perplex me , ever since I first talked about it . Plot . Plotwell He begins to sicken already . aside . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy I sha' n't sleep a wink to-night  --  I shall magnify every little noise into an earthquake , and dream I am crammed between the tusks of his infernal jaws  --  my knees shake like aspin leaves . Plot . Plotwell I should be very sorry to foretell bad omens , but from the sudden appearance of this monster  --  I am afraid the comet is just at hand . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven hundred years ago  --  then my troubles would have been over . Plot . Plotwell But , as this discovery must be made , by the first philosopher who can examine the sun . we may lose the merit of it . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Oh ! damn the discovery  --  we shall never live , to hear it published . Plot . Plotwell I have drawn up an account of the whole , which I mean to make publick to-morrow , as a warning to my countrymen . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy If you live as long as you should say  --  for my part , I expect every minute to be cracked like a parched pea . Plot . Plotwell And , as you have seen it , as well as myself , it is necessary your name should appear to the account , which will add consequence to the publication , and , at the same time , give you an equal share in the merit of the discovery . Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy Well , give me the paper , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs it . I would sign away the reversion of an estate , for a certain prospect of thirty quiet years of life . Plot . PlotwellPuts up the paper  --  starts  --  and claps his hand to his head Hey  --  why no  --  can it be ? Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy What 's the matter ? Plot . Plotwell Perhaps it was only my imagination  --  but  --  Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy But what ? Plot . Plotwell I thought the room turned round  --  Sir C. Sir Credulous Testy It does  --  It does  --  Zounds I 'm as giddy as a goose . Enter Emily . Emily .
