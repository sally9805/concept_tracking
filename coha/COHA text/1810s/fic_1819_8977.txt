The late investigation of the Bank Committee has compelled the United States Branch in this place to stop discounting , and the State Banks do the same .

Mr Easy I have just received advices from Charleston and Augusta by the mail . Business is rather dull , and cotton on the decline ; however , this is no more than I expected . Hard . Mr Hardrun Why , few , I imagine , have anticipated the change . The high prices that cotton , tobacco , and rice , have commanded since the peace , have induced many to embark largely in the Southern trade . Easy .

" Two to one against him , ( the Major and the Field Marshal , ) is one too many .

" 2d Wit . 2d Wit Yes , it is a poor thing  --  and it is not . If it is to be read and criticised as a regular dramatic composition , with its unities , and plots , and catastrophes , and so on , it is insignificant ; but as a collection of natural dialogues , and every day occurrences , told just as they take place , in simple , natural language , it is excellent . It is a happy hit at the times , as Isaac Bronson says . 1st Wit . 1st Wit But there is no wit in it . 2d Wit . 2d Wit Who would ever think of putting wit in the mouth of a Merchant . All their witticisms consist in outlandish phrases , and a sort of slang , which is pretty well preserved in the Farce , I think . But why did Noah attack it ? It either was , or was not worthy of notice . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not , why notice it at all ? 1st Wit . 1st Wit I have heard that it has been attributed to the Major 's pen , and he is afraid , I suppose , that his literary reputation may suffer . 2d Wit . 2d Wit Ah , you have it  --  that 's it . The Major is a great literary character , but I never suspected him to be the author ; the " thing " is written rather too grammatically for the Major ; I observe it makes singular verbs agree with singular nouns , and plural with plural , which is not the case , you know , in the Major 's Book of Travels to all the Barbaries. 1st Wit . 1st Wit Oh , no , not at all  --  The Major shows very little respect for Webster and Murray . He handles them about as unmercifully as he does the Magnus Apollo , whom he will most certainly demolish with his goose quill .
