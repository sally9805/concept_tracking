By Timothy Ford , Esq . one of the Vice Presidents . Charleston , S. C. J. Hoff. pp. 31 . As these very respectable Discourses are already in the bands of many of our readers , and their merits sufficiently known and acknowledged , we shall venture to depart somewhat from our usual practice , by merely offering such remarks as the subject may suggest . We regard the establishment of learned societies as one of the principal causes , that have contributed to the rapid progress of the mind during the two last centuries . The ancient philosophers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too much secluded from each other and from the world . The learned societies of the present ( lay are united to each other , by a common object9 by frequent intercourse , by a mutual exchange of the fruits of their labours , and by a reciprocation of honours and civilities . They embrace persons of all ranks and all professions , the nobleman and the n-.nchanie , the merchant and the scholar , the statesman and the man of business , the observer of nature and the speculative man . They invite to all sorts of inquiries , they profess themselves of no school , they adopt no dogmas ; in the examination of nature they acknowledge no authority , but reason , and they propose no end , but the discovery of truth and the advancement of the dignity and welfare of mankind . Noble , sublime project , worthy the most enlightened nations of the most enlightened age of the world . We are not , however , claiming for learned soQieties all die discoveries and iml ) rovements , that have rendered the period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by individuals , in many instances unsupl ) orted and unpatronized , miay , in spite of public opinion , an ( l in Opposisition to ( loctrines that had received the sanction of the wise and good , and had been hallowed by time , and in violation of // what was deemed the sacred truths of religion . It is to such men , as Columbus , Galileo and Kepler , that we are indebted for the existence of such associations , and for the very spirit of the age in which they originated . The brilliant success , which crowned the labours of these great men , could not fail to attract the eyes of the world , and to inculcate the most important lessons . They afforded striking proofs of what the human mind was capable by a free and vigoroas exercise of its native powers , uncontrolled by human restraints . Columbus discovered a new world , Copernicus and Kepler reformed the science of astronomy , and Galileo overthrew the ancient physics and laid the foundation for the new . The telescope , the microscope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that not only astonished the learned , but were palpable to the most illiterate . A new scene was opened to the world . All became interested in the wonders brought to light by the new philosophy . Many were eager to enter on a career that promised so much to gratify at the same time a rational curiosity and a love of distinction . Princes and magistrates , the noble and the opulent , were ambitious of sharing in those honours which eclipsed the splendour of wealth and titles . Societies were soon formed . More ample means and more sure methods were provided for carrying on the work of discovery . IJniversities received new endowments . Observatories were erected and furnished with accurate and costly instruments . IPersons were appointed to make experiments and observations , with a view to the determination of important questions . They examine and improve the processes in the arts ; weigh and analyse air ; calculate the height of the atmosphere , and its influence upon celestial observations ; count the stars , observe their positions , and watch their motions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of ascertaining its dimensions and figure . A company of philosophers is seen with their telescopes and quadrants amid the snows of Lapland , and another pursuing the same delicate and difficult enterprise among the savages and whirlwinds of the Andes . Suitable persons are commissioned to repair to particular stations in different parts of the earth to watch the passage of one of the planets over the sun 's disc , a l ) l*enomet1on , that had scarcely been presented to human eyes , and that furnished the most accurate method of // determining the magnitudes and distances of the heavenly bodies . The ardour of these first adventurers is kept alive by the most surprising and unexpected success , by the novelty of the field which they undertook to explore , by the abundance and freshness of its fruits , and by the new paths which con. tinually open upon them as they advance . They are further stimulated by the continual accession of others , who are inspired by their example ,  --  by multitudes , who crowd around to participate in their achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the different ranks of society , and all Europe seems to be animated with an impulse , as in a new crusade , to wrest philosophy from the dominion of errour and superstition . We live to trace the progress of this holy war , and to witness its success in the emancipation of the human understanding , in a respect for truth taking the place of a blind submission to authority , in a restoration of a large portion of our race to the condition of thinking , intelligent , independent beings . It is no longer a question , whether the mind be progressive , whether , like the brutes , we soon arrive at the greatest improvement of which we are capable , whether it is our lot to labour and spend our strength for nought , to grope on from age to age in an endless labyrinth of doubt and perplexity . But however gratifying it may be to see the mind escaping from the thraldom to which it was subjected , and disentangling itself from the load of false doctrines and false opinions , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is enough to keep us humble inthe reflection , that we are so nearly allied to the authors and subjects of so melancholy a delusion . This encumbrance ,  --  which we take so much credit to ourselves for having thrown off ,  --  like that which we have substituted in its place , was once the pride of human genius . We exult in the labours of a few years , and look around us with a sentiment scarcely approaching to awe U*Ofl the venerable remains of ancient science , the scattered and mouldering fragments of systems , the work and the wonder of centuries . It is consoling amid these ruins to behold , exempt from the general wreck , the sacred monumertts of our Nligion erect and entire , and only stripped of the scaffolding of human contrivance which had been thrown around them . // We are permitted not oniy to see the evils from which we have been diivered , but also some of the dangers to which so great a revolution exposed us . It was not to be expected , that the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a state of constraint . The world 's great teachers had been detected in inculcating their own visionary schemes for truths , and distrust is naturally attached to all their instructions . Errour is found to pervade certain branches of knowledge ; others are accordingly suspected as equally unsound . The spirit of reform , which had been attended with such salutary effects in religion and many of the sciences , extends itself to every subject of inquiry and speculation . The passion for adventures , so long nourished by the splendid rewards which followed the earlier researches in geogral ) hy and astronomy , sought new fields in which to signalize itself . Not content **ith analysing material substances and torturing fire , air , earth and water , to extort some new secret , the active genius of the age manifests itself in new intellectual plieiiomena ; the world of thought is reduced also to its elements ; ideas , notions , sentiments , all the furniture of the mind , are subjected to new combinations , and made to pass in review before us , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caleidoscope . At one time we are taught , that there is no substance but matter , and no God but the vorld ; at another , that ideas are the elements of things , and that we are such stuff as dreams are made of . ' We have been moving in an agitated and troubled ZflC ( lium , v. hich has generated innumerable meteors , that flit across our path and emit a momentary glare , leaving us to pursue our way by that mild and steady light that comes from higher and purer regions . We have , moreover , at length , the satisfaction of contemplating the magnitude and value of the attainments we have made . We have ( liscovered what is the proper sphere for the exercise of our faculties , and what ought to be the end and purpose of our inquiries , and what the method by which they are to be conducted . We hare ( liscovered also , what may seem almost a self-evident truth , that the world is a machine , an object of experimental examination , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by chance or caprice . We are able to look with composure upon those celestial appearances , which once spread unh*ersal alarm and terrour . We are // delivered from innumerable impostures , that were formally practiseu UI ) Ofl the ignorance and credulity of mankind . Where are now the arts of divination , tolerated by the enlightened Romans , those of magic , sorcery , witchcraft , the trials by water and by tire , and the absurd pretensions of astrologers ; and to what are we indebted for this salutary change so much as to a proper understanding of the powers and operations of nature ? The progress we have made has taught us the importance of preserving the facts and principles , that may present themselves incidentally in our inquiries , however insulated and insignificant they may at first appear . We have already been able to perceive relations among phenomena , that long remained detached and neglected . The prol ) erty which amber possesses , when rubbed , of attracting light bodies , was well known to the ancients . It was by noticing other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led on by degrees to the explanation of thunder and lightning . A contractioit in the limbs of a dead frog , which at another time might have been thought unworthy of notice , by being carefully pursued , opened a new branch of electricity , and put an agent into the hands of the chemist , that enabled him to decompose the alkalies and earths , and , unfold the analogy , if not the identity of chemical affinity and electrical attractions . The fall of an apple , viewed in connexion with the familiar fact of bodies falling also on the tops of mountains , and at the greatest known distance from the earth , suggested to the mind of Newton , that the moon might be embraced by the same power . Hence the astonishing theory of gravity . Certain plumbers , not two hundred years ago , had occasion to raise water by suction , forty or fifty feet . With the utmost care they could cause it to ascend only ahout thirty feet . this fact coming to the knowledge of some acute men , conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the airpump , and finally the steam*engine. * The importance of this instrument to the arts , has been known for some time . Its utility in facilitating internal commerce is just beginning to be perceived . It has already greatly reduced the expense of the transfer of produce . It promises to make the Western States our neighbours , and what is still more , by promoting intercourse and mutual dependence , to make them our friends . Vol . VIII . No. 1 . *2i // An important relation has been found to subsist even be . tween physical phenomena , and the abstract truths of geometry , that had long been regarded as merely curious . The ancient geometers amused themselves with the properties of certain curved lines , formed by the intersection of a plane and a cone . These are now found to be of the greatest importance in Optics , Gunnery , and Astronomy . There is another curve called the Cycloid , which some later mathema* ticians had the curiosity to investigate , and thus unawares furnished the means of perfecting the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common life , is of no less importaiice in astronomy , than the telescope . Philosophers are like artists and mechanics , who pursue their several trades , independently , some working in wood , some in iron , some in glass , and the 1roducts of their labour are laid up in stores for use . By and by , some master workman appears and puts these different materials together , and forms a beautiful edifice . Nothing is more common in our researches , than to arrive at results altogether different from those , which we had anticipated . i'hus , the first astronomers were fortune-tellers , and the first chemists fortune hunters . The one studied the stars , with the expectation of discovering the fates of men , and the other made experiments upon metals with the hopes of reducirg them all to gold . Nothing could seem less calculated to effect a revolution in the affairs of ' nations , than an enterprise which had for its object , a record of the number , aspects , and l ) ositiOns of the stars . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the earth itself was a star , and that it was round , and that it had a western continent , as well as an eastern . The sciences , by their influence upon the arts , and especially that of navigation , have changed the face of the world and the condition of human existence . What a monument of human ingenuity is a ship , laden with the richest treasures , throwing itself upon the billows of the mighty deep , and borne by the winds and the *vaves , traversing this vast globe with such ease , security , and speed , protected as by a divinity from rocks below anti storms above , and guided with such certainty to its destined port . The ocean , once an interminable desert , the horrour of man , is , as it were , subdued , cultivated , and inhabited . While it yields an immense supply for our // wants and comforts , it aft'ords indirectly an employment , and the . means of subsistence to a considerable proportion of our race . Instead of being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union . We are no longer confined to particular islands and continents , like beings of different planets . We have become citizens of the earth , allied to all its inhabitants and interested in all its productions . We are united into one family , connected by a dependence upon each other , etilivened by intercourse , enriched by an exchange of superfluities , and enlightened and refined by a participation in each others discoveries , improvements , literature and arts . How mimerous are the benefits resulting from this free communication with the different parts of the earth . They meet us in whatever direction we turn our eyes . Our dwellings are adorned with the products of foreign arts , and our tables are spread with the fruits of foreign lands . It is not merely the luxuries and embellishments of life , for which we are thus indebted , but many of its necessaries and more important comforts are received through this channel. * Whence is it , that we have derived all this superiority over the nations of antiquity , but from our scientific researches ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that had long be en known , we find , that it will indicate the points of the compass . By making use of a familiar principle in optics , the equality of the angles of incidence arid reflection , in connexion with a graduated arc , we obtain the quadrant . By applying a spiral spring to a horizontal pendulum to act in the place of gravity , we obtain a timekeeper that may be used at sea , and which , by measuring time , measures also longitude . All these instruments are of indispensable importance to navigation . But these are not all . The sublime science of astronomy , aided by mathematics , nay , hy all the other sciences , has lent itself to this art . The light of all the heavenly bodies , even of those which are not It is computed , that more than forty ships are constantly employed in supplying Great Britain and her dependencies with the single article of tca . The coffee plant was transplanted from Arabia to Martinique not two centuries ago . The berry of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles of commerce . It is thought to have done more towards preventing the abuse of ardent and vinnus liquors , than the most eloquent appealsto reason and conscience . The potato , lately introduced into Europe from America is already regarded in some countries as the staff of life . Its value is just beginning to be known . Its fruit will he found perhaps scarcely inferio*r iii importance , as an article of food , to that of any other plant . // visible to the naked eye , has , as it were , been concentrated upon the path of the mariner . It has been said , we have our moon , of what consequence is it to us , that Jupiter has four ? . - their being removed from the sphere of natural vision is a plain intimation , that they were not intended for us . Still it is not to be denied , that by means of the telescope , we have appropriated them to our use . They often l ) resent as many eclipses in one night , as ours does in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance , the commencement and termination of these eclipses are instantaneous . These phenomena , therefore , have served , in many instances , to render us important nautical information , where our moon failed of doing it ; they have taught us , at the same time , the velocity of light , and a certain aberration , thence arising , by means of which we have been enabled to apply an important correction to all our observations , even to that of the moon itself . So also it is said , that it may be very interesting to the mathematician , that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones , but what is it to the mass of mankind , who enjoy the benefit of the arts without dreaming of any such thing . It is to researches of this kind , no less than to the mariner 's compass and quadrant , that we are indebted for this highly improved state of navigation . It is by the patient and unwearied labours of the study , by immense and most difficult calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts , tables and instruments have been provided , that make the profession of the seaman so safe , easy and agreeable . The abstruse doctrine of fluxions has given additional accuracy to nautical tables , and thus , by lessening the dangers of the sea , has rendered an important service to commerce and those extensive interests , that depend upon it . The introduction of the kine pox and the invention of the safety lamp are justly regarded as most important blessings to mankind , and the world is ready to acknowledge its obligations . It is not so apparent , how many lives have been saved by any great improvement in the abstract sciences , the invention of logarithms for instance , and there are fewer in this case , who recognize their benefactor . All the sciences concerned in building and navigating a ship are transferred to the art of war , which comprehends also those , which relate to engineering , and the manufacture of // gun-powder and fire-arms . An entire change has thus been effected in this art , the practice of which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The civilized nations of antiquity arrived at nothing which was a counterbalance to the hardihood and physical strength of the barbarous tribes , by which they were surrounded . They became a prey to savage ferocity , to a power , that is common to man and to brutes , and left the work of civilization to be begun anew . What would those savage hordes , who laid waste the earth , avail against a modern army , supported by a navy ? In order to carry on an effective war , it is necessary now that barbarians should learn a great , complicated , arid difficult art ; they must become the pupils of enlightened nations , owe them obligations , and with the art of war learn the advantages of peace ; that is , they must become civilized . We no longer stand in need of walls to protect us . Our very treasures are our security . We realize the great and important maxim , that knowledge is power . We hail the benign light of science , like the beautiful bow in the cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth shall not again be visited with desolation . Besides the influence which the sciences have through the medium of the arts , there is another point of view , in which they have a favourable aspect upon society . They afford an interesting employment , an intellectual subsistence , to a large class of persons in every enlightened community . Men are like children ,  --  to be kept quiet and out of mischief they must be kept employed . Give them toys and they will not play with edged tools . What an immense supply the sciences afford to these restless and busy creatures ? How many are employed in assorting and arranging the plants , insects , stones and shells , that are so kindly strewed over the face of the earth ? How many in climbing mountains , in searching caves and mines ? Formerly , gold and silver were the only metals worth looking for . Now all the metals have become precious , and the transmutation so long sought9 is , in an important sense , effected , not only with respect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arid all substances whatever . What an inexhaustible treasure to chemists , mineralogists , geologists , and also to printers , papermakers , engravers , booksellers and reviewers ? The sciences not only give us something to do* but something // to enjoy ; not only an engaging occupation , but the means of distinction . They have created a new order in the cornxnuiiity , an aristocracy , distinct from that which depends upon wealth , civil employment , military services and polite literature . The discoverer of a new planet or of a new metal is rewarded with a title and a pension , and what is infinitely more , with the gratitude of his country and the admiration of the world . Distinguished success in physical pursuits bears a comparison in point of mere fame to brilliant achievements in war . Buonaparte in the midst of his glory was proud to add to his other titles , Member of the National Institute . ' There have , indeed , been instances of heroism in the cause of science , that may well excite the envy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that have been made in the respiration of newly discovered airs , and the voyages of discovery that have been undertaken , not only in unknown seas , but in the trackless regions of the atmosphere ? What hardships and perils are some of our brethren now undergobig in the neighbourhood of the pole ? If they should be so fortunate as to meet in this secluded spot , with any of our species , who had hitherto been shut out from the rest of the world , what would he the astonishment of these persons to learn , that their guests had exposed themselves to all this toil and trouble , and braved all these dangers to find out , whether this part of the earth consisted of land or water , and whether the magnetic needle pointed to this or that part of the heavens ? They would perceive , that beside all our other arts , we bad found out one , perhaps the most important of all , that of becoming interested and happy in pursuits , which , independent of their immediate objects , derive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by our fellow men . While the sciences thus give to a great number of persons an employment and a consequence in society , they are the means of a substantial subsistence also . They tend constantly by their influence in improving and multiplying the arts , to repair the inequalities of fortune . Every new invention furnishes artisans and mechanics with additional business , and imposes a tax upon the more affluent , which is distributed among the labouring classes.t Beside the useful and orna j- We have already mentioned , that the Cycloid led to the theory of the pendulum , as the most perfect regulator of clock-work , and that this suggested that of the balance as the best regulator of watch-work , or pocketmental // articles , there are also many of philosophical amusement and instruction , as the telescope , the microscope and other optical , as well as electrical , instruments , the demand for which is sufficient to support large manufacturing estab * lishments in the principal cities of Europe . Thus , wealth , which tends to augment by a continual accession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a river , which , instead of flowing on uselessly within its banks , is by artificial methods , diverted into a thousand little streams , that irrigate and fertilize the country through which it passes . In addition to all that we have said , there is an intrinsic dignity in the attainments we have made . We consider ourselves as raised by our senses above those animals , that have not these means of communication with the world about them . The sciences , of which we have been speaking , are little else than expedietits , which we have contrived for enlarging the sphere of the senses , for correcting their errours , and supplying their defects . We have in the first place , by direct aid to our natural vision , become acquainted with a vast number of objects , that were removed from our inspection ; but , what is still more , we have invented means which have served as a substitute for the faculty itself . There may he beings , who comprehend in their view the revolving of the planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , on the other hand , there may be those , to whom the par'ticles of an acid and an alkali , in a state of effervescence , shall appear upon the same scale . Were our sense of sight such , that we could place in full view before us the planets of our system , as we do the little balls which we have made to represent them , we might have dispensed with all the labour and pains we have taken in observing and calculating them . So on the other hand , could we bring to the same scale the minute particles of solids and fluids whose attractions and repulsions have so much perplexed us , we should stand in little need of the science of chemistry . Is it not then , worthy of the highest admiration , that restricted as we are , we have , by our own resources and skill , supplied the want of faculties , that may belong to other orders of beings , so far removed from us ,  --  that we have time-keepers . This article , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives it , fLirnishes employment in the city of Geneva alone , to ten thousand persons . // extended in each direction those limits , within which we seemed by the ordinary use of the senses to be confined ? We have thus changed our intellectual no less than physical condition . While we have opened an intercourse with our fellow men upon this globe , we have devised methods of communication also with the universe around us ; we have penetrated on the one hand into those worlds of animate and inanimate atoms that lie below us , and on the other into those vast regions that expand above us . We have become a spectacle of wonder to ourselves , and we return from this wide survey , to ponder upon our nature , duty and destination .
