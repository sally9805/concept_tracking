" THE LIFE AND DEATH OF JOHN OF BARNEVELD , ADVOCATE OF HOLLAND . With a View of the Primary Causes and Movements of the Thirty ' Years War . " By John Lothrop Motley . New York : Harper &amp; Brothers . Mr. Motley calls his work a political study , and he furthermore says that his aim is to show how seriously political events are affected by the peculiarities and accidents of individual character . Thanks to his diligent research and acute observations in the elucidation of this matter , we have a valuable historical work . We can convey no better idea of it to the reader than to call it an account of a civil duel on a grand scale between John of Barneveld , an eminent statesman who ruled the Netherlands by mere force of intellect , and Maurice of Nassau , eminent as a military man and therefore popular , and who attained his ends by virtue of being the strongest . One appears to us as wielding power through the esteem and sympathy of his peers , and the other through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular prejudices . The graphic narration of the events which culminate in the destruction of the able statesman furnishes one more striking illustration of the triumph of force over reason , of superstition over intelligence . The effect of individual character on political events is conclusively shown in the relationship of Henry IV . of France and James I. of England to the Netherlands politics . The French king and Barneveld understood each other , and worked in common . Both were men of genius . The English king , pedantic and hypocritical , was a sort of kingly poltroon . The contrast between the jolly , wise , outspoken , capricious French monarch and the prosy , vain , selfish James is a striking one . Mr. Motley 's portraiture of these two men is admirably rendered . The personal influence of Henry in connection with the Netherlands and his worth to Barneveld are seen in the effect of his assassination just at a time when these two statesmen were about to begin operations that would not only have secured the consolidation of the Dutch Republic , but might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely changed the political destinies of Europe . Valuable as Mr. Motley 's book is as a political study , it is still more valuable as a powerful dramatic exposition of fanaticism . The most significant part of it is the account of the opposing religious theories of the day and their consequences . These are at the root of both the death of Barneveld and the failure of the Republic . If not presuming , we should say that Mr. Motley did not attach suP ficient importance to them . Ideas of sovereignty-whicfi seem to have precedence in his mind over other ideas in analyzing the problem of that day-of rights , of national policy , never well understood at any time , had no place whatever in the minds of the Netherlands people of 1609 , mad about absurd theological distinctions . At this time the Reformation was not yet a generally accepted thing , and although the Low Countries were Protestant , there was no conception of toleration , the great outcome of that event , and which must exist before people can entertain conceptions of political rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in the doctrine of predestination , and the Arminians , who rejected it , it is easy to see that religious and not political motives were paramount in all breasts . We can not therefore agree with Mr. Motley in regarding the religious element as merely " the atmosphere which colors " rather than " the essence which constitutes the tragedy delineated . " Barneveld 's death seems to have been compassed quite as much through the doctrine of predestination , forced on the country as national faith by the Synod of Dordrecht , as it was by any other personal or political motive . Calumnious reports , circulated by Maurice , made the people believe Barneveld a traitor ; the acme of crime was reached when , as an Arminian , he was proved to be a heretic . It was these miserable // religious dissensions which neutralized Barneveld 's efforts to insure the political unity of the seven provinces . This work is too able and too important to allow some other statements in it to pass unchallenged . In describing the colony of English Puritans which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this country , and who are known as the Pilgrim Fathers , Mr. Motley says : " Th*e were the founders of what was to be the mightiest republic of modern history . . . . To the fact that the early settlement of that wilderness was by self-sacrificing men of earnestness and faith , . . . there can be little doubt that the highest forms of western civilization are due . Through their provisional theocracy the result of the independent church system was to establish the true purport of the Reformation , absalute religious equality . Civil and political equality followed as a matter of course . " This view of the question , naturally a favorite one with New England writers , strikes us as rather partial . In our reading of plain historical facts we do not find that the Pilgrim Fathers are any more " the founders of what was to be the mightiest republic of modern history , " than the colonists of Virginia , the Huguenots of South Carolina , the Catholics of Maryland , the Calvinists of New Amsterdam , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Pilgrim Fathers , deliberately consulted their material and spiritual interests in emigrating to this country . Again , as far as ideas , or principles , or systems are related to the progress of civil and political equality , " it is very doubtful , to say the least , whether " the independent church system , " which is another name for sectarianism , has had any other than a negative effect in this direction . Sectarianism may have been of service in substituting many ecclesiastical governments for one , and consequently may have been an advance toward toleration ; but we doubt if sectarianism in itself has been of any service politically , except to modify the fanatical zeal against which " civil and political equality " has been struggling for the past five hundred years . The revolutionary ideas of France in the eighteenth century were very effective in the establishment of civil and political equality in our favored land , and so likewise were the ideas and efforts of those who , availing themselves of European wisdom , coupled with their experience of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute divorce of Church and State , the greatest political success of modern times . Were we called upon to account for the growth of civil and political equality here , we should say that it was the fruit of the attrition of man with man , family with family , and community with community , as elsewhere . To give the Puritans exclusive credit for founding our republic , and attribute to one body what belongs to the whole , past and present , is to totally overlook the effect of ideas and conditions lying at the root of all civilizations . " THE LEGEND OF JUBAL , AND OTHER PoEMs . " By George Eliot . Boston : James R. Osgood &amp; Co . " THE FORTUNATE ISLES , AND OTHER POEMS . " By Mrs. S. M. Piatt . Boston : Roberts Bros . From the East , across miles of ocean , and from the West , across miles of prairie , come two little volumes of verse , and lie side by side on our table . One of the largest women of her time utters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and take the measure of all ages . A soft voice from the heart of the American continent , broken and irregular , but tuneful , greets her majestic sister with melodies froni the home circle , mother lullabies , children 's prattle , and in its limited round of notes it is sweet and tender . We do not doubt that these two women would recognize each other as singers , though their different powers may be as unlike as the guitar and the organ : one a parlor and serenade instrument , the other the worshipful accompaniment of cathedral service and many-voiced choristers . Yet trifles truly and prettily played are welcome and refreshing , and Nelly Bly , Kathleen Mavourneen , and Robin Adair are always acceptable to the popular heart , which wonders a little and then goes to sleep over a sonata of Beethoven or an arrangement of Berlioz . Many sweet mothers will enjoy Mrs. Piatt 's sweetness and home feeling , who would only wonder and go to sleep over George Eliot 's broad philosophy and large discourse . Both singers have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare their methods , and measure their excellences . Take then their subjects . In the first poem of George Eliot 's hook , called Jubal , the era of Titans is celebrated , the great mystery of Cain and Lamech , of death introduced to the primeval world , the natural idlesse of health , of youth , and of beauty , the new and painful mystery of death , which through this horror of dissolution awakes effort in all direction to perpetuate themselves and become immortal . In the fine character touches which limn Jubal , Tubal-Cain , and other personages of the poem , the subtle difference of invention and creation is noted ; and the gradual development of music , from the rhythmic sounds of nature and man 's labor , the rapture of the discovery , the content of the musician , the joy of the people , the spread of the new art , and the persecution and unrecognition of the artist , form the themes of this really grand work , which is full of pregnant sentences embodying philosophic truth and beauty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the spirit of humble devotion and service growing in an ardent soul . " Armgart " is the artist , struggling , triumphant ; deposed , despairing . " Liza " is a softer tale of tender passion and richer language . " The Minor Prophet " and " Brother and Sister " are less to our taste , but with " Stradivarius " returns the nobility of the song . In the " Two Lovers " we miss lyrical flow , in spite of the intense , concentrated expression , and also in " Anon , " in spite of the tragic theme . Mrs. Piatt , on the other band , circumscribes her song within the limits of the present . Her sweet household notes treat of the eager curiosity of children , their little occupations , their loves , their disappointments , and she translates these into the vague regret of older people , and interprets them from her own experience . Intensely sympathetic with child life , she links it , almost painfully , with the completed disappointments of after life , and interpolates the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players will always lose , says her sad song ; and it seems to us a little morbid , though pathetic . How can she help , once in a while , breaking out into words of cheer , while chronicling the glad outbursts of childhood ? There is also a similarity , not merely in the subjects , but in the treatment . We are glad to have her occasionally slip outside her personality , and give us such a poem as " The Black Princess . " Both women have their roots in the common soil of humanity ; both are flowering growths , but the flower of one is the flower of the daisy , fair and freely scattered over roadside and pasture ; the flower of the other is a magnolia , with evergreen foliage on a noble tree , with a white wonder of a royal blossom , and a crimson seed cone beautiful to the eye and aromatic to the taste . These women , set each at the extreme end of the musical scale from the other , possess a common quality in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject and servant of man , and the ministrant to his soul . But Mrs. Piatt is more instinctively dramatic than Mrs. Lewes , who passes alternately from dramatic writing to narrative with equal ease , and obviously holds a narrative gift* as strongly as a dramatic power . Neither poet is very flowing in form ; but in choice of subjects Mrs. Piatt is more lyrical than Mrs. Lewes , and writes from her own personal experience , while Mrs. Lewes is absolutely impersonal in her verse . For this reason Mrs. Piatt 's poems may have a more human charm in their limited chords ; but for the same reason she will be apt to write herself out much sooner . It is obvious that most women and some men sing their songs from out their own lives , and like spiders use themselves up with their weavings . Leaving out the essential dif* ference in the culture of the two women , Mrs. Piatt will cease to sing when her circle of personal experience is exhausted . On the other hand , the large , imagina .. tive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She touches the great chords that sound through time . But this very largeness of Mrs. Lewes fatigues some readers , as some eyes find the mountains monotonous , and the hills everlasting in more senses than one , when their feet weary with climbing , and their breath grows short in the high , thin at . mosphere . And this largeness of her thought , which strains the attention , involves at times a limpidness and simplicity of style which approaches boldness. // Trees and shrubs can not grow on the mountain tops , and only the gray and white Edeiweiss , the flower of honor , creeps to the foot of the glacier . On the other hand , the prettiness of Mrs. Piatt 's verse degenerates into mannerism . To read one poem of hers is sweet , two less so ; then we quarrel with the iteration of sadness , and say " kisses " do keep " baby 's dimple ; " after that the jerkiness of style and want of lyric flow attract attention , rather than the grace and subtlety of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its unrest and hopelessness " MEMOIRS OF JOHN QUINcY ADAMS . Comprising Portions of his Diary from 1795 to 1848 . " Edited by Charles Francis Adams . Vol . I. Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co . This volume gives us the beginning of the diary kept by Jehn Quincy Adams " almost continuously for sixty-five years , embraced in nineteen quarto volumes , averaging five hundred pages each of fine writing . " We of to-day can not realize the full value of this remarkable performance ; it must be handed over to the appreciation of posterity . It is doubtful if uny other record of the same period has been kept at all , or , if there is one yet to appear , that it will prove a richer treasury of historical facts . Its true appreciator will be the coming philosophic historian . Mr. Charles Francis Adams compares his father 's diary in extent to that of St. simon . In this respect it is certainly equally remarkable . The comparison , however , suggests the points of difference between them . Most of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two countries in which the writers lived . Others are due to radical differences in the temperaments and intellects of the two men . It is easy to see in the volume before us that it author was not so keen an observer , not so versatile in taste , not so philosophic in his judgments of men and things , as his remarkable prototype . While both men enjoyed equal advantages for studying the world around them , each did it in a different way . St. Simon , in contact with the politicians of his time , dwells on the peculiarities of their characters , and is able to trace the effect of these on political events . Mr. Adams mentions the names of the men he meets , and in the main only records the details of a business interview . St. Simon 's portrait of society is that of an emotional artist , while that of Mr. Adams is the plain statement of an industrious chronicler . One illustration will suffice to show the reader the difference between the two diarists . Mr. Adams , arriving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his deathbed , was subjected on this account to certain official inconveniences . All these are given in his diary , with very slight allusion to the dying monarch . Suppose St. Simon to have been in Mr. Adams 's place , would not his diary have contained a rich recor* of impressions of the formality of the Berlin court , and especially of the dying and degenerate successor of Frederick the Great ? We do not regard as a defect in Mr. Adams 's diary an apparent lack of interest in things which would have quickened St. Simon 's dramatic pen ; this negative feature of it merely illustrates the difference of character between two eminent political observers . Mr. Adams 's diary has merits of another stamp , and especially from a local point of view . We can at present refer to but one of them , and that is the rare example which it affords of an American politician and statesman thoroughly devoted to self-culture . Mr. Adams 's assiduity in this direction is as exceptional as it was beneficial to him and to his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which shows us the formation of Mr. Adams 's character , be widely read , it would do much toward undermining that shallow laudation of common-school proficiency which is producing so much mischief in the national intellect . Mr. Adams seems to have been stimulated to self-culture by his father , John Adams , but the most powerful agency in the matter was that of a sojourn in Europe early in life , with the subsequent mental and moral discipline to which he subjected himself in preparing for a diplomatic career . In carrying out this object he prescribes for himself regular intellectual duties , to which he adheres with unswerving fidelity . Whenever he leaves the track , either for pleasure or through social obligations , he feels remorse , and makes a note of it . Here is his law for a day when minister at tho Hague : " Rise // and dress at six . Read works of instruction from thence until seven . Breakfast . Read the papers and translate from the Dutch till eleven or twelve . Then dress for the day . Write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . Walk till half-past three . Dine and sit till five . Read works of amusement till between eight and nine . Walk again about an hour . Then take a very slight supper and a cigar , and retire to bed at eleven . " This systematic appropriation of time and thought may amuse some , and strike others as a little mechanical ; but it was effective in his case , and worthy of imitation by those who would pursue a similar career . Let the advantages which Mr. Adams enjoyed through self-culture be considered in connection with the various offices he filled in the service of his country , and we shall see how indispensable it is . We have only to contrast his career as a foreign minister with that of some of the men we send abroad nowadays , to fully appreciate the value of general information , and a true sense of personal and national dignity . The government of his day was not obliged to take negotiations out of his hands and intrust them to more discreet and intelligent agents . In delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary routine of his *ffice he was not compelled to fall back on the attainments of his subordinates . Even when a foreign minister was at least a gentleman , the culture of John Quincy Adams made him what Washington said he was , " the most valuable public character the country had abroad . " " ANIMAL LOCOMOTION ; or , Walking , Swimming , and Flying . With a Dissertation on A*ronautics . " By J. Bell Pettigrew , M.D. , etc . Illustrated . New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co . Dr. Pettigrew is well known to naturalists and a*ronauts as the author of some exceedingly able papers on flight and other forms of animal progression . In this book he sums up his numerous original observations upon animal motion , and from the facts thus obtained he points out what he believes to be the true theory and method of artificial progression through the air . The track of all animals , whether moving on land , in water , or in air , is a figure-of-8 , which is produced either by the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode in which they are united to the body , as in animals . In fact , when the form and position of the hones , and the mode in which the muscles are applied to them , are considered , a close analogy is apparent between the locomotory members of all animals . The author points out that the muscles take precedence over the skeleton in animal movements , and thinks that too much stress ( comparatively ) is laid upon the bony structure in teaching the anatomy of motion . His observations reduce the motory members of all animals , both in structure and function , to the screw form . He gives full space to the discussion of the movements of land and water animals , but the most attractive and also the mist novel part of the hook is that which describes the progression of birds . This difficult subject has been studied by him with great care and corresponding success . He points out the structure and motions of wings , and shows that what appears to be an up and down motion is really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing is thrown into convolutions , which act upon the air in precisely the same way that the screw propeller . with its surface of evolution , acts upon the water . As the wing rises , its feathers open so as to form a network , and in this position they offer little resistance to the air . Closed , the moment the down stroke is given , they offer a broad surface impervious to air . From the locomotion of animals the author passes to the art of flying , which he believes has hitherto been followed in an entirely improper manner . The efforts of most aiironauts have been directed toward obtaining a machine sustained . by a gas lighter than air , the whole . power of the machinery being employed in producing horizontal motion . Dr. Petti0rew condemns this method as opposed to that which is uniformly found . in nature , where we may be certain of obtaining our best hints . In every natural form of flying , weight is a necessary element . All birds are much heavier than the air they displace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as . it has by some inventors , the effort has been turned toward forcing an inclined . plane through the air , flapping a number // of stiff ' wings , or turning large-bladed propellers . The author 's study of birds led him to adopt ftexi ble wings , which by an up and down motion would produce curved surfaces similar to those of the berew propeller . His book gives the mode of making them , and also tells of some experiments he undertook to prove that the wing motion of birds was successfully imitated . But he does not seem to have made any successful experiments with flying models . He has , however , the firmest faith that flying will some day be successfully accomplished by man , and evidently looks upon his own work as that necessary labor of analysis which must precede invention . This modest estimate is the more creditable as Dr. Pettigrew has made most important discoveries in this difficult field . His book is clearly and simply written , and illustrated in a manner which is exceedingly creditable both to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOICES CONCERNING AMERICA . " A Monograph . By Charles Sumner . Boston : Lee &amp; Shepard . This curious compilation of prophecies about America begins and ends with poetry , the first one consisting of a Latin verse by Seneca , in which the great moralist of antiquity predicts the discovery of a new world , and the last one of a revcry of future greatness by the compiler . Some of the prophecies are happy hits of the imagination , while others are the anticipations of reason and reflection ; some are worthy of note in connection with events , while others , and much the larger portion , are of no significance outside of personal sentiment . Of the predictions anterior to the discovery of America , that of Strabo , the ancient gesgrapher , who conjectured that there might be two , and indeed more , inhabited lands in the Atlantic ocean , is the most interesting , inasmuch as it affords us a glimpse of scientific foresight . The basis of it is knowledge . The poets , more fanciful , are therefore more amusing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare , pitches on Guiana , " whose forehead knocks against the roof of stars , " as the place where " the circles of an empire meet . " Drayton places Paradise in Virginia . The pious Herbert declares that Religion stands on tiptoe in our land , Ready to pass to the American strand . Fuller , writing about the time of the Puritan exodus from England , declares America marriageable , and hoping " to get Christ to her husband by the preaching of the gospel . " George Webb , *f whom we would know nothing except for Franklin , who has preserved his name , declared that Philadelphia would become " the Athens of mankind . " Time only is wanting to verify that prediction ! Another believer in the City of Brotherly Love , the Abbe Galiani , advises Mine . d'Epinay , in 1776 , not to buy a house in Paris , but to get one in Philadelphia . Honest Milton , who admits that poets " give a personal form to what they please , " views America chiefly as a refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Browne , not foreseeing American love for European travel , pleasantly fancies that the coming Yankee will stay at home and spend his treasure " in American pleasure . " The last and most popular of poetic prophets is the good Bishop Berkeley , who summed up the whole compass of sentiment in his famous line , " Westward the course of empire takes its way . " One might suppose that the statesmen would be more clear-sighted than the poets , which is to a certain extent true . Those of their predictions which are based on the increase of wealth and population are already fully verified ; and so are many which are due to a careful study of political problems . Turgot , regarding slavery as incompatible with a good political constitution , looked beyond its abolition , and foretold that the blacks when restored to liberty " would cause embarrassment by forming two nations in the same State . " Considering the reality , embarrassment is a mild term . De Tocqueville was a good prophet for and against our country ; that is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Sumner , in quoting De Tocqueville , confines himself to what he predicted about slavery and the material growth of the country . Had he dwelt more on what this acute observer says of the possible perversion of the forms of our government , he would have rendered his " Prophetic Voices** more instructive . Compiled as the book is , it tends to foster spreadeagleism , which is not only the // English rendering fer the French term chauvinisme , but a similar source of similar political errors . Governor Pownell , a colonial governor before the Revolution , who was an able advocate of our country in England during that event , because he understood the temper and interests of the people , was an honest practical prophet . Mr. Sumner quotes liberally from his sayings . They have some value because he knew what he was talking about . And yet he has not always proved to be right . When he declared that America ( meaning , of course , the coming United States ) would be the " arbitress of commerce , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , " and become a " free port to all nations , " he did not embrace in his comprehensive view the consequences of the protective system . Or must we , as in the case of the Athenian greatness of Philadelphia , wait for time to give the matter proof ? " MENTAL PHYSIoLoGY . " By W. B. Carpenter . New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co . This work was designed to form one of the volumes of the " International Scientific Series , " but having outgrown , under the pen of the author , the limits assigned to each volume of that series , it was withdrawn from that collection , and now , coinpanionless , is left to journey through the reading world alone . The well-known reputation of its author , however , will command for it the attention and respect of all readers , and give it a circulation commensurate with its merits . The work will be found as interesting as instructive , and to embody nearly all that is known on the subjects of which it treats . In physiology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in psychology a very intelligent and systematic expositor . Both sciences , however , are steadily advancing , and the best treatise on either must be , in many important respects , considered only previsional . We can not claim for Dr. Carpenter any important discoveries in these lines of thought , nor any great freshness or originality in digesting or elucidating the discoveries of others . He has all the timidity of a man accustomed to lean upon popular authorities , and to foster a conservatism peculiar to natures unwilling ' to war with traditional ways of thinking , lie has occasionally been pushed forward by the strong mental currents of more original and bolder thinkers , and many of his recent essays bear the golden stamp of these renovating influences . What with a wise division of labor and greatly improved methods of investigation , the earnest disciples of truth are gradually disentangling the great web of nature and unveiling its most subtle laws . Speculation to be worth anything now must be backboned by the scientifically adjusted phenomena of nature , and by words very distinctly representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolving clouds in the ghostly regions of word-bound philosophy is gone by , and man , no longer content with mysteries , seeks the faithful and literal interpretation of the realities of nature . During the last fifty years England has produced a body of independent thinkers and assiduous investigators , who have not only enriched themselves with the precious treasures of preceding toilers , but who have quarried deep enough themselves to add fresh material to the edifice of knowledge . They have ceased to consume time and to wear out their energies in battling about airy nothings , susceptible of neither proof nor disproof , and in rolling up the stone of Sisyphus . Mill has taught the present generation how to use the logic of the sciences in order to widen and deepen the channels of knowledge ; Darwin has discovered a new world in natural history , and has turned its chaos into order ; Huxley has given a new reading to the topography of animal structures , as well as additional meaning to their varied functions ; and Spencer has gone down into the heretofore dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn pearls of priceless knowledge from their sequestered corners . It is owing to this new and advanced order of studies , to this great and memorable flight of individual genius , that the universities of England , formerly centres of light , have now become eclipsed an*1l are mere dead bodies thrown out of the orbits of intellectual life . The mere mechanical reproduction of old forms of thought , and the vamping up of withered and phantom ideas , have wrecked and stranded these long venerable institutions . The great victories of the intellect at the // present day are no longer gained by men laurelled in the professorial chairs of stagnant universities . Their metaphysical myths , to gain even a hearing , have had to take on new verbal drapery in order , like a painted sepulchre , to conceal their dead forms . Their lately issued " Treatise on the Science of *Iorals " is , according to the " Westminster Review , " a painful failure , an expiring wail from a shattered and paralyzed brain . The energy with which , as a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always marked our industrial and commercial operations , the desire of nearly every person among us to speedily amass a fortune , and as a consequence the fearful strain placed on our bodily and mental powers and resources , give to a work like this of Dr. Carpenter 's an importance which ought to be fully appreciated in order to draw wisdom from its physiological and psychological teachings . In wrestling with the world , the proper economy and wise use of the human instrument ought surely to count for much , as its kealth and general condition more seriously affect the future than the present . We are the living organs through which the whole life of the future is to be transmitted ; and if we allow those orga4s to be abused or to degenerate , our innocent posterity will have to pay the terrible penalty of our sins . If , as many contend , our geographical milieu is inimical to our constitutions , if there is a tendency among us to sink below the European standard of sound health , vigor , and longevity , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-being and that of coming generations must depend upon a thorough scientific knowledge of our interior condition as it may be affected by our exterior , and a consequent conservative action on our part . The great value of Dr. Carpenter 's work for us lies in its elaborate treatment of our physical , intellectual , and moral fabric . It is with these vital parts of our personal structure that we ought to be thoroughly familiar , in order to secure their healthy condition by observing whatever laws are necessary to accomplish this end . It is a matter of almost daily observation that children fall below the standard of their parents , without even geing through their wear and tear . Doubtless there are numerous causes to be assigned for this , though exceedingly difficult to be rightly enumerated . The stormy discussions , so often uselessly indulged in of late , alsout education , afford us no light , as they are generally exhausted in the chaff and not the wheat of the matter . To build up educational doctrines in an absolute way , and without reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their naturally varied and varying aptitudes , is like abstract discussions about the ten commandments without reference to the moral condition of people to observe them practically Nothing is more prized or better rewarded than mere special training in law , medicine , commerce , handicrafts , and artisan callings , and this training is generally the result of mere apprenticeship . Education , strictly speaking , must be understood as the general and harmonizing evolution of all our faculties and their fitting adaptation to whatever is best suited to their nature . But as yet we are left in the dark as to how we shall *roduce the elements truly susceptible of this talked-of education , and how we can becomingly weld them into the anomalous and multiform conditions of society . To follow carefully the speculations of Dr. Carpenter , and to understand *ll his lines of thought , will show the student the folly of most of the theories now afloat on the subject of education . A youth may be educated out of harmony with his family and social position , and if then he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes embittered by disappointment , and perhaps poverty . Beneath the stratum of society there is ever going on a struggle of giants for the coveted goods of this world , for high places and the influence of power . The well educated and refined are soon elbowed out of this great contest . There is no place for them , and they soon sink back into penniless obscurity . Men of wealth and power therefore hold in little estimation most of the flippant twaddle about education , because their own success grew out of bold and dauntless action on men and things , and out of warlike and robust constitutions , never polished or refined by the piamice stone of education . " RECENT ART AND SOcIETY . " By henry Fothergill Chorley . Compiled from the edition of Henry G. Hewlett , // by C. H. Jones . New York : Henry Holt &amp; Co . As a genersi thing we dislike abridgments all the way from dictionaries to cookery-books , an abridgment suggesting the suppression of a good deal of valuable material . This one , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the character of the man is so clearly revealed , the arrangement and selection of his sayings and doings so judicious , we not only feel no loss , but are disposed to think that the editor has saved us a good deal of time and trouble in abbreviating the voluminous work as published in England . Henry Fothergill Chorley , for thirtyfive years one of the editorial staff of the London " Athenmum , " seems to have been a dilettante of the first water . He was born a musician , but necessity made him a critic of art and literature . He possessed remarkable qualities for this service , and became an authority , and indeed somewhat famous . Notwithstanding his success in this direction , he was ambitious of authorship , and wrote novels , plays , and poetry ; but he could not get the public ear , and his attempts in this way passed unnoticed except by friends . His best literary achievements , if they may be called such , seem to have been the libretti of operas , cantatas , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his fine taste in the adaptation of language to music . Refinement of taste , critical integrity , and other qualifications of which he was apparently unconscious , enabled him to become intimate with and respected by the foremost writers and musical composers ' of his time , and consequently a man of social importance . And yet , because he did not reach the ideal he aimed at , he regarded himself as a disappointed man The success he did attain was not that to which he aspired . Chorley was a character of which we in this country have no counterpart  --  a sort of bright , intellectual butterfly , whose radiance is the effect of the surroundings in the midst of which he dwelt and on* which he nourished himself . Among the famous men and women with whom Chorley associated , we find several Americans . The first one is N. P. Willis . Chorley was pleased with Willis , and seems to have judged him pretty accurately . lie speaks of him in the usual English patronizing way , half apologizing for being acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a necessity for me to have some one to talk over my schemes with , " and so on . The truth is that both were young travellers at the time they met , and equally conceited . Chorley seems to have recognized a fine trait in Willis 's character , that of giving a friend the benefit of his experience in a frank , honest , sympathetic way . Chorley encounters Hawthorne . He does full justice to his romances ; indeed , it is a proof of Chorley 's critical sagacity that he was the first in England to detect Hawthorne 's genius . It strikes us , however , tha't he is not equally just to the author himself . Chorley 's esteem of Hawthorne seems to have dwindled on the publication of " Our Old Home , " and of the extracts from Hawthorne 's journal published posthumously by his widow . It appears that Chorley offered civilities to Hawthorne which were not taken advantage of or recognized by him ; while the comments on English ways and manners in the above-named publications , together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressions recorded in the journal , struck Chorley with " an amazement almost approaching distress . ' * He sums it all up as " pettiness " in " a man so great and real . " There is no doubt that amour propre and ingrained English egotism entered largely into the sentiment embodied in this opinion . In respect to the civilities which Hawthorne did not avail himself of , consisting of sundry letters of introduction to residents of Liverpool sent him by Chorley , we suspect that he was not disposed  --  to be the victim of ordinarily polite people . As to the pettiness of Hawthorne 's journal , Chorley was too intelligent a critic not to be aware that the memoranda which form a journal serve a purpose known only to the author himself ; the train of ideas with which they are connected being imperceptible in an irresponsive publication . We can not close our notice of this interesting book without applauding and giving currency to a remark which shows that Chorley was a critic of no common stamp .

These are in fact in one sense " roundabout papers " on a philosophical subject . They leave the right impression on the reader 's mind without announcing in so many words what that impression is to be . In saying this we do not mean to cast a suspicion upon the earnestness of the style , which is both delightful and painstaking . The prehistoric man was of two sorts . One  --  the ancient-was of a nature which we have not yet learned to conceive . Our imagination fails us in attempting to picture a human being in every respect a brute except in pos sessing the ability to rise above the brutes . The modern prehistoric maa is he who has left dim traces of his habits in stone implements and similar relics . Him we can partially imagine , and his chief characteristic appears to have been ferocity when strong , timidity when weak .

The causes of nation-making are far more complex ; but on this point it is to be observed that the simplicity of the current views upon the origin of races qwq A Personal Narrative of Travel and Adventure inFarther India .

His expression often arrests the attention , and he frequently throws peculiar strength into his conceptions by a happy and picturesque phrase . " Foons . " By Edward Smith , M. D. , II . B. , F. R. S. New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co . Dr. Smith presents not only a general discussion of foods , but also the results of a great number of experiments upon himself , most of which have been previously made public in scientific works . He defines a food to be " a substance which , when introduced into the body , supplies material which renews some structure or maintains some vital process . " A medicine , on the other hand , is a substance which merely modifies vital action without supplying the material for sustaining it . Between these two is a class of substances for which he retains the generic term food , though their stimulating action is far in excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the known forms of food in detail , and discusses their character and value , and in so doing he finds that careful experiment usually con-* firms the conclusions to which the ordinary observation of life has led . Thus he proved by personal experiment that cheese when eaten in large quantities is difficult of digestion , but when taken moderately at the end of a meal assists digestion . He confirms the value of fish as a food for persons given to brain work , or who suffer much anxiety , on the ground that its larger proportion of phosphorus repairs the wear of the brain . As to the vexed question of whether unbolted flour ( Graham bread , etc. ) should be eaten , he says that the silicious scales which such flour contains are not only indigestible in themselves , but by irritating the membranes cause the removal of the food before the digestive process is complete upon those parts of the food which can be assimilated . For this reason it is a bad food for the poor , but may be good for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith long ago urged upon the British government the supply of bread made from bolted flour to its prisoners and paupers . Speaking of bread , the author thinks that Dr. Daugush 's method of raising bread by carbonic acid water ( ai*rated bread ) " is the greatest improvement of our time in the manufacture " of this food . As a whole , the book is a useful and suggestive one , albeit not very entertaining , and probably rather too encyclop*edic in its style to secure popular favor . // - READING Agassiz 's lectures , delivered as long ago as 1862 , on " The Structure of Animal Life , " one must come to the conclusion that there is nothing in the discoveries and , l discussions of the twelve years that have passed that disproves the facts they contain or shakes the argument they present . So far as that argument goes , it is a perfect one for the presence of design in the creation of species . That school of evolutionists which denies a ruling intelligence in tke universe can find no foothold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrations of this series of scientific reasoning . But for those evolutionists who are reverent as well as bold , for those who believe that evolution is a means used by supreme intelligence , and that though it did not begin of itself , it was so ordered from its beginning that no further interference with its operations was necessary , these lectures present nothing that refutes or even assails their position . They do not answer the question , " Why do not new species now appear ? " Nor do they show by any other than negative evidence , of a kind , for example , which is met by such astonishing discoveries as the recent ones of Professor Marsh , that the wide gaps between existing species may not be completely filled in , as they have already in part been filled in , by the new finding of extinct related forms . So far as the argument from diversity of structure goes , it is distinctly stated , and supported by well chosen and clearly arranged facts . They prove the immense , almost inconceivable antiquity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct plans in its construction , and the remarkable triple coincidence in the succession , gradation , and growth of animals . Few would be disposed to deny that these are the work of an overseeing intelligence . But it seems to us a needless limitation upon the power of that intelligence to insist that it could not , or did not , by its primal fiat , call into being forces capable of assuming by themselves all such directions and diversities . All the proofs accumulated in these lectures have no application what* ever to this point . Why not press Paley 's famous argument , founded on the instance of a watch , still further , and urge that if intelligence must be inferred from the creation of a being capable of repro* ducing its kind , it must be still more co* gently inferred from the creation of beings capable of varying into other kinds , as well as of the circumstances that might induce such variations ? It is an absolute non sequitur from the premises of facts laid down to say , quoting the words used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the animal kingdom is not a kind of work which is delegated to secondary agencies ; it is not like that which is delegated to a law working its way uniformly ; but it is that kind of work which the engineer retains when he superintends and controls his machine while it is working . " So far as regards the reverent and reasonable view of evolution above alluded to , these lectures leave that question precisely where they found it . - TilE opposition of superstition to science , and to the development of industrial facilities , is of high antiquity .
