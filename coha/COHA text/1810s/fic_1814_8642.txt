" Theod . Theodosia ( much affected , calling after him ) A thousand thanks ! a thousand blessings ! " enter FREDERICK , with knapsack , walks briskly on till he sees the sign , then stops . Fred . Frederick ' Liquors to sell ' ! It is very hot to day . But first let me hold council with my purse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be enough to buy a breakfast and a dinner ; and by evening , I hope to be at home . ( puts up part of the money ) I am very thirsty ;  --  holloa !  --  landlord !  --  ( sees Theodosia ) but what have we here ? a poor sick woman , pining , consuming away ; she does not beg , but her situation asks assistance , and should we always wait till entreated before we give ? we must forego the drinking ;  --  be it so ! to perform a good action satisfies both hunger and thirst .  --  there .  --  ( goes to her to give her the money ) Theod . Theodosia ( looks steadfastly at him , then shrieks violently ) Frederick ! ! ! Fred .

Theodosia I am so weak ,  --  my head is so giddy  --  the whole of yesterday  --  I had nothing to eat . Fred . Frederick Ah , mother , mother ! halloo , landlord ! ( knocks hastily at public house ) Land . Landlord ( looking out of the window ) What 's the matter ? Fred . Frederick Something to eat and a bottle of wine here ! quick , dispatch . Land . Landlord Patience , patience . ( shuts window ) Fred . Frederick ( to his mother ) Hungered the whole day ! hungered ! and I had wherewithal to eat ! I had meat and wine served up to me yesterday evening , at the inn , while my mother pined for bread ! Theod .

Frederick Ill ! and I was not with you ! well , never will I leave you more ! see I am become tall , and strong ; I will work for your support . enter LANDLORD , with a jug . Land . Landlord There is wine ; of precious growth ; a glorious bottle ; t is only franconian wine to be sure , but it is sour enough to pass for good old rhenish . Fred . Frederick Give it me . " What does the trash cost ? " Land . Landlord " Trash ! call one of the most precious gifts of heaven , trash ! good friend , my wine is no trash ! I have , besides , another delicious french wine in my cellar ; ay , you ought to taste that ; so rich , so luscious , when you have emptied the glass , it looks dyed all over , such a fine red .

Land . Landlord ( counting over money ) It is one dreyer short , but however one ought to be compassionate  --  " to revive a poor sick woman , one may overlook such a thing . " But take care of the bottle , and do not break the glass , there 's a verse engraved on it in praise of charity  --  I love charity . exit Theod . Theodosia I thank thee kindly , dearest Frederick ! wine is reviving , and wine , from the hands of a son , gives new life . " Tell me , how it has fared with you for these last five years ; t is a long time since you have written to me . " Fred . Frederick Ah , dearest mother , t is a hard matter for a poor soldier to afford the money for postage ; only think of the distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you 'll forgive me . " " Theod . Theodosia We easily forgive neglect , when the anxiety it occasions is no longer felt . " Have you then obtained your discharge ? Fred . Frederick No ; I have only procured leave of absence , for a few months , for a particular reason ; " but you want me ; " I will continue with you . Theod . Theodosia " There is no occasion , Frederick ; your visit will restore my health , and renew my vigor ; then shall I be able again to work , and you may return to your regiment ; I would not be a hindrance to your fortune . But it seems " you have obtained leave of absence , for a particular reason ! " did you not say so ? " may I know this reason ? Fred . Frederick Certainly when I left you , five years ago , you equipped me excellently with clothes , and linen , and money ; but one trifle you forgot ; the certificate of the legitimacy of my birth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be distressed about it , though it has cost me much vexation . " Many times have I been heartily weary of a soldier 's life , and was desirous of obtaining my discharge , that I might apply myself to learn some reputable , trade ; but whenever I mentioned this subject to any tradesman , the first question always was , ' where 's the certificate of your legitimacy ? ' that settled the point at once ; this " brought me into many unpleasant scrapes ; I was sneered at , twice I was even compelled to fight , and was put under arrest . " My captain , frequently admonished me  --  and at last , about five weeks ago , when another of these quarrels happened , he called me to him in his own room ; Fribourg ; said he , I am sorry to learn that you are continualy getting into quarrels , and incurring punishment , for in other respects , I am extremely satisfied with your service , and have a good opinion of you ; the sergeant has informed me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and desire that your certificate may be sent , or if you are inclined to go and fetch it yourself , I will give you leave of absence for a few months ; the time of exercising is over . Oh , mother ! your form hovered before my eyes , as he spoke so kindly ; I kissed his hand , and stammered out my thanks . He presented me with a dollar ; go , my lad , said he , may your journey be prosperous , and remember to return at the proper time . " Theod . Theodosia ( who had listened with embarrassment . ) And you are come hither , Frederick , for the certificate of your birth ! oh heavens ! ( bursts into tears ) Fred . Frederick What is the matter ! for God 's sake , what is the matter ? Theod . Theodosia Alas ! there is no such certificate . Fred . Frederick How ! Theod . Theodosia Thou art  --  a  --  natural son . Fred . Frederick And who is my father ? speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortures me . Fred . Frederick ( recovering himself , speaks mildly and affectionately ) Be not alarmed . Still I am your son ; tell me only , who is my father ? Theod . Theodosia When you left me , five years ago , you were too young to be entrusted with such a secret . Now , your maturer years demand my confidence . You have become a man , and a good man ! my fair maternal hopes , have not deceived me ; oh , I have heard , full often , how consolatory it is to the aggrieved to unburthen their hearts by recounting their wrongs.  --  Thanks , thanks be to heaven , the hour is arrived , in which I can enjoy this consolation ; my son is my confident , be he also my judge , for a severe judge I must deprecate , but my son will not be severe . " Fred . Frederick Speak , my mother ! lay open your whole heart ! tell me all . " " Theod . Theodosia Ah , my son , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue . Do not then look at me . " Fred . Frederick Know I not well the heart of my mother ! accursed be the thought that would condemn her for a weakness  --  of a crime she is incapable . Theod . Theodosia You village , the spire of whose church you see at a distance , is the place of my birth . My parents were pious and good cottagers ; poor , but honest . When I was fourteen years old , I chanced one day to be seen by the lady of the castle ; I pleased her , she took me to her mansion , and delighted in forming my rustic mind . " She put good books into my hands ; I was instructed in french and music ; my ideas and capacities developed themselves , but so also did my vanity ; yes , under the appearance of reserve , I became a vain , silly girl . " I had just attained my seventeenth year , when the son of my benefactress , who was in the saxon service , obtained leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time my seeing him ; he was handsome ; he talked to me of love , of marriage ; " he was the first man who had paid homage to my charms ; " ah , Frederick , do not look at me . I can not go on . ( he casts down his eyes , and presses her hand to his heart ) He feigned the most ardent love promised me marriage after the death of his aged mother ; swore eternal faith and constancy ; need I say more ? we were both awakened from our sweet intoxication , and shuddered at the fearful prospect of the future ; I had put every thing to the hazard  --  he only had to fear the anger of his mother , " a good , but inexorably strict woman . " How tenderly did he conjure me , how affectingly did he entreat of me not to betray him ! " how seducingly , how ardently did he promise hereafter to make me amends for all ; and so dearly did I love him that " I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seducer ; to bury his image in my heart ; and patiently endure , for his sake , whatever sorrow might be in store for me . Alas , t is much indeed , that I have suffered , I was driven indignantly from the house , and when I came to the door of my afflicted parents , there too was I denied admittance . My father upbraided me bitterly , and even was about to curse me , when my mother tore him hastily away . She soon returned  --  threw me a crooked dollar , which she wore about her neck , and wept ; since that time I never have seen them . But the dollar I have still ; ( shows it ) I have suffered hunger rather than part with this ! ( gazes on it some time , kisses it , and restores it to its place ) without a house , in which to hide my head , without money , without friends , I wandered a whole night in the open fields . Once , I had arrived at the river side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tempted to throw myself in under the mill wheel , thus at once to end my misery . But immediately the image of the minister of the parish presented itself before me , " with his gentle venerable mien . I started back , and looked round me to see whether he were not behind me . " The thought of him , and of his precepts awakened my confidence ; " morning came on , " I resolved to go to his house . He received me affectionately , uttered not a single reproach ; what is done , he said , is done ; heaven pardons the penitent ;  --  " reform then , my daughter , and all may yet be well . Here , in this village , however , thou must not remain ; that will be to thee a continued mortification , and a scandal to my parishoners ;  --  but , " and here he put a piece of gold into my hand , together with a letter which he had written in my behalf ; go to the town , my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is directed , with her thou wilt be safe , and she will besides give thee instruction in what manner to obtain an honest livelihood . " With these words he laid his hands upon my forehead , and giving me his blessing , promised also to endeavor to soften my father . Ah , I seemed now to receive new life ! " on my way to the town I reconciled myself with my creator , and solemnly vowed never again to deviate from the path of virtue ; that vow I have strictly kept , so far may you still respect me , my Frederick . Fred . Frederick And my father !  --  ha ! Theod . Theodosia Your birth , was to me the cause of much sorrow , and much joy ; twice did I write to your father , but God only knows , whether he received the letters , no answer have I ever obtained . Fred . Frederick ( hastily ) No answer ! " Theod . Theodosia Be calm ! my son , be calm ! it was in time of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bustle and confusion throughout the whole country ; the troops of three different powers pursued each other alternately ; how easily then might letters be lost ; no , he certainly never received mine , for he was no villain . " " Fred . Frederick No villain ! and not seek you ! " Theod . Theodosia Since then , indeed , I have never troubled him ; it might be pride , or call it what you please , but I thought that if he had not forgotten me , he would certainly seek information concerning me , and come to see me ; but alas , he came not , and some years after I even heard ( she sighs deeply ) that he was married . Fred . Frederick Oh heaven ! and my father ! Theod . Theodosia Thus was I compelled to bid farewell to my last ray of hope ; in silence and solitude , I inhabited a poor cottage , where I gained a livelihood by the work of my hands , and by instructing the neighboring children in what I had learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my only joy ; and on your education I bestowed all that I could spare from the necessaries of food , and clothing . My diligence was not ill repaid ; you were a good boy , only your wildness , your youthful fire , your love for a soldier 's life , and desire to ramble about the world , occasioned me many a heart-ache ; at last I thought it must be as God pleases ! is it the boys destination ? I will not hinder him , though my heart should break at the separation ; five years ago , therefore , I suffered you to depart ; not long since , I was attacked by a lingering sickness ; my little store scare sufficed for physician , nurse , and medicines , and I was obliged a few days ago , to turn my back upon my poor little cottage , as I had no longer wherewithal to pay the rent . My only resource was to totter along the road , and solicit a morsel of bread from the charity of those who happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick had suspected this , how bitter would have been every morsel he eat , every drop that he drank . Well , heaven be praised ! I am here again , you are alive , and I will remain with you . " Alas , however , I have not learnt any art , any trade , but I have a pair of nervous arms , I can guide the plough , I can wield the flail ; I will hire myself as a day laborer , and at night copy writings for some lawyer ; for thanks to you , my good mother , I write a fair , and legible hand . Oh , all will go well ! God will help us , for he supports those who honor their parents . " Theod . Theodosia ( " clasps him in her arms " much affected . ) What princess could offer me an equivalent for such a son . Fred . Frederick One thing you have still forgotten , mother : what is my father 's name ? Theod . Theodosia Baron Wildenhain . Fred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodosia There once lived his mother , but she is dead . He himself married a noble heiress in Franconia , and , as I am assured , has to please her for ever forsaken his native country . Here , in the mean time , lives a steward , who manages the estate , at his pleasure . Fred . Frederick I will hasten to the baron , my father , boldly face him , and take you to him . " How great is the distance of Franconia ; only so far has he removed himself . And has he escaped from his conscience , at so short a distance ? truly , a lazy creeping kind of a conscience ! twenty years has it been crawling to Franconia , and not yet overtaken him . Oh , fy , fy "  --  wherefore must I know my father , when my father is not an honest man ? my heart was satisfied with a mother , a mother who has taught me to love , and why should I know a father , who will teach me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! let him remain where he is , and feast , and pamper himself till his last hour , and then he may see how he has prepared himself to meet his God . Is it not true , mother , that we need him not ! we will "  --  but what is the matter ! your countenance is changed ! mother , what is the matter ? Theod . Theodosia ( very weak and almost fainting . ) Nothing ! nothing ! my joy ! too much talking ! I wish to be quiet awhile . Fred . Frederick I never till now perceived , that we were in the highway . ( knocks at a public house door ) Halloo ! landlord ! Land . Landlord ( at window . ) Well , what is the matter now ? Fred . Frederick Here , I want a bed in an instant for this poor woman . Land . Landlord ( sneeringly . ) A bed " for this poor woman ! ha , ha , ha ; "  --  last night she lay in the stall , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuts the window ) Fred . Frederick Cursed scoundrel ! ( knocks in despairing anguish at cottage door ) halloo ! halloo ! enter HUBERT , from cottage . Hubert . Hubert God preserve you , what do you want ? Fred . Frederick Good friend ! look at this poor woman ! she is fainting here in the open air . She is my mother . Do pray let her have a corner in your house , where she may rest for half an hour . I beg it for God 's sake , and heaven will reward you . Hubert . Hubert Hold your peace , I entreat ! I understand you perfectly well . ( speaks into house ) Wife make up the bed there , quickly ; you can lay the boy upon the bench in the mean time . ( to Frederick ) Do nt tell me a long story again about God rewarding , and heaven paying ; we who live in such huts , know that when we do a kind action , we are sure to find our reward  --  here . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us lead her in gently ; a bed , as good as I can give her , she shall have , but indeed , she will not find much in my house besides . they led her into the cottage END OF THE FIRST ACT . ACT II . SCENE I  --  a room in the cottage . THEODOSIA , FREDERICK , HUBERT and WIFE discovered . Theodosia reclining on a rustic couch . Frederick , near her , Hubert and wife employed about the cottage . Fred . Frederick Dear good people , have you nothing then ? nothing strengthening  --  nothing reviving ! Wife . Wife Run , husband , to our neighbor at the public house ; and fetch a bottle of wine . Fred . Frederick Ah ! that will not do ! his wine is as bad as his heart ; she has already tried that , and I fear it has proved poison to her . Hubert . Hubert Go and see , wife , whether the black hen has not laid an egg  --  a new laid egg boiled soft  --  Wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( much affected ) God bless you , and reward you for your kind-heartedness : do you hear , mother ? ( Theodosia nods her head ) do you like any of these things ! ( she makes a motion as declining them ) she does not fancy them ! is there no physician in the neighborhood ? Hubert . Hubert There is a horse doctor lives in the village ; but I never in my life saw any other . Fred . Frederick What shall I do ? she will die in my arms ! kind people pray for us  --  pray I entreat you ! I can not pray myself . Theod . Theodosia ( in a broken voice ) Be comforted , dear Frederick  --  I am well  --  I am only faint  --  very faint  --  some nourishing food , or a glass of good wine  --  Fred . Frederick Yes , immediately ! but where shall I procure it ? no money , none , not a doit ! Wife . Wife Look you here , husband ! did you carry the money for the rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , the more 's the pity  --  what can be done ? it is true , as I am an honest man , that I have not a single doit in the house . Fred . Frederick I will  --  I will beg ; and if they will not give me , I will rob ! good people , take care of my poor mother  --  do what you are able ! give her what help you can ! I will soon return . rushes out Hubert . Hubert Should he but step to our minister , he 'll give something for certain . Theod . Theodosia Does the worthy minister then still live ? Wife . Wife Alas , no ; the good old gentleman ! it has pleased God to take him ! he died two years ago , worm out , and weary of life . Hubert . Hubert He went out like a lamp . Wife . Wife ( wiping her eyes ) We have reason enough to weep for him . Hubert . Hubert ( with tears ) He was our father . Theod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wife We shall never have such another . Hubert . Hubert Well , well , let every man have his deserts ;  --  we must not disparage any body ; our present minister is also a worthy good man . Wife . Wife Yes , indeed , husband ; but very young . Hubert . Hubert T is true , we ca n't look up to him , with quite so much respect ; our hearts do nt take to him so readily  --  but our old minister himself , you know , was once young . Wife . Wife ( to Theodosia ) This gentleman was tutor in the family ; and my lord , the baron , was so well satisfied with him , that he made him our minister . Hubert . Hubert And well he might be satisfied ; for to be sure our young lady , God bless her , is a charming affable creature . Wife . Wife Not at all proud . When she comes to church , she nods her head round to all the countrywomen , first to one and then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pew she holds her fan before her face , and prays with such devotion ! Wife . Wife And during the sermon , she never once turns away her eyes from the minister . Theod . Theodosia ( with emotion ) And who is this young lady ? Hubert . Hubert The daughter of my lord the baron . Theod . Theodosia Is she here then ? Wife . Wife Here ! yes , to be sure , did you not know that ? next Friday it will be five weeks since his lordship made his entry into the castle , bag and baggage . Theod . Theodosia Baron Wildenhain ! Wife . Wife Yes , my lord himself . Theod . Theodosia And his lady ? Hubert . Hubert Oh no ; her ladyship is dead ; they lived some hundred miles off in Franconia ; and while her ladyship was alive , my lord never came amongst us.  --  That has frequently been a great loss to us. ( in an under voice ) She was a proud kind of a lady , with a heap of fancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dead . The baron is still a very good kind of gentleman ;  --  scarcely had my lady closed her eyes , when he resolved immediately to leave the place , and returned to Wildenhain . And well he might , for this is his native place ; here he grew up to manhood ; many a time has he joined in our rural sports ; and has often danced with my wife on a Sunday evening under the lime trees .  --  Do nt you remember it , wife ? Wife . Wife Oh yes , to be sure I may well remember it .  --  The young gentleman used to wear a red coat , and fine buckles set with sparkling stones . Hubert . Hubert Afterwards , indeed , when he became an officer , he turned out something wild ; but young folks must sow their wild oats ; the soil was naturally good , but the richest earth , you know , will sometimes bear weeds . Wife . Wife But do you remember , husband , what a piece of work he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must not bring up such old stories . Besides , we do nt know that he was the father of her child ; she never said so . Wife . Wife Well , for all that , I 'd lay my Sunday gown and laced cap that he was the man , and nobody else . No , no , husband , you must not defend that  --  that was wicked . Who knows whether the poor creature has not died of hunger and grief ; and her poor father , he might have lived longer , if he had not been so heart-broken about it . ( Theodosia faints , Hubert sees it first ) Hubert . Hubert Wife ! help , help . Wife . Wife Ah , poor woman ! what 's the matter ? Theod . Theodosia Nothing !

Baron Wildenhain So much the better ; what , indeed , should a young , lively girl of sixteen like you , have to do with restlessness . You have a father who loves you tenderly , and a suitor who begs permission to love you .  --  How do you like the count Cassell ? Amelia . Amelia Very well . Baron .

Amelia And when I awaked , my eyes were really wet . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Hear me , Amelia ; when you dream again of the minister , let it be that he stood at the altar , and you and the count stood before him , and exchanged rings . What think you of that ? Amelia . Amelia I will most certainly , papa , if you command it . Baron .

I mean , that at that time the count Cassel simpered and ogled with you , danced an elegant minuet or two with you , poured can de mille fleurs upon your pocket handkerchief , and God knows what he was talking about all the time . Amelia . Amelia God knows what indeed ! I 'm sure I remember nothing about it . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Nothing ! Amelia . Amelia If it would be a satisfaction to you , I will endeavor to recollect as much as I can . Baron . Baron Wildenhain No , no , there is no occasion . " What one is forced to try to recollect , can only be brought forth from a corner of the memory , not from the recesses of the heart . " You do not then love him ? Amelia . Amelia I believe not . Baron . Baron Wildenhain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to make you understand the connexion between his visit , and my questions . His father is a privy counsellor ; a man of wealth , and rank ! dost thou hear ? Amelia , Amelia Yes , dear father , if you command it . But , our minister always told me that I should not regard such things ; that wealth and rank are mere gifts of chance . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Well , well , he is right enough in that . But if it so happens that wealth and rank , go hand in hand with merit , then they are an advantage . You understand me ? Amelia . Amelia Perfectly ! ( with artless simplicity ) and is that the case with the count Cassell ? Baron . Baron Wildenhain ( embarrassed ) Humph ! his father , has rendered the state important services ; he is my old friend ; " he was my suitor with your mother , and I have great obligations to him ; and because he so earnestly wishes for a marriage between you and his son ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the young man so ardently  --  Amelia . Amelia Does he suppose that ? Baron . Baron Wildenhain Yes ; but it appears to me that you are not of the same opinion . Amelia . Amelia Not entirely . Still if you command , dear papa . Baron . Baron Wildenhain I tell you , child , that one must not command in such things ; a marriage without love is absolute slavery ; none but congenial minds should be united . I would not pair a nightingale with a finch ; if you like each other , be it so ; if not , here let the matter rest . ( more calmly ) Attend , my Amelia , the whole of the affair is this  --  can you , or can you not , love this man ? if you can not , then we must send him back with a refusal . Amelia . Amelia Dear father , it appears to me that I never shall love him . I have read so much in romances about love , how strange and wonderful are its effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop ! I will put a few questions to you , answer them with sincerity , Amelia ; with strict sincerity . Amelia . Amelia I have never answered you otherwise . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Are you pleased when you hear people talk of the count ? Amelia . Amelia Good or ill ? Baron . Baron Wildenhain Good , good . Amelia . Amelia Oh , yes , I am always pleased when I hear good of any man . Baron . Baron Wildenhain But are you not elated , when you hear him mentioned ? Amelia . Amelia No . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Are you not embarrassed ? Amelia . Amelia No . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Do you not wish sometimes , that he should be made the subject of conversation , yet have not courage to begin talking of him yourself ! Amelia . Amelia No . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Would you not defend him , if you should hear any one find fault with him ? Amelia . Amelia Oh , certainly , if I could . My tutor Arnaud  --  Baron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Arnaud at present . How do you feel when you see the count ? Amelia . Amelia Very well . Baron .

Baron Wildenhain Ah , ha ! now it 's coming out . Amelia . Amelia It was at the ball , when he trod on my foot . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Do nt be foolish , Amelia ! do nt you cast down your eyes when he addresses you ? Amelia . Amelia I never cast my eyes down before any body . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Do you not play with your apron or handkerchief when he is talking to you ? Amelia . Amelia No . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Does not your face glow , when he makes you a fine speech ? referring , perhaps , to love or marriage . Amelia .

Baron Wildenhain Do you not know what beauty is ? or do you not know whether you think him handsome ? Amelia . Amelia I never particularly examined him . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Bad again ! how did you feel , when he came yesterday evening ? Amelia . Amelia I was vexed ; for at the very time the servant so unseasonably called me , I was walking with Arnaud on the little romantic hill . " Baron . Baron Wildenhain Unseasonably ! humph ! well , only one more question . Have you not undesignedly dressed your hair this morning , with unusual care , and selected a becoming dishabille ?

Baron Wildenhain ( warmly ) Listen to me , Amelia ! if you repeat again that damned word command , I may be tempted perhaps to command indeed . ( more mildly ) To see you happy , my child , is my earnest wish , and commands can not produce happiness . " Marriage is a very unharmonious duett , if the tones are ill assorted ;  --  therefore the great composer has planted in our hearts the pure harmony of love .

" And would you believe it , this fellow , this Henri , has been thirty years in our service ! for thirty years has he been provided in our family with every thing , for which a man of his extraction can have occasion , and what does he now in return ? forgets my pommade ; leaves it standing on the window , " as I am a vrai cavalier .

Arnaud . Arnaud I have sought it with all diligence , but hitherto in vain . Baron . Baron Wildenhain Believe me , indeed , this has occasioned me many a sleepless night . How often is a man guilty of errors in his youth , which in age , he would give all he possesses , could they be obliterated .

But if motives of more convenience , if parental authority , rashness or caprice , tie the bonds of Hymen , then alas ! the state of matrimony has no pleasant side . The miserable pair , victims of a late repentance , drag along their galling chains . Gall infuses itself into their conversation , coldness into their caresses .

Wife If your son did but know what has been sent in his absence he 'd have been here long ago . Theod . Theodosia I am so anxious . Wife .

Wife Yes , he is very attentive in visiting all his parishioners , and then he asks how we go on with our employments , and how we live among each other  --  if there 's any quarrels or discontents among us , he makes them up ; if any poor man is in great want he assists him .

Hubert Do you hear , wife , come this way . exeunt Hubert and wife Arnaud . Arnaud We are alone . Theod . Theodosia Before I tell you what I was , and who I am , allow me to ask you some questions . Are you a native of this country ? Arnaud . Arnaud No , I came from Franconia . Theod . Theodosia Did you know the worthy old minister , your predecessor ? Arnaud . Arnaud No . Theod . Theodosia ( inquisitively ) You really then do not know any particulars of my unhappy story , and it was merely chance that brought you hither ? Arnaud . Arnaud If you are indeed the person I suppose you , and whom I have so long sought , your story is not wholly unknown to me . Theod . Theodosia Whom you suppose ? and whom you have so long sought ? who then gave you such a commission ? Arnaud . Arnaud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theod . Theodosia Indeed ! oh , quickly tell me then  --  whom do you suppose me to be ? Arnaud . Arnaud Theodosia Fribourg ! Theod . Theodosia Yes , I am the unfortunate , seduced Theodosia ! and the man who takes so deep an interest in my fate  --  I suppose is baron Wildenhain ; he who robbed me of my innocence , the murderer of my father , who for twenty years consigned me and his child to misery , and who now hopes to atone for all by a despicable purse of gold . I know not , with what view you may now come hither , whether to reproach , or to console me , or whether to banish me from these borders , that my presence may not be a reproach to the voluptuary ; but one request I have earnestly to make you ! carry back this purse to the man who has ruined me ; tell him , that my virtue was not to be bartered for gold ; that gold can not repay me for my lost peace of mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gold . Tell him that the poor miserable Theodosia , though clothed in beggars rags , is still too proud in spirit to receive benefits from her seducer . We have no feelings now in common with each other  --  he despised my heart ; with equal contempt I spurn his gold ! he has trampled me under foot  --  I trample under foot his gold ! ( throws the purse disdainfully on the ground ) But he shall be left to his repose ; wholly to his repose  --  he shall live as hitherto , in mirth and cheerfulness , nor shall the sight of Theodosia embitter his pleasures . As soon as I have recovered my strength . I will for ever leave the place where the name of Wildenhain , and the grave of my father , bow me to the ground . And tell him that I knew not he was returned from Franconia , knew not that he was so near me ! assure him earnestly of this , or he may believe that I came hither in search of him . Oh ! he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see that your presence , the object of your visit , have exhausted my little strength ; I know not how to say more ; I know not what more he who sent you , can require of me. ( with indignation ) Yet one thing farther , perhaps the baron has recollected , that he once promised me marriage ; that on his knees before me , he called on God to witness his vows , and pledged his honor for their performance ; but tell him not to be uneasy on that account , for that wish has long since been banished from my bosom . Arnaud . Arnaud I have listened to you with patience , that I might learn your whole sentiments of the baron , and your own peculiar way of thinking . " In this unprepared moment , when your full heart overflowed , you doubtless have not dissembled , and I rejoice to find you a woman of the noblest sentiments , worthy of the highest atonement that a man of honor  --  a man of strict honor can make you . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has , perhaps , occasioned much of the bitterness you have expressed against the baron . " Had the baron known that the sick woman in this cottage was Theodosia Fribourg , and had sent to her this purse , he had deserved your utmost contempt , but no , believe me , no ! this he has not done . " Look me in the face , my profession demands confidence , but independently of that , you surely would believe me incapable of falsehood . And I do solemnly assure you , that " it was chance alone made you the object of his bounty , which he believed was exercised towards an entire stranger . " Theod . Theodosia How , sir ! would you persuade me that such a present as this , was the effect of chance ? to a stranger , one sends a florin , a dollar , but not a purse of gold . Arnaud . Arnaud I grant it is extraordinary ;  --  but the occasion was like wise extraordinary ; your son  --  Theod . Theodosia What ! my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged for his mother , that affected the baron . Theod . Theodosia Begged of the baron ! of his father ! Theod . Theodosia Even so ; but understand that neither knew the other ; and that the mother received this present for the sake of the son . Theod . Theodosia Knew not each other ! and where is my son ? Arnaud . Arnaud At the castle . Theod . Theodosia And still are they unknown to each other ? Arnaud . Arnaud No ;  --  all is now revealed , and I am sent hither by the baron , not to an unknown sick woman , but to Theodosia Fribourg , not with money , but with a commission to act as my own heart shall dictate . Theod . Theodosia Your heart ! oh , sir , pledge not your feelings for those of this obdurate man ! yet will the woman forget what she has suffered for his sake , if he only will atone for it to the mother ; the woman will pardon him , if he deserve the mother 's thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the baron received him ? Arnaud . Arnaud I left him overcome by violent emotions ; even in the moment of discovery ; nothing was yet decided ; yet doubtless at this instant the son is clasped in his father 's arms . I will warrant that his heart  --  Theod . Theodosia Again his heart ! heavens ! how is the heart of this man thus suddenly changed ? for twenty years deaf to the voice of nature  --  Arnaud . Arnaud You do him injustice ! " hear , before you judge him . Many errors appear to us at the first view detestable . But if we knew all that led to them , all the intervening circumstances which insensibly prompted to the deed , all the trifles whose influence is so imperceptible , and yet so great , how might our opinions be altered . In a few words you shall now have the baron 's story since your separation . " At the time of separation he loved you most sincerely , " but the fear of his rigid mother prevented the fulfilment of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he was severely wounded , made a prisoner , and for a whole year was confined to his bed , unable to write to you , or to obtain any information concerning you . " Then did your image first begin to grow fainter in his mind . " In consequence of his dangerous wounds , he was carried from the field of battle to a neighboring mansion , the owner of which was a man of rank and benevolence , " possessed of a large estate , " and the father of a beautiful daughter . The maiden " was particularly pleased with the young man , scarcely ever left his bed side , " nursed him like a sister , " and shed tears for his sufferings , to which the baron 's heart could not be insensible . " Philanthrophy and gratitude knit the bands , which death tore asunder but a few weeks since . " Thus was the remembrance of you obliterated . " He exchanged his native country for a noble residence in Franconia ; he became a husband , a father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No objects that he beheld reminded him of you , " nor could any thing revive your image in his mind , " till his life became embittered by domestic feuds . " Chance at that time conducted me to his house . I gained his friendship , I became the instructor of his only daughter , and was soon admitted to his confidence . " Oh how often with a distressed heart has he said , this woman revenges on me the wrongs of my Theodosia ; " how often has he cursed the wealth , which his wife brought him , and in fancy enjoyed a less brilliant but more happy lot in your arms . When at length this living became vacant and he offered me the cure , the first words with which he accompanied the proposal were  --  my friend , there will you learn what has become of my Theodosia . Every letter that I afterwards received from him , contained this exclamation . Still no tidings of Theodosia ? these letters are now in my possession ; you may see them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abode .

If your strength permits you to accompany me the carriage which brought me waits ; the road is short and easy . Theod . Theodosia I go with you ! go before the baron in these rags . Arnaud . Arnaud And wherefore not . Theod . Theodosia Will they not reproach him ! Arnaud .
