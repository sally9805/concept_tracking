Henry Percy , the son of Hotspur , found himself , when he emerged from childhood , bereft of friends , stripped of the possessions of his ancestors , and subsisting , in exile , upon the bounty of strangers . On the rupture of his family with Henry IV , whom they had been instrumental in elevating to the throne , leaguing with Glendour and the Earl of Douglas , they published it as their intention to transfer the crown to Edmund Mortimer , Earl of March . This nobleman was the great-grandson of Lionel , Duke of Clarence , the third son of Edward III ; and , besides representing an elder branch of the family than that from which Henry sprung , had been acknowledged by Richard II as his successor . The issue of their enterprise was the well-known battle of Shrewsbury . The Earl of Northumberland , whom accident had detained from the engagement , and whose power was still formidable , received pardon . Stung , however , by the loss of his son , and brother , he , in company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mowbray , Earl Marshal , appeared , two years afterwards , again in arms . Ralph Neville Earl of Westmoreland , who was allied , by marriage , to Henry , and was devoted to his cause , broke this combination by stratagem ; took York and Mowbray prisoners on Shipton-moor , and delivered them into his master 's hands , at the castle of Pontefract , where , after a summary trial , they suffered death . Northumberland , accompanied by his faithful friend , Lord Bardolph , and bearing with him his young grandson , retired into Scotland . His estates were confiscated , and bestowed on different adherents of the King . Failing in an application for aid to the Scottish Court , and in their attempts to purchase it in Wales , France , and Flanders , through which they wandered together , these Noblemen came to the resolution of making a third effort to dethrone Bolingbroke , with no other means than those assured by their great personal influence and popularity in the north of England . Thither they accordingly returned , and were , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So that now , " says Holinshed , " the prophesie was fulfilled which gaue an inkling of this heauie hap long before ; "  --  " For this Earle was the stocke , and maine root of all that were left aliue called by the name of Persie , and of manie more by diuers slaughters despatched . For whose misfortune the People were not a little sorrie , making report of the gentleman 's valiantnesse , renowne , and honour , and applieng unto him certeine lamentable verses out of Lucane , " &c.; Respecting his grandson , the same author remarks : " Henrie Persie , then but a child , sonne to the Lord Henrie Persie surnamed Hotspur , after his father 's deceasse , that was slaine at Shrewesburie field , was conuied into Scotland , and there left by his Grandfather . " He was educated at the court of the Regent , Robert Stuart , Duke of Albany ; where he remained till about the date of the following scenes . DRAMATIS PERSON .

A terrace of the castle , overlooking a lawn and woods . Elinor alone . Enter Florence . Flor . Florence She stood , majestic , mid her waving woods , Like Dian musing on her hill of cedars , Or that famed princess whom the grey-eyed dawn Found lingering on the beach beneath proud Carthage , Pensive , and pale , her sandals wet with sea-foam , And her dark tresses with the tears of night , Accusing heaven , and looking  --  much as thou dost . El . Elinor Good morrow , cousin . Flor . Florence Prithee , pretty maid , Why creep'st thou slyly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to this lonely platform ? El . Elinor Look forth : let universal nature speak . See yonder , how the Cheviot summits glow ; What fiery colours deck the glistening wood ; How volumed , dense , and white , the river mist Winds down the gleaming vale ! Flor . Florence Solve me , sweet coz , What stirs thy pensive breast to deeper musing Than all the hues and melodies of nature ? Than moonlight walks on wild Northumbrian hills , Than hoarse waves booming to the ocean shore , Autumn 's sear leaves , sad fields , and farewell song , Or midnight converse with the starry spheres ? El . Elinor Pish ! leave such senseless rhapsody . Flor . Florence A horn ! A simple , merry , huntsman 's horn !  --  How sweet , From this high terrace to o'erlook the courts When , mustering there , the leaders of the chase Marshal their bands , caparison their steeds , Vault to their seats , halloo , and dashing out , Make hill and greenwood , high and low , Shrill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou , Florence ? Flor . Florence His vest was green , His feather blue , His glance was keen , His arrow true  --  ( Pointing to her heart . ) And hill and greenwood , high and low , Shrilled to his merry bugle O ! El . Elinor In simpler words  --  the friend who knows me best , To whom my soul , even from our childish years , Has been translucent as the crystal waters , Believes me ( else , why urge this tedious jest ? ) Enamoured of a hind , my father 's vassal ! Flor . Florence O , spare me ! frown not on my harmless muse . I did but sport : forgive me , Elinor . Yet , would I knew what preys upon your cheek , Shrouds you in gloom , and locks me from your bosom . When Raby 's towers from morn till midnight rang With dance , masque , pageant , minstrelsy , and song , Our lives seem 'd sweetest pastime . Not a lark Rose from her nest , more gaily , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our theme . Why are you grown a stranger to yourself ? El . Elinor What need to search my heart ? Thou know'st it thine . Flor . Florence Does Elinor unkindly cast me out From sympathy in sorrow , like a stranger ? El . Elinor Cease , Florence , cease : I have not yet complained ; Nor ever will , while bounteous Heaven showers down Blessings unnumbered on my worthless head . For shame ! By what prerogative am I The darling offspring of a noble house ? Born in this land of heroes ? Rich in all things ? Who gave those tender parents , and preserves ? Who stretched a canopy above my bed , And steeped my eyelids in the dew of slumber , While many a wretch no worse than I  --  No , no , If , spite of me , my thankless heart repine Because some fancied good swells not the store , Ne'er will I utter such rebellious murmurs . Flor . Florence Seems it rebellion to thee , Elinor , To bathe the wounds which Providence inflicts In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth  --  few words Will sum his story . Three months since , surprised By a wild night while journeying near these walls , He begged a shelter . Voice , or face , or mien ,  --  Fate willed it  --  touched my sire , who questioned him . Fortune , he said , smiled fairly at his birth ; But fatal feuds , mischances long to tell , Robb 'd him of friends and substance while a child , And , ever since , his adverse fate had frowned . Cheered by kind looks , and courtesy , he asked Among the hunting-train some humble post . Rare talents in the art so cherished here , Had won him rank and favour , ere his arm , Blessed be Heaven , preserved my life and honour . Flor . Florence Thy life  --  El . Elinor Have I not told thee ? Strange neglect !  --  O , Florence , hear .  --  A balmy eventide Allured me , with a damsel , down the vale . Beguiled with talk , and roving heedless , night O'ertook us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash o'erspreads the way , a band Of prowling Scots , moss-troopers from the wild , Rushed from a covert , seized , and dragged us in  --  Flor . Florence Jesu ! El . Elinor Bound us upon their steeds , and spurred Impetuous for the North . Long time , our course O'er hills and moors , by lonely robber paths , We held in darkness , guided by the stars And pallid lustre of the northern light . At last ( the moon now broad above the fells , ) Entering a deep wild glen , on this side Tweed , They halted in a brook to counsel , and to breathe Their o'erspent steeds . Issuing from the shade , Four huntsmen joined us . Judge what trembling seized me , When , on their coats my father 's crest I saw ! O , think ! in that wild solitude to find Brave Arthur by my side ! Speech , breath , forsook me : My heart seemed bursting ; yet to speak , to stir , Surpassed me . Agnes shrieked . Then , Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I felt , scarce felt the mortal shock , and swooned . Waking , I found myself in Agnes ' arms : Heard nothing but the whispering leaves , and rill , Nor saw , save her , and Arthur bending o'er me . No foe was near : tranquil , and pale , and sweet , All seemed , till on the runnel 's brink I spied , Close at my feet , four huge Marauders stretched , Mixing their life-blood with the bubbling stream . Flor . Florence O , wondrous Providence ! unheard of rescue ! El . Elinor That night , he gave me to my mother 's arms , And such a night  --  such agonies of joy I hope no more to see . In gratitude , Am I not bound to favour and protect him ? Flor . Florence Indeed thou art : I too , will thank his valour . El . Elinor But if a lighter thought  --  Remember , Florence , Mine is the stock of Lancaster , the blood Whose pure , proud current feeds the hearts of Princes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a whisper of this tale ,  --  That should have flown to meet me on the way , Leaped from her eyes , mixed with the welcome-kiss , And dwelt the favoured theme upon her tongue ! Her mother 's silence too !  --  ay , that ;  --  her frowns , Pale looks  --  Alas ! if Elinor  --  But why  --  What doth he here ? haunting about her steps , And practising upon her noble nature ?  --  This claims a thought .  --  Exit .

Were this fierce chief alive , Or any valiant scion of his stock , Would Henry , on submission at his throne , Restore their honours ? West . Lady Westmoreland Restore !  --  Northumberland is mine : who takes Must win it . Percy lorded o'er the North Too proudly , and is sunk to rise no more . The Sire and Son set Bolingbroke aloft , Meaning to rule the King they made ; but soon , Finding a check on their omnipotence , Their vengeful arms they turned ; denounced his ruin ; Drew half the kingdom to revolt , and clave , Almost , the diadem .

And , had not I Out witted York , dispersed his power , and seized Mowbray , and him , we now had drudged for bread , Cursing the pittance doled by Mortimer ; While grey-beard Percy gored us with his rule , Counting each drop expiatory blood For Hotspur 's death .

Whose soul , in travail of a sonnet , faints , Seven times a day , entranced upon a lute ?

Arthur Here let me pause , and breathe awhile , and wipe These servile drops from off my burning brow . Amidst these venerable trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times .  --  Companions of my Fathers ! ye have marked Their generations pass . Your giant arms Shadowed their youth ; your solemn breezes waved Their silver hairs , when , ripe in years and glory , These walks they trod to meditate on Heaven . What warlike pageants have ye seen ! what trains Of captives , and what heaps of spoil ! what pomp , When the victorious Chief , war 's tempest o'er , In Wark 's fair bowers unbound his panoply ! What floods of splendour , bursts of jocund din Startled the slumbering tenants of these shades , When night awoke the tumult of the feast , The song of damsels , and the sweet-toned lyre ! Then , princely Percy reigned amidst his halls Champion , and Judge , and Father of the North . O , days of ancient grandeur ! are ye gone ? For ever gone ? Do these same scenes behold His offspring here the hireling of a foe ? O , that I knew my fate ! that I could read The destiny which Heaven has marked for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon thee , gentle huntsman ! Whose towers are these that overlook the wood ? Ar .

Douglas Now do I clasp thee , Percy ; and I swear By my dear soul , and by the blood of Douglas , Link 'd to thy side thro ' every chance , I go , Till here thou rulest , or death and night end all . Per . Percy Amazement ! Whence ?  --  or how ?  --  Doug . Douglas And didst thou think Thus to elude me ? Per . Percy Answer how thou found'st me . What miracle directed here thy steps ? Doug . Douglas Where should I look for thee but in the post Where birth , fame , fortune , wrongs , and honour call thee ? Returning from the Isles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance I weighed : Thy difficulties , wrongs , and daring spirit ; The gay delusive shew so long maintained To lull observers ; then set forth , resolved Never to enter more my native towers Till I had found , and searched thee to the soul . Per . Percy Still must I wonder ; for so dark a cloud  --  Doug . Douglas O , deeper than thou think'st I 've read thy heart . A gilded insect to the world you seemed , Fluttering , fantastic , worthless , wildly-gay ; The fashion 's idol ; person , pen , and lyre , The soft , devoted darling of the fair . By slow degrees I found Herculean nerve Hid in thy tuneful arm ; that hunger thirst , The sultry chase , the bleakest mountain bed , The dark , rough , winter torrent , were to thee But pastime ; more were courted than repose . To others , your discourse still wild and vain , To me , when none else heard thee , seemed the voice Of heavenly oracles . Per . Percy O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never guessed your brooded purpose . Rememberest thou the Regent 's Masque ? the birth-night ? Per . Percy Well . Doug . Douglas That night you glittered through the crowded halls , Gay , and capricious as a sprite of air . Apollo rapt us when you touched the lyre ; Cupid fanned odours from your purple wings ; Or Mercury amused with magic wand , Mocking our senses with your feathered heel . In every fancy , shape , and hue you moved , The admiration , pity , theme of all .  --  One bed received us . Soon , your moaning voice Disturbed me . Dreaming heavily , you groaned , O , Percy ! Percy ! Hotspur ! O , my father ! Upbraid me not ! hide , hide those ghastly wounds ! Usurper ! Traitor ! thou shalt feel me ! Per . Percy Heavens ! Doug . Douglas ' T is true :  --  and more than I can now remember . Per . Percy And never speak of it ? Doug . Douglas Heaven knows I burned ; But honour , pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arm , life of Douglas thine , If thou hadst chosen : so , I locked all close . Per . Percy O , Douglas , long ago , I should have shewn My troubled bosom , but my enterprise So rife with peril seemed  --  to hearts less touched , So hopeless ! Knowing thy impetuous soul , How could I justify the deed to Heaven , How to thine aged sire ? Armed proof , I stand , To Fate : come what will come , the wide earth bears No heart of kindred blood to mourn my fall . Doug . Douglas The heart of Douglas beats not with thy blood , But never will I trust in mercy more , In justice , truth , or heaven , if it forsake thee . Per . Percy Douglas , thy friendship is my choicest treasure , Has been a radiant star on my dark way ; And never did I doubt thy zeal to serve me . Lend , now , a patient ear .  --  While with my doom , Alone , I strive , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mine involved , my heart Is fearless , firm my step . Exposing thee , The adamantine buckler falls , and leaves me Trembling , and pervious to a double death . Doug . Douglas Thou lovest me not . Per . Percy Let heaven be witness there !  --  The thought of bringing down thy father 's hairs With sorrow to the grave , would weigh like guilt , Palsy my soul , and cripple all my powers . Doug . Douglas So !  --  have I wandered o'er the hills for this ? Per . Percy I would not wound thee , Douglas , well thou knowst ; But thus to hazard on a desperate cast Thy golden fortunes  --  Doug . Douglas Cursed be the blood within me , Plagues , and the grave o'ertake me , if I leave thee ! Tho ' gulfs yawned under thee , and roaring seas Threatened to whelm thee ! Per .

I 'd not go if staying here would strew His hoar hairs in the tomb  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? sum the odds of life , When honour points the way ? When was the blood Of Douglas precious in a noble cause ? Per . Percy Nay , hear me , hear me , Douglas  --  Doug . Douglas Talk to me Of dangers ? Death , and shame ! Is not my race As high , as ancient , and as proud as thine ? Per . Percy I 've done . Doug . Douglas By heaven , it grieves me , Harry Percy , Preaching such craven arguments to me . Now tell me how thou standst ; thy cause how prospered ; What has been done ? What projects are afoot ? Possess me quickly . Per . Percy Gently , lest some busy ear Be near us . Little have I yet to tell thee . Thinking my rival 's coat would best conceal me , I won his favour by a tale scarce feigned . Doug . Douglas A keeper of his chase thy garb bespeaks . Per . Percy Chief huntsman . Thus disguised , I day by day , Traverse my native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; its holds of safety ; And searching patriot spirits out . For , still , Tho ' kings , and gaudy courts , remember not , Still , in the cottage , and the peasant 's heart , The memory of my fathers lives . When , there , The old , the good old day is cited , tears Roll down their reverend beards , and genuine love Speaks in their praises of my sires . Doug . Douglas I long To press the sons , and tell them what a lord Lives yet to rule them . Per . Percy When first I mixed among them , oft I struck , Unwittingly , a spark of this same fire . Encouraged thus , I sought its latent seeds ; Seized opportunities to draw the chase Into the bosom of the hills , and spent Nights in their hospitable , happy cots . There , to high strains , the minstrel harp I tuned , Chaunting the glories of the ancient day , When their brave fathers , scorning to be slaves , Rushed with their Chieftain to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death , And shared his triumphs in the festal hall . Doug . Douglas That lulled them , as the north wind does the sea . Per . Percy From man to man , and house to house , like fire , The kindling impulse flew ; till every hind , Scarce conscious why , handles his targe and bow ; Still talks of change ; starts , if the banish 'd name By chance he hears ; and supplicates his saint The true-born offspring may his banner rear , With speed , upon the hills . Doug . Douglas What lack we ? Spread The warlike ensign . On the Border side Two hundred veteran spears await your summons . Per . Percy What say'st thou ! Doug . Douglas Sinews of the house : Ready to tread in every track of Douglas . By stealth I drew them in from distant points , And hid amidst a wood in Chevy-Chase . Per . Percy O , Douglas !

Doug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills ; Declare aloud thy name , and wrongs ; call down The swarming tenantry to arms ; and teach Aspiring Neville fatal is the day The Percy and the Douglas league in arms . Per . Percy If he were all  --  Remember haughty Henry The nephew of his wife , Footnote : 1Kb whose word could speed A veteran army to his kinsman 's aid . Doug . Douglas Come one , come all ; leave us to welcome them . Per . Percy There lives a sad remembrancer for us.  --  Think of our fathers ! Think of Shrewsbury ! Doug . Douglas Hum ! Per . Percy Their cause was upright : all that hearts of flesh , And falchions tempered in an earthly wave , Could do , their valour wrought ; yet Percy fell , And Douglas was a captive . Doug . Douglas Well ; what then ? Because fate baffled them must we despair ? Per . Percy Ha ! yonder 's Elinor  --  Westmoreland 's daughter  --  This lucky chance I wished .  --  Douglas , away .  --  Seek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock . That half worn path will guide thee . Doug .

Enter Elinor , attended by a damsel . El . Elinor As o'er the hills we flew , the very heavens Frowned wild and ominous ; but when I woke , So melancholy sweet , the moon looked on me , Murmurs so soothing crept upon mine ear , Awhile , I thought myself in some new being . Dams . Damsel It was a placid night . El . Elinor Balmy as heaven ! But spake he , Agnes  --  as thou saidst ?  --  Dams . Damsel More like a lord than a poor vassal , lady ; Clasped you against his breast , and wept , and swore , As he were frantic ; nay , we thought you dead ; Killed in the shock that slew the ruffian . Enter Percy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady , a moment hear my suit . El . Elinor Your suit !  --  What suit ? Per . Percy A youth who loves , and , in his prosperous days , Favoured me , wandering in a woodman 's weeds , From home and kindred parted , craves a place , ( Hearing my fortune in your father 's service , ) An humble place among the train I lead . El . Elinor Receive him like a brother , Arthur . Welcome the wanderer to my father 's house . But say  --  what tidings pass from Scotland ? I saw you from my tower , at peep of dawn , In parley with the Regent 's courier . Per . Percy No news . El . Elinor How fares my lady Albany ? Per . Percy Soft , benedicite ! a tale there was . The Northern Muses weep , and wreath their harps With mournful willows ; Lady Regent pines , Wan as a shade ; court Ladies droop , and sigh , Forsake their lutes , and talk of nunneries . Mirth , musick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The King of glee , the gamesome Percy 's fled . El . Elinor Has Percy fled ? Per . Percy So says the courier ; none Knows whither . El . Elinor Gracious heaven , protect his steps ! Per . Percy Ha !  --  You speak with fervour , lady . El . Elinor While I rove These woods and walks , and wander thro ' those halls Of lonely grandeur , every object wakes Some sad remembrance of the noble outcast . I entered , late , a long-neglected tower , Where , grey with cobwebs , torn , and soiled with dust , The ancient pictures of the race decay . There , dark-browed Hotspur , stooping to the charge , With many a famed , majestic Percy , moulders . A thrill of terror rooted me ; they seemed to frown , And menace me with hostile eyes ; Question my right in their domain ; and ask , With looks of accusation , for their son . Per .

Per . Percy Sure thou hast trod the gardens where it blooms , And learned compassion at the lips of Angels . El . Elinor I would not purchase greatness at this price . Rather would I find some obscure retreat , Nor dream of splendour , save when fancy spread Pavilions in the clouds , or tracked the moon , Or flew the spangled cope from star to star , Than reign the Queen of an adoring world , If I must do it in another 's right . Per . Percy Ah ! would to heaven such justice swayed all hearts . El . Elinor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I These sumptuous halls to their just lord resign ; Seek Raby 's bowers ; and never , never more , Forsake the shades where , like a vision , flew My happy youth ! the scenes of innocence , Of peace , and sunshine , where my joyous heart Chimed with the blithest musick of the woodlands . No sorrow there , no secret  --  ( stops abruptly . ) Per . Percy Sorrow ! Dares she intrude into a Seraph 's breast ? Alas ! art thou  --  El . Elinor Am I ! Presumptuous youth , Look up , and , if thou canst , regard The dazzling summit where the Neville shines . Do clouds of sorrow roll so high ?  --  Agnes ! Exit . Per . Percy Vanished again !  --  What means this changeful mood ? It grows upon her . Even when she seems Gentlest , and sweetest , breathing from her lips  --  Perpetual troubler of my thoughts ! by heaven , This fellow dogs me  --  Well , how now ?

He prowls about me with an evil eye ; Thrice has surprised me at unguarded moments . He turns  --  I 'll cross the brake and hie to Douglas . Exit . ACT III . SCENE I. A deep shady solitude before the Hermitage of Warkworth . Percy and Douglas sitting on a stone bench by the door of the cell . Per . Percy Caution must rein our ardour : see the land Drained for these wars ; the King , and Westmoreland O'er seas , with all the turbulent bold spirits , Busy in France :  --  then , stir for Mortimer , Make common cause with him , and we may thrive . Doug . Douglas With Mortimer ? Per . Percy My cousin Edmund 's son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sovereign . Doug . Douglas Where ? Per . Percy In London ; whence I hourly look for tidings . But , if nought sinister by waves or war Befal the King , an absent pilot leaves His galley reeling . Men begin to murmur . This prodigal , say they , for selfish ends , Drags to unknown , inhospitable graves Our sons ; barters their bones for barren fame ; Leaves us to starve , while he , on foreign shores , Plucks blood-stained laurels . Doug . Douglas Talk they thus ? Per . Percy Douglas , If Mortimer inherits but a soul , And once Northumberland will lift her voice , Oft , thro ' the realm , in dark and troubled times , The watch-word of the mighty , hope survives For down-trod justice . Number but the host Of discontented spirits late fallen off : More , groaning yet beneath his father 's stripes ; And more that , from the first , pitying wronged Richard , Hated this proud usurping race , and fought In Percy 's battles for the rightful heir : All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be so , What fear ? Per . Percy And that were glory ! grasp at once My own lost heritage , and throne my King ! Sometimes the vision dances in my eyes , But ah ! I fear , a glittering empty bubble . Monmouth is wise , dauntless as Mars , expert , And proved in all the issues of the field . He knows the charm that wins a soldier 's heart ; Success has shed a blaze about his head , Dazzling to vulgar gazers : I , the while , Am but a stripling , yet unknown ; save thine , My cause unsanctioned by a name of power . Doug . Douglas But thou hast justice on thy side . Per . Percy Alas , And had not Hotspur , too , when he lay stiffning ?

Douglas Approve him as you find him . Per . Percy Long , and dark , And tragic is the page of Bertram 's story . Its emblems carved within this rock shall speak . Suffice it , Douglas , cruel fate , with wounds Incurable , had pierced his noble heart .

The storied memory , my lords , is left In chronicles of other times , and serves , Serves but to wring an Exile 's breast with anguish .

Thro ' all his pilgrimage , thy noble sire Watched his sad steps , and cheered him from despair . At last , around his banners , from the north , Mustering a scanty train , he vowed to die , Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bramham-moor , Bardolph partook his fate . Percy was yet a child ; but having heard This tale , with every circumstance of love Shewn to his grandsire by your noble father , Loves , even as his own , your name and race . Bard . Bardolph Doth he ?  --  Heaven judge me as I love him too ! Per . Percy Presuming on that love , he bade me speak .  --  In happier days , the name of Fitzhugh ranked High mid the valiant who for Percy drew . But persecuted Mountfort , whose own eyes Witnessed the downfal of his master 's house , Hunted , proscribed , an outlaw for his faith , And zeal untameable in Percy 's cause , Would spring , we knew , to vengeance .

K. Hen . King Henry V I flatter not . Now , what says noble Warwick ? War . Warwick As much , my liege : the hunt was bravely pushed . K. Hen . King Henry V Ay , by my knighthood , thrice upon the course I thought to ask what mettled gallant led it . War . Warwick I can not say , my liege : an active Huntsman . K. Hen .

Hen . King Henry V Patience !  --  West . Lady Westmoreland Which simply ends in this , his name is Arthur . Three months ago , I found him coarsely clad , Driven in one blustering night , to ' scape a storm . Silent he seemed , and sad of heart ; yet spake With such mild grace , the less he said , the more Curious I grew to hear . His friends were dead ; ( For , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and able ; ) His patrimony lost ; and he an exile . Won by a gentle word or two , he begged , Having no home , a place among my huntsmen . A boon right gladly granted : since repaid By deeds of nearest service to our house . K. Hen . King Henry V He has endowments : you should cherish him . Such feats of horsemanship I scarce have seen . West . Lady Westmoreland Liege , every free , and high-born , courtly grace Prized by the noblest nursed in Princes ' halls , Learning , arms , courtesy , and wit , appear Native in him as doth his horsemanship . K. Hen . King Henry V Why , uncle , these are marvels . Call him in . West . Lady Westmoreland He plainly shuns the light ; but I have worn An eye of note upon him , and , of late , Begin to think him far above his seeming . K. Hen . King Henry V Cite him .

Lady Westmoreland First , view a little entertainment , liege , Devised , and led by him . Seneschal . Seneschal Lords , clear the hall . West . Lady Westmoreland My lords , and gentlemen , please you be seated . The crowd retires , leaving the area of the hall vacant A shrill fanfare from the Minstrels ushers in a phalanx of spearmen . They approach , in close array , the group round Lady Westmoreland and the King ; halt , and open into a crescent , discovering in the midst Percy and Douglas in splendid armour . An ivory horn suspended by Percy 's side , and the armorial bearings of his house blazoned on his shield . He lifts his beaver , advances , and speaks . Per . Percy To show our humble pageant , dreaded Liege , Fair Ladies , Peers , and Knights , behold us come . Fearful a tale artless and rude as ours May prove , from lips unskilled in buskined pomp , But wearisome to Courtiers ; yet , kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the King , Girt with his Barons , rises . Rise ye must ; All  --  Knight and Noble  --  to a doubtful game ! For honour , life , we play , and mean , my lords , To quit us valiantly . West . Lady Westmoreland ( aside . ) Why , who are these ? Per . Percy I can not practise , for your sport , the Antick . Too long , too long , a Masquer , Arthur comes , Stripped of disguise , this night , to execute His Fathers ' testament ;  --  whose blood lies spilt ; Whose murmurs from the tomb are in his ears ; Whose injuries are treasured in a scroll Steeped with a mother 's and an orphan 's tears . O'er that cursed record has my spirit groaned , Since dawning reason , in unuttered anguish . When others danced ; struck the glad wire ; or caught The thrilling murmurs of loved lips , I roamed Where the hill-foxes howl , and eagles cry , Brooding o'er wrongs that haunted me for vengeance . K. Hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle ? West . Lady Westmoreland Faith , my lord  --  Per . Percy For I have been an outcast from my cradle ; Poor , and in exile , while an alien called My birth-right , home . Halls founded by my sires Have blazed , and rudely rung with stranger triumphs ; Rung jubilee above their sepulchres . Their honourable name cowards have stained ; Their laurels trampled on ; their bones profaned . Hence , have I laboured ; watched while others slept ; Known not the spring of life , nor ever plucked One vernal blossom in the day of youth . The harvest of my toils , this night , I reap ; For death , this night , or better life , awaits me . Before my lord the King I stand , and claim Northumberland , my just inheritance , As Henry Percy , son , and heir of Hotspur . ( All start . ) West . Lady Westmoreland Percy !  --  Hotspur !  --  K.

Advances a few steps ; waves his hand to silence the tumult ; when all is hushed , speaks . My lords , and gentlemen , an unknown youth , A vassal in my uncle 's hunting train , The selfsame wight who led our dogs to-day , Now , boldly enters to the presence , backed By foreign arms , and challenges a right Conferred by our most gracious father 's will On valiant Westmoreland , for deeds of love Rendered our house when faction shook the throne . He claims Northumberland ; in right of blood Drawn from rebellious Percy . Well you know That name was blotted from the roll of Peers When old Northumberland , from faith scarce pledged , And pardon fell , lending his reverend locks Anew to traitors .  --  Hollow title this !

Thus bucklered with my mantle , I defy thee Blazing in Percy 's arms . Per . Percy That Percy 's spirit lives , my lord , A burning , proudly-swelling witness tells me . But blood I seek not . Justice  --  K. Hen . King Henry V Craven , peace ! When Hotspur spoke , his trumpet of alarum , Fire-snorting steed , and shout of onset answered . His thundering descant was on foemen 's crests !

For , while I speak , a vengeful Spirit wakes Beneath these walls , whose jealous eye is fixed On you and me . Who harms the Percy , strikes His monarch 's knell .

A pause of astonishment and silence . West . Lady Westmoreland Sure , hell is emptied round us . Per . Percy A thousand horns have answered at my call , A thousand spears are brandished for the charge , And never did a thousand bolder hearts Heave under breast-plate for the work of death . Takes off his helmet , and advances a little . Can any question who I am , my lords ?  --  If any ; speak .  --  Could falsehood purchase ought But shame , detection , and immediate fall ?

If Percy erred , has not the name yet made Its expiation ?  --  O ! my lord , look back ! Let Shipton , Shrewsbury , and Bramham-moor , Let the dire pangs that broke my mother 's heart , Let my own banishment , and blasted youth Declare .  --  I am the last of all the Percies : A name coeval with the crown thou wearest , And prized for ages as its brightest gem .

But pitying thoughts , and ancient amity , Had touched our bosom : fraught with Percy 's pardon , Missives in Scotland bear our seal : his flight Reserves it for his Monarch 's lips .
