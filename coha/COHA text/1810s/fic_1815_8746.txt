Main text Scene Arthur and Theodore . Scene  --  Fields near a cottage .  --  Time  --  Summer 's evening . "  --  processit Vesper Olympo . " THEODORE . Theodore No eve was e'er more still  --  no eve more clear ; Sprinkling the skies , the twinkling lights appear . The lonely tree-toad in the copse is heard , And hush 'd in sleep the song of every bird ; Save , now and then , a hawk , in drowsy flight , Swims through the air , a speck upon the sight . The purblind bat wheels , flapping , over head , And fire-flies light their lovers o'er the mead . ARTHUR . Arthur Now , waking on the green , at our approach , And , drawing from the wing the pillow 'd head , See nodding ducks trudge quacking to the pool , And stately geese like strutting soldiers stalk . The waters sparkle to their oary feet , And , swollen , ruffle to a mimic storm . The heifer 's low rides on the freshening breeze , And the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , and brown the hills appear . The heart is better 'd by such peaceful scenes . THEODORE . Theodore What envied life the peasant may enjoy ; His ships no storms , his gold no thieves annoy . His daily toil reward and vigour gives , Sweet is his sleep  --  contentedly he lives . No false ambition elevates his mind , To reign a monarch , or be sage refin 'd . He whistles to his flocks  --  a pleasing care , And builds his walls  --  not castles in the air . He sows his seed , and nursery stocks with trees , And , with good humour , coarsely arms to please . While frisk his little ones among the lambs , Or , pull the grass and tender to the dams , And , pelting , fly for life the bruising rams . ARTHUR . Arthur No , not a ' squire more peaceful life enjoys , Than he , whose cares are bounded by his need ; Who hangs on no dependant for his gains . Within his cot , the busy wheel flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task , Healthful with toil , his ruddy daughters ply ; Unlike the milk-fac 'd pets which fear the sun . THEODORE . Theodore At eve  --  or on the stile , or round the door , They 'll titter , bashful , at the homeward boor ; Or , chance to aged crone , list mournful tale , Of Hubert 's crime , and little Ellen frail , And weep , that when he sought her for his bride , So broke her heart , scarce wedded ere she died , And how poor Hubert 's brain could not the shock abid ARTHUR . Arthur What pleasing gloom these twilight moonbeams make , Listening , in this side-hedge , to insects ' bum , Or glimmering to illume their bowery dreams . You patch of grain  --  how , billowy , it bends . At distance , those small shrubs obscurely seen , Mocking reality , swell to tall trees . I startled just now , through that broken wall , To spy a nodding mullein  --  simple fool ! Each plant is drest in a strange livery . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' T was near this spot  --  I came upon you sudden  --  You look 'd so foolish !  --  with a finch 's nest  --  Robbing the crying bird  --  to please that jilt  --  THEODORE . Theodore Who could withstand her sweet deceptive art , Or , having seen , keep home his truant heart ? When last I saw the maid , she gave me this , Her pledge of troth , and seal 'd it with a kiss . As clasps the brede my finger , might I now Clasp her yet true  --  how would my bosom glow ! But blighted hope , and faithless woman 's frown . To bed of thorns converts a bed of down . ARTHUR . Arthur That Caroline was comely , none may doubt , But fickle was she , as her beauty frail . THEODORE . Theodore Oh ! say no more !  --  Now home let us repair , And sink to rest  --  the balm of every care .                  @ @ @
