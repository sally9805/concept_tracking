txt Philosophical Essays ; to which are subjoined , copious Notes , critical and explanatory , and a Supplementary Narrative ; with an . lppendix . By James Ogilvie. 8vo. pp. 416 . Philadelphia : John Conrad . 1816 . MR . OGILVIE has long been known in this country , for fine recitations and rather indifferent discourses , delivered from what he calls the Rostrum ; and we are among those , who think that he has some essential qualifications for an orator . In his less ambitious days , or at least those which seemed to be so , we thought he furnished us a very rational and even useful entertainment in his publick exhibitions . He had indeed a little of the air of an adventurer , but this perhaps was chiefly owing to the novelty of his literary enterprise . His profession had some of the enticements of the theatre , without any of the mischiefs , which the scrupulous are fond of ascribing to it . And there was good reason to think he would be satisfied with his . fame in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow or worthless . It was a part of his purpose to awaken literary curiosity , and he contributed with a liberality that should not be forgotten , and which is too seldom equalled , to the support of literary and charitable institutions throughout our country. - In his labours , indeed , he seemed to be alone . He was upon an experiment , about the success of which it was even idle to form an opinion . But his energy and courage sustained him , and over all his enterprise , there was thrown a sort of enthusiasm , which will always awaken interest , though it may not bear a severe scrutiny , or prove of very great service in less obtrusive and more exploring labours than his. - In addition to his public exhibitions , we heard some time ago of his more systematick attempts to revive amongst us the fainting power of oratory ; that he had gone so far as to teach the art in a Southern College , where his success and fame were proved by illuminations , and we believe // too by medals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had actually undertaken a visit to our cities and colleges , with a view to spread the glories of the long-neglected Rostrum ; and to do what in him lay for the establishment of institutions of oratory , in a country that seemed to him almost the only one where its legitimate power could now be felt. - There are men who will laugh at all this , but we are not of their number . The overflowings of zeal and enthusiasm in a projector of useful improvements , are often very favourable symptoms , especially when he has looked his plan through and through , and prepared himself for temporary ridicule or indifference , whilst he looks forward with confidence to ultimate success . We do not pretend to say that Mr. Ogilvie had quite enough sober calculation , to inspire universal confidence . But surely there is no great reluctance in our countrymen to encourage novelties ; they are not generally startled by the boldness or zeal of adventurers ; and as Mr. Ogilvie knew and loved his art so well , it seemed only necessary to persuade men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most bountiful encouragement . As to the neglect of the art amongst us , there could hardly be a doubt ; and it is now so great , in this part of the country at least , that the most timid may well let go their alarms about the dangers of eloquence . The standard with us is so very low , that we hear men called orators for smooth fluency or unimpassioned gracefulness and propriety . A hard clean voice , that travels for an hour over all sorts of surface , without one break or tone of feeling , with no variation of sound save that which is required by the punctuation , will be accounted the voice of an orator . We apprehend that the fanatick , with his holy wildness , approaches much nearer to good oratory , than most of our sensible speakers . One would think we had come to disdain ornament and manner when the subject is vast ; that whilst we allow the classicks to govern our taste in every thing else , we had rejected them in their high examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bestow about an equal measure of anxiety upon every thing they take up-whilst the interest of the bearer waxes dull , and passion fairly goes out . This should be expected when eloquence be // comes little more than a business of careful dissection or explanation , and when hearers have fallen into the habit of inspecting the manner of an orator , and guessing that he has nothing else to offer , if he is only bold enough to venture out of the old walk of tranquil utterance . In quiet seasons , when the state seems an invisible trifle to be talked about only , and men 's consciences can sleep under their duties , they are very willing to listen to a fine orator as they would to the players ; they are entertame ( l by his frolicks , and give in to all his illusions as they would to the fairy work of a dream . But important subjects , such as may call us presently into action , are in a great measure left to work their own way ; they hardly call forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too apt to conclude that he may proporuon his own interest by that of his teacher . It is easy , in such a case , to rail against the evils and abuses of eloquence , and to shew how much better it is to leave truth to its own power , to lay by the drapery of speech , and maintain a sturdy good sense and homely simplicity of manner . And we admit , that if the end ofjust eloquence could be attained by a naked presentment of cold thought , there would be no reason to complain at our indifference to the art , for we should be rid of its evils , without missing its uses . But no one will say that the world has yet got to this etherial purity and susceptibility . Men must be quickened . In spite of good sense , they will be heavy about their duties . It is in their hearts or imaginations that we are to find principles which shall lend energy to their convictions ; it is by the terrours or persuasions of eloquence , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guilt and virtue . And though it is highly honourable to men at the present day , that they can value the very plainest sense , let it come from whom it may , yet we think it must be set down to indolence , or bad taste , or a spirit of pride or narrow calculation , that the leaders of publick opinion are so indifferent to the uses of eloquence . But however important the art may be , we are very far from wishing to see it as powerful now as it once was . We would not have our orators study the ancient masters too much , nor look on them as models . We suspect a little , that when Mr. // Ogilvie talks with so much enthusiasm of vindicatincr the nascent glory of the Rostrum , ' and about the revival of his art , that his mind has " day dreams " of modern Ciceros . His own mode of popular declamation makes us fear , that the oratory indigenously American and essentially republican , ' which he hopes to establish amongst us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunities of a free people . Whenever our scholars undertake to judge of the institutions and practices of their own time , they are not coItent to stay at lome , and study the present condition and taste of men ; hut they run , as if by instinct , into their endeared classical enclosures , and lay down the law for us as they find it there . No matter that two or three thousand years have rolled between us and the memorable eras of ancient literature ; or that we live under a rougher sky , or that a deluge of barbarism has washed over the mind , since it was impressed by the fair and delicate forms of ancient art . We are still carried back to the old examples , and told that the eloquence , which suited the wild rabble of the early democracies , will do in these colder days of g ( *od sense . Men , who talk in this way , are , we trust , much better acquainted with their libraries , and have more to do with their prejudices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are brought up to see beauty only in the dead . They feel a taint in the rude mixture of living , busy , pains-taking mortals . They would carry you into their closets and cast you over again , that you may be stirred by pure Roman passion , burn at fine pictures of ancient virtue , and feel the magick of such allusions as thrilled through the mob like lightning , when Cicero and Demosthenes were making heroes out of every body but themselves . The character , taste and situation of the ancients should be taken into the account , whenever we think of modelling our oratory by theirs , or imagine that its power may be as great . Society will change its form and spirit , with the progress of years and by the help of experience . The excesses even of polished barbarism will give place to deliberation . Passion will in time be mingled with intellect , and judgment go along with feeling . A simple , natural taste in literature and the arts , is sometimes seen to revive in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tawdriness or mechanical primness seemed as general and fixed as an original principle of our nature . We should be careful then , how we judge of society now , its wants and taste , from what we know of men in other ages or climates . Refinement , polish , freedom , institutions and customs with the same names and looking to the same ends , are nevertheless very different things in different periods of history . We should hardly think it well to turn our free governments , our oblations , or our hearths , into those of the ancient Commonwealths ; nor do we think it would be any better to adopt now their declamatory eloquence . We should say that the practical examples which antiquity offers are more of errour than of excellence-for warning than imitation . The ancient oratory was for men who were given up to passion , and who thronged the forum to have it nourished and directed . It was not their way to prepare themselves at home upon questions of great publick concern . It was by action , not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state . They trusted themselves to sympathy and to the orators , who were a sort of self-appointed political teachers , feeling little restraint from the shrewd criticism of a mob , fighting against selfish rivals for sway over the supreme multitude , and sure that he only could be the conqueror who produced the greatest excitement. - We do not deny that there are " fine raptures** in the old eloquence , and that exquisite specimens have come down to us , in all the departments of publick speaking that were then known . This is just what we should expect ; and so long as we can keep these specimens quiet in our libraries , or regard them in connexion with their own times , we shall be as fond as any one of the treasure . We by no means say , that men have less sensibility now than the ancients , even in those colder and purer regions , where free states are supposed to flourish most . There may be less noise and more depth in our enthusiasm now . Our emotions are more inward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publick sympathy . Our judgments are formed after reflection , and a moral spirit pervades them . What we have lost in roughness or inflammability , is probably more than made up // in tempered vigour . A man 's worth or influence is not the less felt , because he respects his own judgment , sets himself sturdily against vain pretensions or lying declamation , and shrinks from the contagion of a mob as from pestilence . It should not be forgotten , that men are readers now . The art of printing has probably done more for independence of mind than all legislation or revolution , hy putting the thoughts of men into the hands of others , where they may be ransacked and proved . We can bring them down to skeletons , and then see if they have strength , connexion and object . A habit of intelligent watchfulness is thus formed in the people , and the orator feels it . He aims less at forcing publick sentiment and drowning judgment in declamation . " It is not enough to speak , but to speak true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feels the influence of keen observers about him , deliberating with him upon common interests , which they value more than his exhibitions . He remembers that they are fond of looking into their work before they begin ; of approaching it with the confidence of knowledge not of ignorance . Of course he must trust to the importance of his subject , and to earnest , wide and clear discussion . He must work through the judgment to the heart , and when he has reached and moved it , he will leave there a deep and inextinguishable energy. - When we are upon important deliberation , we are diverted at seeing a man crowded with himself instead of his subject , and bent upon making a fine speech which we are to pay for with applauses . His tricks and parade will not serve him , nor weigh with us , when we are preparing to act . We look about then for men in whom we can confide , not for the orator who glitters upon feast-days , who toils for effect , and can declaim another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer natural oratory , such as the occasion prompts and justifies . And perhaps it is not going too far , to say , that the best orators of modern times , are those who have been made by the circumstances that pressed immediately upon them , springing up at once and with resistless power , in seasons of gloom and dismay , as if they gathered inspiration from the darkness . // We believe too , that in the free states of our time , there is is something worth preserving , and much too precious to be entrusted with mere declaimers . The prudent , who know the worth of their treasures , are alarmed when they hear a noise made about them . A good government is too awful to be touched by the vulgar or turbulent ; and when society has reached something like settled order , and habits of reflection , it should not be suffered to fall again under what we must call the savage influence of mere passion . We do indeed hear men talk , even now , about national glory and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet consciousness of domestick comfort , a sentiment towards the country as a home and shelter , which seem to have had hut little place in the warlike commonwealths of old . We have still the distinctions of rich and poor , of the illiterate and wise ; and in the unobtrusive orders of society , there may be little of that abject vanity , which prompted the ancient vulgar to compel the courtesy of the great , and to bluster around the common altars and monuments , as if they feared that their own importance would be forgotten . But for all this , we should disdain to compare the multitude in a modern commonwealth , with the street rabble of Rome , whether in good sense , honesty , real elevation of sentiment , political intelligence , just views of national happiness and glory , or the firm of securino them  - -  XVe believe that a purpose b modern orator never need complain , that there is no field for his powers . When we look into English eloquence , we think we can find there more intellect and poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though with less tumult , than in all the polished or boisterous harangues of the old orators. it surely ought not to be a cause of complaint with a great man , that the age he lives in , receives the highest exercise of his best powers , all the wealth of his mind , and forbids him to substitute clamour , ornament or unmeaning vehemence , for strength and becoming zeal . He should he proud that he is dealing with moral and intelligent beings , whose judgments he may convince and establish , and whose passions he can not hope to bring out , till they have travelled over the cool and pure region of the mind. - On the whole , we believe that in modern free states , there is room in all the departments // of eloquence , ( and we have no time to distinguish them ) for the display of what was of real practical worth in ancient oratory ; that we have advantages and opportunities peculiar to ourselves ; and that the means of abusing the art are greatly straightened by the intelligence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can now say to the scholar who loves the masters , or to the anxious observer who argues against oratory from its abuses . We shall not enter into the inquiry how far oratory is an art . The ancients had an easy way of resolving it into discipline , as they did poetry into inspiration or genius . We believe that the art , for such in some degree it certainly is , should bring us as near as possible to life . The instructer should give us such aids as we can turn to account when we go out into the world , whatever we may find the taste and manners of society to be . He is not to carry art so far , as to give a boy the habits of a school room , which shall make him awkward in a change of condition . He is not to kill his enthusiasm and genius by bringing him up to imitate models . Nor would we have Mr. Ogilvie fall into the mistake , that fine specimens of oratory on his Rostrum will be of much practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has not told us very precisely what he means by that oratory , yet as we have seen him upon his stage , we may take his example , together with a few hints in his book , for an explanation of his views . And we should say from these , that such oratory is chiefly intended for gratification of taste . The speaker comes before us as an artist . His manner is studied ; he aims at effect ; and as we are looking out for fine points , he is no less careful to make them . He is loosened from the restraints which society has imposed upon speakers , who deal in realities and present business . We are ready to allow him all the license of poetry . We give ourselves up to illusions , and are not offended even with inflated emptiness , if it only pour itself out in fine tones . Mr. Ogilvie himself has often convinced us , that any thing will do , " being seasoned with a gracious voice . " - This sort of oratory , or popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or presenting specimens of fine and varied modulation . But we believe that Mr. Ogilvie must keep his Rostrumn for the ladies and // gentlemen , and teach his boys to be good speakers by the severe and simple discipline of a school . He has drudgery and details to go through as well as other teachers . He must shew the learner his weapons and their uses . He has little dull errours to correct , and much to insist upon that is merely mechanical . And after all , he must send out his boys into the world to ripen . We wish him great success as a teacher of his art , and think that he may be really useful . We took up his hook , expecting to find in it some scheme for the improvement of oratory , since we had heard so lately that he had applied to teaching the art . We looked at least for one oration touching the Rostrum itself , but that we find is reserved for a second volume . We had reason to think he would say something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the means of reviving it , and of the obstacles to be met and removed . The title to be sure , might have saved us from such vain expectations ; but we thought that " Philosophical Essays , with copious notes , a supplementary narrative and an appendix , * ' together with the miscellaneous character of Mr. Ogilvie 's mind , would justify our hope that his favourite art would stand out in every l ) ai't of the book . We have indeed been a good deal disappointed ; and the only apology we can offer for saying so much upon a subject , which the book has so little to do with , is , that we have long been in the habit of associating Mr. Ogilvie with the improvement of his art in this country . We think too that the subject is important ; and what perhaps weighed with us now even more , is our belief that Mr. Ogilvie , will never give us another chance to say any thing of him or of oratory , since the appearance of his second volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alas , upon the reception of the one before us . It is high time to say a little of this work , and to apprize our readers that Mr. Ogilvie , in the prosecution of his literary enterprise , arrived a few months ago at a stage somewhat critical , and farther success became hopeless or worthless , without the acquisition of permanent and extended celebrity as a philosophical writer . ' We are very sorry for it , and should even think our author had merely fallen into a sudden mistake , were it not that he says these // very words a second time at the close of his book . And he leaves it to the publick to determine by their reception of this volume , whether he shall enjoy that share of permanent and extended celebrity , which is essential to his further success . ' A philosophical writer of permanent and extended celebrity ! If the man were our enemy , we should " thank him for teaching us that word . " But we are always in good humour with a work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after reading along a little while , we became so used to greatness , that we could hear Mr. Ogilvie promise it to his own name , as patiently as if he had awarded it to another . We turned first to the Narrative . We are somewhat at a loss to know why it is called supplementary , but we think it by far the most curious and entertaining part of the book . It gives us our author 's history , so far as it is connected with his literary and oratorical pursuits , and lets us a good deal into his infirmities of mind and constitution ; his moments of unassured consciousness and faintness of vital energy , vibrating betwixt the sick bed and the sepulchre , ' as well as his glows and irradiations of mind . You would judge from his own account , that all his experience lay wholly out of life , and differed from that of other men in the exquisiteness of luxury as well as of agony . This may be ascribed in a great measure to a deplorable lack of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life and what he owes to himself and his neighbour , and makes him provident for the means of real usefulness and unbroken happiness. - Mr . Ogilvie shews singular indiscretion , in keeping himself forever in sight . In his book he is as much the principal figure , as on his Rostrum , with all his parade , and outlandish costume about him . His airs and extravagance may divert mischievous readers , and most are of that class ; but the diversion will surely he at his own expense , and may cost him his good nature at least . He has looked upon the world these many years ; but we fear that he has lived very much out of those wholesome regions , where a man learns to rein in his enthusiasm , to feed his vanity in secret , to feel that society can do very well without him , that it has a resolute way of ridiculing those who proclaim their own merit , // and values that greatness only which oozes out " from the works that a man doeth . " Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal , tenderness and even loftiness ; and we are inclined to think that after all there is more of errour than of want in his mind . There seems to be a perpetual disease , a malignant sensitiveness hanging over him , and though he may be betrayed into fine accidents , we should hardly look for the useful results of a sound and governed mind . But we believe he may yet be useful and happy , if he will consent to think and act a little more like the rest of the world ; if he will but remember that failure is a much better instructer than ambition or illusion , and then turn back his enthusiasm to spheres where his success has been sure and beneficial . We find in the Narrative the stages through which he has passed , and how he came so abruptly upon the third and truly critical one , which we before alluded to . After his arrival in this country ( for he is a native of Scotland ) he taught a school in Virginia for thirteen years ; and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which he had always a great passion , and in a certain species of which he seems to think that nature or education had given him uncommon skill . Flattered by his success in the art , and exhausted by school-keeping and opium , the thought of delivering orations on the Rostrum suddenly crossed his imagination . Assured of ultimate , speedy and splendid success , ' he yielded to the thought , shut up his school , and began his new career , or more properly his first stage , in 1809 . It was at this time he became known to our readers. - The second stage presents our author as a teacher and lecturer in oratory . He began his labours at the college of South Carolina , and received the entire approbation of the Government . The scholars got up an illumination for him , and surprised him by a transparency over the door of the chapel , exhibiting the American Eagle , with our orator 's name in her talons . And when his course of instruction was ended , they presented him with a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck and proudly too , ' in his exhibitions on the Rostrum. - The third and critical stage shall be given in his own words . // " Having entered thus auspiciously on the second stage in the prosecution of the design , which he had undertaken , he began to fix his eye steadily on the third , as it distinctly emerged above the edge of his widening horizon , and loomed and lowered , like the Alpine hehrhts Hannibal . * , when they first arrested the gaze of " The stage to which he now so pompously adverts , was the establishment of ejjicient professorships of oratory in the Colleges , and the erection of spacious and magnificent halls , ( exclusively dedicated to the exercise and exhibition of oratory on the Rostrum , ) in the principal cities of the American republick . " Sup . Narr. lxii . The reader must make out if he can , what there is in this third stage , which required Mr. Ogilvie to become all at once a great philosopher . The hook leaves us very much in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have just stated , before the Legislature of South Carolina , in an elaborate oration ; he made two distinct efforts to secure its accomplishment , in his last visit to Charleston ; he declared his disinterestedness , and that he would not be prevailed upon to accept one of the contemplated professorships . But it would not do . His hearers applauded and smiled , and thought it would be impossible to bring any thing to pass at present . Whereupon our author seems to have gone frantick . He expresses his disappointment in what he calls the idiosyncratick idiom , ' which he frankly declares will he distinctly understood by only one in a hundred , and we unfortunately are among the ninety and nine . We know nothing further of the third stage , except that our author means to try once more in Charleston , and make similar attempts in all our principal cities , except Philadelphia , where , for a reason we shall mention presently , he has an assured presentiment of discomfiture . ' We wonder a little how he dared to print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill success might not be ascribed to the malign influences of that city , had he not assured us , that it is unphilosophical to resort to extraordinary causes , when ordinary ones are adequate to explain a fact. - There is yet a fourth stage in our author 's pursuits , but this is wholly in the mist , or rather has not yet emerged above the edge of his widening horizon . ' The narrative closes with bright visions of the future glories of the Rostrum . The whole is written in ex // tremely bad taste , and sprinkled with specimens of very ambitious and yet humble criticism , which we can not stop to notice . We ought to state that the author speaks of himself in the third person , and we account this the most niodest thing in the whole hook . Perhaps however , this very circumstance tempted him to say things , and in a manner too , that would have startled him if he had spoken in the first person . If therefore we may prescribe for his vanity , we will venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover for it . Mr. Ogilvie is as free to tell of his adventures as of his schemes or infirmities . We will give one or two from the narrative. - The first happened during his first visit at Philadelphia , while our author was yet a novice in the world . The college hail , which is devoted to publick worship on Sunday , and to science the rest of the week , was offered to Mr. Ogilvie for the delivery of his lectures , on his express assurance that they should contain no sentiment which could offend persons of any religious persuasion . He accordingly erected his Rostrum in front of the pulpit , and in one of his orations , after speaking of the blessed effects of our religion , he gave his hearers to know that his observations had regarded christianity merely as improving the condition of society . The awful and mysterious question in relation to its divine origin , I forbear to examine . o pity , great Father of light and of life , A heart that fain would not wander from thee , So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt and from darkness , thou only canst free . " But darkness and ( loubt are not flying away , Alas , I still roam in conjecture forlorn , Nor breaks on the wanderer faint and astray , Thc bright and the balmy effulgence of morn . " The effect of this , according to Mr. Ogilvie , must have been tremendous . The silence was deep and dead . His auditors seemed even to hold their breath and to stare at each other with " stony eyes . " The late C. B. Browne , // who was present , told Mr. Ogilvie afterwards , that his feelings on that occasion " made an era in his sensations . " But our orator , not aware how things were going , proceeded to finish his oration , and closed with a thundering , prophetick harangue against Bonaparte , filled with that hyperbole and bombast , and uttered with that impassioned vehemence , which he fears ( we think he should rather rejoice at it ) will always be most acceptable to a miscellaneous audience . This explosion seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plaudit loud , long and apparently unanimous . ' But nothing would do . The town was against him , and every body he met was ready with remonstrance , or disheartening tidings . In the language of an adviser , " he had thrown away an empire of fame and emolument ; " - in his own more glorious phraseology , he had dashed the brimming and golden goblet of success from his eager lip , dashed it almost untasted ! And all this came of his making a pretty and unchristian perversion of two stanzas of Beattie 's Hermit . In spite of his expressions of sorrow for his offensive avowal of skepticism , he was denied the further use of the ball , and we believe he has never since asserted the dignity of the Rostrum ' in that offended city . Sup . Narr. xxii . In his first visit to New York he shews himself once more in his noviciate of worldly wisdom , and well nigh brought the Rostrum into jeopardy , by his desperate love of saying something very tine . Towards the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was led to direct and fix the attention of his auditors on an epoch ( preeminently memorable , even amid a twenty years succession of astonishing events and prodigious revolutions , ) the portentous epoch ! " when the conqueror of Lodi and Marengo , pointing with his batoon to the white cliffs of Albion , whetted the insatiable cupidity , and infuriated the souls , of two hundred thousand cannibals , disciplined to every deed of death and deso* lation , by describing in words that burned ' on his lips , and in imagery which rage and rapine embodied and half realized as he spoke , the treasures of London , the plunder of the queen of isles , the beauty and the booty of the garden of the earth , the sub. * jugation of the magna virum mater ; to whose daughters the Paphian goddess had lent her cestus , and every grace her pe // cuhar attraction ; to whose sons Pallas had consigned her a*gis , Pomona her cornucopia , and Neptune had for a season transferred his trident . " " The audience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) catching suddenly and simultaneously , the feelings of the speaker , gave vent to their sympathetick enthusiasm , in a loud , protracted , and he believes heart-felt plaudit . The room shook , as if it had been rocked by an earthquake , as if it had reverberated the thunder 's or the cannon 's roar. - When the plaudit ceased , a gentleman , ' ( who turned out to be a united Irishman , ) deliberately rose from his seat in the middle of the room ; assumed an erect and disdainful port ; looked intrepidly and indignantly around , and without casting a glance , or directing his hand towards the Rostrum , but turning both successively and slowly to the auditors in every part of the room , hissed with set teeth and with an intensity of sibilation , that indicated unusual vehemence in the feeling by which it was prompted. - His proceeding excited a lively and general emotion of momentary anger . Frowning brows and hashing eyes were bent upon him , idly bent ! The hisser , with an air of calm defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . " At that moment , the situation of the orator , ( then a novice in such scenes , and destitute of that habitual self-possession , and imperturbable serenity of soul , which experience only can attemper and confirm , ) was critical and distressing . In the school of experience he has , he trusts , acquired a self-control and selfsubjection , which , to him , would make the recurrence of such an incident amusing merely : At this time , if the contents of a loaded pistol were discharged at him , whilst he was declaiming on the Rostrum , ( unless the contents pierced his heart , opened an artery , from which life-blood would burst in a torrent , or inflicted intolerable agony ; ) so unexpected and improbable an incident , could not now disturb him for a moment , or but for a moment . Far different were his feelings then . lie experienced inexpressible disquietude . Advancing to the very verge of the Rostrum , and with a gesture , attitude and expression of countenance , which emphatically indicated the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he succeeded in restoring order , and preventing outrage and violence , in an audience as polite and respectable as were ever , probably , assembled in that populous , opulent and flourishing city .

" -A reply to this in a democratick paper gave notice , " that if the oration were repeated and the Editor of the Post were present , the amusement of the evening would be diversified and enhanced by a game at leap-frog , in the course of which , that Editor would amuse and astonish the audience , by the most prodigious leap , from a window of Attick altitude , ever witnessed in that or any other city . " This brought out our orator , who arrested an altercalion , so hateful to his soul , so offensive to the dignity , and damnatory to the nascent glory of the Rostrum ; so abhorrent to all the aspirations and chivalrick enthusiasm , which had impelled him to undertake , and governed him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's card drew from the hisser the very flattering explanation , that the insult was not intended for Mr. Ogilvie , who was a native of Great Britain , and expressed only a natural feeling towards his own country , but that the hiss was meant for the audience . who listened silently to marked compliments to their own country , and " clapped for King George . " Our author says , he admires his intrepidity with all his heart . ' During the delivery of an oration in a small town in Kentucky , our orator , or rather the audience , was disturbed by an inebriated intruder . ' He had now grown so old on the Rostrum , that instead of being embarrassed by this incident , he turned it most admirably to a practical use . Inferring from the conduct of his hearers , who were soothing the drunkard in the most friendly manner , that he was a man of respectable station and character , our orator , with singular delicacy , " raised his voice to a tone , that drowned the unmeaning noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery of his oration , till a passage occurred , in which the misery an ( I ignominy of intemperance were depicted in strong colours . In pronouncing this passage , he descended from the Rostrum , and , advancing with a slow and pausing step , towards the bench , on which the involuntary and , probably , unconscious violator of decorum sat , or on which he had staggered and lay stretched ; continuing to declaim , as he advanced , till he approached the mind-deserted body as nearly as he could . Here , for a few mo // ments , he stood still ; ceased to declaim ; folded his arms , and resting his eye on the floor , slowly and solemnly said ,  --  " Where example so emphatically arrests attention , declamation may well be dumb : It is , and can be , but babbling and impertinence , in the presence of a warning , that addresses the soul through the senses . " Sup . Narr. xxxi . We think Sterne would have made a fine picture of this . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have a suspicion , that it was very far from gratifying the utmost wish of the orator . Mr. Ogilvie should know better than to bring living , retired individuals before the publick , especially to abuse them . The notoriety which one gains from being extolled or calumniated in print , may be gratifying to vulgar or abandoned spirits ; and distinguished characters must submit to such display , as to the order of society ; but the quiet , secluded and delicate must shrink from being made publick property in this way . In this country , or in our part of it at least , we are not yet used to this profligate introduction of private names into a hook ; we are not proud of the honour , and , we trust , the victims are not grateful for being thus distinguished . If Mr. Ogilvie 's book were of more importance , we should warn him to consult publick feeling on this matter a little more . His poor countryman , James M'Allister , must take the quarrel into his own hands ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's outrage , for when he gets into the western country , he seems infected with the wild independence of the region , and lays about him like a very backwoodsman. - This M'Allister , ( who is one of the ten children of a Scotch weaver , and who came nearer to the character ' of a scientifick sage , than any human being Mr. Ogilvie has ever known , with the exception of William Ogilvie , professor of humanity , in King 's College , Old Aberdeen , in Scotland , ' ) has very prudently settled himself for life in our western country , with his wife and children about him , and , for all that we know , is a very good farmer , and makes a very good husband and father . Our author visited him , in the hope that he would be all he had once known him ; able to advise and encourage him in the prosecution of his noble enterprise . // Here bitter was his disappointment ! He found him alive , indeed , and neither in bad health , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he might , the narrator adds with pain , ought to have been . He found him the idolater , and vassal of indolence ; the breathing and unburied victim of a voluntary and seemingly predestined insignificance and obscurity Upon renewing his intercourse with this motiveless monster of intellect , he sensibly felt the infectious stupefaction of his incurable and seemingly innate lethargy . As he listened to his cogent but abhorred logick , the nervous but soul-chilling eloquence , with which he expatiated on the inanity of fame , present or posthumous , ' on the difficulties that lie in the way of literary ambition , and on the nothingness of success , he felt conviction , " o'er his inmost vitals creeping cold . " This ill-fated man is doomed to pass the rest of his life , not where he ought to be , near the centre of the most enlightened circles in Edinburgh , London , or Paris , but in the bosom of the western wilderness . Yet even there , his possible value is inestimable . Could any popular Kentuckian patriot ( Mr. Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place him at the head of the College of Lexington ( whose present president would surely vanish at the very sound of his name ) he would give himself additional claims not only to the confidence and respect of his countrymen* but titles to the gratitude of posterity . It is afflicting , it is humiliating to reflect , that whilst the votaries of Mammon ransack the sunless and poison-breathing caverns of the earth ; descend even to the ceiling of Pandemonium ; venture almost into the jaws of death and hell , to extract gold from the bowels of the earth ; patriotism will suffer wisdom to slumber inactively on its surface , and genius to " waste its sweetness on the desert air . " After a few interviews , he recoiled with implacable antipathy from this incarnate Genius of the Castle of Indolence , and fled from his society , before he had fastened his spell on his soul . ' Sup . Narr. xliv &amp;c . We can not extract any more from the narrative , and we sincerely think that our readers will deal kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his manner , from the passages we have given . We are now coming to the philosophy , and shall despatch our work very speedily . This part of the book consists of three Essays , with copious notes . And you would // judge perhaps from these , that the author had read largely , and that his fine memory was abundantly stored ; that his mind had more of alacrity than insight , and was more greedy of accumulation than patient in exploring . If there were nothing else , his errours would he enough , to shew that he is exceedingly intrepid and independent in the use of his knowledge . We may say something of his style hereafter . The first Essay is " On the Study of Mathematical Science . " It is very short , and by far the most composed part of the hook . The object is , to shew the uses of thir study in disciplining and invigorating the mind , and thus indirectly helping to form the young orator . And the author swells into such enthusiasm , in behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul had been always devoted to abstract truth , and found its only atmosphere in the sw* pernal regions of pure intelligence . ' He seems to take a pleasure in exalting mathematicks above the poor mutable fabricks of morals and physicks . The truth of mathematical science is divine , Whedding the same " increate " and irrefrangible light on the minds of demons and damned spirits , and of Newton ; ' and ( what seems too solemn for such a flourish , ) we may even dare to believe that the evidence of its demonstration , is beheld in the same light by the Almighty mind , and the humblest and most fallible of his intelligent creatures . ' Not content with simply showing how the study gives habits of intense exertion , distinct , precise and composed thought , and stimulates inquiry and invention , he assures us , it is by the study of this sublime science , that juvenile intellect first " plumes its feathers and lets grow its wings ; " " rises intoregions mild , of calm and serene air , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which men call earth . " p. 17 . But a little after he grows more reasonable , and shews the tendency of a premature and excessive devotion to this study , not only to fold the wing and shut the eye of imagination , but to clip the plumage and cut the pectoral muscle of that " frolick wing . " ' p. 25. // Well : we have learned to make great allowance for our author 's singularities ; for having read his book through , we have discovered , that he makes it a point to be passionately fond of his present subject , whatever it may be , and to give it pre-eminence . Otherwise , we should have wondered , that a man of so much rhetorick and enthusiasm , should be so eloquent in behalf of a study that deals in cold certainties , especially when he regards its exclusive votary as a being , whose heart floats in a sort of mediocrity and apathy , in an element clear but cold ; pure and bright , but colourless ; calm and innoxious , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated in the Essay , that this study could not directly contribute to the attainment of oratorical skill , being exclusively conversant with truths , in the development of which , so far as consists in the exercise of a rich but disciplined imagination , of a pure yet refined taste , in the excitement of intense yet chastened passion , and in the exquisite embellishment of diction , oratory , in its technical and popular acceptation , is mad missible. ' p. 17. rp1ii* appeared perfectly just , and probably nobody would find fault with it , but the author himself Accordingly , in a note at the end of the Essays , he begins to repent , and thinks he has not been philosophical enough in this behalf . But if we take a more enlarged and philosophical view of oratory* even the theorems of mathematical and the principles of physical science , may fall within the legitimate sphere of this glorious art . ' p. 267 . Now we shall not allow our author , without warning , to couple mathematicks with natural phiioso*hy , especially as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let the divine science stand by itself ; and then hear our orator . Imagine a great mathematician demon4rating such a theorem , in the presence of an audience , sufficiently en1i*htened to comprehend the * ) rogressive steps of his reasoning , as they are embodied by the utterance of the speaker : Imagine , that // with perfect distinctness of articulation , propriety of emphasis , a modulation of voice agreeable to the ear , and suitable dignity and vivacity of manner , he unfolds a principle that enlarges the boundaries of human knowledge , and reveals the arcana of nature to the inquiring mind . Feeling the most unshaken conviction of its truth and importance , and elevated by a consciousness of intellectual dignity , superiority and power , with what earestness does he investigate , with what perspicuity develop , with what felicity illustrate its evidence and utility . ' - LIis emotions thicken with the discovery of truth , and his imagination is busy in anticipating its uses . He even displays a graceful and impassioned elocution. - ' Can the countenance be vacant , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterance frigid or monotonous , when the light of eternal truth irradiates the understanding , when the heart swells with the divine enthusiasm which it inspires , and with a lively anticipation of the unspeakable benefits , which it has in store for mankind ? ' These were the themes of oratory , that ravished the senses and the soul of Adam , as it flowed from the lips of Raphael . Whilst Adam listened to this seraphic oratory , he became unconscious , even of the divine beauties of Eden . The lovely mother of mankind , forgotten and unobserved , averted her eye from the fatal apple ! At that moment , even the tempter had shrunk in conscious impotence from her ear , and listened with reluctant rapture to the seraph 's tongue , ' &amp;c. p. 268-9 . This is what our author calls a more philosophical view of oratory . His passion for mathematical oratory , soon reaches such a height , that he declaims , without the least remorse , against mere worldly eloquence , and goes very near , we think , to demolishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences , and closes the note with a prudent admission ( which should have saved him from writing it , ) that this mathematical oratory will not do now-a-days for popular purposes . The second Essay , which is a good deal more ambitious , is " on the Nature , Extent , and Limits of Human Knowledge , so far as it is founded in the relation of cause and effect , and concerns mind and matter . " We have here old truths and errours , and doubtful novelties , to say the least of them , served up to the solitary reader , ' after the manner of the Rostrum . We shall not undertake to fol // low Mr. Ogilvie through this Essay , for it would carry us greatly out of our limits , and much farther than is necessary to ascertain his pretensions to celebrity as a philosophical wri*-ter . He is so desultory and miscellaneous , adopts so readily the mistakes of others , and assumes so confidently what some would deny , and others ask him at least to explain , that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lead us over much of the field of modern scepticism ; of ethical and metaphysical controversy . We shall look at his plan , and perhaps at an errour or two , as we g* along . He first undertakes to set Locke right as to the inlets of knowledge ; charging him with lack of philosophical precision , in ascribing to reflection instead of consciousness , our acquaintance with our intellectual faculties and operations . So far we are upon beaten ground . But we are in the wilderness , when Mr. Ogilvie calls reflection a concentration of consciousness on whatever ( whether an impression from without , or an internal operation ) excites peculiar interest . ' Besides this , without any open quarrel with Locke or any body else respecting sensation or per*eption , he goes on ( and this too for the sake of precision ) to make consciousness the fountain of all our actual or possible knowledge . Our language , and of course our ideas , as they regard the philosophy of the human mind , will he more precise , if we consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consczousness , first of impressions from external objects , and secondly of the internal energies that are called into action by these impressions . ' p.34 . If he tells us , he talks after the manner of Hume , we assure him that his exactest imitation of his master will lend no light to this subject , and moreover , he must give up talking about external objects and matter . We wish he had been less vague where it was his purpose , and an ' easy thing too , to be precise . He should have remembered that men ( and great philosophers amongst them ) are very much in the habit now , of finding objects of pesception in things external , and those of consciousness in the mind only . // After this philosophical view of the origin of knowledge , he goes on to define the thing itself to be , the arrangemeat of the various subjects of modifications of consciousness , in the order of cause and effect . ' If we understood him just now , these very subjects and modifications of consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition then brings us to the important truth , that knowledge is the arrangement of knowledge in the order of cause and effect . ' And we hold this to be a very extraordinary account of a very old word . It is mere assumption , and stands in great need of explanation and proof . You must now expect to see him as enthusiastick about the relation of cause and effect , as he was just now about mathematicks . The dignity of our nature , its preeminence and dominion upon earth , its capabilities of improvement primordially originate in its capacity to unravel indefinitely the chain of cause and effect . ' Its progress in improvement is identified with the knowledge of this relation . The prophet evolves links in the chain by divine aid . The worker of miracles inserts new links . And the philosopher differs from the superficial , that the chain with him is longer , and composed of more and finer links . And by this wonderful relation , he understands , that order or succession , the discovery or development of which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon , or by a series of given events or phenomena , to anticipate the recurrence of another event or phenomenon , or a required series of events or phenomena , and to summon them into existence , and employ their instrumentality , in the gratification of his wishes , or in the accomplishment of his purposes . ' p. 35 . As these Essays are written for the young , we think this fundamental relation should have been explained more simply ; though we would not have our author undertake to prove his assertion , that every department of human knowledge is founded in this relation , lest he should succeed no better , than in his attempt to bring mathematicks within his definition of knowledge , not indeed as coming within // any arrangement in the order of cause and effect , ' but as helping us to unravel the chain it is certain , that we are very much in the dark as to *fficient causes . We can not trace what the philosophers call necessary connexions in the phenomena we witness ; nor can we explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cause . " XVe observe a constant conjunction between certain events ; we confidently look for this conjunction hereafter , and are in the habit of calling that which precedes , the cause ; and that which follows , the effect . if this is what Mr. O*. , ilcie means , when he says , that we owe to Hume the first satisfactory elucidation of the fact , that our knowledge of cause and effect includes nothing more than a perception and belief of the uniform antecedence of one event and sequence of another , we assure him , the fact was clearly held and explained , and by christian philosophers too , before Ilume 's speculations appeared . If Mr. Ogilvie 's statement of the fact mean the same thing as ours , we can set him right on another point . lie gives us to know , that Dr. Reid and his disciples , differ from Hume , and on fallacious grounds too , as to the fact which has just been stated . Mr. Ogilvie will find , by looking into the matter , that Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the sceptical conclusions , which Hume drew from a principle they admitted. - The Doctor does indeed argue rather drily against Hume , that if mere priority or conjunction implied efficiency or causation , we may call day the cause of night , night the cause of day , and in this way make any thing to be the cause of any thing . We are sorry to see Mr. Ogilvie so much discomposed at this. * Dr. Reid does indeed deny , that there is any efficiency in priority or conjunction . Still he thinks we are greatly in the dark as to efficient causes , though * The Shepherd tells Touchstone , " that a great cause of the night , is lack of the sun ; " or , in our author 's elegant paraphrase , it is the ab sence of solar light in consequence of interposing terraqucous opacity . Mr. Ogilv , ie actually undertakes to support the shepherd 's proposition , in a very vigorous analysis of day and night , shewiug how they resolve them selves into four links in the chain of cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a first principle , that there must be an efficient cause for every phenomenon we witness . He is merely saving men from dreary scepticism . Mr. Ogilvie should have understood his countrymen better , and remembered that Hume himself may possibly better deserve the charge of sophistical artifice , ' than such a straight-forward observer as Dr. Reid . The foundation of knowledge being laid , our author proceeds to analyse the relation of cause and effect ; and begins with inquiring into the grounds of our belief , that the succession of events in time future , will resemble that of events in time past . He takes Adam , ( who had the advantage of being full grown from the first , and who surely would be the only 1 ) erson , who could have any doubts on the subject ) and gives a flourishing account of the supposed state of his mind , as to the reappearance of the sun after its first set . At first , he is in perfect uncertainty ; but the repeated and regular return of the luminary would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unbroken alternation of day and night ; though it would take an antediluvian life at least , to become as sure of the fact as we are . So Mr. Ogilvie adopts Hume 's hypothesis , and resolves our belief in this case into custom or habit ; while Dr. Reid would make it a part of our constitution . Here then is our author 's creed , and we take it to be a mere obscuration of Hume . He is now in motion , and the remainder of the Essay is devoted to defining the regions of the knowable , and drawing several conclusions from the whole matter . Of these , and the enormous notes upon every thing , we can say nothing . We wish , however , that our author had avoided ambiguity and contradiction , upon the delicate subject of the immutability of truth . He is so hard upon poor Beattie , for wanting philosophy in treating this subject , that he should have been exceedingly careful of his own growing reputation in that line . At one time he tells us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical order of the universe , leads directly to atheism ; and at another , that the mighty laws of nature bind with " adamantine chains , " and support with " Atlantean shoulders " the immutable order of the moral and material universe . ' this is loose , and satisfies us that his oratory and rhetorick are greatly in the way of his philosophy and logick. // The last , and by a page or two , the longest Essay , is upon the " Modern abuse of moral fiction in the shape of Novels . " It is of this Essay , that he says , every sentence came , ( gushed he had almost said ) from his heart . ' " The subject is so peculiarly susceptible of rhetorical embellishment , so admirably adapted to the purposes of impassioned declamation , that he offers no apology for the style . ' It was fair to warn us ot this ; so we entered prepared , and found a good deal of just remark , mixed up with the mistakes of a solitary man , who thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed from false representations of life given in novels , merely because 1e is not aware what a cluster of realities and " tangible motives " there is around us of the city , which breaks up our illusions , and bring us down to " sober certainty , " long before we begin to act . Still there is a laudable honesty in Mr. Ogilvie 's zeal , and no doubt he strikes at many real mischiefs. - If a fiction is intended for our taste merely , or for out ' moral improvement too , it should certainly be consistent . Let it be poetry or life ; or if it give models for practical use , let them be such as are fitted for beings cast as we are , even though we may not see around us , any actual combination of virtues , which will answer to that in the story. - It is needless to say , that novels , like every thing else in literature , have fallen too much into the hands of men whom nature never formed for authors ; men void of genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wild romance or idle pastoral , and mixing all up in a way of vulgar tawdriness , to entertain boys and girls , who have more sensibility perhaps , but riot a jot more of experience than the authors themselves . Thus it is that the young are inflamed or misguided , and their relish for a book turned to sickly stories ; not to fine fable , which fertilizes the imagination ; to high adventures , which stimulate curiosity and make one stretch beyond his own home ; not to history or travels ) which are crowded with truth as well as excitement ; and all which may be enjoyed by the young , not only without enfeebling and dissipating the mind , but actually purifying and strengthening it . No-it is to mawkish , immoral , delusive nonsense ; to which the herd of novel-writers tempt their readers , // and to Whicl ) our printers are often most unworthy auxiliaries , inasmuch , as having it in their power to do something for our taste and morals , with profit to themselves , they still contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wretched composition . If a dull poem comes out , it is in general sure to die shortly : or to live in a very narrow region ; for poetry is somewhat the property and luxury of the intelligent , or at least owes its popularity for the most part to their judgments ; and perhaps no other sort of composition depends so much upon skill , and shews so plainly and so fatally its own defects . But the meanest novel has the vulgar charm of a story , and almost any thing of this sort will have admirers . The clumsy workmanship is kept out of sight , by wonders and sentimentality . rrhe favourite volume is soiled to-day in the kitchen , and to-morrow in the parlour . It has readers among the high and low , to sigh and melt over its extravagance an ( l lies . Fortunately , there are fine novels too , that have a place in literature , and save the moderns from the reproach of failure in a species of composition , that has no model in antiquity. - We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , which we may perhaps call religious . We set Discipline ' at the head of these , and venture to hope that authors , blest with genius and knowledge of life , will hereafter learn from this book , that the direct mention of our religion may be seriously introduced in a novel , without injuring its sale , or subjecting the author to the charge of cant or hypocrisy . We are growin * almost as zealous as Mr. Ogilvie . But we can not recommend this Essay for a philosophical one , any more than the others . The extracts we have made , are probably enough to let our readers into the peculiarities of Mr. ( igilvie 's style , though we assure them we have not sought out defects , and we think the author himself will allow , that we have omitted some of the most vicious passages . He was writing for the young , and therefore concluded that ornament and copious illustration were indispensable to gaining attention . his long habit of popular declamation led him , in preparing his book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rostrum , of moving the affections , and neglecting // the judgment . Vie had also unfortunately found out , that Dugald Stewart had done more to recommend the philosophy of the mind , than any other man , by his style and illustrations . ' All these things conspired , with his own defects of taste , to per *ui de him that truth was but an unsavoury morsel of itself , and would go down and nourish one better , if fairly smothered by cookery. - At the close of the volume , he looks back upon his lahours , with the mournful remembrance of exhausting toils made fruitless by defects . An author has some claims upon our compassion , ( and this Mr. Ogilvie very honourably disdains ) who shuts up so long a work with acknowledginents of deficiency , unpreparedness and unaccustomedness , and with sad allusions to his lonely and unfriended labours . He came at last to a clear conviction of the radical malignity of metaphor , ' and means in another work , to shew its unfitness , not only in philosophical disquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are glad to find him for once , io an errour on the safe side , and will quote his favourite H nine , by way of reproof and encouragement . " In all abstract reasonings , there is one point of view , which , if we can happily hit , we shall go farther towards illustrating the subject , than by all the eloquence and copious expression in the world . This point of view we should endeavour to reach , and reserve the flowers of rhetorick for subjects which are more adapted to them . " The wonder with us is , how Mr. Ogilvie should have studied fine authors so long , and certainly become acquainted with the taste of readers , and yet had the courage to carry into his book as bad composition , as lie could possibly expect to pass off on a mixed crowd , by all the helps of his fine speaking . We find fault with his excesses and his gilding ; but we would not have it thought , that he gives us the gorgeous , perhaps licentious diction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school-boy , or the hurried imagery of a writer who is warm with his subject , is caught for a moment by an illustration , gives it in a word , and rushes on impatiently with his reflections . He strikes us more like a man , who makes ornaments and beauties out of his dictionary , though he often gives proofs of a rich fancy , and of nice susceptibility to beauty in others. - We are perhaps the more disgusted , at seeing sober philoso // phy arrayed in such sorry and unbecoming finery . One is almost tempted to think , that in Mr. Ogilvie 's mind , tropes and beauties were thrown in amongst facts and conclusions , so that in looking for a truth , he was bewitched by the light graces that started up , and that he could only bring it out , hung round with the flaunting ornaments that lay near it . When we think of the sumptuousness and vagueness of his language , the solemnity and poetical indistinctness of his statements , the boundless stretch of his views , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the unexpected beauties that now and then shew themselves , we are tempted to call this work the most grotesque literary curiosity we have seen , and shall venture , with Dryden 's leave , to pronounce our author 's manner , the philosophical " fairy-way of writing . " Amongst his first wants are simplicity , calmness , and directness . He wants courage to say a thing outright , and sometimes props himself up by mere words , whilst aspiring to a distant beauty that has caught his fancy . He has no natural falls and elevations , to suit the varieties of thought . He is always straining and striving , and actually talks of the damnatory weight of blasphemy , ' in a man who spoke lightly of Cicero . He is so sweeping and boisterous in his severest philosophical investigations , that we are constantly reminded of his rifle of analysis , and the Congreve rockets of philosophical rhetorick. '  - -  His want of skill is seldom more remarkable , than in his long parenthetical sentences . We like sentential length , ' as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who goes through a long process of accumulation , with a strict preservation of dependence in his thoughts , enabling us as we go along to feel , ( if we may use expressions that have been applied to logical reasoning ) not only the concatenation of the links , but that the whole chain is still fastened to the hook , or yet further to the beam . The process is indeed very artificial , but we like to see it well carried through . Our author is singularly unskilful at this work , though he is particularly ambitious to excel in it . If we had room , we might justify this remark , by a passage from the Narrative , ( p. lxxxv. &amp;c. ) where we have one sentence of two pages , including three paragraphs.  - -  He is as fond of parentheses as of long sentences , and they are // often quite as embarrassing . In the very spirit of the song , beginning as we believe with , " what 's an old bachelor like , " he shews us what an unparenthetical style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glands without absorbents ; a chamber without closets ; a coat or a pair of pantaloons without pockets ; a sideboard without compartments ; a trunk without a boot ; p. xcviii . For all this , we have seen our author quite lost in a sentence of moderate length , even with the aid of a parenthesis within a parenthesis . Sup . Nar. xxii. &amp;c . Till he is more practised , he had much better condescend to write in the uninvolved manner of his favourites , Campbell and Hume. - It will not do for Mr. Ogilvie to affect contempt of style , because he has found so many blemishes in his own . We believe that his defects of composition are nearly connected with important defects in his mind and ways of thinking , and are an essential injury to his meaning , where he has any . And when we ask him to reform his manner altogether , it is not merely from a regard to the taste of his fastidious readers , but because we believe that a simple , direct mode of expression , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save him from mistaking words for substance . But we must close , though we had something to say of his innumerable compound epithets , his bad English , his childish way of dovetailing fragments of borrowed poetry or prose into his text , and of his beggarly repetition , again and again , of passages that are quite familiar , except when he misquotes them. - The neglect in which his book continues to sleep , is another symptom , that something like good taste is growing up amongst us ; and we are really glad that the work can not , with any justice , be thrown upon our literature . If the book had been of any value , his countrymen would certainly have claimed it , and we shall not allow them to cast it upon our hands now , though it would be in their way to tell us , that we spoilt the author . We are charitable enough , when we have any thing to bestow ; but the fact is , we have no literary reputation to spare . We have enough bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We leave Mr. Ogilvie to " the august and // appellate tribunals of criticism " ( whose notice and favour he confidently expects , ) for abler censure or worthier commondation than ours ; and in parting , we beg him , whatever he may do for the improvement of our boys in speaking , by all means to let their composition alone .
