txt Mv admiration of Shakspeare , as a profound delineator of human nature and a sublime poet , is but little short of idolatry . I think he is often misunderstood , as performed on the stage . The character of Juliet , for example , is travestied almost into burlesque , by the alteration of the text in the Scene where the nurse , with so much precision , fixes her age ( act 1 , Scene 3 . ) The nurse declares she knows it to an hour , and that next Lammas eve , ( which Lady Capulet says will be in a fortnight and odd days ) she will be fourteen . Upon this precise age , the character of Juliet , her discourse , her passion , and the deep pathos of the interest that we take in her fate , very largely repose . Born under Italian skies , she is at the very moment of transition from the child to the woman . Her love is the pure impulse of intelli-. gent sensitive nature-first love-unconscious and undissembled nature , childhood expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ardor , all ecstasy . How irresistibly are our sympathies moved at seeing the blossom blasted at the very moment while it is opening to the sun ! As the play is performed on the stage , the nurse , instead of saying that Juliet , at the next Lammas eve , will be fourteen , says she will be nineteen . Nineteen ! In what country of the world was a young lady of nineteen ever constantly attended by a nurse ? Between the ages of thirteen and fourteen , a nurse , in a noble Italian family of the middle ages , was not yet an unnatural companion . On the verge of nineteen , the nurse is not only supernumerary , but very much out of place . Take away the age of Juliet , and you take away from her all her individuality , all the consistency of her character , all that childish simplicity , which , blended with the fervor of her passion , constitutes her greatest charm . In what but in that , and in everything which she does and says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Miranda , from Ophelia , and indeed from all the lovely daughters of Shakspeare 's muse ? They are all in love , but you can never mistake one of them for another . The peculiarities of Juliet all have reference to her age ; and that which in her mouth is enchanting , would seem but frothy nonsense from a woman five years older . Juliet says - And when Romeo dies , Take him and cut him up in little stare , And he shall make the face of Heaven so fine , That all the world shall grow in love with night , And pay no worship to the garish sun . ' // nineteen , however desperately in love . One , who has been accustomed to personate Juliet as a young woman of nineteen , may see no incongruity with that age in her character ; yet that one , who has herself passed through both those stages of life , should not understand the difference of maturity between the ages of fourteen and of nineteen in the female sex , is scarcely conceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That he intended to make the age of Juliet an exposition of her character , is evident from the special care he has taken to make the nurse announce it . If the meanest of dramatists were to undertake to write a tragedy , and to draw the character and to repeat the discourse of a girl of fourteen , attended throughout the play hy a nurse , can we imagine that he would change the age to nineteen and yet retain the nurse , and give to the full-formed woman the same character and the same tone of dialogue which he would to the ripening child of fourteen ? Such a writer would prove himself as poor a proficient in the school of human nature as in that of Shakspeare . In that ever memorable delineation of the Life of man , and its division into seven ages , ' hy Jaques , in the comedy of As you like it , ' the meditative moralist says that each man in his turn plays many parts . He says , too , that all the men and women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits only the seven ages of the man ; but there was certainly in the mind of the poet a corresponding division in the ages of the woman ; and Juliet , at any age short of fourteen , and yet tinder the care of a nurse , partakes at once , in the relation of her sex , of the schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face , creeping like a snail unwillingly to school , and of the lover sighing like a furnace , with a woful ballad made to his mistress 's eyebrow . Shakspeare was not the observer and painter of nature , to confound them together . If he had exhibited in action a school-boy of between thirteen and fourteen , think you that he would have given him the features , or inspired him with the language and ideas of a lover at nineteen ? Our youth at fourteen are yet under the age of passing from the school to the university ; at nineteen , many of them have already closed their career at the university and passed into the busy scenes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maturity in advance of the male ; and a woman at nineteen is generally more completely formed than a man at twenty-one . Shakspeare , with his intuitive sagacity , has also marked the characteristics of the change between these two of his seven ages . ' In the Merchant of Venice , ' when Portia proposes to Nerissa that they should assume male attire and go to Venice , she *ays - I 11 hold thee any wager , When we are both apparell 'd like young men , // I 11 prove the prettier fellow of the two , And wear my dagger with the braver grace , . flnd speak between the change of man and boy With a reed voice ; and turn two mincing steps Into a manly stride ; and speak of frays Like a fine bragging youth ; and tell quaint lyes how honorable ladies sought my love , Which I denying , they fell sick and died .

' * Tragedy , according to the admirable definition of Aristotle , is a poem imitative of human life , and the object of which is to purify the soul of the spectator by the agency of terror and pity . The terror is excited by the incidents of the story and the sufferings of the person represented ; the pity , by the interest of sympathy with their characters . Terror and pity are moved by the mere aspect of human sufferings ; but the sympathy is strong or weak , in proportion to the interest that we take in the character of the sufferer . With this definition of tragedy , Romeo and Juliet ' is a drama of the highest order . The incidents of terror and the sufferings of the principal persons of the . drama arouse every sympathy of the soul , and the interest of sympathy with Juliet . She unites all the interest of ecstatic love , of unexampled calamity , and of the peculiar tenderness which the heart feels for innocence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Verona , at the conclusion of the play - For never was a story of more wo Than this of Juliet and her Romeo . ' The age of Juliet seems to be the key to her character throughout the play , an essential ingredient in the intense sympathy which she inspires ; and Shakspeare has marked it , not only in her discourse , but even in her name , the diminutive of tender affections applied only to childhood . If Shakspeare had exhibited upon the stage a woman of nineteen , he would have distnissed her nurse and called her Julia . She might still have been a very interesting character , but the whole color and complexion of the play must have been changed . An intelligent , virtuous woman , in love with a youth of assorted age and congenial character , is always a person of deep interest in the drama . But that interest is heightened and redoubled when , to the sympathy with the lover you add all the kind affections with which you share in the joys and sorrows of the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the poet has shown us why ; because she had scarcely ceased // to be a child . There is nonsense in the alteration of Shakspeare 's text upon the stage . There are several of the most admired plays of Shakspeare which give much more pleasure to read than to see performed upon the stage . For instance , Othello ' and Lear ' ; both of which abound in beauty of detail , in poetical passages , in highlywrought and consistently preserved characters . But , the pleasare that we take in witnessing a performance upon the stage , depends much upon the sympathy that we feel with the sufferings and enjoyments of the good characters represented , and upon the punishment of the had . We never can sympathise much with Desdemona or with Lear , because we never can separate them from the estimate that the lady is little less than a wanton , and the old king nothing less than a dotard . Who can sympathise with the love ofDesdemona ?  --  the daughter of a Venetian nohleman , born and educated to a splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and makes a runaway match with a hlackamoor , for no better reason than that he has told her a braggart story of his hair-breadth escapes in war . For this , she not only violates her duties to her father , her family , her sex , and her country , but she makes the first advances . She tells Othello she wished Heaven had made her such a man , and informs him how any friend of his may win her hy telling her again his story . On that hint , says he , I spoke ; and well he might . The blood must circulate hriskly in the veins of a young woman , so fascinated , and so coming to the tale of a rude , unbleached African soldier . The great moral lesson of the tragedy of Othello ' is , that black and white blood can not be intermingled in marriage without a gross outrage upon the law of Nature ; and that , in such violations , Nature will vindicate her laws . The moral of Othello is not to beware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and conduct of his wife , though not in the fact of her infidelity with Cassio . Desdemona is not false to her husband , but she has been false to the purity and delicacy of her sex and condition when she married him ; and the last words spoken by her father on parting from them , after he has forgiven her and acquiesced in the marriage , are - Look to her , Moor ; have a quick eye to see : She has deceived her father , and may thee . ' And this very idea is that by which the crafty villain Jago works up into madness the jealousy of Othello . Whatever sympathy we feel for the sufferings of Desdemona flows from the consideration that she is innocent of the particular crime imputed to her , and that she is the victim of a treacherous and artful intriguer . But , while compassionating her melancholy fate , we can not forget the vice of her character . Upon the stage , // her fondling with Othello is disgusting . Who , in real life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife ? ShQ is not guilty of infidelity to her husband , hut she forfeits all the affection of her father and all her own filial affection for him . When the duke proposes , on the departure of Othello for the war , *that she should return during his absence to her father 's house , the father , the daughter and the husband all say No ! She prefers following Othello , to be besieged by the Turks in the island of Cyprus . The character of IDesdemona is admirably drawn and faithfully preserved throughout the play . It is always deficient in delicacy . Her conversations with Emilia indicate unsettled principles , even with regard to the obligations of the nuptial tie , and she allows Jago , almost unrebuked , to banter with her very coarsely upon women . This character takes from us so much of the sympathetic interest in her sufferings , that when Othello smothers her in bed , the terror and the pity subside immediately into the sentiment that she has her deserts . We feel a similar want of interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . The story of Lear , as those of Othello and Romeo and Juliet , was ready-made to the hand of Shakspeare . They were not of his invention . King Lear and his three daughters form a part of the fahulous history of England . The dotage of an absolute monarch may be a suitable subject of tragedy ; and Shakspeare has made a deep tragedy of it . But , as exhibited upon the stage , it is turned into a comedy . Lear , the dotard and the madman , is restored to his . throne , and Cordelia finishes with a wedding . What can be more absurd ! Dotage and madness , in the person of a king , possessed of the power to give away his kingdom at his pleasure , afford melancholy contemplations of human nature . They are not fit subjects for comedy . Lear is no more fit to be restored to his kingdom than Christopher Sly is to be metamorphosed into a lord . Lear is a dotard and a madman from the first scene in the play , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affec-* tionate daughter , that we feel but little compassion for whatever may afterwards befall him . The interesting character of the play is Cordelia ; and what a lovely character it is ! But the restoration of a dotard from old age to his senses , is as much out of nature as the restoration to his throne is preposterous . Lear , as Shakspeare painted him , is the wreck of a mighty mind and proud spirit , sunk from despotic power into dotage , and maddened by the calamitous consequences of his own imbecility . His madness , with lucid flashes of intellect , is incurable . It is terrible it is piteous ! But it is its effect on the fortunes and fate of Cordelia , that constitutes the chief interest of the spectator ; and // Lear himself , from his first appearance , loses all title to compassion . The chief import of these objections to the manner in which Shakspeare 's plays are represented upon the stage , is to vindicate the great master of the drama ' from the liberties taken by stagemanagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alteration of a single word - the substitution of nineteen for fourteen - changes the whole character of the play - makes that , which is a perfect imitation of nature , incongruous absurdity , and takes from one of the loveliest creations of Shakspeare half her charm .
