SCENE 1 .  --  A hall in Makesafe 's house , with two doors in front of the stage  --  one leading to Adelaide 's room , the other to Makesafe 's  --  two tables , covered with books and writing materials  --  chairs , &c.; Caution , Makesafe , and Judith discovered . Make . Makesafe LISTEN to me both of you , for I have something of importance to communicate . I know I can confide in you , and it is not necessary I should remind you , what I have promised you . Caut . Caution For my part  --  I speak only for myself , though  --  Confide in me and you 'll never repent it . Jud . Judith I hope I need not tell you I am to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak for me . You may be sure I shall never disclose your secrets . Who can be more silent than I ? Caut . Caution ( Aside ) The town cryer . Make . Makesafe I am satisfied  --  attend  --  It is of my little roguish ward I wish to speak to you , who , during the last three months that I have had the folly to let her pass with one of har aunts , has become acquainted with a certain young fellow whose name is Camelion , and with whom she fancies herself in love , forsooth . Jud . Judith Lord bless us , in love ! Well , these are times , to be sure ! Caut . Caution Silence ! let me listen .  --  Fancies herself in love , forsooth ! what 's next to love forsooth ? Make . Makesafe This whim of her 's does not by any means assort with my views  --  my intention being to marry her to my nephew Laglast . Jud . Judith All this is news to me . You might as well tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attorney by profession  --  that this is Christopher Caution , your foolish clerk  --  and that I am  --  Caut . Caution Judith , the chat  --  chat  --  chattering old housekeeper . Jud . Judith Old  --  come , I am but fifty-five , Mr. Impudence . Caut . Caution That 's pretty well for a young one . Make . Makesafe Come , come  --  attend ; you have broke the thread of my story , and I forget where I was . Caut . Caution You left off at Laglast  --  nephew Laglast . Make . Makesafe True  --  I expect him here this very day ; and it is my intention to conclude this match the moment he arrives . Caut . Caution The moment he arrives ! Make . Makesafe I shall find means to make Adelaide obedient to my will . Jud . Judith There will be the difficulty  --  she does not appear to me to be so easily managed . Make . Makesafe I shall find means  --  Her lover , I am told , has been seen lurking about here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and window in it  --  But though he is , as they say , up to every thing , he wo n't find it so easy to be up to me . Caut . Caution No , nor up to your windows ; I 'll take care of that . Make . Makesafe You do'nt know the puppy , do you , Mrs. Judith ? Jud . Judith Me , indeed ! I know none such . If any male things pass where I am walking , I always turn my head another way ; I never look at any thing of the kind . Caut . Caution Ah ! you are an innocent young creature , to be sure ! Make . Makesafe Come , let us arrange our plan  --  in case this young gentleman should have the audacity to gain admittance here . Adelaide enters from her room . Ade . Adelaide ( Apart ) They are speaking of my lover  --  I must be on the listen . Make . Makesafe I am determined that each of you shall stand centinel at one of these doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall rely on it that you will let nobody enter but my nephew , and two other persons , of whom I shall give you so exact a description , that it will be impossible for you to mistake them , although you are unacquainted with them . Ade . Adelaide ( Apart ) I must attend to this very accurate description . Caut . Caution Suppose we should forget what you tell us . Make . Makesafe That that may not happen , sit down each of you at one of these tables , and write what I dictate . Ade . Adelaide ( Apart ) As I am apt to be a little forgetful , I may as well write too . ( Runs into the room . ) Quartetto . Makesafe . Makesafe Take your pens my friends and write What I shall to you indite . Caution . Caution Good beginning makes good ending , Stop awhile my pen wants mending . I have mended it  --  now begin . Makesafe . Makesafe Are you both ready ? ( Re-enter Ade . with pencil and paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelaide . Adelaide All three . Makesafe . Makesafe Now attend . Adelaide . Adelaide Ha ! ha ! ha ! Makesafe . Makesafe What are you both about ? Caut. and Jud . Caution , Judith You'r so quick you put me out , What are you both about ? Make . Caut. and Jud . Makesafe , Caution , Judith What are you both about ? Adelaide . Adelaide What are they all about ? ( Makesafe , Caution and Judith sit down at the table  --  Makesafe in the centre . ) Make . Makesafe Silence ! I say , while I describe to you my client , Lady Pepperpod , an old lady about sixty , who comes from the country to give me instructions about a cause of considerable consequence . Caut . Caution To her ? Make . Makesafe Aye , and to me too  --  I dare say I shall get more by it than she will . Her dress is quite in the manner of the old school  --  a crimson gown , with a fine brocaded petticoat  --  deep laced ruffles  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profusion of ribbons  --  a pair of high-heeled shoes  --  a sharp visage , with a nose rather inclining to the ruby , and a tall figure ; making an appearance altogether perhaps a little outre  --  But I desire she may be treated with great respect , for she is a very good client of mine . Jud . Judith I shall receive her accordingly . Make . Makesafe Then there 's Malachi the Jew  --  He is a very general dealer as well as money lender , who comes to see certain debtors of his , who have not been quite so regular in their payments as he requires . He is of a spare habit , and rather tall ; he has a red beard , and a red head , a broad brimmed hat , turned up at the sides , and a long dark coat , almost down to his heels . I think you can not mistake him . Caut . Caution I have him before me  --  " almost down to his heels "  --  ( writing . ) Make . Makesafe Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Yorkshire , I say nothing ; for I have not seen him these five and twenty years , when I stood godfather for him ; since which , he is in all probability a little altered . Caut . Caution A good deal , most likely . Make . Makesafe I asked him to describe his person to me by letter , and he writes me that he is about six feet high ; neither too fat nor too lean , with a handsome ruddy countenance , and a most agreeable manner of delivering himself in conversation . Jud . Judith A modest young man , truly ! We shall no doubt know him by his dialect . Make . Makesafe These are the only persons to be admitted . Now each of you to your post , and if Adelaide 's lover makes his way in here , I 'll forgive him . Ade . Adelaide ( Apart ) And if he does not , I wo n't forgive him  --  Here are his instructions  --  I 'll take this opportunity to throw them to him from my window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caution ( Reading his paper ) " Crimson satin gown , hat and ribbons  --  Red beard , almost down to the ground  --  red head , turned up at the sides , with a ruby nose  --  six feet high . " What odd people , to be sure . Their portraits are so very interesting , that I long to be acquainted with the originals . Exit . Jud . Judith If any young fellow should dare to presume to enter this door , I 'd give him a look that should petrify him into a statue of alabaster . Exit . Mak . Makesafe ( Having collected papers from the table . ) Now  --  I will just secure these papers in my room , and then return and make Adelaide acquainted with my intentions . Exit to his room . SCENE 2.  --  A street before Makesafe 's house  --  a window in front of the house . Enter Camelion , ( looking towards the window . ) Cam . Camelion ( Calls gently ) Adelaide ! Adelaide ! What can detain her so long ? Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has locked her in the cellar . Why , Adelaide , I say , only one word more ! She said he would return to the window in a moment ; but it seems to me an hour since she went . Adelaide appears at the window . Duett . Adelaide . Adelaide A captive sighs for liberty , Will no one set her free ? A captive sighs for liberty , And are you come to set her free ? Camelion . Camelion Sweet captive what will you engage To give the man that opes your cage ? Adelaide . Adelaide On him I would my heart bestow , Had I not lost it long ago . My heart I would on you bestow , Had I not lost it long ago . Camelion . Camelion Then farewell captive , I 'll retire , Since you refuse my sole desire ! Adelaide . Adelaide Cruel man ! can I give you twice , What you demand for freedom 's price ? My heart long since to you has flown ; You have stole mine , and kept your own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beating true , For mine long since has been with you . Both . Camelion , Malachi A captive sighs for liberty ! And here I vow to set you free ! Cam . Camelion Yes  --  but how , my dearest Adelaide , am I to get you out of this infernal old fellow 's clutches ? Ade . Adelaide I am so closely watched that it will be quite impossible for me to get out , I fear ; but perhaps you may find a way of getting in . Cam . Camelion Will the old fellow go out ? Ade . Adelaide Yes , he is going directly . Cam . Camelion Then my scheme will answer ! Ade . Adelaide But he has given particular orders that nobody is to be admitted , but the persons you will find described in this paper  --  ( drops a paper )  --  Now if you could but contrive to be disguised like the old lady  --  Cam . Camelion Me , in petticoats ! Impossible . Ade . Adelaide I know your imitative powers , and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will but try . Cam . Camelion There is a natural softness in your sex , which it has never been my ambition to imitate , nor my desire to ridicule . Ade . Adelaide Very fine indeed , sir ! then here I must stay . If it depended on my wearing the breeches , I am sure I should not remain here long .  --  ( Makesafe calls within , Adelaide ! Adelaide ! ) There , I am called ; I must go ; I shall soon know whether you have any regard for me or not . ( Goes from the windows . ) Cam . Camelion One word more ! She 's gone ! and has left me stuck up to the chin in flannel , flounces and furbelows ! What a heat I am in ! What must be done ? ( looks over the paper )  --  Lady Pepperpod , by all that 's whimsical ! I know her ; and she is not one of the softest of her sex , that is certain . Egad , I 'll try it  --  though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his will ; in which case , my old manager Strutt said , he was always sure to fail ; and yet diffidence was not his leading trait . Ah ! I shall never forget the many days I have passed strolling about with the Strutt family . Song . 1 Manager Strutt was four feet high , And look 'd mighty droll when he cocked his eye , For he squinted just  --  so , And he waddled and he snuffled with one arm  --  so , And t' other ' kimbo , He look 'd like a tea-kettle , But could not sing half so well ; And yet in Macheath he was thought to excell . " Roses and lilies her cheeks disclose , But her ripe lips are more sweet than those . " O rare manager Strutt ! What a fine actor was manager Strutt ! 2 Now Mrs. Strutt was very nigh , Compar 'd with Mister , twice as high , When on her long leg  --  so ; But in walking she hobbled a little , First on one foot  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace advancing , Was she not the thing for dancing ? And in lively Columbine She was most prodigious fine ! And she was no more than sixty-four ; Whene'er she sung The houses rung With  --  encore ! encore ! encore ! O rare Mrs. Strutt ! What a sweet mate had manager Strutt ! 3 Two charming babes had crown 'd the loves Of these two tender turtle doves ; The boy had just his daddy 's fault  --  He squinted a little ; The girl had learned her mother 's halt  --  She hobbled a little ; And whether they spoke , or whether they sung , They did it all in the Yorkshire tongue ; Yet oft the play-bill did let fly , That they were two young Roscii . ( Imitates two children . ) O rare family Strutt , Happy , thrice happy , is manager Strutt ; O rare manager Strutt , Happy , thrice happy , is manager Strutt . Exit . SCENE 3.  --  Makesafe 's hall . Enter Makesafe from his room . Make . Makesafe Adelaide ! Adelaide ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter Adelaide . Ade . Adelaide Did you call me , sir ? Make . Makesafe I am very glad to see you , Adelaide . I have a pleasant piece of news for you . My nephew will arrive here to-day , and you shall marry him to-morrow . Ade . Adelaide I thank you for your intelligence ; and give you this in return  --  Let your nephew come when he will , he shall never be my husband . Make . Makesafe Reflect a little , my good girl , how happy it will make you to become my niece . We shall then never part . You and your husband will reside here together under my roof , and I shall continue to take a most paternal care of your fortune  --  What happiness ! You laugh ! What am I to understand ? Ade . Adelaide I will be frank with you . Did I not love another , I should refuse your nephew , from the great desire I have to leave a house so dull and disagreeable as yours is to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truly , my lady you are very difficult to please ! Have I not an excellent library ? Ade . Adelaide Law books  --  charming amusement truly for a girl of my age , to read acts of parliament and musty records : Know all men by these presents , that I never will look at any thing like law again , except a marriage contract  --  Make . Makesafe With my nephew . Ade . Adelaide With no such person . Enter Caution . Caut . Caution Old Mr. Codicil desires to see you immediately . Make . Makesafe Say I 'll be with him in the evening . Caut . Caution That wo n't do ; he 's very ill , and wants to make some alteration in his will . ( Sits down at the table and examines papers . ) Make . Makesafe And if I do n't go , the whimsical old fool will leave me out perhaps . Adelaide , my dear , you see an affair of great importance calls me away ; when I return , I hope to find you ready and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your good . Ade . Adelaide You will hope in vain . ( Goes into her room . ) Make . Makesafe Very well , madam , very well ; since I find entreaties wo n't avail , I must try other methods to bring you to obedience ! Judith ! Judith ! Enter Judith . Now , Mrs. Judith , be careful ; remember my instructions . I shall very soon return . Exit . Jud . Judith Do n't fear me ; I know my duty ; depend upon it , nobody comes in here but those you have mentioned . Stay away as long as you will , I shall not stir from my post . Exit . Caut . Caution ( rising ) What is that old woman talking about ? Jud . Judith ( without ) I should like to see any jackanapes of a fellow try to make entrance here ; I would soon let him know  --  Caut . Caution How her tongue does run ! I never hear her talk , but it reminds me of the Constantinople trunk maker . Song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noisy ' , a turbulent Turk , With his hammer : Of him oft ' t was said , That to get his daily bread , He made a vast deal more noise than work With his hammer ; Thumping , rapping , knocking , The din he made was shocking ! Oh ! what a row with Ali and his hammer ! 2 The neighbours at length with Ali went to law , For thumping ' em out of their lives , With his hammer : Ali then his trade declin 'd , And sought to divert his mind By marrying two couple of wives ; With his hammer , Left off rapping , knocking , Yet a noise was heard more shocking , What a row with his wives , without his hammer . 3 Four wives requiring that Ali should bestir , Why he soon fell to work as before , With his hammer , Making as much noise as ever ; Yet the neighbours heard it never , The ladies contrived to make a little more Than the hammer : All the thumping , all the knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four spouses were too loud for his hammer . Exit . END OF THE FIRST ACT . ACT II . SCENE 1 .  --  A hall in Makesafe 's house . Enter Adelaide from her room . Ade . Adelaide Heigho ! Surely Camelion will not disappoint me ? I think I know his spirit too well ; yet I am anxious for his arrival . How tedious appears the hour of expectation . Song . 1 Why reigns a gloom around my heart , Whenever from the youth I part ; Why does that heart all wildly beat , Whene'er I chance his form to meet ? Why are my wishes to retire ,  --  And lonely nurse a secret fire , Or heave the sigh amid the grove ? Alas ! it is the sigh of love ! 2 Why seems the sun no longer bright ? Or yields the valley no delight ? Why envy I each nymph and swain , Who with their carols charm the plain ? Why , to my cot , when I return , Is every minute doom 'd to mourn , Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the tear of love . ( Retires up the stage . ) Enter Judith , followed by Camelion , dressed as Lady Pepperpod . Jud . Judith Mr. Makesafe has just stept out , my lady , but will return immediately . Cam . Camelion How ! not at home ! is it possible ! am I to be kept waiting ? I would have Mr. Makesafe to know that I am not one of his every day clients . Jud . Judith He is aware of your intention of calling , but  --  Cam . Camelion Do n't tell me ! an attorney not keep his word with me  --  a woman of my quality ! ( Seeing Adelaide , who advances , ) Ah ! what charming young lady is that ? Mr. Makesafe 's daughter , no doubt . Jud . Judith No , his ward , my lady . Cam . Camelion What ! the ward of my friend ! ( to Ade . ) Welcome to my heart  --  ( embraces Adelaide , who recognises him )  --  ( In his own voice , forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a  --  ( recollecting and changing his voice )  --  respectable , decent person as you , madam , to guard such a treasure while he is absent ; for I dare say she has already plenty of lovers . Jud . Judith Lovers , truly ! they had best keep from here , I can tell ' em  --  I know all their tricks  --  I should like to see a lover try to circumvent me  --  I warrant I would make pretty sport with him . Ade . Adelaide If you knew my choice  --  Cam . Camelion ( passionately ) And may I hope  --  ( changes voice )  --  that it is approved by this good lady . Follow her advice , my child , and you will escape the snare of the wicked . Jud . Judith Indeed , my lady , you are so very agreeable , that I forget I am not at my post , and if any one should come  --  Cam . Camelion Oh ! pray do n't let me detain you a single moment  --  No apology , I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelaid , I hope you will profit by the conversation of this good lady  --  Attend to what she says to you , and you will find your account in it . Exit . Ade . Adelaide I shall not fail ! Cam . Camelion Now , my dearest Adelaide , let us lose no time , but  --  Ade . Adelaide Indeed we have none to lose , for my guardian will return immediately . Cam . Camelion Not so soon  --  It was I who contrived the message for him . Ade . Adelaide You ! Cam . Camelion Yes , I ; and I have sent him on , fool 's errand to the other end of the town . Ade . Adelaide But this disguise  --  Suppose Lady Pepperpod should come herself ? Cam . Camelion Do n't make yourself uneasy about that  --  you will find me provided for any thing that may happen . Ade . Adelaide Heavens ! here 's somebody coming ! Cam . Camelion Leave every thing to me  --  ( Sits in the centre . ) Enter Caution and Lady Pepperpod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is odd enough ! Miss Adelaide , here is Lady Pepperpod  --  Ade . Adelaide Lady who ? Caut . Caution ( louder ) Why , Lady Pepperpod . ( Cam . comes forward  --  Lady P. seeing him , screams and holds up her hands  --  Cam . mimics her . ) Cam . Camelion What would you with Lady Pepperpod ? Caut . Caution Madam , it is Lady Pepperpod who comes to consult Mr. Makesafe . Cam . Camelion Most assuredly I come to consult Mr. Makesafe . Caut . Caution You come to consult ! Why  --  Ade . Adelaide Consult  --  yes  --  do n't you see ? Caut . Caution Yes  --  I seem to see double ! Ade . Adelaide This is Lady Pepperpod  --  ( Points to Camelion . ) Caut . Caution ( to Lady P. ) You must be a very pretty sort of person , truly , to come here and think to impose upon me  --  I thought there was something about you the moment I saw you . Lady P. Lady Pepperpod What astonishing behaviour ! I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and if any one of you dare call me by any other name , I 'll bring my action against you for defamation . Cam . Camelion My action is already brought  --  and what is more , I have brought two hundred guineas with me to pay the lawyer . Caut . Caution Oh ! then the case is clear enough ! Cam . Camelion If you doubt it , here is one of the guineas , which I believe is as good a proof as I can give  --  ( Gives it to Caution . ) Caut . Caution A very worthy lady , faith , and just like what my master described . You shocking old woman ! Do n't give us any further trouble , but go about your business  --  Oh ! fye for shame ! ( To Lady P. ) Lady P. Lady Pepperpod I shall not stay here to be insulted any longer ! But when I return , you shall all know who I am , with a vengeance ! Exit . Caut . Caution If one had not one 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wicked world . Your real people of consequence have a certain way with them , that it is quite impossible to mistake .  --  ( Pocketing the money and exit . ) Ade . Adelaide What a rage you have put the old lady in ! Poor woman ! she was almost choaking with passion ! Cam . Camelion Do n't I hear somebody talking on this side ? Ade . Adelaide ( listening ) We are lost ! Her ladyship 's servant is enquiring for her  --  He is talking to Judith  --  What 's to be done ? Cam . Camelion ( Having changed his dress , and thrown Lady Pepperpod 's under the table , appears as Malachi )  --  Lady Pepperpod is just gone , and Malachi the Jew is just come . Ade . Adelaide Heavens ! what an astonishing change ! Cam . Camelion Quick ! quick ! take a book , and sit down here , this is my part  --  ( Sits in the centre at one of the tables and writes  --  Adelaide reading . ) Enter Judith . Jud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But  --  what do I see ? Is her ladyship gone ? Ade . Adelaide She was tired of waiting , and is just gone out at the other door , by which this gentlemen entered . Jud . Judith Ah ! ' t is Mr. Malachi , of whom my master spoke to us  --  he seems very busy . Ade . Adelaide He has been very much disposed to enter into conversation with me ; but he has such a dialect I can not understand him  --  So I began to read , and he to write , as you see . Jud . Judith I must speak to him  --  Good morning , Mr. Malachi ! I beg pardon for disturbing you , but  --  Cam . Camelion ( rising ) Your mosht obedient  --  Anoder younk womansh ! My friend is indeed a very happy man  --  ( Makes a low bow . ) Jud .

Exit . Cam . Camelion Once more , my charming Adelaide , we are alone ! Ade . Adelaide Yes , thanks to your address .

Camelion I study Ovid  --  his Art of Love is constantly getting me into scrapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets me out of them . But this is the moment to make our escape ; if we hesitate we are lost . Your guardian expects his nephew every minute . Come , dearest Adelaide , let us fly . Ade . Adelaide Hold ! hold ! you forget we are under military government . Each door is guarded by a centinel , watchful as Cerberus ! ' t is impossible to elude their vigilance . ( Listens ) O Jerusalem ! here is the real Malachi . Cam . Camelion What ! the genuine Jew ?
