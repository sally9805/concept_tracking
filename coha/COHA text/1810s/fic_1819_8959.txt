Citizens , waiters , &c.; Main text ACT I. Scene I.  --  A banking-house  --  Habakkuk discovered examining his books  --  he shuts them hastily , and walks rapidly across the room . Hab . Habakkuk Well  --  after all my boasting about raising " six millions by financial means , " I must e'en close my bank !  --  After speculating for years upon the industrious and laborious class of the people , I must give the finishing stroke , by plunging those very men , who have trusted to my honour and promises , into misery and want  --  or what is as bad , into the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brokers ! Verily ! methinks this is very hard  --  but , as I did not compel them to receive my bills , they shall not compel me to redeem them  --  unless in promises ! Halloa , clerk ! Enter Gatherwell . Gatherwell Close the doors of the bank  --  and should any person present bills for specie , or for exchange , or for debts due unto me , unless in the notes of other banks , take heed that thou dost not exchange them , nor receive them , until I shall instruct thee further . Gath . Gatherwell ( In amazement )  --  What ! Not pay specie to the holders of your bills who may be in extreme want ? Hab . Habakkuk Nay . Gath . Gatherwell Nor exchange bills for those persons who have been induced by your promises to receive them at par , and who may be ruined by your refusing to exchange them ? Hab . Habakkuk Nay . Gath . Gatherwell Nor receive your bills from your creditors  --  from those who , trusting to your vaunted wealth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been induced to receive them , when they might have taken the bills of other banks ? Hab . Habakkuk Verily , I tell thee it must be so !  --  Let them go unto those faithful servants , the brokers  --  it is mete that they should be cherished , if the poor are starved by it  --  therefore should Friend Shaveall send a check , see that thou honourest it with specie . Exit . Gath . Gatherwell And I am to be the miserable agent of thy villainy , or prudence , as you might term it !  --  I am to turn the honest tradesman , who has parted with his substance for the bills which he presents for payment , from the door  --  I must tell him that the " little all , " which he has been toiling for years to accumulate , and which he fondly hoped would place him beyond the reach of poverty , or the frowns of the rich , must , by " one fell swoop , " be thrown into the clutches of hard-hearted , needy speculators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , for years , have been battening upon the wants of their fellow creatures  --  or rioting in pleasures on the miseries of others . O ! this is rank  --  rank swindling . But who comes here ? Enter a Citizen . Cit . Citizen Here are some bills which I wish exchanged . Gath . Gatherwell Indeed , sir , I can not do it  --  I have been directed to close the bank , and neither to exchange or receive any bills . Cit . Citizen ( Angrily . ) Then , may the lot which your employer thus casts to others , speedily be his own ! Exit . Gath . Gatherwell So be it ! Truly , this may be a " thing that will be ! " Exit . Scene II .  --  A TAVERN . Enter Friendly , in a travelling dress , followed by a waiter . Friend . Friendly You say Habakkuk the banker , has shut up  --  Do you know what is said to be the reason ? Wait . Waiter Some say it is because he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of his speculating plans . Friend . Friendly Very like . Should Mr. Heartwell inquire for me , show him in . Exit waiter . What can Heartwell mean by writing to me to hasten to the city  --  let me read his letter again  --  ( takes out a letter and read )  --  " Dear Sir  --  Should it be in your power to leave home for a short time , I would be happy to see you in this city  --  I am engaged in an affair which very much requires your assistance and advice .  --  I shall expect you to-morrow .  --  Heartwell . " Some love affair , I suppose  --  or perhaps in the bank  --  but , here he comes . Enter Heartwell . Heartwell How d'ye do ? Friend Heartwell ! Heart . Heartwell Very well ! But I am sorry I have put you to so much trouble . Friend . Friendly You have put me to no trouble  --  I had business with Habakkuk . Heart . Heartwell What ! Have you any of his bills ? Friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay him some money . Have you any concern with him ? Heart . Heartwell Yes , but that is not the only subject I wish to consult you about  --  You know Shaveall the broker ? Friend . Friendly Yes . Heart . Heartwell He has a lovely daughter  --  Friend . Friendly Whom you wish to marry , but can not gain her father 's consent . Eh ! what say you ? Heart . Heartwell You are right . I hold $5,000 in Habakkuk 's bills , which he refuses to exchange  --  having taken them at par , should I not be able to get them off at a small discount , I shall be ruined  --  Of this Shaveall is aware , and has determined to marry her to one Shallow , a fellow who has nothing but his purse to recommend him  --  but which , although an unusual thing for a dandy , possesses every charm in Shaveall 's eye . Friend . Friendly Do not despair  --  I can assist you very easily . The money which I have to pay Habakkuk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he can not in justice refuse them . Heart . Heartwell Aye ! that he will  --  He has given strict orders not to receive any ; and has actually turned away several honest mechanics and labourers , who were in extreme want . Friend . Friendly Then I see he does not wear a straight- breasted coat for nothing ! however , we must devise some means for your relief  --  in the meantime let us take some refreshment . Exeunt . Scene III .  --  A room in Shaveall 's house . Shaveall reading a letter  --  enter Peter behind , unperceived . Shave . Shaveall Well , Mr. Shallow has arrived at last  --  I must inform my daughter of it , and have her married before that fellow Heartwell makes his appearance ; for if she but once sees him , pop ! she is off with him like a skyrocket ! even if it were before the altar  --  though to speak the truth , I believe he has more the appearance of a man , than that fellow Shallow , with his corsetts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appendage , which Heartwell , since old Hab. has shut up , is in danger of losing  --  that is , a full purse . Moreover , the legacy left my daughter by her uncle , I can pay over in Habakkuk 's bills , and keep the check which I have on him for my own use  --  Shallow is simple , and will not be aware of it : therefore , I shall turn my money to a double account . Oh ! Shaveall  --  well wert thou called " cule Shaveall ! " But let me see  --  ( reads the letter again )  --  " Sir  --  Permit me to have the supreme pleasure of informing you , that I shall do myself the exquisite honour of waiting upon you at 5 o'clock , this evening .  --  Timothy Shallow . " Hem  --  well named ! I must prepare my daughter to meet him . exit . Pet . Peter Zounds ! I believe that master of mine is as sheer a rogue as is unhung ! he shaves notes at 50 per cent . for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants  --  devises marriage plots to swindle a noble youth out of a girl that loves him ; and to defraud a shallow-pated , intended son-in-law out of his wife 's legacy , with as much case as I could eat a beef-steak , or toss off a glass of cognac  --  " but this is no business of mine "  --  stop , let me see , I think it is " business of mine " to prevent this puppy Shallow from marrying Miss Emily , and at the same time to secure her legacy . Had I but a woman to plot with me , we might be too many for " cute Shaveall "  --  if " two women can puzzle old Belzebub , " it 's a hard matter if a man and a woman could not match a broker ! But here comes one . Enter Jenny . Jenny Well , deary ! what news ? Jen . Jenny " Deary ! "  --  pray be a little more mannerly , Mr. Peter . Pet . Peter De'il take me , girl ! you did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the waiter at  --  Jen . Jenny Hush ! Peter  --  I was only in fun . Here is a letter which my mistress wishes you to carry to Mr. Heartwell  --  it seems that her father has detarmined to marry her to Tim Shallow , the dandy , against her will , which I think is rather hard , Mr. Peter . Pet . Peter Yes , but you and I must try to prevent it  --  This master of mine , between you and me , Jenny , I do not believe is over honest  --  he has a check upon old Habakkuk. which he has directed his clerk to pay in specie  --  indeed , I am of the opinion that him and my master are rather thick  --  but " this is none of our business "  --  now , this check is the amount of the legacy left by Emily 's uncle ; if we could secure that for her  --  Jen . Jenny ( Interrupting him )  --  And so we can  --  as I was coming through the hall , I heard master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank for specic  --  now , I 'll hide myself behind the desk , and when he comes to get the check , you must follow him , and as soon as he unlocks the desk , break the china vase in the next room  --  when he runs out to see what 's the matter , I 'll get the check . Pet . Peter Very good . If there is any mischief to be done , give me a woman for it . Now I 'll go to Mr. Heartwell . Exeunt . END OF THE FIRST ACT . ACT II . Scene I.  --  A room in Shaveall 's house . Shallow viewing himself in a glass  --  Enter Peter by a door in the back of the room . Pet . Peter So we go ! By this time Emily and Heart well have fixed matters in a good train for execution  --  and now to deliver Friendly the check . Hah ! who have we here  --  ( looking at Shallow )  --  Shallow 's footman , I reckon  --  laced up in stays too ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the shoulder . ) Good evening , friend wasp ! Shal . Shallow ( Surprized . ) Eh ! Pet . Peter ( Taking hold of his pantaloons . ) Fine mealsacks ! Faith , boy ! you resemble a churn  --  broadest end below . Methinks you 'd make a good lyehopper ! broadest end above . ( Here Peter seizes him , and , notwithstanding his cries and struggling , places him on his head in a corner of the room . ) Fegs , boy ! you resemble a split shilling loaf , stuck upon an hour glass . Shal . Shallow ( In a piteous lone . ) Murder ! murder ! Pet . Peter Halloa ! why the animal squeaks wonderfully  --  ( sets him on his legs again )  --  why , child , you 'd make a good auctioneer , or clam-seller . Shal . Shallow ( Strutling round the room in a great passion . ) Do you know whom you have insulted , fellow ? Pet . Peter ( Ironically . ) " Do I know you ? " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In a loud voice . ) " Mr Shallow 's footman ? " No , you scoundrel ! I am Mr. Shallow himself ! and I 'll have you hang 'd for your insolence . Pet . Peter ( Aside . ) Zounds ! then I 'm blown . However , I must smooth it over , and gain time . ( To Shal . ) Please excuse my taking you for a footman  --  my eye-sight is bad . Shal . Shallow As you seem to be a humourous dog , I shall forgive you . Show me to your master . Pet . Peter ( Aside . ) So far , so good  --  but I must delay him . ( To Shal . ) Please pardon me for calling you a wasp  --  Indeed , sir , your shape will bear examination ; it is in exact proportion . Shal . Shallow ( Viewing himself with rapture . ) You are a shrewd fellow  --  dost love brandy ? Pet . Peter ( Aside . ) The gudgeon bites at flattery , and I may gull him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drink a glass now and then . You will please pardon me also for comparing you to an hour glass and shilling loaf , as your pantaloons are extremely neat , and your coat fits elegantly . Shal . Shallow ( viewing himself again )  --  Here  --  ( hands money ) now lead me to your master . Pet . Peter Yes , sir .  --  ( aside )  --  now to get some brandy . But , hold , had I not better tell Shallow about the legacy , it will keep them in play . ( As they are approaching the door , Peter stops. )  --  Are you not going to marry Miss Emily ? Shal . Shallow Yes . Pet . Peter Well then , you had best see after her legacy first , as her father intends paying it in Habakkuk 's bills . Shal . Shallow Say you so , my good fellow ? then I 'll take care of him . Exeunt . SCENE II .  --  A room in Shaveall 's house , as before . Enter Emily and Heartwell  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt me  --  I shall not fail to meet you at the place appointed . In the mean time , go and get the money exchanged by Habakkuk 's clerk . I must , in order to avoid suspicion , meet Shallow . Heart . Heartwell Why need we delay any longer  --  let me insist on your now accompanying me . Em . Emily No , no  --  My father is in momentary expectation of the arrival of Shallow  --  and see , Jenny warns us of their coming . Be ready at the appointed place . Heart . Heartwell I will .  --  ( embracing her. )  --  Let this be a seal to my promise . Em . Emily I do not doubt your punctuality . Peter has succeeded in procuring the check and delivering it to Friendly  --  so away  --  here comes my dandy ! Exit Heartwell . Enter Shaveall and Shallow . Shave . Shaveall There is my daughter , now try your hand at courtship . ( Retires . ) Shal . Shallow Most divine  --  most angelic  --  Em . Emily Blockhead ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to bow at your feet  --  Em . Emily Aye , do ! and break that hideous carcass of thine . Shal . Shallow ( Gathering courage )  --  and thus seal my happiness  --  ( Advancing to embrace her . ) Em . Emily Avaunt , thou wasp ! I desire none of thy stings . Exit with Jenny . Shave . Shaveall ( Advancing . ) What ! gone  --  never mind  --  she shall marry you to-morrow . Shal . Shallow Compel her to marry me  --  that is the best way . ( Aside . ) But , egad , if she is as fond of Heartwell as report says she is , who knows that she will not compel me to wear horns ! The legacy too ; I had almost forgotten it . ( To Shave . ) What is her legacy to be paid in ? Shave . Shaveall ( Aside . ) The deuce  --  who 'd have thought that ?  --  ' t is lucky I did not give Peter the check . ( To Shal . ) Oh ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come this way , and I 'll show it to you . Exit , followed by Shallow . END OF THE SECOND ACT . ACT III . Scene I  --  A banking house  --  Gatherwell employed at a desk . Gath . Gatherwell So far I have done pretty well !  --  paid Friendly the legacy check  --  received the amount of Do-well 's note  --  and exchanged bills for indigent citizens , as far as I had means . Here comes Habakkuk , and I shall leave him . Enter Habakkuk . Habakkuk Sir , instead of turning every person away empty , I have redeemed bills as far as I had power , and received debts due you in your own bills . I now intend leaving you  --  Should you wish any thing further , you know my lodgings . Exit . Hab . Habakkuk Verily , this is tough work ! I have been caught in my own net  --  and here comes a host of bill-holders . I begin to think it would be more to my advantage to act honestly  --  however , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Truly these fellows seem determined to proceed to extremes . Scene II  --  A street . A crowd of Citizens assembled before a banking house , stamping and showing other signs of anger . 1st Cit. 1st Citizen Let us break open his bank , and do ourselves justice . 2d Cit. 2d Citizen Nay , let us tar and feather the speculator. 3d Cit. 3d Citizen No , no ! ride him on a pole . Enter Friendly . Friend . Friendly Friends ! Friends ! This is making matters worse ! retire to your houses  --  in a few weeks , perhaps , he may perform his promises  --  ( aside )  --  though to speak truly , this is rather doubtful . Exeunt . Scene III  --  Shaveall 's house . Enter Peter  --  rather top-heavy . Pet . Peter Well , by this time Miss Emily is married  --  Friendly has the specie  --  Shallow misses his bride  --  master his check  --  and I 'm  --  why I 'm merry on the dandy 's money .

Sometimes these machines of stout white-oak are made , And sometimes of whale-bone , as best suits the trade  --  Our dandies all wear them , be made as they will , In order their coats more snugly to fill . And they 're all for corsetts  --  they 're all , &c.; Lo , there is a maiden , by nature to please , How graceful her form  --  " The devil ! here comes master in no graceful humour , followed by that ninny-hammer Shallow  --  now for a glorious " blow up .

Shaveall Then here are your wages  --  leave my service immediately . Pet .
