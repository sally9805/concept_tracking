PREFACE . A very ingenious French melo-drame entitled " Le Vol , ou La Famille D'Anglade , " suggested the idea , and furnished the leading incidents of the following play . Great changes have been made in the sentiments and dialogue . The persons who frequent the Theatres of Paris in which melo-drames are acted , seldom scrutinize the literary or moral merits of the productions which they applaud . Audiences are classed in different Theatres in Paris , as they are in different parts of the same Theatre in London . Instead of a vast building in which the lovers of shew and pantomime are jumbled with the lovers of Shakspeare and sense , every quality of auditor has there a distinct Theatre appropriate to its quality of taste . Should the national Theatre in the Rue de Richelieu dare to represent a melo-drame , even the powers of Talma could not protect it from public indignation . But as the taste on this side of the channel is too modern for the polish of the loftier French Drama , and too polished to admit any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources in Paris whence Covent Garden and Drury Lane borrow ) ,  --  without great and studied alteration ,  --  the adaptor of a French production becomes liable to all the labour of an original writer without entitling himself to equal fame . To this labour the adaptor of the present play has been condemned . Whatever may be thought of its literary pretensions , he will be satisfied if he has succeeded in the leading object of his alterations ;  --  in displaying the graces and the dignity of conjugal love ,  --  and in holding up to the admiration which it deserves , that sublime and disinterested constancy towards the unfortunate and suffering , which endears and ennobles the female character . The original story of " Accusation " has long been naturalised in English literature . The trial of D'Anglade is detailed at length in a volume of legal translations entitled " Gallic Reports . " To those who desire only the prominent particulars , an abridged account in volume the second of Charlotte Smith 's " Romance of Real Life , " headed " Anglade " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entitled " Love and Duty , " which relates every circumstance , can not be read without tears and rapture . The refined and powerful imagination of this fascinating authoress , has followed up the story of D'Anglade by a touching narrative of the effect of his persecutions upon the destinies of his daughter . Out of her heart-breaking sacrifices to duty ,  --  her devotedness to the memory of her martyred parents ,  --  the exquisite delicacy of her lofty feelings ,  --  and the unwavering constancy of her hopeless love ,  --  Mrs. Opie has created an almost matchless picture of moral purity and intellectual loveliness . It is to be regretted that this fiction of Mrs. Opie could not have been brought upon the stage , but the laws of dramatic unity deny the public that benefit and pleasure . Were the stage consecrated to conceptions like this , it would speedily reform both itself and its supporters . The Parisian wits , who must have their epigram upon every thing which engages public attention , made themselves merry with the selection of the present subject for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled " Flore et Zephyre , " the Grand Opera , ( which is represented under the name of Somno , for its dulness , ) offers his daughter Flore to any one , who , by no-matter-what novelty , might succeed in restoring the fallen glories of his deserted house . The various amusements then fashionable in Paris , grotesquely personified , present themselves in rotation ; and old Somno examines their various pretensions and obtains an opinion from each as to the best mode of reviving his attraction . The far-famed Gulliver , who had recently figured at the " Thetre des Varits , " appears among the rest , and holds the following dialogue with the distressed manager : Somno . Monsieur , qui ai-je I'honneur de parler ? Gulliver . Vous voyez un tranger qui , instruit de votre dtresse , a fait force de voiles pour venir votre secours . Somno . Comment , monsieur , vous esprez me rendre cet clat do nt je brillais autrefois ? Gulliver . Moi , monsieur , je russis toujours . Somno .

This play was sent from Paris , before its appearance upon the French boards . It was received by the then principal member of the Drury-lane Subcommittee on the 23d of January , 1816  --  instantly accepted , and performed on the first of February ,  --  a celerity perhaps unprecedented in the history of the stage . The adaptor regrets that his residence in Paris during its run , prevented him from witnessing the exertions of the performers whose talent obtained for it so much applause . To that estimable lady and accomplished actress , Mrs. Glover , he understands he is greatly indebted for her excellence in Madam de Cerval ;  --  and to Mr. Wallack , an actor more liked by the public than many who are more flattered by the press , he has been taught to ascribe the highest praise in Valmore ,  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute to unpretending talent , which is moving silently , but with firm and steady step , towards the highest honours of its profession . Mr. Knight as Marcel , and Mr. Rae as D'Anglade , must have powerfully enhanced the interest of the scene ;  --  and if Miss Kelly 's Madam D'Anglade awakened less enthusiasm than she usually commands , it was only because the part was not of a cast to call forth the characteristic peculiarities of a genius , certainly not surpassed by any upon the stage .  --  If Mr. Bartley 's good humour and kind-heartedness did not prevent him from looking like a misanthrope , a better representative could not have been desired for Leon . The scenery was beautiful , and it would be ungrateful to omit any opportunity of acknowledging how many compliments are due to the pencil of Mr. Greenwood . London , Sept. 20 , 1817 .

Compared with the pleasure of shewing gratitude , money 's nothing in my eyes ; it melts away like snow in the sun ! Hub . Hubert Persevere in these noble sentiments ; there 's nothing like a little liberality :  --  and so thought my master Valmore , when he sent us these ten louis by way of encouragement . Now then to divide them fairly . Mar . Marcel That 's the fair way to prevent a division . Hub .

Hubert Away , my lads ,  --  zeal , you see , never fails of recompense . Mar . Marcel Mr. Hubert ,  --  the louis  --  I say  --  Hub . Hubert And let every thing be in readiness to make the fete worthy of the best of mistresses  --  Mar . Marcel ( mimicking him . ) That 's right ! You do the drudgery ! I 'll keep the wages ! A common trick where great men work by deputy ! Hub . Hubert Despatch , boys , despatch ! Hubert hurries the Servants and Gardeners away .

Hubert In that case you may remain here . Four . Fourbin ( aside . ) I am not mistaken  --  it is he !  --  ( in a low voice to Hubert . ) Hubert !  --  Hub . Hubert ( startled . ) Hey ? Four . Fourbin ( perceiving that Marcel gazes earnestly at them . ) Si , Signori , si signori  --  Hub . Hubert He pronounced my name ! Four . Fourbin ( low to Hubert . ) Do n't you know me ? Hub . Hubert Very extraordinary ! Four . Fourbin Siete il maestro della casa ? Are you de maestro of de house ? Hub . Hubert ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features . ) No  --  I am  --  I am  --  the master 's valet  --  and I  --  ( in a lower voice , and taking Fourbin by the arm. )  --  But who the devil are you ? Four . Fourbin Fourbin . Hub . Hubert ( astonished . ) Fourbin ! Mar . Marcel What ails you , Mr. Hubert ? How came you to know those  --  Hub . Hubert Pray let me alone . You have plenty to do . ( low to Fourbin . ) Send away your companions . Mar . Marcel One must come cap in hand to speak with you , it seems , Mr. Hubert ;  --  but if you wo n't give up my money , keep back your own impertinence . Hub . Hubert Get along , get along . Mar . Marcel Very well , very well , Sir . You 've taken the sure way to keep yourself from being forgotten . Cheat a man and he 'll remember you . Exit Marcel greatly incensed . During the latter speeches Fourbin whispers to his companions . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fourbin remains alone with Hubert . Hub . Hubert And so , my poor Fourbin , it is really you ! Who would ever have thought of seeing you again ? And above all , so strangely shatter 'd , tatter 'd , and batter 'd ! Four . Fourbin Ah ! Every thing has fail 'd with me of late . You must recollect our being together at Naples in the service of that old lord  --  Hub . Hubert Who gave us so much of his cane and so little of his cash ? Four . Fourbin You ca n't have forgotten , that , in order to revenge ourselves for his ill treatment of us , we one day left him at leisure to repent of it  --  Hub . Hubert Yes  --  carrying off with us four thousand ducats which we found , by chance , in an old strong box  --  Four . Fourbin Of which we broke open the lock and divided the money  --  Hub . Hubert Like brothers ! Four . Fourbin Not altogether , for you took two thirds of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T was I who conducted the whole affair . Four . Fourbin Yes  --  and ' t was you , also , who disappear 'd one night , taking away with you the other half , which happened to be mine . Hub . Hubert Poh ! Oh ! That is not possible ! Four . Fourbin Possible or not , it 's true however . Hub . Hubert Why , what could I have been thinking of at the time ? But , to say the truth , my dear friend , I certainly have , now and then , stumbled upon such blunders . Four . Fourbin And you never blunder to your own disadvantage . Hub . Hubert Hold , hold , Fourbin . Do n't renew old grievances . Let us speak no more of it . Four . Fourbin But we must speak of it . You are now in a good place . You appear to be well off . You see my miserable plight , and you will surely render me  --  Hub . Hubert Any service in my power . ( aside ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) To the devil !  --  ( aloud ) The best proof of my friendship !  --  ' T was your lucky star led you hither . You can be useful , and pocket a good round sum . Four . Fourbin How ? Hub . Hubert Harkye . This house belongs to Madam de Cerval , a widow , whose husband was a rich merchant , and has left no children . Valmore , my master , is her nephew and sole heir . He was an orphan , without fortune , and is indebted to this good lady for his education and all he possesses . He has ever deceived her as to his real character , and she , poor dupe ! fancies him a saint , whilst , in fact , he is but a  --  a  --  Four . Fourbin I can believe he is bad enough , since I find you in his service . Hub . Hubert That pavilion which you see on the right hand , at the end of the orange tree walk , is inhabited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young couple of high family , very rich , married about six years , with but one child  --  Four . Fourbin I begin to understand . Madam D'Anglade is beautiful  --  Hub . Hubert Divinely ! Four . Fourbin Valmore is in love with her  --  Hub . Hubert To distraction . Four . Fourbin And a libertine ? Willing to risk every thing to gratify his passion ? Hub . Hubert Tolerably well guessed . My master , eight years , ago , wearied with Paris , where he had squander 'd in a month his aunt 's allowance for a year , came to replenish on her credulity . Lena de Senesse , now Madam D'Anglade , was at that time on a visit to his aunt ; he there first beheld her ; and captivated by her charms , requested permission from her parents to offer her his hand . Four . Fourbin What ! Would he have married her ? Hub . Hubert Aye , that he would ;  --  for love had almost made him what he professed to be ,  --  a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four . Fourbin Oh , that 's another thing . If a man does volunteer to be a prisoner , his chains ought to be made of gold . Hub . Hubert But as the said gold was all on one side of the house , her parents gave him liberty to withdraw his petition , and withdrew her to their chateau near Marseilles , that the young lady in person might not be exposed to the allied powers of love and poverty . My master , in despair , went back to Paris ; won great sums at play ; made the tour of Europe , and on his return found his beloved was married , and had passed several months in this retreat , with her husband . The sight added fuel to the old flame ; his rival 's happiness was insupportable ; and , at last , madden 'd by the mingled force of love and jealousy , he has determined to destroy this union , and become , at any price , possessor of the only woman he ever truly adored . Four . Fourbin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Hub . Hubert She knows nothing at all about it . It seems her parents were prudent enough at the time to conceal the advances of Mr. Valmore ; and since his return he has not dared to make an avowal , restrained by her devotion to her husband and her fondess for her child ; for , in short , Madam D'Anglade is a downright she-dragon of virtue ! Four . Fourbin But what are your master 's intentions ? Does he mean to carry her off ? Hub . Hubert No , no . That 's an old trick . The scheme I 've been thinking of is far easier , and I 'll confide it to you . In the meantime , fifty louis might , perhaps , do you a service . Four . Fourbin Fifty louis ! That 's fifty good reasons why I should say nothing about my hundred objections to a rogue 's project .  --  The cash !  --  Hub . Hubert You shall have it the moment my master has gain 'd his wish'd-for mistress . He comes . Retire ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Lurk in the neighbourhood , and walk this evening near yonder gate . Away ! Four . Fourbin I 'd sworn never to risk my neck again , but go where I will , the devil 's at my elbow ! Hub . Hubert You wo n't take the money then ? Four . Fourbin ( taking it . ) Oh , lackaday ! How difficult it is to be an honest man !  --  Exit Fourbin through the garden gate . Enter Valmore with a sullen , thoughtful air . Val . Valmore Hubert , have you seen Madam D'Anglade ? Hub . Hubert She is now with Madam de Cerval . Val . Valmore And her husband ? Hub . Hubert Is gone out . Val . Valmore The die is cast ! Hubert , I will follow your advice . In a few days she is to quit this place . ' T is done  --  the conflict is at an end  --  I will instantly declare my passion ! Hub . Hubert How , Sir ? Madam D'Anglade to quit Marseilles ? Val . Valmore Important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubert That 's very unaccommodating of him . He 's welcome to go though , provided he leaves his wife behind . Val . Valmore Nothing can be wider from his views . Nay , his desire to remove her from my society is probably the real cause of his abrupt departure . Hub . Hubert Jealousy ?  --  So much the better , Sir , so much the better . A husband who suspects his wife without cause , is apt to be the cause of what he suspects . Val . Valmore But in the meanwhile he quits Marseilles  --  he bears her from me , and perhaps forever ! Hub . Hubert Well then , Sir , act with decision . Hesitate no longer . You have a skilful servant at command , and your hatred of your happy rival  --  Val . Valmore Exceeds , if possible , my love for her ! He has blasted my happiness forever , and fate seems to have wrought a miracle in his favour , only to deepen the agony of my despair ! Hub . Hubert Fate , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesIlleg. wealth . He never could have aspired to Lens , had he not obtained the immense fortune of his cousin , Leon de Valency , who is thought to have perished abroad by shipwreck . He may thank this event , and my aunt 's avarice for his envied happiness . But let him not yet triumph ! While I am in existence , never shall he remain the undisturb 'd possessor of the woman I adore ! Hub . Hubert That 's worthy of my gallant master !  --  but I will withdraw , for , see ! Madam D'Anglade is approaching ! Courage ! Exit Hubert , making , as he goes out , sign of encouragement to his master . Val . Valmore She comes ! Important moment ! Enter Madam D'Anglade and Charles . The moment Charles see Valmore , he springs from his mother and runs towards Valmore . Char . Charles Oh , Mr. Valmore , I am so glad to see you ! Val . Valmore Lovely child ! ( kissing him . ) He has all your features , Madam . Mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Valmore ? I may be mistaken ; but , to my view , Charles is the living image of his father .

Madam D'Anglade Take them , my dear , since the gentleman is so kind , and thank him prettily . Char . Charles Thank you , Sir . Will you have some , Mamma ? Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade No , Charles . They are all for you . Char . Charles Oh , I do n't want them all . I 'll give some to papa , and some to Bertrand , and some to  --  every body . Oh what a fine box !

I have observed for some time that you are the only inmate of this house who appears unhappy . Val . Valmore Can I have been an object of your condescending notice ? I pray you pardon me . Until this moment I have endeavoured to conceal the struggle with myself from every eye , and above all , from yours ;  --  but you have pierced the veil I would throw around my sufferings , and they will be lessened by your generous compassion .

Madam D'Anglade Indeed , I feel for your affliction . Val . Valmore Do I hear aright ? You who possess every thing to make you happy  --  you to whom no sensation should be known which brings not pleasure ! Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade And is it not a pleasure to sympathize with the afflicted ? Val . Valmore No longer do I accuse my fate ! Life ceases to be a burthen !

He who cherishes a guilty passion for the woman who can not listen to him without crime ,  --  who , instead of avoiding her , seeks , by mean artifice , to corrupt her heart  --  Val . Valmore By mean artifice !  --  Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Degrades his own sex , and deserves the scorn of ours ! Charles returns , gaily running from the house of Madam de Cerval . Char .

Enter Hubert in the back ground , observing Madam D'Anglade , as she withdraws . Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) Master 's looking gloomy . Humph !  --  things have n't turned out as he hoped . Mad de C.

I have long regretted to see you , wandering , without any fixed object or decided station in society , and I assure you that but for the impediment of which I speak , you should have enjoyed the advantages of independence much earlier . This impediment is now removed , and by the decision of justice in my favour , I have realised the sum of twenty thousand louis . Val . Valmore ( surprised . ) Twenty thousand louis ! Hub .

Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Valmore , I know the workings of your heart . You cherish a criminal passion . To harbour unhallowed feelings for the wife of another ,  --  for the object of my hospitality ,  --  for my dearest friend ,  --  and to meditate her ruin !  --  such a crime would drive you from society with scorn , and plunge me and your connections into misery and disgrace .

This man would rob a church , but wants the courage to break the door . ( snapping his fingers . ) That for his canting ! I 'll humour him in his own way . He shall be a villain by proxy , as greater men have been before him . But he must not marry ,  --  for wives , they say , have the marvellous faculty of making a bad bachelor a good husband ,  --  and any thing good in my master would defeat my gains . No , no !

Leon Then he does not reside constantly at Marseilles ? Mar . Marcel I 've told you already that he does not . Hub . Hubert Hold your tongue , Marcel . Leon . Leon Is he married ? Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) This fellow 's manner quite amuses me. ( aloud . ) Why , yes . Leon . Leon Is his wife rich ? Hub . Hubert Why , yes . Mar . Marcel Now only tell me , what 's that to him ? Leon . Leon Has he children ? Hub . Hubert One . Leon . Leon And a large fortune . Hub . Hubert Why , yes . Leon . Leon What use does he make of it ? Hub . Hubert Maintains a becoming establishment , keeps a good table , and is useful to his friends . Leon . Leon ( aside . ) Aha ! a spendthrift ! Mar . Marcel ( low to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , Mr. Hubert , to  --  Leon . Leon That blockhead told me Mr. D'Anglade was gone out . Mar . Marcel Blockhead ! Hub . Hubert He is so . Leon . Leon At what o'clock does he return ? Hub . Hubert When it suits him . Mar . Marcel And when he does return , you ca n't speak to him . Leon . Leon Why not ? Mar . Marcel Because there 's to be a Fte here , and a very fine one  --  ( retires up the stage . ) Leon . Leon What 's that to me ? I came to no Ftes  --  On the contrary  --  Hub . Hubert ( eagerly . ) How " on the contrary ? " Mar . Marcel ( coming down abruptly . ) Do you intend to do or say any thing disagreeable to Mr. D'Anglade ? Leon . Leon What 's that to you ? Perhaps he will be sorry to see me ,  --  perhaps also  --  in that case his conduct shall regulate mine  --  ( going ) I shall return by-and-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil  --  This begins to excite my curiosity . ( aloud ) Permit me , Sir  --  If you will tell me your name  --  Leon . Leon Not to you . To Mr. D'Anglade I may . ' T is fit he should know who I am and my business . Exit Leon without attending to Hubert , who endeavours to stop him . In going out , abruptly , Leon jostles Bertrand , whom he meets coming on the stage . Enter Bertrand . Ber . Bertrand Who is that strange brute looking for ? Mar . Marcel Your master . Ber . Bertrand Has he left his name ? Hub . Hubert He refuses it to any but Mr. D'Anglade . Ber . Bertrand Has he promised to return ? Mar . Marcel Oh , yes , he said he would return , and I 'm glad he took himself off , for his staying here might have delayed the Fte . Ber . Bertrand How delay the Fte ? Have you any fears  --  Mar . Marcel Why , he looks so queer , and has such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be wrong , but I am much mistaken if he brings any good news . Ber . Bertrand What nonsense you are talking ! Mar . Marcel I am talking no nonsense , and I have no mind to joke ; for that cross old fellow has driven away all my gaiety with his manner of saying  --  " I came for no fte  --  on the contrary "  --  Ber . Bertrand Did he say so ? Hub . Hubert ( taking Bertrand aside . ) Bertrand . you are in the confidence of Mr. D'Anglade . Ber . Bertrand I hope I merit it . Hub . Hubert ( with eagerness . ) Your master has perhaps some enemies ? Ber . Bertrand He ought not to have any . He never did any thing but good ;  --  that , however ,  --  ( sighing ) that is no reason ! Hub . Hubert But you hear what Marcel says .  --  Do n't you think your master  --  Ber . Bertrand Mr. Hubert , I love my master with all my heart . I would sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I know my place too well to dive into his secrets , and when he chooses to confide them to me , I never betray his confidence . ( Exit through the garden gate . ) Mar . Marcel Oh , lackaday ! Look ! All the guests are coming and I 'm not ready yet ! There 's a pretty concern now ! Oh , I must be off and make myself beautiful ! Oh dear , Oh dear ! Exit Marcel . Enter Mr. D'Anglade , Madam D'Anglade , Madam de Cerval , in conversation . Charles accompanies them . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Certainly , my dear Lena , Charles is in the right . Your sadness is unusual . Char . Charles Yes , mamma , I 'm sure you wanted to cry without letting me see it ! Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Might not an involuntary dejection overcome me for a moment which your presence has dispelled ? Enter Valmore . Madam D'Anglade shudders when she sees him . Charles runs towards him , and Mr. D'Anglade welcomes him with great cordiality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That good Mr. Valmore is coming ! Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( with trepidation . ) Valmore ! D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade ( not observing his wife 's agitations . ) Ah , Mr. Valmore , this fte has occupied so much of your attention , that we have not had the pleasure of seeing you to-day . Val . Valmore That I regret ;  --  but I am too happy when I can testify to my dearest benefactress , the gratitude  --  Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval ( interrupting him and significantly . ) Of which I hope soon to receive a more conclusive proof . ( Enter Marcel , running , gaily dressed . ) Mar . Marcel Here they are ! Here they all come ! Our mistress , her relations , and every body 's relations , and all the country people besides ! And there , on the other side , the boats glide along , filled with dancers and musicians , and  --  What a charming fte will ours be , to be sure . Come , quick ! Come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thrown open . All the work people and tenantry enter dancing , attired in the costume of natives of the environs of Marseilles . They salute the company present , and range themselves on one side of the garden . Immediately , at the extremity of the stage , elegant boats appear , filled with guests , musicians , and dancers ;  --  the musicians and dancers clad like the ancient Troubadours of Province . They all disembark and spread over the stage . The family and guests place themselves under the bower ;  --  the musicians take seats appropriated on the opposite side , and the Fete commences . After the ballet , Madam de Cerval comes forward . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval My kind friends , permit me to thank you for the compliment of this attention . A repast now awaits you beneath my roof , and I hope you will do me the honour to partake of it . Mar . Marcel ( aside . ) Oh ! a repast ! that 's the best caper of the whole . D'Anglade offers his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam D'Anglade , who shudders , and hesitates ; but , to avoid remark , she is constrained to receive it . Just as the whole party are about to mount the steps of Madam de Cerval 's house , Bertrand appears , followed by Leon de Valency . Ber . Bertrand ( addressing D'Anglade . ) Sir , a stranger wishes to speak with you on business which he says is very important . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade ( to Madam de Cerval . ) Will you permit me , Madam ? Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval By all means , Mr. D'Anglade . No ceremony among friends . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade I will see you to the door , and then return to you in a moment . ( The musicians strike up a march . ) Mar . Marcel ( to the peasantry , &c.); Come with me , my jolly ones ! There 's a repast for us , also , and it is I who do the honours of the table ! March resumed . General departure . The family and visitors enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go off with Marcel on the other side . Leon de Valency , who has stood in the back ground , advances when all have disappeared . Leon , D'Anglade , and Bertrand only , remain upon the stage . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade ( after having seen Madam de Cerval into the house , returns and addresses Leon . ) Is it you , Sir , who desire to speak with me ? Leon . Leon It is . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Be pleased to accompany me to my apartment . Leon . Leon Not I. There 's no need of that . You are waited for , and I sha' n't detain you long . We are very well here ;  --  only send away this man . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Leave us , Bertrand . Ber . Bertrand But  --  dear master  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Withdraw . Ber . Bertrand ( aside . ) I do n't like this stranger . I will caution my lady . ( Exit into Madam de Cerval 's house . ) D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Now , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) It seems you do n't recollect me ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade I have not that pleasure , Sir . Leon . Leon I am not surprised . We never saw much of each other . You were at college when I left Marseilles , and fifteen years of misfortune must have worn my features out of your recollection . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade How ! Leon . Leon I have traversed the farthest seas ;  --  I was shipwreck 'd ;  --  the captain of a privateer saved my life , but had the cruelty to throw me and my fellow passengers upon an island among savages . After enduring fifteen years ' hard labour , at the risk of my life I escaped this miserable bondage , and it has pleased heaven to restore me to my family . Know that I am  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade ( who , during this narrative has shewn increasing emotion , exclaims with astonishment . ) Ha ! now your features rush upon my memory ! Yes , yes ! I know you  --  Leon de Valency !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I return poor and destitute . You , this long time past have enjoyed all my fortune . It must be given up . You well know my rights , and I hope you wo n't scruple to acknowledge ' em ;  --  in short , that you will make no difficulties  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Make difficulties ! ( with dignity . ) I see plainly , Sir , that you know nothing of my character ; but knowing the family to which we both belong , you ought to have deemed me incapable of making difficulties about an act of justice . Tho ' I admit your claim , Sir ,  --  I disdain your suspicion . Leon . Leon You mistake me , Sir . I should be sorry to offend . ( more abruptly . ) But oppressions do not make men courtly . I have been oppressed ,  --  and my present situation  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Gave you no right to doubt my probity . But all is forgotten , since you acknowledge your mistake . You come , then , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bequeath 'd to me ? Leon . Leon I 've a right to it  --  hav' n't I ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Granted . I am ready to give up my papers . Leon . Leon So much the better ; for I am in haste to quit this place :  --  but you will need some time to deposit with the notary the full amount of the sum for which you are accountable . To that end I allow you three days . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Three days ! The time is very short . No matter .  --  But what am I to understand by " all for which I am accountable ? " Leon . Leon You 're to understand by it , Sir , the titles to the property and effects which you inherited in my stead ;  --  the revenues you have received ;  --  and the interest of the ready money . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Of ready money , there was but very little . The titles to the property and effects have remained at the notary 's ; and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have but one observation to make ,  --  which is ,  --  that believing myself the master of a fortune , then undisputed , I exercised the same freedom with regard to it , which every rich man should . Leon . Leon What do you mean ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade When one of those calamities , which too often ravage the earth , destroyed in our fields the produce of a season , I did not then receive any thing from your farmers , who , with their numerous families , would have been reduced to misery and perhaps despair , had I required from them their usual rent . Leon . Leon That 's all very excellent , Sir ,  --  but in this world every one has his own way of thinking and acting ; and yours would not have been mine . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade You are then destitute of humanity Leon . Leon Humanity ? And did not calamities overwhelm me too ? Whose " humanity " came to my succour ? Once more , Sir ,  --  I must have all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir , reflect . Even my paternal inheritance , added to that which fell to me in your stead , will scarcely satisfy your claim . Would you take my own fortune when I have preserved yours ? Leon . Leon Aha ! Disputes , contests ! I expected them !  --  But the Tribunals will decide !  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade The Tribunals !  --  There is no need of tribunals , Sir .  --  It was to your heart that I appealed ; but since that is shut to the voice of humanity , I know what remains for me to do .  --  You shall suffer no loss , Sir . In three days , the necessary statements ,  --  the capital ,  --  interest ,  --  all shall be restored . Leon . Leon Be it so . In three days ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade In three days ;  --  and as you must necessarily be in immediate want of money , to-morrow you shall have as much I can collect . Leon . Leon You make this an obligation by anticipating my wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will be at your house . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade I shall expect you . Leon . Leon Very good . I was not deceived . You 're an honest man . We shall one day , perhaps , know one another better  --  and you  --  adieu , till to-morrow . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Your servant . ( Exit Leon . D'Anglade alone . ) Overwhelming blow ! Would I were the only victim ;  --  but Lena , my dear Lena , must share in my misfortune ! How shall I announce to her the fatal news ,  --  how tell her  --  but she comes ,  --  and , for the first time I dread her presence !  --  ( Enter Madam D'Anglade . ) Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade My love , Bertrand acquaints me that a very abrupt , ill looking man desired to speak with you . What was his business ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade ( aside . ) She must be informed , and yet I dare not tell her ! Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade You turn away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adolphus inquietudes which he would hide from me ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade An unforeseen misfortune  --  Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Misfortune ! There is but one which I dread ,  --  that of being separated from you ! Tell me , my Adolphus , I entreat you , tell me ,  --  if you love me , relieve me from suspense ! D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade If I love you , Lena !  --  Learn then the truth . Leon de Valency is not dead . After escaping the shipwreck in which he was supposed to have perish 'd , it was he himself who just now appeared , to claim from me his paternal inheritance . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade You must restore it to him , Adolphus , and without delay . Lament not the sacrifice on my account ,  --  I feel it but on yours . In wedded life , sorrows , like joys , must be shared equally . Near you poverty has no terrors . In my husband 's arms the most rigorous lot can offer nothing to affright me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make the greatest sacrifices . To restore his patrimony in the manner he requires , I shall be forced to sell my own . Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( eagerly . ) Sell my diamonds also ,  --  I can no longer wear them . In the retreat we must now inhabit , these objects of luxury will be superfluous . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Adorable woman ! Thy virtues restore all my courage . Yes ! I now feel capable of any sacrifice . Fortune ,  --  grandeur ! I resign you without sigh ! Still shall I , though losing you , find myself rich , inestimably rich , in the dearest of my possessions !  --  ( to Lena . ) I will return to Madam de Cerval 's , and excuse myself from remaining with her friends . But what pretext ? Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Let her know all . We can have no reason to blush at the loss of fortune , when honour is unblemished . ( Enter Bertrand from Madam de Cerval 's house . ) Ber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your being kept so long , and has sent me  --  Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( to her husband . ) Allow me , my dear  --  ( to Bertrand . ) Bertrand , I know your zeal . I may confide in your attachment . You will oblige us by looking for a jeweller who can buy diamonds to the value of about five thousand louis , and pay ready money for them . He must come to-morrow , and your master will shew them to him . Ber . Bertrand You make me tremble , Madam . Has any misfortune befallen  --  Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade You shall know all in good time ;  --  but now , do as I bid you , Bertrand . We shall not forget your services . Ber . Bertrand I obey , Madam , I obey . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Come Adolphus ,  --  let us rejoin Madam de Cerval . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Beloved Lena ! never were you so dear to me as at this moment ! Take back thy riches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not melt thy soul ! Be assured that in the midst of all thy wealth , thou wilt be far less happy , than him thou hast impoverished . Exeunt D'Anglade and Madam D'Anglade . Bertrand remains , and gazes after them , with great emotion , until they get out of sight . He then wipes his eyes and comes forward . Ber . Bertrand " Not forget my services ! "  --  Is there any thought , then , of discharging me ? My master had a downcast air  --  Madam D'Anglade appeared greatly moved ! That man who desired to speak with him , is perhaps the cause .  --  Kind Heaven ! do not permit any thing ever to trouble my good master 's peace ,  --  or the happiness of those he justly holds so dear !  --  Marcel is heard singing merrily , behind the scenes . He comes capering in , obviously a little tipsy . Mar . Marcel Ah , this is what you may call a jolly day ! Oh , I 've been feasting and drinking and laughing ! Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you , master Bertrand  --  hey ? What are you doing here , all alone ? Ber . Bertrand Nothing . Hubert appears at the back of the stage . Perceiving Marcel and Bertrand together , he makes a significant gesture , and then places himself where he may listen unobserved . Mar . Marcel Why , you look quite down in the mouth . What 's the matter ? Are you in l-l-love , or are you in li-li-liquor ? Ber . Bertrand What 's that to you ? Mar . Marcel Oh , oh , oh ! Very true that ! It 's no affair of mine . Ber . Bertrand Tell me , Marcel ;  --  you know I am but little acquainted in town  --  where can I find a jeweller ? Mar . Marcel Aj  --  jew  --  jeweller ? Oh ! why there 's Mr. Dumont . I bought a ring of him the other day to give the chambermaid for a keepsake . Ber . Bertrand Is he rich ? Mar . Marcel Oh , that you may be sure of . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think , then , he could buy diamonds to a considerable amount ? Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) Buy Diamonds !  --  Mar . Marcel Oh , I 'm sure of it . I always heard say he gets his living by it . Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) There 's something in the wind , here . Ber . Bertrand If so , I want to speak with this jeweller , but I have just at present reasons for not going out :  --  if I write a word to him , will you carry my letter ? Mar . Marcel Why not ? Certainly ! Why not ? Surely ! To be sure . I 'll go with it this moment . Ber . Bertrand Hold . You must urge him to be punctual , because Mr. D'Anglade expects him at his house to-morrow morning . Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) Mr. D'Anglade ! To-morrow morning !  --  Mar . Marcel Oh , dear me , Mr. Bertrand ! The doleful way you say that in , frightens me . What has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly fear my poor master  --  Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) Ha ! Mar . Marcel What ? Good Mr. D'Anglade ? Why , who could think of doing him any harm ? Ber . Bertrand Ah , my dear Marcel , there are some people so wicked  --  ( turning and perceiving Hubert . ) That Hubert here !  --  Come along , Marcel . Mar . Marcel I am quite at your service , Mr. Bertrand , I 'm sure . ( Exit Marcel with Bertrand . Hubert advances . ) Hub . Hubert ( alone . ) Rather shy , old Bertrand . Something 's going wrong . Would to heaven I could find out what it is . They look so confounded melancholy !  --  particularly Mr. D'Anglade , since he saw that stranger . The day now begins to decline , and the stage to become gradually dark . Valmore enters abruptly from the house of Madam de Cerval , violently agitated . Val . Valmore Hubert ! My rival 's ruin 'd ! Hub . Hubert Ruined ? Val . Valmore He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sought for him is no other than Leon de Valency , who comes to reclaim his fortune . D'Anglade is forced to a total restitution , and his ruin is complete ! Hub . Hubert It seems to have happen 'd on purpose to favour your projects . Val . Valmore I thought so too . Hope darted through my soul . I flew to compassionate Lena and endeavoured to win her love by exciting her gratitude . What think you I have done ? Hub . Hubert I know not  --  but I tremble lest  --  Val . Valmore I implored Madam de Cerval to dispose of the twenty thousand louis destined for me , in favour of Mr. D'Anglade , and ,  --  can you believe it ?  --  his wife refused the offer ! Hub . Hubert She never did a better thing . Val . Valmore Proud woman ! Tho ' I cast my fortune at her feet , she overwhelms me with disdain , while my rival 's ruin seems but to double her affection ! I heard her soothing him by the tenderest names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That sight rack 'd my soul ! Now , the desire of vengeance inflames me into madness ! Hub . Hubert ( who , during Valmore 's speech , has affected to partake his anger . ) Well , Sir ,  --  you shall have vengeance ! You shall destroy your rival ! You shall possess Lena ! Val . Valmore What say you ? Hub . Hubert My brain is at work . Val . Valmore Have a care ! Hub . Hubert There 's not a moment to be lost . Let me proceed as I please , or , at once renounce Lena . Val . Valmore Renounce her ! Hub . Hubert A final answer ! Val . Valmore At least acquaint me  --  Hub . Hubert Impossible !  --  Yes or no ?  --  Pronounce !  --  Hark  --  Music is heard . Fourbin at the same moment appears behind the gate , and is observed by Valmore . Val . Valmore A stranger comes this way . Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) ' T is Fourbin . He will aid me. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for the word . Val . Valmore I dare not utter it . Hub . Hubert Well , Sir ,  --  then leave the woman you love in the arms of your rival . ( going . ) Val . Valmore Hold ! vengeance gains the victory ! I consent to every thing , I abandon myself to you ! Hub . Hubert Bravely resolv'd.  --  Fourbin ! Fourbin ! ( Fourbin enters . ) Four . Fourbin Here . Hub . Hubert Follow me , and if you are useful , you shall be well paid for it . Four . Fourbin Depend on me . Hub . Hubert Succeed , and I 'll make your fifty louis a hundred . Nobody here knows you , and I will give you an inpenetrable disguise . Come ! ( in a lower voice . ) Courage , and our fortune is made !  --  The boats of the parting company advance , and will observe us . Let us withdraw . Through the latter part of this act a beautiful sun-set has taken place ; twilight has succeeded ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubert and Valmore . The distance is now filled with boats , elegantly illuminated , in which all the company bestow themselves and depart ,  --  music playing all the while . Valmore on one side of the stage appears a pray to the most agonising irresolution . Hubert and Fourbin on the other , seem to shrink from observation . Act the Second . SCENE : AN ELEGANT APARTMENT , THE STUDY OF MR . D'ANGLADE . ON THE RIGHT HAND , A WRITING TABLE AND A SIDEDOOR . ON THE LEFT , ANOTHER DOOR AT THE TOP OF SOME STEPS WHICH HEAD TO MADAM D'ANGLADE 'S CHAMBER ; ALSO A BUREAU , A SOFA AND ARM CHAIRS . AT THE BOTTOM , A DOOR AND TWO WINDOWS OPENING ON THE GARDEN . WHEN THE CURTAIN RISES , IT IS MORNING , BUT THE WINDOW SHUTTERS ARE STILL CLOSED . D'ANGLADE IS SEATED AT HIS WRITING TABLE , COUNTING NOTES , WHICH , AFTER TAKING THEIR NUMBERS , HE PLACES IN ONE OF THE DRAWERS . TWO CANDLES NEARLY BURNED DOWN TO THEIR SOCKETS , ARE BEFORE HIM . D'Ang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and seventy ! ( places them in the drawer . ) My work advances . I can not rest till this affair is finished .  --  Cruel de Valency ! With a fortune great as that which I restore to him , to reduce me to such sacrifices ! Why all this rigour ?  --  But no more !  --  I must fortify myself . This very morning I receive his second visit . The sun I have just counted , with the money for the diamonds , will prove my rectitude , if it shame not his severity . ( Enter Bertrand , softly . ) Ber . Bertrand Is your honour in want of any thing ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade No , Bertrand . Ber . Bertrand And yet ' t is already late ; and as your honour has not had any sleep all night  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Late , do you say ?  --  I should not have supposed it .  --  Open the shutters . Ber . Bertrand I will , your honour . ( He goes up the stage to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has this night flown ! The hour we dread never lingers in its approach ! How short a time shall I retain the wealth which but yesterday I deemed mine irrevocably ! Chance gave this wealth , and chance transfers it to another . Let me yield without a murmur . Let me learn patience from the endearing submission of my Lena to this blow ,  --  unexpected and severe indeed !  --  but why should I shrink under it ? It has been struck in youth , when my fortitude and faculties can sustain its violence ;  --  it might have fallen when age had palsied those powers which are still competent to the support of my wife and the education of my boy !  --  ( During this soliloquy Bertrand opens the shutters , and the garden appears through the windows . It is broad day . Bertrand extinguishes the candles . ) Have you not been in bed , Bertrand ? Ber . Bertrand No , your honour . I preferred waiting in readiness for your call . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade That was considerate ; but age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master 's afflictions denied him rest ! D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Your mistress gave you some orders yesterday . Ber . Bertrand They are fulfilled . The jeweller will have the honour of waiting on you before twelve to-day . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Before twelve ?  --  ' T is well . Leave me . Ber . Bertrand Your honour  --  Could I but be permitted  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Proceed . Ber . Bertrand Were it not presuming  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Well  --  Ber . Bertrand I would venture to speak with you . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Speak , my honest friend , speak ! Ber . Bertrand That tone of goodness gives me strength . Yes , my dear master  --  then let me disclose my apprehensions  --  my fears  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Your fears , Bertrand ?  --  Go on . Ber . Bertrand The orders my mistress gave last night made me tremble . I feel too certain that before you could yield your consent to sell my lady 's diamonds , you must have been reduced to the extremest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertrand And that makes me fear  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade What ? Ber . Bertrand That you intend to keep me no longer in your service . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Bertrand , I can not be insensible to your attachment and fidelity , but my resources will soon be reduced to very narrow limits . Events oblige me to retire with my wife and child to Senesse , unattended , and without even a domestic . Ber . Bertrand Without a domestic ! Can your kind heart suffer you to dismiss me ?  --  I , who have been thirty years in your service ,  --  I , who attended you when you were a little child ,  --  I who thought never to have been parted from you while I lived !  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade But still ,  --  necessity  --  Ber . Bertrand Do not imagine it , your honour . No , no . I will never quit you . You will always need some person in your service . Well , let me be that person . Oh , do not be cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gardening ,  --  the house  --  work ,  --  the out-door business ,  --  I will do all . I want no wages ;  --  no , no , not a farthing !  --  Master , my dear master , in the name of heaven , do not refuse me ! ( he falls on his knees to D'Anglade . ) D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Rise , honest man ! This noble devotedness shall not appeal in vain . Yes  --  thou shalt accompany me to Senesse . Rich , I possessed in thee a good and faithful servant ;  --  Poor , I shall find in thy attachment , the carefulness and consolations of a friend . Ber . Bertrand Well then ,  --  it is decided  --  you will not drive me away ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade No ! thou shalt never leave me !  --  Ber . Bertrand Ah ! You almost make me young again ! I was sure you could not reject me :  --  but I had resolved to follow you . I would have come to the door of your retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away your poor old servant . ( kissing D'Anglade 's hand . ) My dear master ! My good master ! I am overwhelmed with thankfulness ! ( A noise is heard at the latch of the door leading to Lena 's apartment . D'Anglade hides his face in his handkerchief and points thither . Bertrand goes and opens it . ) It is Master Charles . ( Enter Charles with a small morocco box . ) Char . Charles Good morning , papa . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade What ! up so early , my child . ( kisses him . ) Char . Charles Oh , I did n't go to bed all night long . I slept in mamma 's lap . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Poor Lena ! Char . Charles As soon as it was morning , mamma put all her pretty things in this box , and then she said , " Charles , carry that to papa .

What do you take all these pretty things away from her for ?  --  Mamma is a good mamma . When she takes away my toys , it 's because I 'm naughty .

Adolphus D'Anglade Bertrand , let me know when the jeweller comes . Ber . Bertrand I will , your honour . ( Exit Bertrand . ) D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade ( alone . ) Honest Bertrand ! This last act of thine shall never be forgotten ! ' T is thus that in this changeful world the goodness of the few , consoles us for the heartlessness of the many . Behind the windows at the back part of the stage , Hubert and Fourbin appear in the garden . Fourbin is disguised , wearing a wig , a cane , and an oldfashion 'd shop-keeper 's dress , in which it is not possible to recognise him . Hubert and Fourbin advance softly , and are unperceive 'd by D'Anglade , who , seated at his bureau , has opened the box , and taken a casket out of it , regarding , alternately , the diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Anglade . Hubert points out D'Anglade to Fourbin , and also the door at which he is to present himself . They then shake hands and retire at different sides . I know not whence this weakness can arise ! ( pointing to the casket . ) But this is the sacrifice which costs me most ! ( opening the casket and fixing his eyes upon the diamonds . ) Brilliant ornaments ! you will soon pass into other hands , but never can you decorate higher excellence than hers , from whose charms and virtue you borrow 'd half your lustre . I surrender you with a sigh : but ( taking a ring out of the casket. ) this ring , the first symbol of my plighted faith , revives a thousand recollections of our early love , which now cling , with redoubled force , about my heart . This ring I must retain . ' T was the harbinger of that union at the altar , which now forms my solace ' mid the ruin which compels this sacrifice ! ( Enter Bertrand . ) Ber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adolphus D'Anglade So soon !  --  Admit him . Ber . Bertrand Come in , Sir . ( Enter Fourbin , who bows to Mr. D'Anglade . Exit Bertrand . ) Four . Fourbin I am told , Sir , that you desire to dispose of a set of diamonds . Marcel , the gardener of the house , requested me to call here . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Right . You are doubtless aware that they require a very considerable sum ? Four . Fourbin Yes , Sir !  --  but that wo n't be any great objection . I happen just at this moment to have a demand for them . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Here they are . They could not be purchased for less than five thousand louis ; but I would avoid delay , and I have fixed the price at four thousand , five hundred . Four . Fourbin Will you permit me , Sir  --  just for an instant  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Willingly . ( He gives the casket . ) The sett is complete . Four . Fourbin ( aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my honesty prevents me from pocketing this , and making off at once ; but I 've promis 'd Hubert to dispose of it in another way . If there 's not honour among thieves , where should we look for it ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade What do you say ? Four . Fourbin That four thousand five hundred louis is a great deal of money . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade They are worth more , and I can not part with them for less . Four . Fourbin Oh , I 'm sure you will agree to take off  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Positively nothing ! If they do not suit you , I must consult another . ( Extending his hand to take back the casket . ) Four . Fourbin Stop a moment , Sir , only one moment .  --  If it must be so , it must . I 'll take them , but in truth if I had not just now a particular customer to serve by purchasing these jewels , it would have been impossible for me to have produced this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , I wish to have the honour of doing your business for you ( aside ) which shall be done to some purpose . ( aloud . ) There , Sir . There 's the value of four thousand five hundred louis in good notes . ( aside . ) Whew ! what a sum ! ( aloud . ) Be pleased to see if your money is right . D'Anglade takes the notes , goes to his writing table , and examines them . While he is thus occupied , Fourbin casts his eyes around the whole apartment and his attention is momentarily rivetted on the sofa : then , as if struck by a sudden thought , he slips the casket and a large pocket book under one of the cushions . Four . Fourbin ( aside . ) I 've done your business . Here are my commissons. ( patting his pocket . ) D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Good ! ( to Fourbin . ) What said you ? Four . Fourbin I  --  I  --  merely asked whether you found the notes right . D'Ang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have the honour of taking my leave . ( aside . ) Now then to find Hubert . Exit Fourbin . D'Anglade takes the 4,500 louis just received from Fourbin to the drawer in which he had placed the 570 at the beginning of the act . He counts all the notes together , and then removes them from the drawer of the writing table to a letter case on his bureau . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Now Leon de Valency , I am ready to fulfil my promise . ( enter Madam D'Anglade . ) Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade My love , I dread the effects of your unceasing labours .

Charles , in turning , has perceived , through the window , at the back of the stage , two police officers , and several soldiers , traversing the farther end of the garden .

I saw one of the windows wide open , though they 're always bolted during the night . I just peeped in to see what was there .  --  I saw nobody ; but I saw in an instant that the desk was all broken , as if some one had forced the lock ! All . All Oh Heaven ! Mar . Marcel I lost no time . I went to tell Mr. Valmore of what I had seen , directly ,  --  he sent to look for the police officers . They came .

Marcel Yes , they suspect me . All . All You ! ! Mar . Marcel Yes  --  me ! Because I was the first that saw the open window , and gave the alarm , they say ' t was all a trick of my own to keep clear of being suspected ! One ought to be wicked and arch wicked to lay this charge on me , that never went by the Parson without pulling off my hat !  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade But it will be easy to justify yourself .

The police officers ?  --  Oh Lord ! They 're after me ! Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade They are coming hither .  --  Poor Marcel !  --  ( Enter Hubert , Dorval , Soldiers , Police Officers , and Notary . ) Hub . Hubert ( with effrontery . ) Come in ,  --  come in , gentlemen ! This is the dwelling of Mr.  --  ( at the sight of D'Anglade , Hubert stops and dares not continue . ) Dor .

D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( aside to D'Anglade . ) How unpleasant is this affair ! D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade ( aside to Madam D'Anglade . ) Yes , but the officers will not exceed their instructions . Madam D'Anglade sits down near the writing table . Dorval , after having cast his eyes over every thing which the study contains , fixes them on the bureau , and on the letter case , which is placed there . Dor . Dorval What is in that case ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Family papers . Satisfy yourself . Examine them if you please . ( Dorval opens the case and turns over the papers . ) Hub .

Among these notes a part of those of which I have the numbers !  --  ( aloud to Mr. D'Anglade . ) How did you come by these notes , Sir ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Why that question ? Dor . Dorval I must repeat it , Sir . How did you come by these notes ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade You must be aware , Sir , that events sometimes reduce even people of condition to extremities , the disclosure of which might expose them to impertinent remark ;  --  but in the present case I perceive the necessity of avowing that this very morning those notes were paid to me for diamonds , of which a sudden emergency compelled me to dispose . Dor . Dorval To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Dor . Dorval His name ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade I do not know it . Dor . Dorval ( astonished . ) You do not know it ? Mar . Marcel No , certainly !

Dorval makes a sign to the Notary , who sits down and makes a minute of each question and reply ; then addressing D'Anglade . ) For how much did you sell these diamonds , Sir ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Four thousand five hundred louis . Dor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand five hundred of them among the five thousand and seventy now in my hands ! But where can the others be ? ( aloud . ) Mr. D'Anglade , what other notes have you ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade None , Sir . ( Dorval makes a sign to the Notary which Madam D'Anglade observes . ) Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( to Dorval , with agitation . ) Why these extraordinary questions to Mr. D'Anglade ? See , Adolphus , they are writing down all you say ! Dor . Dorval Madam , these are formalities prescribed by law , the necessity of which you and your husband will acknowledge , when I tell you that among the notes in this letter case , I find four thousand five hundred louis of the identical notes last night stolen from Madam de Cerval . Ber. and Mad . D'A . Bertrand , Madame D'Anglade ( terrified . ) Merciful Heaven ! Mar . Marcel Oh ! Lord ! D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade ( moved . ) How could that happen ? Dor . Dorval I know not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am most desirous to see this mystery unravelled . Mar . Marcel Huzza ! Now the truth will out ! Here he comes ! Here he comes ! All . All Who ? Mar . Marcel Mr. Dumont the jeweller . Dor . Dorval The information we shall gather from him will doubtless shed great light on this affair . Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) There 's no craft in my skull if it does . Ber . Bertrand ( aside to Madam D'Anglade . ) My dear mistress , the evidence of the jeweller , will , I 'm sure of it , remove this embarrassment . Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( with dignity . ) Unquestionably . Mar . Marcel Come in , come in , Mr. Dumont ! Enter Dumont.  --  At the moment when all looks are directed towards the door at the top of the stage , and when all the characters impatiently expect the jeweller 's arrival , Dumont appears . Every countenance changes instantly Extreme surprise is depicted on the features of D'Anglade  --  terror on those of Bertrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alteration in her husband . Dorval attentively examines every face . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade What can this mean ? Ber . Bertrand ' T is not the person ! Dor . Dorval ( to Dumont . ) Approach , Sir .

Dumont Jeweller . Dor . Dorval Your residence ? Dum . Dumont Number twenty-nine , Gold Street . Dor . Dorval ( pointing to D'Anglade . ) Do you know this gentleman ? Dum . Dumont I never saw him before . Dor . Dorval How ? Did you not purchase diamonds from him this morning ? Dum . Dumont No . Madam de Cerval 's gardener brought me a note desiring my attendance on Mr. D'Anglade , if I wished to purchase diamonds to the amount of nearly five thousand louis , intimating that the money must be instantly advanced . The raising of so large a sum delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my way hither , when the officer met me with your summons . Dor . Dorval Mr. D'Anglade , what have you to say in reply ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade The gentleman has declared the truth . It was that person ( pointing to Mr. Dumont. ) for whom I sent , and another has appeared under his name . He professed to be the jeweller whose attendance I had required . Not suspecting any fraud , I shewed him at once the diamonds . The purchase was settled immediately , and I received from him notes to the amount of four thousand five hundred louis , which I deposited among those now in your possession . This is the truth  --  I aver it upon my honor .  --  How the impostor could have been apprised of my having had diamonds to dispose of ,  --  why he should have personated the real jeweller ,  --  how the sum he has paid me should be a part of the very notes stolen from Madam de Cerval ;  --  all these are mysteries I can not comprehend . Dor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any person to make this purchase on your behalf ? Dum . Dumont I did not . I studiously avoided mentioning the circumstance ; that no other might deprive me of the purchase , which , at this moment , I had an opportunity of converting to fair profit . Mar . Marcel And I , too  --  I did n't say a word about them to any body but Mr. Dumont , because ( to Bertrand. ) you told me to conceal it from all the people in the house . Dor . Dorval ( surprised . ) And for what reason was that order given ? Ber . Bertrand I never ask the reason of my master 's orders . Dor . Dorval ( to Dumont . ) Mr. Dumont , come hither . Read and sign your deposition . ( Dumont goes to the table and signs . ) D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade ( aside . ) And Leon de Valency ! He too will soon be here ! Mad . D'A .

You already know it to be my wish . Dor . Dorval ( pointing to the door at the left . ) Whither does that door conduct ? Ber . Bertrand To the apartments of Madam D'Anglade . Dor . Dorval ( To Police Officers . ) Go ! but forget not the respect due to the house you are examining . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Bertrand , conduct them . Dor . Dorval ( to Mr. D'Anglade . ) Will you favour me with the key of your writing desk ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade There it is . He gives the key .

Fear you not , my love , lest these notes  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade What can he fear who feels no self reproach ? Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Oh my dear Adolphus ! A pure conscience must defend us in the last extremity ! I rest your safety and my peace upon your self collectedness . The Police Officers suspend their search . Dorval quits the writing table . Dor . Dorval Have you found nothing ? All . All Nothing . Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) That 's strange ! Dor . Dorval Let us proceed . Madam D'Anglade is seated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , leaning on the back of her chair . Dorval is near the bureau , and the three Police Officers renew their search in the back part of the room . Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) Curse it ! The wheels do n't work ! Fourbin in his haste to get away has not told me in what corner he concealed the  --  Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( to Charles who is going up the stage . ) Charles ! Stay here , my son . Char . Charles Oh , mamma , I 'm only going for my little chair . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade It is up stairs , child . Mar . Marcel Here 's a chair , my young master . Char . Charles No , no  --  that 's too high for me . I 'll find one I like better . He goes to take the cushion which covers the casket from the sofa , brings it without noticing the casket , to the feet of his mother ,  --  and sits down there . At this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Madam D'Anglade 's apartment . The first of them says , from above , on the stair , to Dorval : Pol . Off . Police Officer We have found nothing . Mar .

Dorval steps forward to approach the Police Officers , when his eyes become fixed upon the sofa , and he exclaims : Dor . Dorval ( with the greatest surprise . ) What do I see ! All . All What ? Dor . Dorval ( taking the casket and pocket book , and addressing D'Anglade . ) Do you know this casket , Sir ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade ( astonished . ) It is that which contained the diamonds I sold this morning ! Dor . Dorval But they are still in the casket ! All . All Just Heaven !

Who can be the author of this black design ! Mar . Marcel ' T is impossible ! ' T is impossible ! There 's craft , and handicraft , and witchcraft in it all ! Dor . Dorval This pocket book contains fifteen thousand louis in notes , the numbers of which exactly correspond with those on the memorandum of Madam de Cerval . Adding this to the four thousand five hundred louis in the letter case , it appears that five hundred louis have been taken away from the sum stolen . Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) That villain Fourbin ! The lesser rascal has made sure of the greater pay ! Dor . Dorval Mr. D'Anglade , you say you sold your diamonds ? I find them and the pocket book concealed in your study !

Dorval ( hesitating . ) But , Sir ,  --  the appearances  --  D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Are all deceptive . So extraordinary a concurrence of circumstances , can only be the work of foul conspiracy . Doubtless some one meditates my destruction , and profiting by the moment when all my wealth is snatched from me , seeks to rob me of my honour ;  --  but , in the face of heaven , I protest that I am innocent ! Dor . Dorval I wish to think so ; but , Sir , I must fulfil my duty . ( whispers to an agent who goes out immediately . ) Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade O ye powers of mercy !

An additional number of Soldiers appear at the back of the stage . Leon De Valency is heard behind the scenes . Leon . Leon ( behind the scenes . ) Fire and thunder ! Stand out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through a legion of ye ! Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade I sink , Adolphus ! I die ! She falls into the arms of her husband . At the same moment Leon De Valency enters precipitately , clad as in the first act . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Heavens ! ' T is Leon de Valency ! This still was wanting to my misery ! Leon . Leon ( in coming down the stage . ) Where is he ? Let me see him . ( looks around him with astonishment . ) Ah ! Have I found you at last , Mr. D'Anglade ? Hub . Hubert ( aside to Valmore . ) ' T is Leon de Valency ! Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( recovering and regarding Leon . ) Every disaster bursts upon us at once ! D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade Pardon me , Sir , for not complying with the promise which I made you , but this terrible event  --  Leon . Leon ( stopping him abruptly . ) I know it . They 've told me all . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Anglade I hope , Sir , you do not believe  --  Leon . Leon Me ? No ! Not a word of it ! ( seizing and shaking his hand . ) Cousin ! Now I know you , and you shall have proofs of it ! There 's my hand , my heart , and my friendship forever ! Where 's the magistrate ? Dor . Dorval Here , Sir . Leon . Leon Mr. D'Anglade is my relation . I have proved him just and honourable . I know he could not commit a disgraceful act , and I will save him , whatever be the price . ( All utter ejaculations of surprise . ) Dor . Dorval Sir ! Leon . Leon Before the Tribunals he will justify himself . His accusers will be confounded , and his innocence proclaimed . I know he will prove spotless . But what do you mean to do with him now ? Dor . Dorval He must go to prison . All . All To prison ! Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( to Dorval . ) Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon Fear not . He shall not go to prison . I 'll be d  --  d if he shall ! Dor . Dorval How ! Leon . Leon No , Sir . He shall not . I 'll answer that his person shall be forthcoming , to the utmost I am worth . How much do you want for his bail ? Thirty , forty , fifty thousand louis ? They shall be instantly counted down to you . D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade I am lost in wonder ! Mar . Marcel That 's glorious ! He 's an honest fellow after all ! Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) My game is up . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Oh , Sir  --  this generosity  --  Leon . Leon No thanks  --  no praises  --  I do n't deserve ' em . I 've been the cause of all his misfortunes . All . All What say you ? Leon . Leon Yes , I ! Deceived by all men and never having obtained any return for good offices but ingratitude , I sought to prove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worthy of a fortune which I had the right to reclaim from his possession . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Fatal experiment ! Leon . Leon I went to him in this disguise . I made him believe that I was in misery , that I wished to despoil him of his wealth . I saw all the nobleness of his perfect integrity , all the magnanimity of his character . The evidences I subsequently obtained confirmed my good opinion ; and I came full of joy , to communicate the truth and clasp him in my arms , when I heard of the odious accusation which hangs over his head and points the finger of disgrace at all his family .  --  And can I believe it ? The man who did not hesitate to relinquish every thing he possessed at my first demand , because he felt its justice ,  --  could such a man commit a robbery ? Never , never ! I know him to be innocent . I will repair the wrong I did him , if it costs me my fortune and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers ? Dor . Dorval It can not be . He must depart immediately . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Can you refuse this mercy to the tears of his wife and child ? D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade I obey . Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( throwing herself into his arms . ) Adolphus , my dear Adolphus , I must not , can not lose thee ! D'Ang . Adolphus D'Anglade I am not lost .  --  Think of thy son , Lena . Leave me to the justice of my cause . Remain with this generous kinsman ;  --  concert with him how best to justify my name , and to proclaim my innocence . Leon , Bertrand , Friends ! To your protection I confide all that my heart holds dearest in the world ! He tears himself from the embrace of his wife , who sinks , fainting , into the arms of Madam de Cerval , Leon takes little Charles in his arms , while he is embracing the knees of his father . Valmore appears a prey to the most bitter self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The soldiers encircle D'Anglade , and the curtain falls . Act the Third . SCENE : ANOTHER PART OF MADAM DE CERVAL 'S GARDEN . ON THE RIGHT , A VERY THICK COPSE ; AND A SMALL GREEN BANK WITH A SPADE RESTING AGAINST IT . ON THE LEFT , A HANDSOME SUMMER-HOUSE , THE DOOR OF WHICH IS ON THE SIDE : A LARGE WINDOW , FRONTING THE AUDIENCE , DISCOVERS TO VIEW THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING , AND ABOVE , THERE IS AN ATTIC WINDOW . BEYOND THE SUMMER- HOUSE , ON THE SAME SIDE , A SMALL GARDEN DOOR WHICH OPENS ON THE COUNTRY . ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE STAGE , A GARDEN WALL , WITH A LARGE OPENING OF IRON RAILING IN THE CENTRE , WHICH DISCLOSES THE DISTANT COUNTRY . GARDEN CHAIRS , &c.; FOURBIN APPEARS AT THE ATTIC WINDOW , DISGUISED AS A SAILOR . Four . Fourbin ( at the attic window . ) Is the coast clear ? May I venture down ? There is no one within sight  --  now is the time then . ( he withdraws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a soul to be seen ! ( He advances on the stage , which , as he continues to speak , he traverses very carefully to see if any one is within view . ) Hubert does not come ! This alarms me . As I value my head I must be off . I took care to secure my tithes out of Madam de Cerval 's pocket book , unknown to Hubert , in return for a like kindness from him on a former partnership plunder . Fearing I should be caught , and the notes found upon me , I have placed the money ( pointing to one of the steps of the summer-house ) in this bank , on which I can draw without a check I hope . The moment is favourable . Nobody can see me . Let me make sure of my five hundred . ( having ventured to the door of the summer-house he stoops and begins to remove the stone , when he hears a noise , starts , and drops it instantly ) What 's that ? ( Exit rapidly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( alone . ) At last I have succeeded . Now to rid myself of that scoundrel Fourbin ; and get the five hundred back from him . ( He advances towards the summer-house , cautiously looking behind him . On reaching it , and taking a key from his pocket to unlock the door , it is slowly opened by Fourbin , who has been holding it in his hand and watching , and who now appears before him . ) How now ? Where are you going ? Four . Fourbin Do n't make a noise . I saw you coming . Hub . Hubert You should n't have quitted your den . Suppose you had been caught ? ( pointing to his neck . ) That cursed De Valency has suddenly tacked about upon us . He swears that till the guilty are detected , and D'Anglade 's innocence made known , he 'll not cease to move in this affair . Four . Fourbin Then he 'll be a perpetual motion ; as I intend to keep moving out of his way ; and under cover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one 's way . Hub . Hubert There 's nothing left for us now but your flight . Four . Fourbin And your master ? Hub . Hubert O , he 'll stay here to moan over the mischief he has done , chicken hearted driveller !  --  But come , I advise you to be off . I have spoken to the captain of a trading boat which sails this evening for Legborn . I told him you were a Venetian sailor , and would work your passage to your own country . Harkye , do n't be awkward at your new trade . Four . Fourbin Not I. I happen to have been brought up to it . Hub . Hubert I thought it best not to offer money . It might have raised suspicion . Four . Fourbin That was right . The less I give away , the more I shall have for myself . Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) You 'll have less than you think perhaps . ( aloud . ) Now , all 's settled . You 're well disguised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and giving a glance at the place where the notes are hidden . ) Oh , the devil ! Hub . Hubert ( holding out his hand . ) Come ! Four . Fourbin With all my heart ,  --  but  --  Hub . Hubert ( aside . ) He hesitates !  --  The notes are not about his person !  --  ( aloud . ) What makes you loiter ? Four . Fourbin ( as if struck by a sudden thought . ) You say nothing of the hundred louis you promis 'd me . Hub . Hubert Ah , right ! I have been so hurried  --  I have not been able to see my master for a single instant .  --  Faith , you did well to remind me  --  I should have forgotten to ask him for ' em  --  Four . Fourbin Or you might have forgotten to give them to me . Hub . Hubert Can you think that of your old friend ? Four . Fourbin Indeed I can . You know you are subject to those absent fits . Hub . Hubert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your hiding place . ( Fourbin enters the summer-house , and Marcel appears . ) Mar . Marcel ( as he enters , without seeing Hubert . ) Odrot it ! Is n't it vexatious now that one ca n't find out any thing ! I have been labouring and labouring to get at the truth , till my brain is turned topsy turvy ! but I do think if I could once find myself face to face with the real villain  --  ( perceiving Hubert . ) Ha ! It is you , Mr. Hubert . Hub . Hubert ( abruptly . ) That 's true enough ; but what do you want ? What brings you here ? Mar . Marcel Hey ! Well now , there 's a sensible question ! As if it was n't my place to be here ! As if you did n't know that ! There 's my nursery , look ye ,  --  and over there 's my ice house ,  --  and if you must know all about it ,  --  there !  --  there 's my lodge at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , my business to ask what brings you here . Hub . Hubert I  --  I  --  why I was looking for my master . Mar . Marcel Mr. Valmore ? It 's odd what an effect this affair has on him . I met him just now ,  --  his arms folded ,  --  his head bent down ,  --  just so !  --  for all the world like the image in my weeping willow grove . And then he began to walk with great strides , as if he was running ; and then he stopp 'd suddenly as if he 'd lost his legs !  --  And then  --  in short , he had so much the way of a madman , that  --  I declare one would almost think there was something terrible upon his conscience :  --  but here come the ladies . Ask them for your master . Hub . Hubert It 's useless to trouble them . ( authoritatively . ) But do n't repeat what you have just told me . Mar . Marcel I sha n't forget . ( Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what airs some people give themselves . Well every body is crazy here to day , and I believe I 've caught the infection . Ever since morning , I have n't the least notion of what I 'm about . I look for a spade and I lay hold of a rake . I set out to go home , and the first thing I know I 'm in the middle of the ice-house ! The housekeeper asked me for a melon and I gave her an artichoke ! Oh dear ! oh , dear ! If it were possible , I should lose my wits ! ( Enter Madam D'Anglade , Charles and Madame de Cerval . ) Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Compose yourself , my dear Lena . You make me tremble for you . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Can I with composure witness the loss , the dishonour of my husband , and the degradation of my child ? Can I contemplate without horror the calamities which hang over me ? No , never ! I might be armed with fortitude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when I think of the infamy of my boy ; when I behold his father classed among wretches , the shame and terror of society ,  --  when I feel that an atrocious decree is about to blast for ever , the reputation and happiness of the most estimable of men ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Dearest Lena ! Indulge not these frightful apprehensions ! Confide in the goodness of Heaven and the justice of man . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade What can I expect from the justice of man , when my husband is in chains ? When , upon mere suspicion , the barbarians have robbed him of liberty ? When they accuse him of the basest , the meanest of all crimes ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Anguish bewilders you , my love . The baser and the meaner the crime of which he is accused , the more infallible must be its refutation . Your husband will be restored to you , his innocence publicly proclaimed , and the author of this horrible conspiracy delivered up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam D'Anglade But who can have involved him in these dreadful toils ? What interest can animate the wretch who has plunged us into this abyss of misery ? Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval There lies the mystery . Do you suspect any one ? Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Alas ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval You are silent . You turn away . Do you fear to let me read your heart ? Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Ask me not . I can not speak . Believe that you possess all my confidence ;  --  that your conduct in this awful crisis binds me to you for ever ,  --  and that were it possible  --  but my gratitude for your kindness prevents me from wounding your feelings ,  --  and , without resistless proof , I can not , must not , become an accuser ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval You alarm me  --  Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Forgive me , but I conjure you , suffer me  --  Mad . de . C. Madam de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly to my dear Adolphus , to dare every thing to free him from captivity , and should I fail , at least to afford him the sympathies and consolations which a wife 's tenderness can alone supply . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Can your feeble frame brave the terrors of a dungeon ? Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Have they not dragged my husband thither ? Can I remain from him at such a moment ? No ! I 'll fly to share his sufferings . The wife who devotes herself to the succour of her persecuted husband , converts her prison to a sanctuary which even his oppressors must revere . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval But Leon has gone to supplicate for the liberation of Mr. D'Anglade . Will you not wait for his return ? Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade No , no . They are inexorable . He must have failed or he would have returned ere now . This agony of suspense I can support no longer . Mar . Marcel ( who has gone up the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He 's coming ! There 's Mr. Leon de Valency ! Mad . D'A. and Mad . de Cer . Madame D'Anglade , Madame de Cerval ( together . ) Leon ! Mar . Marcel How he runs ! ( to Leon who at that moment appears on the hill at the other side of the railing . ) This way ! This way ! Come , Mr. Leon , I 'll open the little gate , that 's the nearest path ! ( Leon , ready to turn at the bottom of the hill , stops at the voice of Marcel , and retraces his steps . ) Char . Charles Is papa with him ? ( Enter Leon , elegantly dressed , by the little gate . Madam de Cerval goes to meet him . ) Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Oh , Sir , what news ? what news ? Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade My husband  --  My husband  --  Leon . Leon I have seen him . He preserves , in prison , that calmness which never can forsake the honest man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sufferings . He implored me to encourage your fortitude , and I assured him that you would not despair . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Dear and unfortunate D'Anglade ! Leon . Leon Thrice have I sought admission to the magistrate , who has at last promised to receive me in an hour . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade In an hour ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Dear friend , take courage ! The hou will soon elapse . Leon . Leon Soon !  --  Yes  --  Thus think the happy ! Were it my misfortune to be invested with the duty of pronouncing on the life and liberty of my fellow creatures , I would at all times be accessible . Too often do magistrates forget that a moment taken for their convenience is an age of agony to the poor , neglected prisoner . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Too poignantly I feel it . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval And have you any hope ? Leon . Leon There is but one way in which he can be saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a robbery was not the end in view , for a mere robber would have taken away the money . No ! ' T is evidently a plot to ruin and disgrace Adolphus . The contriver must be an implacable foe ; and the false jeweller his chief instrument . ( pauses . ) I am sorry , Madam , that you did not see this jeweller , and that my cousin , in speaking with him , scarcely observed his face ; for I strongly suspect that he is still in this house . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade In this house ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Can it be possible ! Leon . Leon I have questioned every body , except Bertrand . Nobody in the house perceived him ,  --  not even the Porter , to whom he would have addressed himself to inquire for D'Anglade . He was neither seen to come in or go out . How , then , can he have passed ? Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Yet , though the Police Officers have made most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon . Leon Malice abounds in precautions . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Precautions could only have been adopted by a connivance with some one in my house . Leon . Leon True ;  --  and that I suspect to have been the case . Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( aside . ) Can he suspect as I do ? Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval How , Sir ? Leon . Leon D'Anglade has injur 'd no one . Who could plan his destruction but some abandon 'd rival ? Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Sir  --  Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( alarmed . ) Nay  --  nay  --  beware  --  Leon . Leon Let me alone . An impenetrable veil covers this atrocity . In our conversation you lifted it with a trembling hand ; but it is now my place to tear it away . Has the trouble which has pervaded this house prevented you from remarking the agitation , nay the distraction of Valmore ? This is not natural . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leon ( with energy . ) Friendship ! Are we not both aware that he was once the rival  --  Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Time and absence have extinguished that passion . Leon . Leon Be undeceived , Madam . Valmore only induced you to think so , that he might the better perpetrate the project of dishonour he had dared to form ! Know that yesterday , scarcely removed from your eye and regardless of Lena 's virtues , he had the presumption to speak to her of love . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Ha ! Can it be possible ! Leon . Leon He may have been hurried on by unprincipled advisers ,  --  by the force of passion . The sufferings which rend his bosom at this moment prove that his heart is not hardened against remorse . Speak with him , Madam ,  --  quickly speak with him ,  --  and obtain a confession to exonerate Adolphus . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval ( deeply distressed . ) I ! Leon .

Leon It is time for me to go back to the magistrate . Come with me , Lena . ( to Madam de Cerval . ) Madam , we confide in the active justice of your noble heart . Mad . D'A . Madame D'Anglade ( approaching and falling on her knees to Madam de Cerval , with her son . ) Save the unhappy D'Anglade ! His wife and child implore you on their knees ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Lena ! Lena ! Char . Charles ( on his knees . ) Dear lady , give me back my papa ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval ( excited to the highest pitch of tenderness . ) Yes , yes ! Whatever be the sacrifice ( bursting into tears. ) my duty shall be done !  --  Delay not to return . Leon . Leon He comes . Let us away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter Valmore slowly . His arms folded . His head bent upon his breast . At first he does not see any one , and expresses the greatest surprize on discovering Madam de Cerval . Val . Valmore Damnation ! Madam de Cerval again ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Valmore , since morning you have appeared to fly me . I have sought you . I must speak with you . Val . Valmore With me , Madam ? Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval With you . You know the dreadful situation of Mr. D'Anglade . Val . Valmore Believe me , it affects me deeply . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval I do believe it . Think you he can be guilty ? Val . Valmore I dare not answer you . Mad de C. Madam de Cerval But I must be answered . You have known him long  --  Val . Valmore And have always considered him a man of unquestionable honour . Mad de C.

Madam de Cerval Are you very sure of your own servant ? Val . Valmore Of Hubert ? Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Yes , Hubert . I never had a good opinion of that man . Val . Valmore He never gave me reason to complain . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Can you answer for his probity ? Val . Valmore Yes , Madam  --  Besides ,  --  what interest could he have  --  Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval He might have been the agent of some secret enemy . Val . Valmore I can not think so . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval You can not but be conscious how nearly it concerns us to penetrate this mystery . It is a duty for both of us , but especially for you . Val . Valmore For me ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Yes , Valmore , for you . The world often judges from appearances .

And you , Madam ,  --  can you imagine  --  Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval No , surely , ' t is impossible !  --  Coolly to plan the ruin of a virtuous man ,  --  to accumulate against him such proofs of turpitude ,  --  at one blow to rob him both of liberty and honour ,  --  to expose him to the risk of admitting himself guilty to evade the rack ,  --  to suffer him to be condemned when known to be innocent ,  --  to deliver up to infamy his wife , his child  --  ( bursting into tears . ) No , Valmore , no !  --  I should shudder at myself were I capable of suspecting you of such fiendlike refinement upon cruelty and crime !

The misery of Madam D'Anglade forbids the least delay . I burn with impatience to put a period to her woes , and from this moment pledge myself to silence this unfortunate affair . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Gracious heaven ! Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval To silence , say you ? Val . Valmore Yes  --  all my own credit , all that of my friends , shall be employed to rescue Mr. D'Anglade from the perils which gather round him , by furnishing him with the means of escaping to some foreign land . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Dare you insult me , Sir , by such a proposition ? Adolphus is not guilty . He might appear so , could he consent to fly . Val . Valmore Madam  --  Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Advance not for an instant such a thought ! Adolphus D'Anglade must transmit to his son a name without a blemish . He is slandered with the stigma of having broken his country 's laws , and he will scorn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set him free . Val . Valmore Yet  --  Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval She is right . The honest man never shrinks from the scrutiny of his judges . Val . Valmore Reflect , Madam , on the strong proofs which combine against him . He must be condemned . Mad . D'A . Madam D'Anglade Condemned ! ( approaching Valmore . ) And is it you , Sir , who dare say that in my presence ? Catching him by the wrist with one hand , she elevates the other firmly to Heaven , and looks at him with the most forcible expression . For an instant he meets her eye and then shrinks from it . She dashes his arm from her with mingled indignation and contempt . Mad . de C. Madam de Cerval Be calm , Lena . I am now satisfied as to what remains for me to do .  --  Do you , Sir , meet me instantly within . I shall there explain my intentions . I rely on your unconditional compliance . ( Approaching him and lowering her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands you are about to receive , can alone shelter you from the calamities which I forbode ! Val . Valmore Madam ! Mad . de C.

My crime is detected ,  --  and soon will justice  --  Whither shall I fly ? Fly ? I can not move  --  a spell hangs over me  --  my feet are rooted to this spot  --  a menacing voice shrieks in my ear  --  " Stay , miscreant , the Tribunals claim thee ! " Death ! Dishonour !

The veil has fallen , and discovers to my affrighted gaze all the magnitude of my crime , and all the horrors which beset me for its punishment !

Let 's lose no time ! Hub . Hubert I 'm ready . Mar . Marcel ( low to Bertrand . ) Shut him up well , and come back directly . Ber . Bertrand ( low . ) Rely on me .

Dorval returns , sustaining Valmore , pale and bleeding , with a pistol in his hand . The Soldiers follow . Dorval brings Valmore to the centre of the stage . Valmore drops the pistol , staggers to D'Anglade , falls upon his knees , and seems to supplicate forgiveness ; then rises , reels towards Dorval , plucks a paper from his bosom which he gives Dorval ; clasps his hands fervently as if in prayer , then falls and dies .
