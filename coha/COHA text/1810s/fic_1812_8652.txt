DRAMATIS PERSON . Peter the Great , Czar of Russia . Alexis , his Son . Prince Mentzkioff . Prince Galitzin . Father Confessor . Iwan . Officers , &c.; Ksenia , in love with Alexis . SCENE . St. Petersburg Main text ACT I. SCENE I.  --  Imperial Palace . Enter Princes Mentzikoff and Galitzin . Prince Galitzin Prince Galitzin If virtue be the special care of heav'n , If nations ' welfare be its chief concern , Our czar belov 'd will soon regain his health . When millions pray , they seldom pray in vain . Has balmy sleep reviv 'd his languid frame ? Feels he the genial influence of this morn ? Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff Slow his recovery , being still in need Of that which , if obtain 'd , would soon restore him . Prince Galitzin Prince Galitzin Is he , whose anxious care for publick weal Brought here the stores of esculapian art , And for its votaries sumptuous temples rais 'd  --  Is he alone exempted from relief ? Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff No human art can reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and galling flight To Austria 's court , depress his noble soul . Prince Galitzin Prince Galitzin A people 's father , in his nearest son Unhappy ! How endures he this affliction ? Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff Mild sunshine oft gilds Etna 's front serene , While subtle fires deep on her entrails prey ; Even such his outward calm ! He stands the shock So firm , his own strength may , I fear , prove fatal . His wakeful mind keeps strict watch o'er his lips ; But , when soft sleep has stolen on his senses ; Nature resumes her claims ; th ' offended monarch Is silent , and the father only speaks . Prince Galitzin Prince Galitzin Should the repentant prince return , how far , Thinkst thou , might he indulge his hopes of pardon ? Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff I dread the czar 's deep-rooted love of justice , Which , ever constant , yields to no temptation ; I dread that stoick firmness of his mind , Which ever bends th ' unwilling heart to duty ; That heroism of soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , And makes him most severe , where most he loves Which separates the sov'reign from the man , And places laws beyond the reach of both . Alexis is his son ; yet e'en for him I tremble , when I think of hapless Julia ! Prince Galitzin Prince Galitzin I knew her , ere I had departed last On distant service . Of her woes the tale Imperfect reach 'd me . Therefore , I beseech thee To state how fell the ill-starr 'd maid ? Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff " She bloom 'd The fairest flower , that ever grac 'd a palace , Belov 'd , ador 'd by all , most fondly cherish 'd By our great sov'reign , and his royal consort . She stain 'd her virtues with a dreadful crime , Which made her life a forfeit to the laws . The court , the city , those whom her perfections Had rack 'd with envy , join 'd to mourn her fate . The nobles all entreated ; weeping virgins , Companions of her youth , all pray 'd ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd forgiveness ; A pleader , yet more powerful , was found In Peter 's breast . He wept ... yes , Peter wept ! He press 'd th ' unhappy culprit to his bosom , He hung on her as on his long-lov 'd child ; Great in all things , he e'en in deep-felt grief Surpass 'd mankind ; yet , matchless fortitude ! Remain 'd to justice true . " I have no power To pardon ; " saying this , he kiss 'd her cheek , Bade her adieu , and with averted eyes Resign 'd her to her doom . " Prince Galitzin Prince Galitzin " O , what a man " ! Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff " This is not all . When pale disease has brought Life to its lowest ebb ; the human mind Subdued by bodily weakness , passive yields To the religious horror , and resists No longer , superstition 's awful sway : Even such was Peter 's recent state . Exhausted He lay , while th ' elders of our grecian church , Shrouded in mystick pomp , beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mercy , Which might propitiate heav'n , by giving freedom To malefactors . Here a sudden ray Of supernatural light illum 'd his visage . New life was breath 'd into his frame . He rose Majestick from his couch , and casting round His eagle eye , which fix 'd us in mute wonder , He thus in solemn strain pour 'd out his soul : Ne'er shall the blood-stain 'd murderer range my empire Unpunish 'd ! Of this scourge the quick destruction Is my best hope , my surest claim on heaven For mercy " ! Prince Galitzin Prince Galitzin " There spoke Peter ; still unconquer 'd , His mind unerring soars in destin 'd track , Discerning still where mercy 's cruelty , And where severity is kindness . Yet " Methinks , the father would prevail , and work The son 's forgiveness . Thou remember'st well The emperor 's factious sister , proud Sophia : Great was her crime , yet did he pardon her . Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff She shar 'd his crown and pow'r , and was not held In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hope , unless the czar should think His person only ... as a man and parent , Not as connected with the state ... was outrag 'd . Enter Alexis , not recognized . Whence is this bold intrusion ? Alexis Alexis , discovering himself . Chide me not ! But aid me how to bear a father 's wrath ! Behold Alexis penitent , return 'd T ' atone for past misdeeds ; to live forgiven , Or die unbless 'd ! Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff Unhappy prince ! Alexis . Alexis E'en death I could brave sooner , than the piercing glance Of his resentful eye . Yet I must see him , Must throw this guilty body at his feet . Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff Much it rejoiceth me to see thee here . To reconcile thee to thy royal father Is my fond wish and duty . Publick weal Requires it : for , his grief and malady , Made hopeless else , would prejudice the state . Yet I have fears , trust me , no idle fears ; For ' t is a crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens ! am I then so hateful grown ? It must be so . My conscience whispers loud , I have distress 'd , transfix 'd his noble heart . ' T is therefore to restore his peace and health , I bring me here a willing sacrifice . Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff Ill-fated youth ! from what a height thou ' rt fallen ? E'en from that eminence , whence thou couldst view A rising world , preparing to receive Thy laws . Second thou stoodst in its creation ; Yet principal in giving its new form The finish 'd brightness . Thy great father was Himself thy guide . ' T was the meridian sun , Whose faithful light thou never couldst mistake ! He led thee through the labyrinth of state ; Shew 'd where lay dangers  --  how they might be shunn 'd ; He pointed where , of access difficult , Dwelt spotless glory , and taught , how to gain her : Explain 'd the mystick process , which can change Barbarian into man ; with politicks Blend private virtue , and produce ... a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guiding the fiery steeds of car despotick . Alexis . Alexis Oh , drive not back the current of my thoughts ! To tell me what I was would give reproof Its keenest edge , and make me doubly wretched . Thou'dst point the heaven , which I have forfeited , And the profound abyss , to which I fell , Like Satan , fell  --  Like Satan ? nay , much worse ; He was a hero , when with me compar 'd . Ambition ruin 'd him ; I was undone By folly , by caprice , by causeless disaffection . Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff Say then thou wert a patient , who , unconscious , Hugs his distempers to his bosom , still Loathing all medicine . But now , thou know'st Thy malady , thy cure is render 'd easy . Confession is the sure sign of repentance . Prince Galitzin Prince Galitzin Despair not , prince ! thy father will relent . Alexis . Alexis Bless 'd be the tongue , that cheers my drooping soul ! A wretch , condemn 'd to perish on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is with me . Suspense is torture , cruelty refin 'd ... I 'll know the worst . Therefore I pray you , friends , Straight bring me to my father ! Prince Galitzin Prince Galitzin ' T would look well . Impatience to return to duty would Be gracious in his eyes . It should be done . Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff His wearied frame , in gentle slumbers laid , From care 's invasion must be guarded now . To-morrow  --  Alexis . Alexis Hold ! shall strangers watch his couch , And I away ? Mine be that sacred task . These eyes shall close not through the live-long night : With filial , tender care I 'll chase away All harm ; no noisy insect shall disturb His precious rest . I will peruse his features , While sleep spreads over them a summer 's calm : For soon a storm , rais 'd by a wayward son , May fret and hide them from my sight forever : I 'll steal this only chance to gaze with joy On my lov 'd parent 's form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful judge . T ' increase the agony of expectation By one whole night 's removal from the hour Of certainty , would break my heart ! Delay not ! Grant , I beseech you , my request ! Dismiss The menials ! Let the son attend his father ! Mentzikoff . Prince Mentzikoff My prince , thy wishes shall be gratified . exeunt . SCENE II . Peter sleeping on a couch . Enter Mentzikoff , with Alexis ; points in silence to the couch , and exit . Alexis Alexis , in a low voice . My heart misgives me , and impels me back ; I dare not seek a parent 's couch ; that couch To which , in times past , I with joy repair 'd : ' T is my unworthiness , that checks me thus . Repentance , balm of wounded conscience , come ! Come , filial piety , inspire me now With courage !  --  I 'll advance , with noiseless step . approaches the couch .

How quickly can thy magick wand transform The fairest objects into hideous sights ! Pervert the lovely face of smiling nature ; And turn our joys , our hopes , our sweetest hours , To grief , despair , and years of bitterness ! Hark ! hark ! he stirs ! he speaks ! Peter Peter the Great , dreaming . My son ! my son ! Alexis . Alexis O extasy of sound ! he loves me still ! Peter Peter the Great , waking . ' T was but a dream . Alexis falls back . I see him not . Why should Such visions mock me , when reality Makes disappointment doubly keen ! I 'll sleep ; I 'll close my eyes again , and court the vision , Which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gives me my son such as he was ... the prop , The hope , the joy , and solace of my days , The object of my cares , increasing daily Yet bringing with each hour some new delight .

It suits not my great station to indulge My heart 's desires at the expense of duty . He that ascends the throne , resigns all claims Of common man . He must inflict the blow , Thought it may crush himself : Must live for others , And in self-sacrifice shew most his power . Shall I now pause for an ungrateful son ? Let me not call him son ! For this would shew Him nearest to my heart , and so , most guilty . I 'll pluck the viper thence for ever ! my curses ... Alexis Alexis , discovering himself . Forbear , dread sire ! Kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Peter Peter the Great , much agitated . Avaunt , degen'rate wretch ! whence cam'st thou ? Hence ! Blast not my sight with thy ungracious form ! Alexis . Alexis Inflict on me the sharpest misery ! Smite me in all the fulness of thy wrath ! Tread on me ! crush me , as a venomous reptile ! Make me the theme of universal scorn , A dreadful warning to unnatural children ! All this and more with patience I 'll endure ! But oh ! deny me not thy royal presence ! Let not the beams of thy most gracious countenance Withdraw from me their soul-reviving light ! Peter . Peter the Great Away ! Hide thee in foreign climes ! there seek That comfort , which thou wouldst not taste at home ! Go , profligate ! and to thy parent 's arms Prefer the cold embrace and cheerless fare , The looks mistrustful , and reluctant hand Of strangers , grown impatient of thy burthen !

Alexis And willingly I yield me to its power . To me the greatest pain is thy displeasure ; To this cold earth I 'll cling , until in pity She gives me refuge in the friendly grave ... Or I feel death no longer in thy frowns ! Here will I ceaseless still invoke the heavens , The kinder stars , and all propitious powers , To plead my cause before an injur 'd father ! I ask not now to live ; I ask to die In peace with thee . I 've sinn 'd beyond forgiveness : Yet , sire , reflect ! scarcely a third has pass 'd Of that existence , which unworthily I hold from thee . The greatest part remains . Oh ! were it sav 'd , I 'd hail it as the means A short-liv 'd disobedience to repay , By a more lasting , more extended duty . Peter Peter the Great , much moved . Be still , thou lab'ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail o'er softer ! aside . Alexis Alexis , seizing his hand . Avert not so thine eyes ! Frown not , my father ! Relent ! relent ! yield to the voice of nature ! Receive me to thy arms , and all my thoughts Shall henceforth dwell in thee ! my soul , reclaim 'd , Shall harbour nought , but thy respected image ! Be glorious in being conquer 'd thus ! Ah me ! I plead in vain . Once more then , ere my doom Is fix 'd , let me attend thy couch ; let me Be rooted there , in expectation mute , Till sleep has charm 'd away thy anger , till Thy lips once more have bless 'd me with the sound Of thy not yet extinguish 'd love ! Peter Peter the Great , quite overcome . My son ! sinks gently into Alexis ' arms . END OF THE FIRST ACT . ACT II . SCENE I.  --  Interior of a Convent . Father Confessor , solus . Confessor . Father Confessor The prince return 'd , and by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my hopes ! Must I then tamely see the emperor 's minions , False to their oaths , to their own sacred order , Assist him to unveil the people 's eyes ; And so reduce the power of the church ? Shall one of these apostates , worthless , impious , Place on his head the patriarchal mitre , Now vacant ; and I still , with aking eyes . Behold it vanish from my eager grasp ? Rather I 'd move heaven , earth , and hell itself  --  But , hold ! Despair is my worst foe : Alexis May still ... nay , shall be yet reclaim 'd . His mind , Like heated wax , yields quick to each impression ; His judgment , warp 'd from infancy , dares not Confide in its own strength . I still must guide it , I 'm his soul 's counsel , guardian of his conscience : I know , where lies each spring , that moves his heart ; Where love , where each blind passion dwells ; and can , With one touch , bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peerless beauty of the court , She too deems me her soul 's physician . ... He Adores her  --  That 's enough ! So rich in means , Methinks , I can not fail . Enter Ksenia . Thou'rt welcome , daughter ! Ksenia . Ksenia Thy blessing , reverend father ! weighty matter Has brought me hither : well thou know'st , Alexis Has pledg 'd his faith and hand to me . His sire Would have him wed a foreign royal maid ; But the young prince , true to his vow , more fearful To lose his love , than bear his father 's anger , Would fain by holy marriage make me his . Perplex 'd in doubt , I come to crave thy sage Advice ! Confessor Father Confessor , after a pause . Has Ksenia strength to meet his wishes ? Ksenia . Ksenia Where inclination leads , strength can not fail . Confessor . Father Confessor I understand thee , and will aid thy union ... Yet , there 's a bar , which , if not first remov 'd , Thou pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the demon of unruly passion Urge thee with fatal rashness to o'erleap it . Ksenia . Ksenia Thy words import some mystery , which appals My boding soul , yet goads it on to knowledge . Confessor . Father Confessor Know then , thou canst not safely wed the prince , Unless his erring , lost soul bereclaim 'd From sin  --  from heresy , the worst of sins . Ksenia . Ksenia What do I hear ! the prince a heretick !  --  Confessor . Father Confessor ' T is sin to doubt it . Ksenia . Ksenia O , forgive me , father ! But how , in word or thought , has he prov 'd such ? What deeds , what actions have proclaim 'd him thus ? Confessor . Father Confessor What deeds , what actions ? Thou art lost already ! For , blind and deaf , thou seest not day 's broad light , Nor hear'st the roaring cataract 's loud voice . Ksenia . Ksenia O say not so ! I hope I 'm not yet lost . Confessor . Father Confessor To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ksenia . Ksenia I will do so . Yet fain would I be told , In what my prince swerv 'd from our holy faith ? Confessor . Father Confessor In all ! in every thing !  --  Has not his sire With impious step invaded all our temples ? Trod on religion 's rights divine ? Profan 'd , With touch impure , all that our church holds sacred , And with th ' unhallow 'd breath of mock reform Swept off all dear remembrance of our fathers ? Our convents , holy places of devotion , Are now reduc 'd to abject poverty ; Threaten 'd even from the consecrated ground , On which they stand , to be eras 'd . Donations Of pious charity are from the church Transferr 'd to wicked uses of the state . War 's standard waves , where stood our savious 's cross . The sacred bell , which spoke the hour of prayer , Transform 'd into the fiery mouth of battle , Proclaims now hungry slaughter 's bloody feast . And this the prince had vow 'd to check ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father liv 'd . Warm in heaven 's cause , he e'en abjur 'd his sire , And just were his resolves . But , recreant now , Seduc 'd by evil spirit , he resigns The glorious splendour of th ' immortal crown ; Covets the earthly sway ; and with his father Is leagu 'd in heresy , to persecute Our true and holy faith . Ksenia . Ksenia Lost prince ! lost Ksenia ! Confessor . Father Confessor A heretick , he never can be thine : Yet think , how glorious is thy destiny , How happy to thyself , to save a prince ... To save a people from perdition sure : A voice within me whispers , thou art call 'd To do this task , which angels well might envy . Ksenia . Ksenia O that I might ! Confessor . Father Confessor Thou may'st , and shalt perform it . Remember , God disdains not humble organs . All means are just , which serve t ' advance his glory . Employ then all thy sighs , thy tears , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No art I need , Nature perforce , will have me sigh and weep ; My bleeding heart will labour in my visage : If all should fail , I 'll bid the world farewell . Within the dreary walls , where mourns Eudocia , The prince 's mother , shall my virgin state Unchang 'd pass to the grave . Confessor . Father Confessor ' T is better far To pine within a convent 's gloomy cell , Than on the throne be plac 'd by impious hands .  --  The prince will soon be here ; retire my daughter ; Strengthen thy mind , and be prepar 'd to meet him . Exit Ksenia , much affected ; Confessor looking with malignant exultation . She 's mine ! ... Would that the prince were so ! why doubt it ? Religion 's spurious sister , of her rights Usurper bold , engendered in darkness To mock heaven 's light , O mighty Superstition ! Where is the heart , that , once caught in thy toils , Can e'er escape ? where is that boastful nation , That has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole To pole , has groan 'd beneath thy giant foot ! From Africk 's burning sands , to Asia 's point , Where Winter ever reigns , and checks relentless The breath of life  --  prolifick swarm thy slaves ! Thou nodd'st thy sable crest ... and the huge globe Is drench 'd with seas of human blood . Thou bidd'st ... And brother springs in arms ' gainst brother ; sister Denounces sister ; and the tender mother , Fiercer than tygress , on her offspring preys . Obedient to thy call , dire discord shakes The world , and slaughter grim bestrides the ocean . Assassination , murder , parricide , And crimes more horrible , if such be found , Ordain 'd by thee , are just and holy deeds ! Thee , power resistless , I invoke ! my cause Is thine . A mortal king unceasing labours Thy altars to destroy , and of thy worship Disperse , with reason 's torch , the imposing gloom . Revenge thee , through his son , who serves thee still . Call love , almighty love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then lift me To the proud eminence , my soul 's desire ; And I 'll restore thy shatter 'd temples , bind This empire faster in thy chains ; and fix , The son undoing what the father did , Firmer than e'er , thy priesthood 's ancient rule ! Enter Alexis . Whence comes it , prince , for well I know thy purpose , That , heedless of thy father 's late displeasure , Thou holdly would'st encounter it again ? Think'st , he will smile on thy clandestine union ? Alexis . Alexis Question me not so near !  --  Dread tyrant love Urges me on , usurps the seat of reason , Controls my will , and stops the voice of duty . But few hours back , while yet my fate was wrapt In painful doubt , I vow 'd to banish love . A rash and vain attempt , with rigour punish 'd : I still might for a while have brav 'd its power , Had not my sire propos 'd another wife  --  Another ! no ! never ! ... Ksenia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure of thee ! aside . Alexis . Alexis I knew my sire Would not consent : yet , to part with my Ksenia , Would be to part with soul and life : besides , Her shining virtues might grace any throne . They once being known , he will with open arms Receive her , and will glory in my choice . For ' t is his boast to seek for modest virtue , Even in the humblest lot ; and , when ' t is found , To raise it to a high and worthier station . Think of prince Mentzikoff : low was his state , Yet how exalted now ! and justly too . Think of th ' imperial Catherine , whose deserts I own with bleeding heart , since she now fills The rightful place of my still-living mother : He , that admitted a poor soldier 's widow To share his throne , will sure forgive his son For loving one of less ignoble birth , Equal in worth of mind . Confessor . Father Confessor Dream on , young man ! Thou'rt more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexis . Alexis I swear , This one offence shall be my last . No more Shall I rebel against my father 's will ; Let him but ratify my bond with Ksenia , And , happy in his smiles , bent to his wishes , I 'll live for him alone . Confessor Father Confessor , sternly . Degenerate prince ! For him , said'st thou ? not for thy God and country ? Alexis . Alexis In serving him , I serve them both . Confessor . Father Confessor Shame ! shame ! O ! that I should have liv 'd to see thee thus Fall'n from all grace , lost in perdition 's gulf ! That thou , on whom I built the state 's salvation , To whom the church , oppress 'd , look 'd for defence , Religion for support , shold'st blast at once These fondly cherish 'd hopes ! O ! rather let me Pluck one by one my silver 'd hair , tear off My aged flesh , scatter my limbs in air , Than see thee ... thee , whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Alexis . Alexis Forbid it , heaven ! Tell me ; Explain , in what have I so deeply sinn 'd ? Confessor . Father Confessor In what ? ... can not thy conscience answer thee ? Or must I act the part of thy accuser ? I , who more gladly would accuse myself ! Alexis . Alexis If't be a crime to have renew 'd my duty To him , who gave me life ! ... I am most guilty . Confessor . Father Confessor The life he gave , he takes away : nay , worse ; For transient boon , he bids thee sacrifice Even thy soul . He stands ' twixt thee and heaven . Him then , who is thy God , thou must renounce , Or of thy earthly father think no more ! Alexis . Alexis Awful alternative ! Confessor . Father Confessor Dost hesitate ? Alexis . Alexis I doubt the urgency of sacrifice . Confessor . Father Confessor Go then , deprav 'd , lost youth ! Enjoy thy work ! Feast thy eye on thy country 's woe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerable fabrick ! In this land Plant fruitful heresy , whose wide-spread roots Shall stifle soon the growth of true religion ! Destroy all pious zeal , and of devotion Remove what yet remains sound , undefil 'd ! Plunge deep in atheism 's bewild'ring mazes ! Riot in sin ! exult in thy own ruin ! Behold , without remorse , the noble race Of Sclavia 's sons chang 'd into servile apes : From sturdy heroes sunk to beardless boys ; Condemn 'd to breathe , instead of sacred incense , The nauseous vapour of a pois'nous herb , The cursed growth of climes no less accurs 'd . Alexis . Alexis Methinks , my sire is too severely judg 'd : His innovations aim not at religion , But tend to strengthen it with reason 's aid : Nor do they wrong our glorious ancestors : But , keeping pace with our improv 'd condition , They add to their renown , increasing ours . Reform , in his skill 'd hand , with aim unerring Strikes safe at prejudice ; but touches not What 's truly sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us their treasures , Appears to me a blessing , not a curse ; For by such intercourse , the human race Become one family . Confessor . Father Confessor Perish the thought ! Shall turk with christian feed ? shall heretick , Apostate , e'er associate with the true Believer ? No ! Abjure this blasphemy ! Spurn this fruit of thy sire 's infectious doctrine , Pollution can not dwell with purity , Nor sin with righteousness . Like death and life , Like night and day , like hell and heav'n , they ne'er Can be together . Alexis . Alexis Ill it suits my years T ' oppose their inexperience to thy wisdom . Confessor . Father Confessor Remember thou hast vow 'd , in face of heav'n , T ' uphold its sacred cause ; nay , to renounce Thy sire ! Dost thou not justly dread the malice Of stars , invok 'd by thee ? Dost thou not fear The vengeance swift of the insulted powers , Which have been call 'd to ratify thy oath ? Alexis . Alexis A subtle horror from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perjury To break a guilty oath ? Confessor . Father Confessor Bold , impious youth ! Methinks , the very earth , on which thou stand'st , With horror trembles at thy words . Heav'n frowns Portentous ! And lo ! from its lab'ring womb , The flaming bolt seems bursting o'er thy head ! Even the air around thee is infectious ; I 'll shun it ! Far hence , to some lone desert , Yet unpolluted by the breath of man , I will commit this aged frame , till death . Alexis . Alexis Stay father , stay ! ... sure at my sire 's demise I may redeem the pledge I 've giv'n ; and yet Not fail in that , which to himself I owe . Confessor . Father Confessor To do well , thou must do it now , or never . ' T is not by starts , by future promises ; Delay is crime ; ' t is by incessant labour That we can rightly serve the cause of God .

' T is man that errs , not God . Who trust their reason , Though wise and great , e'en like thy sire , miss truth . But we by heaven 's faithful light are guided ; We can not err . Alexis . Alexis O my beloved father ! Confessor . Father Confessor Wilt thou still cling to him ? Must I remind thee , Since thy soul 's on filial duty bent , There yet lives one , who ought to share that duty ? Thy mother lives yet  --  Alexis . Alexis Oh ! Confessor .

Confessor . Father Confessor Time favours thee . Thou'rt well prepar 'd to woo her ! For thou canst move thy suit with mighty gifts  --  With curses , which are now thy growing riches . exit . Alexis Alexis , solus . Contending passions rage within my breast . Thoughts roll on thoughts , like madd'ning waves , and leave No resting-place for reason ... Mother ! Heaven ! My country ! rise in terrible array Against my sire ! There needs but Ksenia 's name To make this triple league past all resistance .

Were my love less ardent , Thine less sincere , ' t were better for us ... but ... Alexis . Alexis Kill me not , Ksenia , with this formal chillness ! Love brooks it not , but warmer language speaks . Ksenia . Ksenia Doubt me not , prince ! Thou art my joy ! my life ! My world ... Thou art most deat to me ; so dear , I prize but one gem higher .

SCENE I.  --  Moonlight night . Peter , Peter the Great solus and incog . A sober calm pervades the world . All nature Is hush 'd in deep repose , the pleasing emblem Of peace , a welcome stranger to my breast . The tide of health pours copious through my veins ; For I am happy : and ' t is happiness That gives us health , when all resource has fail 'd . Yon planet , silver-clad , whose influence sweet I have not felt so long , with steady lustre , Yet gay beyond her custom , seems to smile , As if she too regain 'd a long-lost son . I hail thee , chaste and peerless gem of night ! Pride of the starry host ! Shine on , propitious ! A monarch well may view in thee his image ! For , as thou tak'st thy light from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth ; So he receives all bounty from above T ' enrich the people to his sway subjected . This is the great reward of all my cares , Of dangers , toilsome days , and sleepless nights : This is the wish'd-for height of my ambition . Exalted ' bove the rest , my thoughts and deeds Should be my chief distinction ; else , ' t were best To languish in a humble sphere .  --  In me All duties are combin 'd . Now I must act A master , now a father ! Oh ! this last Pays of itself . ' T is a most grateful office , And brooks not rest , when all my children sleep . The scarcely-form 'd machine of this young state Requires a dragon 's vigilance ; each spring Must move beneath my own inspecting eye .

Iwan . Iwan Wherefore this question ? Peter . Peter the Great I meant no offence . Iwan , Iwan eyeing him with suspicion . If so , answer me first : Say , who art thou ? Peter . Peter the Great Plain-dealing man : The son of liberty , That feeds on nature 's lap ; supplies defects Of law and justice ; knows , without their aid , T ' inforce his rights ; nor stays at home , scar 'd by The midnight ghost ; holds fortune in his reins , Whips the blind jade into straight course ; and , like Th ' industrious bee , takes honey where he can .

Peter . Peter the Great So warm !  --  Can we not rob a heretick ? Iwan .

If we are his subjects , We have a right t ' exact from him relief . Besides , whate'er we take , we take our own ; For ' t is from us , among the rest , that he Extorts his wealth , and on our life-blood thrives . Iwan .

Iwan . Iwan Keep watch Below , while I ascend to yonder window : We must examine well , before we strike . Ascends the window by means of iron gloves . Peter . Peter the Great I can not treat this man as an offender . He may , and shall be , usefully employ 'd . Truth , valour , prudence , mark him for a soldier .

Peter the Great Thou needest not a lie , For he , that sends thee , is the czar himself ! discovers himself : Iwan Iwan falls at his feet . O mercy ! mercy ! spare the guilty man ! Peter .

SCENE I.  --  The Convent . Confessor and Ksenia . Confessor . Father Confessor The fiends of darkness triumph . Sin prevails ; And heresy , exulting , rears her front . The evil genius of the czar defeats Our pious wishes , and our sacred hopes . The spectre of destruction hovers near . A massy rock seems tott'ring o'er our heads , And one word from Alexis hurls on us The crushing weight of the impending ruin . Ksenia . Ksenia Wherefore these fears ? The prince will not betray . Confessor . Father Confessor The fugitive ingredients of his soul Are thrown with each alternate gust of passion , Chief with the breath of fear , into commotion . As well we might the structure of our hopes Rest on Arabia 's fleeting sands . Decision  --  Decision , prompt and firm , alone can save us . Ksenia . Ksenia The worst is but to die ; and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crime of death , not death itself . Self-preservation is a law with all : But , when connected with the publick good , It then becomes a duty , doubly sacred . If God requir 'd our lives , the sacrifice Should be our glory : but , when sin demands them , Resistance ... efforts to preserve that life , Are virtue 's noblest proof . My own career Is not yet finish 'd , thine scarce yet begun ; And , in our death , religion would sustain A heavy loss . ' T is then a crime to die , When we can save ourselves , and live yet useful . Ksenia . Ksenia I dare do all that virtue strict will sanction . Confessor . Father Confessor The time admits not of a dubious pause ; In desp'rate cases , desp'rate means are lawful . Wert thou inspir 'd like me , a prospect bright Would rise before thy eyes , the rich reward Of one bold effort :  --  heresy destroy 'd  --  Thy friends in pow'r  --  thy princely husband sav 'd  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these not worth a trifling risk !  --  Kesenia . Ksenia O ! teach me How to obtain them ! There 's no sacrifice Too great ... no danger , which I would not tempt , When such is the blest promise of success . Confessor . Father Confessor Attend then to my words ! Let each be weigh 'd In thy mind 's balance ! and may due conviction Reach thy converted heart ! Last night , when scarce My eyes were clos 'd , a solemn voice , unknown , Pronounc 'd my name . " Awake ! arise ! " it said ; I started ! and beheld a form seraphick , Of heav'nly radiance , bending o'er my couch . Entranc 'd , o'eraw 'd , enchain 'd in wonder mute , I had no sense but that of hearing left . All faculties , save mem'ry , were suspended , While thus impressive spoke the dazzling vision : " The prince has fail 'd , his life must pay the forfeit . Else he must yield his friends to vengeance dire , Deneunc 'd against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare of the church , And your own safety . Let a well-feign 'd tale , From both your tongues , prevent his dread confession , So fatal to yourselves ! Accuse conjointly The impious Theodosius of the crime Of being the chief adviser of Alekis . Avow the prince 's marriage , and lay boldly ' Its whole contrivance to the intriguing prelate . Thus heaven in its wrath will smite th ' apostate , While Ksenia 's evidence insures her pardon : The prince , no more forc 'd to betray his friends , Will to his rightful station be restor 'd : The czar , his present object being obtain 'd , In taking back a son , will take a daughter , Unclaim 'd , unknown yet , to his arms : thyself , No longer check 'd by the opposing bishop , Will have most ample means , in season fit , To benefit religion 's sacred cause .

Ksenia Most wond'rously indeed ! yet much I fear , This may be some malicious , dark temptation ; The bishop 's innocence . ... Confessor . Father Confessor Presumptuous woman ! Forbear ! A heretick , and innocent ! Impossible ! Heaven decrees his fall , And heav'n 's decrees are just ! Banish these doubts , And learn , how its dispensing pow'r , mysterious , Oft inflicts punishment , when none seems due ; Bestows reward , which seems but ill deserv 'd ; And from the very source , which threaten 'd ruin , Draws happiness . And shall we hesitate ? Shall we , with scrup'lous nicety , receive The will of God ? Horrid presumption ! ... No ! We must obey ! and light is that obedience , Which pays us ev'n beyond the prize expected . Ksenia . Ksenia Will the prince give his sanction to the scheme , Which else must fail ? Confessor . Father Confessor Doubt not , the pow'r , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not being suspected yet , thou may'st obtain Admittance to Alexis . Let him know All that has pass 'd , all we 've resolv 'd , obedient To heav'n 's command .

The many original pieces which his majesty published concerning the history of this unfortunate son , the frank and generous assurance with which he lays his own conduct before the impartial world , are incontestable proofs that he had nothing to reproach himself with in this remarkable event . The noble acts of clemency he had shewn to persons infinitely less dear , and the great pains he had evidently taken to reclaim this unworthy heir , can not but convince us that it was a necessary piece of severity when he gave him up to be tried as a criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be cruel to a child against whom he was unwilling to be strictly just . And so much as this being manifest , it can certainly be no impeachment of the character of a legislator , that he preferred the interest of an empire , for which he had so often hazarded his life , for which he had laboured incessantly near 30 years , to the safety of a son who had conspired to dethrone him , and to disconcert the whole system he had so long been forming . " This shews that among those who took the trouble of informing themselves , there was but one opinion on the conduct of Peter towards his son . Even Voltaire , though checked by the malignant influence of the king of Prussia ,  --  who conjured up every shadow , that racked imagination could throw on bright innocence , can not refrain from observing : " If the czar had poisoned his son , as so many writers have asserted , this would have deprived him of the advantage of all he had been doing , during the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right he had to punish ; it would have brought a suspicion on the motives of the sentence , and would have been condemning himself . If he had resolved on Alexis 's death , he would have caused the sentence to have been executed . Was it not entirely in his power ? Can a prudent person , a monarch who had attracted the eyes of all the world , bring himself basely to poison one , whom he has a right to cut off with the sword of justice ? Would he suffer his name to be transmitted to posterity with the horrid reputation of a parricide , when he might so easily have brought himself off only as a rigorous judge ?
