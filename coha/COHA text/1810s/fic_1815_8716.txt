Que fera gens hominum , quiere hune tam barbara morem permetit Patria ? Virg . To JOHN TRUMBULL , Esq . OF HARTFORD . My dear Friend , The extraordinary success with which the following Tragedy has been attended in the representation , and the circumstance of our having been jointly concerned in writing the Prologue and Epilogue , make an apology unnecessary for my inscribing it to you . If the public , in judging my writings , has acted the part of a generous patron , rather than of a rigid critic , this candid public ought to be informed how much it is owing to you , that my performances are not still less worthy of its patronage . It is my boast , that we formed our taste together , and on the same models , Although you preceded me somewhat , in your classical studies ; yet no sooner had we seen each other at the place of our education , than ( as I think I may be allowed to flatter myself ) a certain similarity of genius , and congeniality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship . We shall not be accused of having neglected real business for poetical recreations . Had not the tumultuous scenes , which commenced with the late war , separated our little society , we might perhaps have innocently indulged ourselves considerably more in literary speculations , than the circumstances have since permited . It is a consolation that the occasion or tendency of our performances have conciliated the minds of our Countrymen to receive them with favour . I will not offend your delicacy by entering into a detail of the merits of your writings , But I wish you would realise , that , with such talents , erudition , and critical knowledge as you possess , the present age and posterity have a kind of claim upon you , for such farther monuments of genius as your avocations may allow you to furnish . I am , my dear Sir , With the most affectionate sentiments , Your sincere Friend , and Humble Servant , DAVID HUMPHREYS . New-York , August 4 , 1790 . PROLOGUE . Spoken by Mr. HALLAM . The Gallic muse , this night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lands prevail ; Displays the widow 'd fair a sacrifice , And draws compassion 's drops from melting eyes , Oh ! if your hearts have ever learn 'd to feel , Let sweet compassion o'er your bosoms steal ; Believe the plot , from Eastern story , true , Believe the shores of Malabar ye view . The haughty Bramin , with imperious smile , Propels the fair-one to the fun'ral pile : There  --  see her mounting , with retorted eyes , And hear , ' midst bursting flames , her dying cries . Such tragic strains the nobles charms dispense , To purge the passions , and refine the sense : Each virtuous tear confers a new-born grace , And adds fresh beauty to the fairest face .  --  Oh ! born to bless , and meliorate mankind , With manners winning , and with taste refin 'd , What wrongs , ye fair ! your gentle bosoms bore , In each rude age  --  on ev'ry barb'rous shore ! Doom 'd the mean vassals of unfeeling lords , By Western Savages , and Tartar hords ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks the fairest of their sex for slaves : Hearts form 'd for love , but doom 'd in vain to glow In prison 'd pomp , and weep in splendid woe :  --  Or see their fate in India more severe , The sad companions of a husband 's bier !  --  Not such their doom , where genial science shines , And Heav'n-born freedom , human souls refines ; Where polish 'd manners social life improve , And teach us to respect the sex we love ; Confirm their claims in equal rights to share , Friends in our bliss , and partners in our care :  --  And hail , ye fair , of ev'ry charm possess 'd  --  Who grace this rising empire of the West ; With better fates , and nobler genius born , Your sex to honour , and your land adorn ; In this blest age , to share our fond regard , The friends of heroes , and their blest reward !  --  Yet when o'er foreign woes ye shed a tear , And find your bliss by contrast still more dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which fix 'd your birth in this auspicious land ! Ye gen'rous patrons who protect our stage , Friends to the arts , and guardians of the age ; To tragic woes now lend the list'ning ear , Attend with candour , with indulgence hear ! While we display , in pleading nature 's cause , Our best attempts to merit your applause !  --  PERSONS . Lanissa Widow of Malabar Mrs. Henry . Fatima her friend Miss Tuke .

The Scene is in the Portico of a Pagod , in the suburbs of a maritime Town on the Coast of Malabar . The High Priest .  --  Young Bramin.  --  Bramin . High Priest .

High Priest .  --  Young Bramin . High Priest . High Preist ' T is you , young man , Who must conduct the awful pomp of death . Young Bramin . Young Bramin What then ! is this a time , while Europe 's bands , Invade our country with unnumber 'd ships , And hurl their bursting thunders at our walls : Is this a time , amidst alarms and deaths , To give a spectacle more cruel far , To light new fun'ral fires  --  our shame ! our scourge ! Can we unmov 'd , behold the victim burn ; Should we not rather snatch her from the flames ? Her husband died far off , nor , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul Hovers between two worlds , did he demand Such proof of her affection  --  then the fair , Dissolv 'd in all the extacy of grief , And prompt to shun the tediousness of life , Might deem it bliss to die with him she lov 'd . High Priest . High Preist What matters it , if dying he receiv 'd No oath that she would follow him in death . Think you , descended from such noble blood , She can dispose of life just as she wills ? E'en now her friends require the sacrifice  --  And what a stigma , would refusal cast On all her kindred ! how pollute her name ; And make her thus a slave , in grief of soul , And steep 'd in tears  --  the scorn of gods and men ! Curse the long horrors of a constant death . Young Bramin . Young Bramin But Father ! cruel is poor woman 's fate , No choice is left , but infamy or death ; Is it not barb'rous in a land like this , Where woman has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband pow'r ! To leave his wife , confign 'd beyond his death , For heirs to immolate upon his tomb ! Then must she die , or lead a hated life , Stripp 'd of maternal rights  --  The sons forgetting , A mother dies to deck a father 's ashes !  --  High Priest . High Preist Know'st thou , young man , that custom 's iron rod , Rules ev'ry land , and sanctifies their laws ? One country gives the father right to fix , For life or death , his children 's destiny :  --  One makes the son a pious paracide , Soon as the authors of his life grow old .  --  In Afric , men , like beasts , are bought and sold :  --  The Courtiers in Japan , die with their Kings :  --  The Sultan strangles all his nearest kindred :  --  And e'en in Europe , where such light prevails , A foreign sense of honour , for one word , Oft makes the best friends shed each others blood ! Young Bramin . Young Bramin So must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allume the fun'ral fire ! Ah , must our fair-ones , slaves to barb'rous men , Slaves to their husbands e'en beyond their lives , Bound with such chains , as death can never break , Must they in vain thus raise their plaintive cry : " Ah ! cruel Lords of this creation , see ; How weak , how full of woes , our sex is form 'd ; Is it for you , exempt from many ills , Which we must bear  --  is it for you , instead Of light'ning much our load , to add new weight To nature 's heavy yoke ! ' T is you who give us Slavery and death !  --  " High Priest . High Preist Young man , what horrid language ! Dost thou renounce , thy nation and religion ? Oh shocking blasphemy ! say , wilt thou then , That woman , made for us , shall have her rights ? Dost thou defend , that foreign prejudice ? Wives owe their husbands all they have  --  their lives  --  And in their widow 'd state they covet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In torrid climes all things are in extremes ! Wilt thou , who know'st our rites , bewail their fate ! And yet thou know'st what voluntary ills , Our Priests and Faquirs brave  --  what glorious palms They win  --  and how , without a groan or sigh , They stifle nature as they conquer pain .  --  Young Bramin Young Bramin At least , they , suff'ring by their own accord , Do not deplore their pain or wish for pity . But tyrant honor here pursues the sex To death .  --  Pardon my weakness  --  but I thought , The real woes of life were quite enough , Without our adding more :  --  Of good and ill Th ' inexplicable laws of nature mix Each creature 's portion  --  yet from worm to man , Instinct directs them to self-preservation  --  How strange that man alone , throughout all nature , Should lift his murd'rous hand against his life , As if he spurn 'd the gift of fav'ring Gods .  --  And do those awful pow'rs , whose warning voice Cries in our inmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demand such wanton waste of their best blessings ? Who hates too much himself , loves not his neighbour , And could a righteous Heav'n have made the law , To love all others , and to hate ourselves ? SCENE III . High Priest .  --  Bramin.  --  Young Bramin . High Priest . High Preist Well ! what 's your information ? will this widow Devote herself upon the fun'ral pile ! And has she promis 'd ?  --  Bramin . Bramin Yes , this very day , She means to sacrifice herself  --  her friends Surrounding her unceasing  --  but not long , For when she learnt her loss , she knew her duty ; Our women mostly are too bold or timid : In triumph dancing , or as victims dragg 'd , They mount the burning pile  --  But she , serene , Nor mingled marks of joy with death 's apparel , Nor breath 'd a single sigh , nor seem 'd depress 'd  --  But fix 'd in resolution , though so young , She shews how life sublimely may be lost .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor do I view surpris 'd , Her pious conduct  --  oh , my friends , ' t is well  --  For at this time , while strangers press the siege , And from superior prowess , skill , or fortune , Seem ready to atchieve their dreadful conquest , Let us maintain our sacred fun'ral rites  --  Let us , tho ' conquer 'd , piously maintain them . But will this widow soon be at the temple ? Bramin . Bramin Yes , you will see a great example soon : E'en now the people croud the sacred porch . Young Bramin . Young Bramin Must she be burn 'd ? alas ! how I bewail her .  --  In charms distinguish 'd , and in flow'r of youth , Ah ! how ' t is pitiful to see such courage , Employ 'd to haste her beauties to the tomb , E 're nature had reclaim 'd them  --  hateful custom ! Oh ! what a world is this , where not e'en crimes , And cruelty alone destroy our bliss : But where , by specious names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . Men hear not the mild voice of sympathy , But only strive to persecute each other : Nor all th ' inevitable pangs or plagues That flesh is heir to , can , at least , compare With those which they inflict upon themselves ! High Priest . High Preist Hear thou a diff'rent voice that speaks to thee , What hop'st thou from this world ? is this thy home ? We 're born for woes  --  let us not faint  --  but learn , That patient suff'ring is the proof of virtue . Now hear of Brama the tremenduous voice , " Thy sensibility is sacrilege ! "  --  Young Bramin . Young Bramin Ah , but some other hand might lead the fair .  --  High Priest . High Preist No  --  you were last admitted to our order ; ' T is your 's to lead the victim to the pile , And your 's the honour to confirm her zeal , Go wait my final orders at the porch : The law ordains  --  be humble  --  tho ' you doubt  --  SCENE IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . High Priest . High Preist What urgent business brings you now to us ? Officer . Officer The governor 's commands .  --  High Priest . High Preist Well , what are they ? Officer . Officer He counsels to postpone the sacrifice , Lest from their posts too many troops be drawn , And thus the town be left an easy prey .  --  Besides , you see the temple 's situation , Between the walls and camp , will let our foes Perceive the ceremony :  --  which , he fears , Will greatly irritate European minds !  --  SCENE V. High Priest .  --  Bramins . High Priest . High Preist to the Bramins . Yes !  --  to postpone , what should at once be done ! What then is his design ? And is it thus , He means , if conquer 'd , to preserve our manners ? Well  --  I 'll not trust to his perfidious prudence , But make him instrumental in my plans . Whate'er this timid governor intends , The sacrifice shall never be deferr 'd Onemoment for the siege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by such a sacrifice , Are render 'd more propitious to our cause .  --  Bramin . Bramin This rite omitted , all our rites were vain . High Priest . High Preist Ah , should this rite , first introduc 'd for safety ; Then foster 'd by religion , be abandon 'd , Where shall we stop ? one and another goes , Till not a temple will be left for us.  --  These doctrines stern , and pains extravagant , Astonish , shake , and petrify the souls Of mortals made to venerate the skies , And see in us the delegates of Heav'n . Say , but for these , where were the Bramins ' honours ? Our penance would be deem 'd mistake or madness .  --  Yet when mankind behold to what a length , Enthusiasm in other minds can go , They wonder , tremble , and believe the more ; Thence order springs , and Brama all adore .  --  ACT II . SCENE I. Widow .  --  Fatima . Fatima . Fatima But , Madam ! to what law have you submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanissa Be not surpris 'd ; You , born in Persia , under milder skies , Can scarce conceive the manners of our climes . But Fatima ! the dye for me is cast ,  --  Yon walls and rocks are dark with fun'ral smoke , Others have fallen in their tombs of fire ; Nor can Lanissa from her fate escape .  --  Fatima . Fatima Your woes depress my soul , yet you seem tranquil . Widow . Lanissa My husband 's dead , and calls me from the earth . Fatima . Fatima And can your sorrows quench the love of life ? Or will your husband 's senseless shade be sooth 'd , By this dread off'ring of your fairest days ? Suppose he lov 'd , as much as you lov 'd him , Would he require it ? Widow . Lanissa Oh ! you understand not :  --  Honor 's the tyrant that subdues my soul ! To live contemptible  --  or die in flames  --  I have no other choice  --  that is the law ! Fatima . Fatima ' T is wrong ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's enough .  --  Fatima . Fatima Who made this murd'rous law ? What woman first was mean enough to yield , And mount the bonfire of a barb'rous spouse ? Forsooth ! he claims it  --  but if he survives , Does he destroy himself to honor her ? Ah ! does he guard his faith beyond the grave ? Then , by what right does he survive  --  but that Of having made the law ? The weaker sex Must bear a yoke , men will not bear themselves ! Widow . Lanissa I give up life , since honor thus decrees : Alas ! long since , I gave up happiness ! You see my destiny  --  my boundless grief  --  I ne'er knew aught save mis'ry in this world : Wedlock and widowhood alike were torments ! Fatima . Fatima What heard I ? my surprise exceeds my terror ! You were not happy in your wedded state ? Widow . Lanissa You little know how wretched I have been ! Fatima . Fatima I see despair invades your very soul , And yet you hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Fatima . Fatima Oh speak , what griefs too long conceal 'd  --  Widow . Lanissa My friend ! ' T is but too true , I lov 'd and was belov'd.  --  Oh ! hapless day , when from the Ganges ' banks , From Ouglee 's shades we came to sojourn here ; And ship accurs 'd , which , to complete my woes , Carried a youth  --  too lovely to my eyes ! There , Fatima , you know the cause of tears , And all the secret sorrow that consumes me ! Why , in our country 's view , are Europe 's sons Esteem 'd barbarians ? why could not my father Consent his child should wed that foreign chief ? Or rather , why did he compel his daughter To wed the man she hated ? Fatima . Fatima Oh ! great Gods ! Your husband sacrifices you to day  --  You lov 'd him not ; and yet you die for him ! Your fun'ral pile , erected in despight , Will prove a trophy for his jealous shade ! You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Widow . Lanissa Still more in vain your pity .  --  Fatima . Fatima Cruel woman ! But where is now your lover ? Widow . Lanissa That 's unknown : I know he lov 'd and wish 'd to marry me ; That he was snatch 'd away , that I was forc 'd To smother flames which I could not extinguish ; And that the flames I vainly strove to quench , In spite of me , revive and threat my virtue . Fatima . Fatima Your lot is hard !  --  Widow . Lanissa Had I elsewhere been born , I should have ceas 'd to be a SLAVE , a WRETCH ! The man who forc 'd me to his arms , when living , Would , when he died , at least , have left me free ; Then soothing hope had whisper 'd to my soul , That I , some day , might find the youth I lov 'd ! Now all conspires to drive me to despair ; Past vows , remembrance , and a form too dear , The nuptial ties impos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd , and what'er I lost  --  I die  --  and worse  --  I die a dreadful death , To join the man , who forc 'd my lover from me . Fatima . Fatima You much amaze me . Widow . Lanissa Yes  --  I 've said too much , Excuse , oh cruel shade , excuse thy victim : This heart submissive , though too hardly us 'd , Pays the strange duty that thy death demands : For thee , my flesh shall mount the burning pile , But ask no softer sentiment from me . If you have caus 'd my woes  --  let it suffice , I shall be faithful found beyond thy death : Perhaps , the pangs to come will scarcely equal The sacrifice I made without a sigh  --  And yet my fate might sanction more than sighs ! Fatima . Fatima How curst a fate succeeds to such a marriage ? Widow . Lanissa Oh ! if you love me , leave me all my courage ; I 've need enough of it  --  for that 's my all . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madam ;  --  heav'ns ! I see a Bramin coming , And read unkindness in his hateful face . SCENE II . Widow .  --  Fatima.  --  Young Bramin . Fatima . Fatima Well , what dost thou announce ? for doubtless death , Terror , and lamentation come with thee . And art thou come to claim that cruel promise , And tear my dearest lady from my arms ? Widow , Lanissa to Fatima . You may withdraw awhile . SCENE III . Widow .  --  Young Bramin . Young Bramin . Young Bramin ' T is thus both parties , Heap keen and undeserv 'd reproaches on me . You think me , madam , a relentless monster : While to our chief my feelings seem too tender : His views transported into other worlds , Perceive no scenes of pain , or pity here . For me , who follow him at awful distance , I know my heart was made to feel for others : And when I yield to nature 's first decree , Do I betray my country or religion ? But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is I Must lead you to the flames !  --  ' t is I  --  who , fill 'd With horror for your fate , had rather die To abrogate th ' infernal rite for ever ! Still as I see thee , still my melting soul Revolts against the order for thy death . Widow . Lanissa What interest can you have to plead for me ? Is it for Bramins thus to shew their pity ? How then could you accept this ministry , Without the temper ? or , if form 'd with kindness , Why did you join with those who stifled theirs ? Young Bramin . Young Bramin Alas ! What mortal can command his fate ! I 've been unhappy from my earliest days . Why did the man , who sav 'd my infant life , Convey me here from Bengal ? Why , so soon , Did death deprive me of that foster father ? An orphan , forc 'd to take this new profession . I find some deadly custom every where , Escap 'd from one , and but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allude ? Young Bramin . Young Bramin The murd'rous custom , Of plunging in the Ganges ev'ry child , Who thrice declines his nat'ral aliment , When first presented to him  --  ' t was my case  --  But while I should bewail your woes alone , I speak of mine .  --  Widow . Lanissa ' T is true the tale is piteous  --  But , oh , what destiny pursues my race ? Far from these regions in my native land , I lost a brother by that same strange custom . He in his dawn of life , at Bengal died : In Malabar , at morn , I meet my doom ! Young Bramin . Young Bramin In Bengal , madam , did your brother die ? So destiny ordain 'd for me at Ouglee.  --  Widow . Lanissa At Ouglee ! that agrees . Young Bramin . Young Bramin There was I born . Widow . Lanissa And there the tissue of my woes began . Young Bramin . Young Bramin What is your family , your name ? Widow . Lanissa Lanissa.  --  Young Bramin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Widow . Lanissa Heav'ns ! Young Bramin . Young Bramin Embrace , Embrace , and own your brother ! Widow . Lanissa Thou , my brother ! Oh , aggravation of my vig'rous fate : Iv'e found thee in the very hour of death . Just Deities ! where are we ? Young Bramin . Young Bramin ' T is Providence .  --  Widow . Lanissa In what a day of wrath has heav'n rejoin 'd us ! Ah , barb'rous brother ! ah , why have I found thee ? Restore me that UNKNOWN , who wept my fate !  --  Young Bramin . Young Bramin What said you ? Widow . Lanissa Yes , I 'm born to bear strange woes ! If you 're my brother , you must wish my death .  --  Young Bramin . Young Bramin I wish your death ! what madness ? oh  --  my sister ! Widow . Lanissa If I am so , begin to steel your heart . Brothers persuade their sisters here to die : Our mutual honor claims this sacrifice ; My family attends around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity for me  --  The ties of blood which elsewhere draw mankind , Repel them here , and nature 's plan reverse . Th ' endearing names of brother and of sister , Here lose their charms , and urge me to expire . Young Bramin . Young Bramin My eyes at last are open 'd  --  yes , I ought To succour thee  --  what signify your customs ? Shall I regard your laws ? I 'll brave them all , In such a cause  --  in vain you name your friends , Who wish to haste your death  --  you saw how I , A stranger then to you , froze at the thought .  --  Shall thy sweet voice , humanity ! when mix 'd , With cries of kindred blood , have lost its rights ? Widow . Lanissa Your rashness , brother , will not profit us . Young Bramin . Young Bramin If man presumptuous throws down nature 's laws , Let us rebuild them :  --  No  --  ' t is not for me , To heed those customs that confign to death ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whom heav'n has sent to you . Widow . Lanissa Your friendship makes This life more lovely , and its end more dreadful . Oh , ' t is much , in this excess of woes , To combat nature , tenderness and tears . Why did I see thee ?  --  I belong to death , And death demands his prey  --  what ! you pretend To change the customs prejudice confirms ! Shame were my portion , if I shun 'd my fate . No  --  if I 'm dear to thee , then join our friends , Who soon will come to place thee at their head . Young Bramin . Young Bramin What dar'st thou tell me ? Widow . Lanissa Follow here ! Young Bramin . Young Bramin Remain ! Widow . Lanissa With unavailing grief why wilt thou goad me ? Young Bramin . Young Bramin Art thou then blinded by fanatic rage ! Widow .

Lanissa But if the assailants fail , in vain Shall I have shewn timidity and tears . Then shall I fall too late a sacrifice , Despis 'd of all  --  the glory gone !  --  I 've promis 'd , Nor will delay .  --  Young Bramin . Young Bramin ' T is well , my sister , well  --  Let 's finish this dispute by changing climes : Let 's fly beyond the reach of such strange rites : And put the sea between this shame and us . Let 's fly from India , and its barb'rous laws , To realms where reason guides the human race , Where nature 's God those real duties shew , Which neither mortals , years , or climes can change . Widow . Lanissa What idle hope now animates your breast ? How , quit these shores ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , where mem'ry , shame , go not . Or , were it possible , my friends would then Be more than exiles in their native land . Young Bramin . Young Bramin Go on ! and still respect this murd'rous law ! Believe thy husband , like a god , will scathe thee : Thy friends be scorn 'd for thy delinquency . For me , thy only friend , first known this day , ' T is well that I , by sympathy , must bear The horrors of thy fate  --  while thou'rt unmov 'd !  --  A brother , little as his tears avail , Has still the pow'r to save you from yourself : And  --  cruel !  --  that he will . He 'll save thy life , In spite of thee  --  that , once accomplish 'd , then There 's neither ocean , continent , or isle , Which can divide me far enough from hence . SCENE IV . Widow . Lanissa alone . What can this project be ? this enterprize ? From his too tendes love must I defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fatima Madam , a truce is settled with the foe , Which stops all farther carnage for one day . The shorter is the truce , the more my hopes : For in the town there 's terror and dismay , Soon Malabar must yield  --  Before the place , E'en now the gen'ral of this foreign force , In parley with the governor , declares We must surrender , or expect a storm .  --  Madam , you may rejoice that soon the law Which seals your death , will have no farther sway . But what new trouble rises in your breast ? Perhaps the conversation of this Bramin , Who , though so young must have a cruel heart , Has cast such deep dejection in your spirits .  --  Widow . Lanissa Alas ! you 're ignorant !  --  But  --  conceal the fact .  --  Hark  --  Fatima ! this Bramin is my brother ; To day recognis 'd , in this house of death ; He means to end the rigours of my fate .  --  Fatima .

Fatima . Fatima Why paint this lucky chance in such dark shades ? Or why despair ?  --  all things now bid you live : A truce , which vict'ry soon perhaps will follow  --  A brother found  --  and more  --  perchance , they know In yonder camp something of that European  --  At least , they come from the same distant land , And may relate if yet your lover lives .

What fatal expectations hast thou rais 'd ? Inexorable honour holds my heart .  --  Respect my virtue , glory , resolution , And let me still believe that this young Frenchman , Is lost forever to my fond affection !

French General I only meant , By rigidly abridging thus the term , And threat'ning an assault , to save much blood : Too much already has distain 'd these shores : Let 's save what yet humanity can save . But , oh , my friend , what can atone those ills , Which war inflicts on mortals ?  --  yet I see , With indignation , that this race entire , Are slaves to the proud Bramin  --  with what art , He warms their minds with superstitious fire , And then alarms them for their rites and worship .

Spoken by Mrs. Henry , in the character of Lanissa .

Nought could have sav 'd me from the jaws of fate , Had my French lover came one breath too late .  --  The pile prepar 'd and kindling brisk as tinder , They 'd burn 'd your poor Lanissa to a cinder !

Am I to blame , if , this dear life to save , I lik 'd a lover better than a grave ; Prefer 'd your christian maxims for a drama , To all the murd'rous rites of pagan Brama ; And held , retreating from my fun'ral urn , " T was better far to marry than to burn ? " No  --  I 'll be burn 'd , but ev'ry maid and widow , Would do , in such a case , just as I did do . Yes  --  thank your stars , Columbia 's happy dames !
