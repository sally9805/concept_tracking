The events of the Play , supposed to have occurred several years previous to the last war with Great Britain . Main text Act I. Scene SCENE  --  A bold river , winding through rich scenery , part of an ancient chapel appears embosomed amidst venerable live oaks . The moon shines bright and discovers the waving moss suspended from the trees . The oars of an approaching boat strike time to the music of horns and flutes . The boat appears full of company . States Woodberry jumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the party remain on board . States . States Woodberry You shall be gratified , Ellinor ; and though this spot is only calculated to increase melancholy contemplations , I will stroll about with you ; but the dew is falling heavily , and we must not stay too long . Ellen . Ellinor You are always indulgent . ( They walk towards the chapel . ) ( James speaks from the boat . ) James . James Trevors While you contemplate , we will treat the good old tenants of those tombs to a serenade , when some of them may perhaps peep out to look at their fair visitor . Music and Song . Fair Cynthea beaming , Her radiance streaming , O'er the gloom of yonder shade ; While pale spirits flitting by , Listen to our melody  --  So fancy paints those forms that fade . ( States and Ellinor return from the chapel . ) Ellinor . Ellinor How rich the foliage of these venerable oaks . Beneath the shade of this  --  rests the excellent mother of St. Julien . O that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have we not yet heard from him ? ( She stands in a musing attitude . ) ( James calls from the boat . ) James . James Trevors Come , States , come . Your aunt 's gossamers are loosing their folds , dissolving into dew . Upon my word , Miss Ellinor , you will send us all to the shades if you stay any longer among them . Your sister 's ringlets are as straight as a Naiad 's dripping locks . ( Miss Woodberry from the boat . ) Miss W. Miss Woodberry My dear Ellinor , I hope you will not suffer for this melancholy indulgence . Ellinor . Ellinor Your pardon , we are coming . ( James leaps ashore and assists Ellinor on board . The boat rows off . Music . ) Scene Scene changes to an Encampment of Waggons . Several waggoners appear  --  some employed in feeding their horses , others stretched out at their length sleeping , and at a distance some are cooking at a fire . ( Homespun advances from among the trees ) Homespun . Homespun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How I long to see the dear child , and to take her home again . I reckon it is because she has been away from me that I love her better than my other girls . But she is so clever , so tender  --  and has so the ways of a gentlewoman , tho ' she did quite as much household matters as any body ; and then her pretty face is just like her dear mothers ' . Well , it does not signify talking , I must take her back . She has taught Madam Woodberry 's weaver all she can teach her by this time . Ah ! I wish she would have listened to our young neighbour Tom . ( Enter George with a waggoner 's whip . ) George . George Well , father , I 'm right glad you got up with us ; all tight ! for some of those stumps we leave to jog the gentry , now and then give we a plague jogging too . I came on ahead as fast as I could , to look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is too late to go to the hall to see your sister ? George . George O no , fine folks do nt go to bed with the whippoor-will . Why , they are but just returning from their frolicking parties . A little above I saw a fine bustle  --  there was a mighty fine young gentleman driving some spruce laides in a coache full of gabble all of them  --  and the young coachman mayhap with a little wind in his wig , as they had been on a fishing party I heard . Presently all on a sudden , whisk goes the whip , ( cracks his whip ) whap comes the carriage flat in the mud , and all bespattered my homespuns . The ladies squealed , while that fellow John Axle , bawls out , " help yourselves gentry , help yourselves ; the waggoners you know are never civil , "  --  and with that he cracks his whip as loud as thunder in their ears , and on he splashes . Homespun . Homespun I hope tho ' you did n't serve them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn my back upon any folks in trouble ; so I and Billy soon prized them up again ; fetched some water for the young madams : the servants tied up the harness , and away they went ; no harm done . Homespun . Homespun George I am going ; and shall tell Madge to get ready to go up with us when we return from Charleston . George . George Now father if she should ask you to let her stay longer , I reckon you 'll be obliged to say yes ; for with all our mighty notions of having our own way , I never knowed it happen otherwise than that these saucy petticoat wearers could bend a man the way they would have him to go . Tell Madge how d'ye for me . ( Excit Homespun . ) ( George whistles Yankee Doodle  --  smacks his whip , and then sings , to the tune of Yankee Doodle. ) 1 The people ask 'd me whilst in town , Why wagg'ners were so merry ; Why never but in mud cast down ? I answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have ; A wife  --  a child  --  a waggon ; A tight log house  --  hog , fowl , and goose , And a whiskey flaggon. 2 Cotton and corn we plant enough , And a small field of tobacco ; Which nicely tied , in pig tail pride , We twist into our chops  --  O Our lips we smack , our whips we crack , Then bundle up our spare truck , " Buy me a gown , " wife cries . " in town , ; " Throws her old shoe for good luck . 3 Through thick and thin , at last we 're in , And down King-street we dash on , And stare about , to see whos'e out , To shew us what 's the fashion ; Last time I saw a flimsy thing , It seem 'd to have no body ; With what they call a parasol , To shade its niddy doddy. 4 A curious bag hung from the arm ; As big as my baby 's pocket ; And from the neck hung dangling down , A mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad , Tripp 'd along the pavement ; I reckon if I 'd seen his phiz , It did n't want a shavement. 5 Next came a capering troop of horse , With a trumpet cesararo ; But I reckon we cou 'd cut ' em out . If there come a downright war , O. ( A waggoner . Waggoner calls  --  " George , come and take a shot at a Turkey " George George sings in reply . ) Aye ! I can shoot , and I can kill , I bet you now a trifle ; I 'd pick out yonder fellow 's tooth , With Father 's meanest rifle . ( Smacks his whip as he goes off . ) Scene Scene changes to Woodberry hall . Discovers an apartment handsomely furnished , though in rather an old fashioned style . Miss Woodberry , seated on the sofa . States standing near her Ellinor by her side . Caroline and James leaning in at one of the windows from the piazza . Miss W. Miss Woodberry But how can I part with you , my Ellinor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , my dear aunt . James . James Trevors And I , with the ladies permission , will take care of both . I shall be a Cerberus , an Argus  --  and on my steady frontlet write vigilance . States . States Woodberry How soon a few months will pass away , and do not apprehend that one summer absent , we shall become strangers . Miss W. Miss Woodberry You may be mistaken , States , and unhappily prove that even one summer 's absence will render you liable to the cruel fever ; if the climate was not so changed within a few years , I would , however reluctant , give my consent to this visit to your uncle in England . James . James Trevors O , give it , madam , give it  --  You need not fear that , or any thing else . States will conduct all things prudently ; for he is not in love ; his heart 's sober pendulum beats as slow and equal as the pounding pestle in your barn . Now were his temperament like mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my very self all but perptual motion , have some apprehensions ; and from the same last named quality , tremble for my health , when again under the influence of our summer season . Caroline . Caroline But what will you say for Ellinor ? States . States Woodberry One word from Ellinor , and my aunt consents ; besides , if you can persuade Margaret to accompany you  --  nay do not shake your head  --  for you positively shall not stay to think so much of St. Julien ; pho , pho , He is very safe , very well in Paris , only a little lazy  --  or perhaps  --  Ellinor . Ellinor Do not suppose he could have been so long in Paris and not have written to me . States . States Woodberry Young men are apt sometimes in new scenes to let the remembrance of old friends fade away . I will not accuse St. Julien of inconstancy , but  --  ( Enter Caroline and James as they were speaking . ) James . James Trevors Accuse St. Julien of inconstancy ? as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure it does vary in some latitudes , so St. Julien may feel a new influence from the Parisian atmosphere . Ellinor . Ellinor O , forbear . Do not think unjustly of him . James . James Trevors I would not hurt your feelings for the presidency of the United States , and to be master of the universe ! would not suspect my friend St. Julien of dishonorable conduct . Many things may have occurred to prevent his throwing himself at your feet upon paper . Enter Cudjo . Cudjo . Cudjoe Old massa from de back woods come for see he daughter . Miss W. Miss Woodberry Ask him to walk in ; and let Margaret know immediately . ( Exit Cudjo . ) States . States Woodberry Perhaps he has brought another of his pretty daughters ; his Margaret excels all our lowland ladies in complexion . James . James Trevors Well States , give me the tender lilly , you shall take the monutain rose . ( Re-enter Cudjo with candles in shades , followed by Homespun . Homespun bows respectfully . Exit Cudjo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madam , I could not help calling in to night to see my girl ; but I reckon you 'll pardon it when you think it is her father . I have brought you , madam , a piggon of butter , which I hope you will please to accept from me . I 'll allow there 's none better , having a right good range for my creatures . Miss W. Miss Woodberry I thank you , my good sir : sit down ; you must be weary this warm evening . Homespun . Homespun No , madam , no ; the thoughts of seeing Margaret keep me from feeling weary ; her sisters long for her among them again States . States Woodberry Are they as blooming as Margaret ? Homespun . Homespun No , no ; they are stout lasses , and our country boys call them pretty , but  --  Well , well , I 'll say no more ; for I guess every father is proud of his own children , and I mought say too much  --  Enter Margaret . Margaret ( Embraces her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret Homespun I have been expecting you , I do n't know how long ; what has kept you so much later than usual , my dear father ? O , how are all at home ? Homespun . Homespun Quite well , quite well , my deary ; but planting season has been backward , tho ' we have a special good crop in the ground ; and I am going to town for a spruce new chair to take you up with me Margaret . ( Pats her on the cheek . States walks about anxiously observing them . ) Ellinor . Ellinor Do not speak of taking Margaret away , Mr. Homespun , for we can not part with her . Homespun . Homespun You will spoil her for our plain fare and country ways , if she stays any longer at Woodberry hall . Ellinor . Ellinor You really must spare her to us for twelve months , and more than that ; if I should go to England , you must indeed suffer her to accompany me . Homespun . Homespun Ha ! so far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back with me , in a few days . Could you leave me so long , Margaret ? Margaret leans upon him tenderly . ) Marg . Margaret Homespun My heart bids me go with you ; but then these ladies have been so kind , that if I could do any thing in return I should be happy . Miss W. Miss Woodberry Your daughter has made herself so welcome here , that we all love her ; oblige me by allowing her to remain till this time twelve months ; we will then return her to you I hope in health and not displeased with her voyage , should she in that time go with my niece to England . ( Homespun pauses and looks at Margaret . ) Homespun . Homespun I do n't know how to refuse ; and yet I was bent upon taking her home : but if you please , madam , I will think about it , and so tell my mind freely when I call again . Miss W. Miss Woodberry Do so ; and I think you will oblige us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will indeed spoil me . Miss W. Miss Woodberry You must stay at the hall to night , Mr. Homespun . Homespun . Homespun Why , madam , I thought to have roughed it as commonly in our waggon camp . I am an old continental soldier , and used to sleep in the woods ; one of General Marion 's men ; but as you are so mighty kind , I wont refuse . I must go first tho ' and speak to my son , and will return . Marg . Margaret Homespun Let me go with you , for I wish to see George . States . States Woodberry We will all walk ; the evening is delightful , and by the time we return supper will be ready ( Exeunt all but Miss W. She rises and walks about . ) Miss W. Miss Woodberry My niece , I am persuaded , is only withheld by her reluctance to leave me and her sister ; in all other respects she inclines to take this voyage . It is selfish to add my entreaties to her reluctance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying a visit to England ; and it is but a temporary separation . And should I not let another consideration have due weight ? Novelty will contribute to disperse those agitating reflections which have evidently impaired her health . Surely St. Julien does not propose any thing so dishonorable as to forget his engagement  --  but he is so very young , he may have mistaken the strength of his attachment , and not knowing his heart , felt the force of habit , not love . More than once we might have heard from him since he set out upon his travels . ( She pauses ) I will yield to the arguments of States , and my consent be at once given , if Margaret can be induced to go . Scene Scene changes to the vicinity of the city of Algiers  --  View of the city  --  the sea , and a large broken rock of stone . Christian slaves are at work ; many of them dragging carettes , upon which stones are laid of an immense weight ; the slaves are yoked together in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Other slaves are employed in preparing to blow up part of the rock of stone . Loud explosion  --  several large pieces of stone fly off :  --  The slaves then fix some upon burrils  --  others raising the smaller pieces upon the carettes  --  Turks at different places standing over the slaves with goads and whips  --  one driver in particular standing on a projection of the rock , appears to be lashing about his whip , unmercifully driving the slaves . St. Julien languidly advances . St. Julien . St. Julien Savage cruel drivers ; ye have pierced my flesh with your keen goads . My toil-worn wretched body can not endure such usage much longer . O , that this feverish languor did not so reduce me ; unnerved , unnerved  --  by these incessant trials beyond my strength . And where is that poor lad , Ziekel ? If they had but permitted us to labor together , it would have been some alleviation to our misery . Ah ! Ellinor ! my Ellinor ! little do you imagine what your St. Julien suffers ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathise : But she is ignorant of my wretchedness ; thinks me gaily dancing the giddy round of pleasure , and perhaps chides me for neglect . Neglect ! O , Ellinor ! till the latest period of existence , fond , fond remembrance will entwine thee with that existence . O , that I could but whisper St. Julien loves thee ! will be faithful forever !  --  A few short months and I may be banished from her thoughts  --  some other youth persuade her to forget me ; but , alas ! ' ere that period arrives , here will this miserable body perish  --  . The driver calls to him from the projection of the rock  --  holding up his whip in a threatening manner  --  ) Turk . Turk Christian dog ! to work . ( St. Julien looks at him . ) St. Julien . St. Julien Your cruelties have rendered me almost unable to work . I paused from labor , or must have sunk . Turk . Turk Work then till thou dost sink  --  Dogs ! ye shall pay for your feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and falls headlong upon a large fragment of the rock , and lies without motion .

St. Julien Some mitigation of our hardships we may now hope for  --  this was a turbaned monster . ( Scene closes . ) Scene Scene changes to Woodberry hall . States holds a book , which he impatiently tosses upon a table . States . States Woodberry " Nor wit nor wisdom can relieve their friend  --  Wit ca n't relieve the pain I now indure , And wisdom shews the ill without the cure . " What a countenance ! when I gaze upon it my heart beats with a new pulsation . Never till I beheld this lovely girl , did female attraction force my thoughts to quit their calm and tranquil channel . Margaret ! too lovely Margaret ; why has fate thrown you in my way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am irresistibly compelled to stay ; and how am I using all my influence to keep her in sight  --  absurd , foolish , inconsistent , weak  --  Enter James . James . James Trevors What famous sport you have lost , States ; we shots , and both did execution . I have laid my proofs of prowess at the feet of Miss Woodberry ; but all the thanks your sisters bestowed were conveyed in a reprimand for enjoying such cruel sport ; however I perceive they eat a piece of venison with great gout , though we must not kill the deer . Why would you stay at home ; when perhaps this is the last sporting day before you sail ? faith I hate the thoughts of your going ; and shall not know how to part with my dear Mentor . States . States Woodberry I feel as if in a fair way to need a mentor myself . Enter Ellinor and Caroline . James . James Trevors Do you hear , ladies ? do you hear ? our Solomon is out of his senses ; behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , my dear fellow ? Ellinor . Ellinor This is but an unfavourable account of one who is soon to take so great a charge upon himself , as the care of two damsels . States . States Woodberry ( Eagerly . ) What ? has Margaret consented to go ? Ellinor . Ellinor She has ; and my aunt is busy arranging every thing to prepare her for the voyage . This afternoon she thinks it advisable to set off for town , as you say the vessel sails immediately . States . States Woodberry With all my heart . James will you drive Caroline in the curricle ? and as this warm weather rather makes me indolent , I will take a seat in the carriage . Caroline . Caroline I negative that gentleman 's motion ; so soon to be separated from Ellinor , I prefer a seat in the carriage , and you beaux may take care of each other . James . James Trevors Impossible ; absolutely impossible  --  I will go and convince your aunt that the first is the best plan . Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated by your whims ; come Ellinor assist me to interrupt these encroachments , or I shall very soon be a slave to all the caprices of his fancy . ( Exeunt Ellinor , Caroline and James . ) ( Margaret enters not seeing States . She arranges some flowers , and puts them into a large China jar . ) Marg . Margaret Homespun It is a pity any thing so sweet should die . I wonder if any such grow in England . I hope so ; for to pick these gave me a pleasure I never felt before in gathering them . It must be , because they put me in mind of home . O , when I am far , so very far away , should I find one like them . I shall press it to my bosom , as if I had found a picture of my dear old father , or one of my sisters . States . States Woodberry Sweet picture of innocence . Marg . Margaret Homespun I thought I was alone . ( She courtesies , and offers to retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Margaret , before you tell me , if you are willing to go with us to England ; or does diffidence only prevent your speaking candidly ? Marg . Margaret Homespun I really am willing to go as Miss Woodberry tells me it is but for a few months ; and only fear I shall be awkward , and not all I wish . States . States Woodberry Awkward !  --  O no , my sister will be , can not fail to be , pleased with all you do ; and you possess one accomplishment , which you do not acknowledge I find . Marg . Margaret Homespun What is that ? States . States Woodberry I have heard you sing , Margaret , and most enchantingly  --  but you were at a greater distance than at this moment . O , if you would now indulge me with one song . Marg . Margaret Homespun I should be ashamed to sing before so good a judge . States . States Woodberry My taste delights in simple melody . I love to listen to the sweet wild notes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untutored voice charmed me equally . Do not deny me . Margaret . Margaret sings . When distant from my much lov 'd home , A thousand tender thoughts will rise ; For , ah ! when I have ceas 'd to ream , My kindred may have sought the skies ! Then how shou 'd I regret the hour , That led me from my peaceful cot ; Not all the gifts of wealth and pow'r , Cou 'd soften then my hapless lot . But I will hope again to view , Each cherish 'd object of my heart ; Domestic joys with them renew , And never more from home depart . States . States Woodberry A thousand  --  ten thousand thanks ; but why cease so soon ? Marg . Margaret Homespun O , you would be tired if I sung more ; besides I can not stay any longer . ( Exit Margaret ) States . States Woodberry These feelings must be corrected ; yet how ? Am I not about to be placed for some time in the very situation to encourage them ? Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I to do as an American , with the word rank ? here equality is the motto ; but it must be equality of education that applies to marriage , not birth or fortune ; for if improved intellect , and polished manners , wed uncultivated simplicity , the contrast is , though unwillingly , pepetually felt ; and true love evaporates when contempt of the understanding undermines it . Where the mind seeks in vain for a reflection of its own images ; where they can not be impressed , no coincidence of sentiment will arise . ( Pauses . ) Perhaps when I quit these shades , mix with the world , and see a thousand lovelier faces the impression Margaret has made on my youthful fancy , will be erased .

Caroline There is no excuse for cold inattention ; leaving me at a moment when his care would have been particularly acceptable , was mortifying in the extreme . He knows my unconquerable terror when it thunders , yet turned away , and flirted with his pretty partner , while the storm pealed over our heads frightfully ; the bower of myrtle and wild orange afforded slight protection ; and but for captain  --  Enter James . He bows gravely . Miss W. Miss Woodberry How do you do , Mr. Trevors ? James . James Trevors O , the quintessence of good health ; never better madam , I thank you , in my life . Caroline . Caroline Nor in better spirits : which I rather wonder at . As you have but just left the fair partner , you might plausibly enough have complained of fatigue , as a little blind to conceal your regrets at parting , considering the warm sail this morning . Pray , how did you leave the charmer ? how could you quit the island ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I should be charmed if I could flatter myself that I excited no more ennui in her this morning , than the captain occasioned you at the maroon . The town has added him to the list of your devotees . You certainly took no pains to check the circulation of such a report , but seemed to be perfectly disposed to receive his attentions . Caroline . Caroline His politeness must always command attention . James . James Trevors No doubt , no doubt ; the ladies ' hearts flutter at his approach , and to be particularly the object of his soft flowing transports , flattering to the happy nymph whom this Mars with Cupid 's attributes , deigns to select ; and you could not fail of being as highly gratified with his devoirs , as I felt in beholding the encouraging glances of my animated sparkler . O , I adore animation ; no whining sentimentals for me . I would rather be jilted ten times in ten months by lovely coquettes , than court hum drum sensibility . Miss W. Miss Woodberry This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so ironically overstrained , that it appears adopted for the occasion . You are both piqued at imaginary inattentions . Some lovers are perpetually wrangling , one would think merely for the pleasure of reconciliation ; but I disapprove of it . Every quarrel is productive of a degree of acrimony , which robs love of a portion of its sweetness . No more ! no more ! young folks . Caroline . Caroline My dear aunt , I can not forget his conduct at the maroon . James . James Trevors Nor I your complaisance to the captain . Caroline . Caroline You provoke me  --  ought I to have been rude to a gentleman whose good breeding led him to pay every proper respect to his partner ? James . James Trevors And was not my partner a vain girl ? and you know I delight in pouring out a little spirit of flattery , to make a pretty butterfly expand her wings , and display her gaudy colours . Caroline . Caroline I have heard twenty of you say , that a young woman should be vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female not completely modelled to your taste without it . James . James Trevors You never heard me , with all deference be it spoken , express that opinion . No , I despise vanity , and at all times ridicule it ; it is in my eyes so contemptible , indeed deforming , that when I see a pretty mouth disfigured by the grimaces of affectation , if it was the mouth of Hebe I would not kiss it . Miss W. Miss Woodberry I see now that your peace is signed ; you have indirectly paid Caroline a just tribute ; for I will do my nieces the justice to say , they are as free from that despicable defect as I could wish them to be : but allow me to change the subject to one more important . Have you , my dear sir , heard any news of St. Julien ? James . James Trevors I wish I could reply satisfactory . I saw his agent this morning , but he had not heard from my friend .

Caroline Should either misfortune have befallen him , what sorrow awaits my sister . Lost ! O do not imagine that  --  to suppose him taken would be a comparative comfort . Miss W. Miss Woodberry No , no ; It is scarcely possible long to survive the capture of those barbarians , from the labors and cruelties they inflict . O , from such a deplorable fate , may he be preserved  --  Enter Cudjo . Cudjo . Cudjoe One gentleman send for see you , massa James ; he wait pon you at de door . James . James Trevors Excuse me then ; I shall pay my respects in the evening . ( Bows , and exit with Cudjo . ) Miss W. Miss Woodberry I am hurt to observe these frequent jarrings between you and Mr. Trevors ; and look forward to your probable union with some distrust , as I shall doubt of its permanent happiness .

His profound speculations would be scattered into nothings , a thousand times a day , by my volubility , and we should worry each other to death . James and I agree very well on the main points of opinion ; and I dare say , if it pleases the goddess of fickleness , not to put too tempting a lure in his way to draw him from me , we shall make an happy pair .

Zeikel O , what a blessed sight is that white flag  --  a little sweet respite from our sour labour . Nay , it is salt labour for me ; for I eat , and drink , and live , on the spray of the sea . Mighty hard , indeed . Now I reckothese whiskered rascals think their prayers are handed up by their glorious Mahomet ; but all he could say to heaven 's face of mercy , according to my notion , would n't be a passport for them .

Why did I fall in love ? and because Margaret refused me , followed the unlucky star of poor Mr. St. Julien ; and where in this dog of a place have they set him to wear his flesh away ? Mayhap he helps to haul along those monstrous stones , yoked with a hundred or two poor Christians , like himself . If I could but lay eyes on him .

Friends  --  friends he wants , for by good management I do not despair of seeing him dey of Algiers . Selima 's connexions will make our influence powerful , and my command of the soldiery at a word , makes the caftan his ; but never if his best hours are sacrificed to an indolent passion .

Enter Ellinor , disguised as a Turkish boy .  --  Achmet enters at the opposite door . Behold my pretty little Turk , Achmet ; the Aga could never discover Ellinor in this disguise . Ach .

Achmet To the British consul 's , but avoid the street in which the palace stands ; or you may meet the Aga . His eye is so keen , I dread that he might penetrate even thro ' that disguise .

Scene Scene changes to the street , in which is seen a great concourse of Turks and Moors , assembling round the principal marabout or priest , asking a blessing .  --  States , St. Julien and Ellinor , advance with Hassan and other soldiers ; some of whom commence a riot by ill-treating the Moors .

A great many young people assembled dancing the Dutch hip se saw ; a rude imitation of the waltz ; but instead of the graceful movements with which the dance begins , the rustic couples clasp each others fingers as firmly as they can ; then spin round many times together , as fast as possible ; again let go hands , then begin to foot it violently , doing many strange steps , then again clasp hands  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Homespun Well never mind George , the news ; as you are here now safe and sound . George . George The news ? aye such news ; I 'll give every one of you nine guesses a piece ; and I think you will not be mighty nigh the matter then ; I have brought a piece of furniture for  --  ( several exclaim ) what is it ? what is it ?

Homespun Ha ! is that true Tom ? is that true Margaret ? Marg . Margaret Homespun Yes my dear father ; for Zeikel has done so much for me that I can never do enough for him . Zeikel . Zeikel What will you all think of me , when I tell you that I walked out of Algiers ?  --  ( Gives himself airs and struts about . ) Homespun . Homespun Algiers ! and where then is  --  Zeikel . Zeikel No , I rowed out of Algiers with Margaret by my side , as easily as I walk now ; got loose from my chains , aye chains larger than ox-chains , fastened round my body ; with bolts as big as the lynch pin of a waggon-wheel . But what were they all , when I saw Margaret cooped up behind an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they ? why Margaret with my assistance popped through the bars as though they had been corn-stalks ; and dressed half like a Moor , but you never saw a Moor ; I 'll shew you one by and bye .

Zeikel No , no , the Moors clothes are all in the waggon but as I was saying , when Margaret had broke the iron bars , out she hopped into these arms ; that never will let her be farther off than their length again as long as my eye can see her ; so now for a wedding ; a wedding .  --  ( Zei. skips about . ) Homespun .

Homespun O no Zeikel , you have fairly won her ; and you know that many day ago , I would have given Margaret to you , had she been willing ; here is her hand , and my blessing to you both .  --  ( Gives her hand. )  --  I do n't mean to grudge you a wedding-supper ; so make merry now , and then too , and tell us how all your strange matters happened ; and were the sweet young lady is , my old eyes run over with joy to see you .

James Trevors Again I repeat my desire , that you will spare no pains or cost to accomplish this business ; by the time you arrive the money sent by government to ransom all the captives , may have been received ; I hope so , for the sake of our poor suffering countrymen .

Scene closes . ) Scene Scene discovers an appartment at Miss Woodberry 's . Miss W. and Caroline . Miss W. Miss Woodberry All that can now be done Caroline , is to bear as patiently as possible , the lingering time that must elapse before we can see them ; but as it may reasonably be hoped the measures we have taken will restore them to us , let us wisely endeavor to compose our minds . Caroline . Caroline Life abounds with such various evils , and trials , and disappointments , that but for being some comfort to you , I could most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to change the decree , if I knew that this night I should sleep to wake no more on earth . Miss W. Miss Woodberry Ah ! my dear , we know not what awaits us of happiness . How soon may these gloomy thoughts give place to a train of bright images , and years of promised delight be realized . Caroline . Caroline The prospects which adorned the future , are closed toy view forever ! You have often told me , that it is infinitely more difficult to keep an heart than to gain it ; either from its proneness tonconstancy , or because we do not find it worthy . But my dear aunt , on this point your kindest sympathy can not avail ; you can not enter into my feelings , as you never experienced them . Miss W. Miss Woodberry You are mistaken . I was once on the verge of marrying ; my lover proved fickle , and forsook me ; but pride was so wounded , that his cruelty sat very light upon my heart , and I discovered that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however I will confess , since that period , then extremely young , I detected myself in a preference for a very interesting young man  --  but as I had no attractions for him , the preference was extinguished in my bosom . Caroline . Caroline And where is he ? have I ever seen him ? I wish you had been united to him ; for I can not bear to think you ever had so mortifying a trial as that of an hopeless attachment . Miss W. Miss Woodberry A mind well regulated , and conscious of its powers , may by perseverance subdue all that would sink its dignity , or confine its faculties to the contemplation of one fancied good , of which it may be deprived , neglecting in consequence the cultivation of surrounding advantages , or sources of enjoyment , which the society of esteemed friends , or the discharge of such duties as are placed in our way afford . The dutiful and affectionate attention of yourself , your sister , and States , filled up any void my heart might have experienced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things . Miss W. Miss Woodberry I hope that you will like me , at least , look back , my dear child , upon the effect of past disappointments with approving thought ; never having omitted to apply all your strength of mind to render the impressions nature moulded your heart to receive , conducive to its improvement , and of course its happiness . Wisdom forbids us to suffer any impression to remain so deeply engraved , as to destroy our peace . Enter Cudjo , out of breath . Cud .
