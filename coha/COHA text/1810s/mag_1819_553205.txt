txt ART . XIII .. - On the means of education , and the state of learning in the United States of . ilmerica . On the state of learning in the Untted States of . *merica , 1819 . ( From Blackwood 's Edinburgh Magazine . ) THE cognizance which our transatlantic brethren are disposed to take of American literature , evinces that we are not regarded by them with indifference ; and though their judgments are not always founded in that liberality which is becoming in every portion of the great republic of letters towards every other , yet we suppose they would affect a contenptuous smile , if we should ascribe any of their trials and decisions to a jealousy growing out of our improvement , and vapid advances in learning and the arts . Till of late , most of what has been said by the literary censors of Great Britam , has consisted of remarks somewhat vague and general , except so far as to point out to us , not always in the most kindly manner , such words as they pronounced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ls and phrases as violate the true English idiom . By whatever spirit this was dictated , we rejoice in the result ; it has , in a few instances , grven us opportunity to triuml ) h over a rash decision ; but , what is of much greater value , it has made us vigilant to guard against the intrusion of barbarous words and phrases , which air independence too bold and presumptuous , and bidding too great defiance to the critics of our mother country , might have led us to regard with criminal indiflerence . In the remarks under the titles which we have placed at the head of this article , we are favoured with a more partic* ular account of American learning , and the state of our literary institutions , than any we recollect to have seen before . The outlines must have been furnished by one of our home-bred scholars ; but the filling up and the colouring , the incongruous composition of the parts , and the air of caricature that Pervades the whole , we are confident must be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , who was well acquainted with our learning and literary institutions ; but there is an inconsistency in the two articles which we have cited , almost throughout while the situation and circumstances of our country are incidentally mentioned , as sufficient to account for our inferiority to older countries* in learning and learned instituPons , we // 1819 ; State of Learning in the United States . are constantly reproached for being so low in the scale ; as if it were a voluntary , and even wilful degradation . This is an unfortunate specimen of Scottish logic . The author , after admitting that sufficient provision is made in a great portion of the states for common s'hools , gives some account of our Academies . We concede to him , that it is absurd to give this high sorinding name ' to a great proportion of these incorporated institutions , and that many of them do not deserve it ; but in some of them , we know that the classics are taught with accuracy , and in a manner tending to give the pupils as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can usually be acquired . Our readers shall see what is said on this subject In all that relates to classic learning , they the academies are totally deficient ; there is not one , from Maine to Georgia which has yet sent forth a single first rate scholar ; no , not one since the settlement of the country , equal even to the most ordi1*ary of the thirty or forty , which come out every year from Schule Pforta , and Meissen . It would not be unreasonable to say , that a boy in America , who is put to learn the ancient languages , loses his whole time , from the first moment he begins his Latin Accidence , till he takes his bachelor 's degree  --  a period of eight or nine years , and those the most precious years of life . They are not merely lost-they do positive injury to the youth ; those delectable studies , whose power it is , when properly felt , to form a pure and elegant taste , and polished mind , are looked upon as tasks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the voice of inspiration is heard , and awakens not , and the most powerful means of intellectual regeneration , which learning can employ , leave the mind in a state of hopeless insensibility . This arises from bad nasters , and a bad method of study . It is impossible for a man to teach what he does not understand himself , or to excite in others a taste , which he has never acquired . The remark may be applied to most of the instructers of the classic schools in America ; they are mere language masters , not scholars ; miners , who know the art of getting at the ore , but not of using it . But they are not without excuse ; it can not be expected that the masters should be good , as long as the system of education , which they are required to follow , is wholly ( lefective . The object of learning is misunderstood in America , or rather , it is valued only as far as it is practically useful . IBe it understood , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality with those of England , proceeding* // from their Universities and higher schools ; nor , perhaps9 even with those of Scotland ; though the latter , when they have entered the lists with English scholars , we have sometimes seen smarting pretty severely , and *vrithing , with something of bitter anguish , from the stripes they have received . But such absurd exaggerations , and indiscriminate use of totalities as this passage contains , scarcely deserve a reply . Are there no such things as degrees in learning ? Are the rules and maxims which apply to every thing else , so completely inapplicable here , that we are to conclude that whatever is not the best , is the worst that can be conceived ? Besides , there is an inaccuracy and confusion in the writer 's statement . He is speaking of what are here called Academies , when he says a boy loses his whole time , till he takes his bachelor 's degree ; leaving it to be inferred , that lie receives his degree at the Academy . That the preparation made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defective , we are obliged to admit ; and that the idle and the dull sometimes obtain degrees , which are wholly undeserved , is an equally lamentable truth . But that some of our Colleges afford the meatis of forming a good scholar , and that they are successfully used by a part of the students , it is impossible for us not to believe . If their circumstances and vocations in life are afterwards , in general , such as preclude their farther advancement , those are distinct considera. * tions . The object of our Colleges is to lay the foundation in different branches of valuable learning ; and surely we can not deem it a reproach to our system of education , nor think it greatly erroneous , if it is valued for its practical utility . Weconceive that a classical education is an accomplishment for a gentleman , which he will never regret ; and that it is in some degree practically useful to every professional man . Hence it is , that our Colleges would afford every one as much time and assistance in classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will happen , that some , who have a taste for languages , will learn to read the classics with pleasure , and tasteful discrimination , and that others will be satisfied with a tolerable knowledge of their daily tasks . It is true , that the same tasks are assigned for aW and it is done on the principle we have already Aentioned . And though it is inte ided that all should have // enough to perform , yet we know that there is as much room for tavoritism in the choice of studies , as in that of corn panions ; and that a young man , whose inclination leads him to a particular pursuit , will be able to indulge it , without censurable negligence in other branches of study . This is analogous to the employments of manhood . With a moderate share of business , or duties , a man in either of the learned professions may persuade himself that he has enough to do ; but even when crowded with j ) professional avocations , if he have a genuine ardor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will find time for gratifying his peculiar propensity . The analogy might be pursued much farther , if we were engaged iii a mere speculative inquiry ; but our illustrations we think are sufficient to show , that with all our reverence for classical learning , ( for we mean ever to maintain its exalted worth ) it is no unpardonable sin , that the students at our principal Colleges can find time and assistance to acquire , in addition to their proficiency in languages , what is practically useful* ' We have no acquaintance with Schute Pfrrta , and Meissen ; ' though we do not hesitate to admit , that the persevering industry of the German scholars in their schools of every gradation , is carried farther than that of any other people . iBut such a rhetorical flourish as follows , namely , that a boy who is put to learn the ancient languages , loses , and *vorse than loses , his whole time , till he takes his bachelor 's degree , is an hyperbole too bold to impose even on the most credulous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead language . Let the learner be a Dutch , an English , or an American boy , and let the motive proposed to him be what it may , it can not be seriously maintained that he is won to his daily kssons by the beauties discovered in his grammar or dictionary . We have certainly heard of English boys being brought to their tasks by the birch and fertile , which are not the most winning ways , nor much less calculated to make the pupil look upon his delectable studies ' as loathsome tasks , than is the prospect held out to him of being prepared Lor college , which seems to be viewed as a mean and sinful lure to ambition . Do what we will , the elements of education must be dry and uninteresting in themselves ; and however refined the taste of the instructer may be , it can have little effect on the pupil , till he is grounded in // Sept. his grammar , has a*quired a vocabulary of considerable extent , and begun to compreheud something of the idiom arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly aware that the instructer may do much to Hispire a taste in his pupils , as they advance in the study of the classics . But we are not ready to admit that nothing of this kind is successfully attempted in our own country . There are instances continually within our knowledge , of young men , who read the Latin classics with pleasure , and acquire such a discriminative taste in the idiom of the language , as to compose in it with as much propriety and taste , as are commonly to be found among the scholars of other countries . They may not indeed be as well drilled in prosody , and their memories are not stored with the same collection of favourite passages , which , in some foreign institutions , are committed for daily recitation . In every thing however which is most valuable in this kind of knowledge , whether it regards the understanding or the taste , we are perfectly confident , that there is , among ourselves , a continual succession of good scholars . The shameless absurdities of the writer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indiscriminate abuse of all our means of learning , he indulges in the same sweeping calumnies against the characters of our young men , who are acquiring a liberal education . To finish the picture of the seminaries of learning of the first rank in America , we must give a little sketch of the student 's manner of life . The time not spent at the classes , is divided between eating and drinking , smoking and sleeping . Approach the door of one of their apartments at any hour of the day , you will be driven back from it , as you would from the cabin of a Dutch smack , by the thick volumes of stinking tobacco smoke , which it sends forth ; should you dare enter , you will find half a dozen loungers in a state of oriental lethargy , each stretched out upon two or three chairs , with scarce any other indication of life in them than the feeble etfort they make to keep up the fire of their cigars . We know that there are other countries besides America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are surely no other Christian ones , in which it is an employment , and a substitute for all occupations , as it is there . In Holland and in Germany students smoke full as much , but then they study at the same tine . In the American colleges , it is the source of // an hundred evils , of waste of time , of drinking , of ill health , of clownish manners , and , above all , of a hahitual stupor of mind , that gradually destroys its faculties . ' Every one who has taken the least pains to inform himself , must know , that wherever there are from two to three hundred young men collected together for study , there will be some idle , and others both idle and vicious . This and nothing more is true of our colleges . The loathsome picture which is here drawn in gross caricature , in which are grouped together the whole body of our youth , at the public seminaries , contains just enough of truth to work up the writer 's fancy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of travellers among us , which , if it were not for the excess of human credulity , would be merely amusing ; but which , when we find them credited , and quoted to our reproach , excite a *just indignation . We can not believe that men of sound ju ( lgment will long suffer themselves to be imposed upon by this loose , generalizing process ; this induction of universals from a few individual examples , either in regard to national characteristics , or to the state of learning and morals in our literary institutions . It is time for foreigners to become more suspicious of the idle stories they are continually hearing concerning their brethren of these states , and to make those reasonable abatements , which are prompted by a liberal mind , and an impartial judgment . What false and extravagant opinions might we not form concerning the people and the institutions of foreign countries , were we to collect our data in the same unjust and partial manner . which has been pursued of late by English travellers and journalists ? So far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , they are much to be deplored . We do not mean to speak of them as matters at all inditferent . That young men from fifteen to one and twenty should acquire a habit of smoking . so injurious to health , and so liable to lead to intemperate drinking is truly lamentable , wherever it exists . The degree of smoking among young and old students in our seminaries may , perhaps , be about one fourth as great , as among the same number and description of persons in Holland and in Germany . ' Even this ratio , which probably exceeds the amount , we could wish to see very much reduced ; and , if we have been rightly informed , the // practice of smoking , like every thing else , affected by the fluctuations of fashion , is on the decline , we hope a rapid one , in our University . Certain it is , if this institution is affected by the state of society around it , the habit of which we are speaking , must of education which our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libraries . The last subject of importance connected with education is libraries . These are , for the most part , pitiful ; the largest in the country is that of Harvard college , which is now said to contain 25,000 volumes ; six or eight years since , it had little more than half that number , and this rapid increase affords a pleasing proof of the improving state of the institution . Next in consequence is that of Philadelphia , being the City and the Logan libraries unitc ( l , which make together , about 20,000 volumes . The Boston Athen*um library has 12,000 , and the Philadelphia about 6000 . Beside these , the remaining public libraries are those of the other colleges , which are all inconsiderable , from 8000 down to a few hundred ; those of the literary an ( l scientific societies , none of which are important enough to be particularly mentioned ; and , lastly , the social libraries , as they are called , being small collections of books , made up in the country towns by subscription , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched octodecinios , that are put into a gilt and lacquered box for children , an ( l distinguished by the name of a juvenile library . These out of the question ( for it is quite impossible to calculate their number , and they are always a kind of books of no importance to a scholar , ) all the other public libraries of every kind do not contain above 150,000 volumes , of which not more than SO , 000 are distinct works ; for , as they form so many different libraries , they are , of course , made up of multiplied copies of the same . This then is the whole compass of learning , which the most favoured American scholar has to depend upon . It is uncertain what is the number of books now extant in all languages we have used a library of 250,000 volumes , which contamed no ( luplicate , and it was so perfect , that it was difficult to ask for an author not to be found in it . The largest library in Europe contains nearly 400,000 volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he about right to estimate the whole number of printed books in the world at 500,000 . This being the case , America furnishes about one-seventeenth of the means necessary for extending learning to the utmost , and about one-thirteenth of // what the city of Paris alone affords . Another comparison will shew her poverty in a manner equally striking . Germany contains 30 millions of people , who have * millions of books iii public libraries for their instruction , exclusive of those of the sovereigns and princes , which are always accessible to scholars . America contains 16 millions of people , who have 150 thousand books for the same purpose . But the two millions in Germany are more read than the 150 thousand in America , and the result of the comparison will form the second part of our subject . ' This account we presume is numerically correct , or as nearly so as is necessary . Nor is it surprising that our public libraries are not larger , when we consider their age , and the disadvantages under which the books have been accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a century old ; for in the year 1764 , it was entirely consumed by fire . Previously to that period it contained many valuable books , and in some instances , perhaps , the loss has never been repaired . It would be extremely difficult , at this period9 to collect a library of the same size which would be equally as valuable , as that which now belongs to harvard College . Owing iii part to the munificence of Hollis , a great virtuoso , it contains more scarce and curious books than are to be found in any other library in America . What is now chiefly wanting , is a large collection of English books , upon almost all subjects ; for so inconsiderable are the funds appropriated to the increase of the library , that , for many years , there has been a most deplorable deficiency in this particular . It is some consolation to know , that nothing but money is wanting to Supl ) ly this defect , and to hope that the time is not very distant , when there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . In regard to the libraries of the other colleges , a rapid increase of books could not be expected . They are either situated in parts of the country , where there is not much wealth , or in small states , where there is little public munificence ; or they have been so recently founded , that they could not he furnished with great collections of books , consistently with other demands on their funds . The Athen*um library , iii Boston , which owes so muTh to the exertions of an individual , is an instance , perhaps unexampled , of the rapid accumulation of books , in a town of the same population . The collection too is of the most val // nable kind , arid remarkable for neatness and beauty . There are other libraries , of a similar kind , in severa ! large cities and towns in the United States , which show , that , whatever scantiness there may be in respect to original productions , we are far from being indifferent to the advancement of learning . Though our means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet we object to the fallacious calculations and results of the writer who falls under our notice , when he seems to estimate learning by a ratio corresponding to the number of books at the command of scholars . To say nothing of a host of authors almost worthless , during the whole history of learning , thousands of books concerning the arts and sciences are rendered useless , by those discoveries and changes , which leave nothing interesting , but what relates merely to the history of those arts and sciences , which may be found in any Cyclopredia . Add to this , the endless repetitions in a succession of authors , upon the same subject , which Sterue facetiously calls " pouring out of one vessel into another , " and the show of precision in the calculation is still more deceptive . We are very far from being reconciled to our poverty ; but we wish it to appear no greater than it is . Our sensibility on this subject has already been manifested , ( and we would fain excite the same feeling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wants we would not exaggerate , nor attempt to estimate them by the precise number of books in which she is deficient . But while she so liberally extends the use of what she pos* sesses , we can not doubt that her liberality will soon be rewarded , by an increase of her stores . The general remarks upon learning , in the second paper , whose title is prefixed to this article , are substantially true , and by no means derogatory . Learning ( does not constitute among us a distinct profession . No scholar , after he has ubtained his degree , is supported by any endowments at our colleges , merely that he may make it his business to furnish himself with literary and scientific knowledge , with the chance that he may afterwards turn it to account , and repay the patronage , by the honour he may reflect on his patron . For this luxury of letters we have not sufficient wealth . Our forefathers brought with them their share of the learning of their country , and made such provision for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their necessities re* // quired . In successive periods there have been continually learned men in all the professions , and able men ii* every department of public life ; and on every occasion which called for distinguisned talents , such talents haie been displayed . What more could be expected of a country less than two centuries old ,  --  a country in which overgrown estates are hard* ly known , and , if they are acquired , are generally reduced to several competent fortunes , by being soon divided among a number of heirs ? Sinecures are unknown in our institutions , whether political or literary ; and no man is allowed to fill a place in which it is not intended to occupy his time with its duties . Fr ' . ' m these various causes it happens , that our young men , before they receive a bachelor 's degree , generally fix on a profession , or some active pursuit . The professorships in our colleges are few ; and fellowships are not knoAII , except we gi*e this name to the few firnndafinns for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our public semina'ies . So infrequent is the demand for new professors , though it is now an increasing one , that a young man of talents never has any reference in his studies to a remote probability of becoming one of the number , and coflse ( luently his pursuits are directed to what is thought most useful , in regard to the profession of his choice . this circumstance , we appreheod* will account , in part , for the remark in the close of the following extract . The professors in the Universities form the only body of men of letters* and from them alone could learned works be reasonably expected . But their situation , it will be recollected , is not like that of professors in this country ; instead of half or more of the year in vacations , they have hut a small portion of it ; their duties are more laborious , being divided among a much smaller number ; they have no hood libraries to consul* , and . above all , they are obliged to work through life , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted *vi1h the manner in which the instruction and discipline of our colleges is conducted , must know that a great part of the time of the professors is consumed in private duties ; and so far are they from leading * life of ease , or even learned leisure , that they are generally em * ) loyed with their classes to the exclusion of any great literary u*de*takiogs , to which their own choice might di Vol .

Most of the business of the lecturers here , as well as every where else , consists in combining , arranging , and elucidating what is already known , in a manner , as they th ! nk , best a ( lapted to their pupils . Those therefore who have held the office of a professor for a fe*v years , have materials for books , which might perhaps do something to faeilitate the acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are engaged . The Public sometimes demands proots of the learned labours of professors in the colleges , and sometimes obtains them ; but the proofs must be sought chiefly in the improvement of those who receive instruction , for whose immediate benefit it is intended , and who are in general the only witnesses , whose testimony can be procured . Comwerning the comparative insignifluan our Iibra* ries , and the defects of early education , own have already made some remarks . We could wish that no reply were necessary , in either of these particulars . In regard to the first , we have said all that we intend ; and in respect to the last* our previous explanation accounts in a great measure for the alleged defects , and takes away munch of the seeming reproacli attached to them . The method recently adopted in several colleges of electing professors , who promised by their devotion to learning and science to fill the offices to which they were appointed with distinguished ability , and giving them opportunity to make preparation for their particular duties before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knoxded*e , and relieves those officers from part of the great pressure of respoimsibility , which is felt by those who , without long previous expectation , have been called to fill stations , whose immediate duties demand the whole of their time . The next subject of importance to which the writer adverts , is that of the learned professions ; an ( l , notwithstanding the barbarous state of education among us , we are allowed in these to have attained to no small degree of eminence and distinction . His liberality is particularly manifested in speaking of law and medicine . // 1819 . State of Learning in the United Slates . of preparation , in which most young men are when called to it , the country may well boast of the lawyers it has produced . In this protession , the deficiencies of education must be made up by after diligence ; no man can attain to a high rank in it without legal learning ; in spite of all the prejudices ot the country , and the general disposition to reduce the system of jurisprudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of England remains , for tbe most part , the law of the land ; and a knowledge of that , every one knows , can not be acquired without laborious study , by the mere force of genius , however great . In all the states where this system still continues in force , we find a learned bar ; and , although the lawyers entitled to this distinction are few , these few are eminently so ; and , to prove it , we refer to the common law reports of the cases adjudged in the courts of final jurisdiction in Massachusetts , Connecticut , New York , Pennsylvania , and Virginia . In some of the states , the issue of a suit depends chiefly upon the jury , and then the pleas of the counsel are of course rather appeals to popular feeling , than legal arguments ; these are admirable schools , in which to acquire a readiness of extemporaneous speaking , and great powers of that kind are often displayed in them ; but as courts of justice , they deserve not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed principally in their courts ; and the only written evidence of it is cOntaine ( I in the reports . Blackstone 's Commentaries , and many other of the English elementary treatises , have been reprinted in the country , with notes , pointing out the alterations or modifications of the English law by their statutes . The civil law is not used at all , and not studied hut by a very small number of curious scholars ; and , in general , the English books are the only authorities cited , except in the admiralty courts , where the early Italian , Spanish , French , and Dutch writers upon maritime law are often referred to . It is difficult to draw a just parallel between the American and English bars , for two reasons ; first , because in the former , the various departments of legal business are united in the same individual ; and , secondly , because their period of preparatory study is much shorter , and their means and system of education greatly inferior ; if proper allowance be made for these disadvantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered equal to the same class in England , in point of legal learning , and superior in extemporaneous speaking . We need not repeat what we stated so explicitly in the first division of our subject , that the well educated lawyers form but a small part of the whole number ; it is of this small part that we have been speaking , and upon them the wholo character and credit of the bar must resL ' // State of Learning in the United States . Sept . That the profession of law for a number of years inchided more that its share of men ot talents is prob*ibIy true , though , at present , * believe the distribution among the different proiPSsions , in this respect , is sufficiently equal ; and we can paint out , in all , a great number of bneil of ( h5-tingui*hcd and appropijate abilities for their several vocalions .

Excellence is every where comparati'e , and , there many are engaged in the same pursuit , the rivalries for the highest place are confined to a few . in each of the professions , in e*ery country , the great mass are contente ( l *xith mediocrity , knowing that all can not be first , and that they have not the capacity or the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the writer , who has occasioned these remarks , aims to say every thing good concerning us , with as many qualifications and deductions as possible , yet we do not see , if we interpret all the parts in consistency with each other , how he can refrain from the inference , that the character of the legal profession stands as high in this , as in our parent country . The writer next adverts to the connexion between the bar and the Senate , and considers the character of the latter . ' No country ever had occasion for a greater proportion of ' statesmen , and in none was political education ever less attended to . Three thousand five hundred legislators are constantly required for the general and state governments ; and , in the whole country , there is not a course of ' lectures , either upon their own constitutions , the law of nations , political economy , statistics , *r history , and very little public instruction of any kind in these // important departments of science and learning The bar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only requisite for a statesman is acquired , fluency in speaking . Want of the necessary knowledge is not the greatest evil arising from the want of proper political education ; a far greater one is , that men who have been pursuing a profession for a long time , are very apt to have their minds somewhat nariowed by it , and are theiefore not capable of taking such extensive views as politicians , as ought to be done by those , who are legislating for the whole community , and not for a particular class of it . *Notwithstan ( lin6 this defect , the Congress of the United *tates has generally been ( listinguished for the wisdom of its political ; neasures , and always for a large proportion of powerful and eloquent speakers . What more could be said of any government on the face of the earth ?

Such , nearly , has been the history of politicians and political learning in our own country . A fevv elementary treatises have been prescribed to students , in the course of their academic education , such as afford that instruction which belongs to every gentleman , who vvould acquire general information ; but it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident ; that they are self-taught , and that they prepare themselves for service as occasions offer . In a government like ours , it would be no mark of wisdom to create mechanical politicians , who might never be wanted . Nor can we expect much systematic exertion of this // State of Learning in the United States . Sept. kind , while necessity does not seem to urge it . Whoever will take the pains to review our legislative journals , our state papers , our diplomatic corresl ) ondence from the time that we were first obllo ' to claim the rights of Englishmen , and afterwards declared ourselves an in(lel)endent people , to the present period , will fln ( l 110 ( leficiency either of ability or of political learning . The praise of eloquence too is extorte ( l , which , though wild and unpinned , ' is as rich and luxuriant as the vegetation upon the great rivers of the west . ' This does indeed characterize our eloquence in part ; but it is as various as our climate , mal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the different portions of our immense territory ; partaking too of the respective advantages enjoyed for the refinement imparted by e ( lucation . Sometimes it glitters with all those rhetorical ornaments which receive their polish from the hand of taste , and sometimes with such as have all the rudeness of nature . Again it appears in the l ) laifI and forcible argumentation and inferences of sound logic ; and at other times it blazes with the fervour of passion , and is exhibited in the splendour of heated declamation . Such is the freedom of debate , that the speaker is embarrassed by little external restraint , and the natural and peculiar workings of the mind in the most distinguished speakers , on great occasions , are manifestly displayed . In regard to the medical profession ) ve ( lifer so little from the writer , that xxe shall pass to that of theology . Speaking of the clerical profession he says , Its comparative decline has been very great for the last twenty years , and it must be still greater for the future , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equality with law and medicine ; and how this could be done , it would be difficult to say ; - there are no orders of clergy , and hence there can be no hope of preferment to act upon the ambitious , and no promise of leisure to tempt the scholar . Itinerant preachers are continually gaining upon the educated clergy , even in New England , where the people are the sorberest , and in the other states they have almost succeeded in extirpatino ' them I he necessary that the profession is * * proof losing its attractions for young men of ' talent , time fact , that the only parishes now sought for , or accepted by such , are those of the cities , affords a conclusive one ; and a stm'on*er even than this is shewp by the records of the // annual academic degrees ; Harvard College first conferred tie* , rees in 1642 ; for the next succeedin* ei*hty-eight years , onehalf of the whole number educated there entered the church ; but , during the last equal period of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To confirm this fact , we refer to the catalogue of the graduates , in which the clergy are printed in Italics . This picture must he particularly pleasing to the admirers of the antichurch establishment system ; and it was for their gratification that we sketched it . We now return to the subj ct , which more properly belongs to us here to consider , and proceed to give an account of the state of learning among the clergy . Critical learning was not introducing into the study of theology , until within a very few years . The old American divines , notwithstanding their superiority to the modern , as classical scholars , relied entirely upon the English version of the Scriptures , and English commentators . Of late the German system has prevailed , and . the doctrine of inspiration being now renounced by many , the Bible is subjected to the common rules of criticism , and hence must be studied in the original languages . The character of the leading clergy is therefore essentially changed ; theological controversy , which was heretofore purely metaphysical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more exclusively professional ; and their sermons more in the style of exegetical lectures . This applies particularly to the Unitarians ; the orthodox clergy are not so learned , but they retain more of the old stamp ; their tendency , however , is the same way , as all the new theological schools now adopt this system of critical inquiry . ' Two things are obscurely blended in the first part of this statement , which in themselves are perfectly distinct ; namely , that the clergy constitute a smaller proportion of the educated men than formerly , and that they are men of less talents , than their predecessors . It must be recollected that Harvard College was for many years the only one in this new world ; that the number of its graduates was exceedingly small ; that a principal design of its establishment was to provide religious teachers ; that l ) OPUlatiOn was very sparse in proportion to its local extension ; and consequently that most par* isbes or churches consisted of a small collection of people . Thus we can easily account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to the w ole number of graduates , without so great an effect hem * produced by sectarian and itinerant preachers upon the congregational churches in the older parts of New England , as would be inferred from the passage we have 6ted. // We should not have discovered , without going across the Atlantic for the information , that the clerical profession has ceased to embrace its proportion of men of talents , or that the only I ) arislles now sought for , or accepted by young men of talent , are those of the cities . ' In consequence of a remarkable succession of vacancies in the Boston churches for several years past , a proportion of ministers has there been required far exceeding that which can generally be wanted ; and it is to be expecte ( l that these churches will command the most distinguished candidates for the sacred office . But it is a calumny. wholly unmerited by the rest of our clergy , to say that all the professional lalents are conlined to the cities , as they are called . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should attempt to practise upon foreign credulity by such a partial account , and one which indicates 50 little knowledge of facts . Equally destitute of evidence is the implie ( l assertion , that the clerical profession includes a less prol ) ortmrl of men of talents , than irk times past ; for if we except our scholars who come from the south , who are out of the question , because they have never chosen this vocation , we are so far from believing that there has been any material and constant change in this respect , unfavourable to the profession ; that , according to our best judgment , it has been rather gaining for some past years . Something is said concerning the superiority of the old American divines to the modern as classical scholars . This superiority may be real or it may he imaginary ; no proofiin of it are given , nor do we know whence they are to be drawn . But , according to what follows , it seems that the classical learning of the old divines was almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relied ( utirdy on the Ei gush version of the Scriptures , and English commentators , and that theological controversy , which was heretofore purely metaphysical , is now reduced to mere biblical criticism . It is not true that theolo0ical controversy is , or ever has been , confined either to the one , or the other . The writer before us has a great contempt of asserting any thing with qualifications . We presnn*e he thinks that this is time office of a little mind , arid that there is something much more great , arid elevated , and imposing in the method he has adopted . Still there is miot a little of the marvellous in the change , and in the ciremimstances of the change , declared to have taken place in theo* // logical inquiries . That the most distinguished scholars , as were the old divines , should pay no regard to the original languages of the Scriptures , and that their successors , though such degenerate scholars , should recur to those languages constantly , and apply to them all their philological learning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to become credible . But such are not the facts . Biblical criticism here , as in the older countries , has become constantly an object of more attention ; but there never has been a time when the study of the original languages of the bible has been thought of little consequence . Nor , on the other hand , did metaphysical theology expire after the birth and rapid growth of critical ; the former has still a powerful sway , and is employed in strengthening our creeds , and fortit*ing polemics of every beliet* The following recapitulation is given of the remarks on the clerical profession From the views we have now taken , it appears that the whole number of religious teachers in America is but about half what is requisite for the population-that of these , three-fifths are ignorant , deluded fanatics , who possess almost exclusively one great portion of the country-that the proportion of regular clergy is diminishing and the profession daily becoming less respectableand that the spirit of controversy and sectarism extends to all classes , who interest themselves at all in religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities in the other states , are still favoured with a respectable , and , for the most part , well-instructed clergy , but the residue of the land is a prey to delusion . ' In the older states , or in those parts of them that were early peopled , the regular clergy are neither diminishing , nor becoming less respectable . The population in many portions is stationary ; but where it is increasing , and the parishes have become too large , they are frequently divided , and provision is made for another minister . In the District of Maine , and part of New York , and in the Western States , where every thing is comparatively new , where the popula9 tion is scattered , and consists of individuals so diverse and opposite , that there are few kindred ties which unite them sufficiently to act together , the inhabitants are obliged to depend on itinerant preachers for what public , religious instruc** Vol .

These preachers are said to amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , we are fully persuaded , are well calculated for the service in which they are engaged , and produce a salutary influence in the sphere in which they move . At any rate it is calling very hard names , in the gross , to denominate them all , ignorant , deluded fanatics . ' The body of preachers , thus branded , are methodists . They are not learned , and many of them are apt to undervalue and ( lecry learning and learned theologians ; but this is not their universal character . *4e have known exceptions in our own vicinity ; and where they are remote from learned clergymen , and there are no interfering interests , it is probable that they are sparing of their invectives and contemptuous reflections . The spirit of contro*versy and sectarism ' ( or the choice and vindication of our own sect ) which is said to prevail among us , we conceive to be in no degree peculiar to this country ; for it belongs to all people , who enjoy any freedom of inquiry , and whose consciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy . It ' a bitter spirit is meant to be implied , this also is not peculiar ; hut the manifestation of this spirit is only occasional and partial , and as far as our knowledge extends , it is tending to amelioration , and has already been softened . Some of the subjects of the papers we are examining have been passed over , in order to include our remarks within reasonable limits ; and we have not time to speak particularly of what remains , namely , the productions of literature , science , and art , which are enumerated and commented upon . According to the writer 's own showing , taken in connexion with the age and circumstances of the country , we are so far from being ashamed of what has been done , or of what has not been done , that we rejoice in the promise given , by that which has already been accumulated , of increasing treasures . No evil forebodings disturb our minds respecting the advancement of learning and science , or ultimate success in works of genius and taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or regarded with general indifference ; and there is much more literature and science in our country , than the number and variety of original hooks indicate .

We wish for no such apologies9 nor distant foresight from them ; nor should we be at all astonished if they should be dL*appointed . As to productions of literature and taste , with a few exceptions , this is an age rather of critics and compilers , than of original genius . We hear perpetual and just complaints of bookmaking from our brother journalists of England and Scotland , and we would not do any thing to increase the cause of complaint . And though we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Byron , and Scott , yet we see frequent indications of native poetic genius , and tasteful cultivation , which sustain our hopes of more exalted lays , in times not far distant . We have no desire to see any elaborate and voluminona vindications of our country , in answer to the querulous faultfinding of foreign critics and foreign travellers . Confident that they can not long impose upon the most intelligent and impartial class of society abroad , we would rather wait for our vindication , as the result of becoming better known , and more fairly estimated . Vague predictions and dreams of future greatness are of little value , and therefore we shall not cornmunicate our own ; but that our country is far , very far from moral or literary degradation , is the sober conviction of our waking moments . Sometimes we are apt to feel impatient , that more is not accomplished , and that the learned labours of our countrymen do not make more show in the literary world ; but again we are consoled by knowing that literature and science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected , form a part of the occitpation of men in various callings , and that patrons of valuable learning are often found among those , who make no pretensions to it themselves . We dismiss these papers with the single remark , that , if the author be a citizen of the United States , we wish he may be better employed than he can be in exaggerating the defects of his countrymen , and gratifying the spleen of foreign sciolists , at the expense of those who have higher claims to his regard .
