He left a Corsair 's name to other times , Link 'd with one virtue and a thousand crimes  --  Byron . PREFACE . The following Dramatic Essay , for the principal attraction of which , I am indebted to the Poem of Lord Byron , is submitted to public observation with feelings of extreme diffidence and intimidation . I have always been an enthusiastic admirer of the writings of that celebrated Bard , whose towering and resplendent genius has illustrated whatever is beautiful in song , and like a " sentinel star has set its watch " in the brightest skies of Poetry and Romance . Among the many splendid testimonials of that genius , I know of none , around which so many brilliant recollections gather , as that of " Th Corsair "  --  I never read a line , or recalled an image of this magnificent production , without feelings of indescribable admiration . There is a witchery in the grand and terrific wildness of its incidents , a richness of imagination with which they are enveloped , that control as it were by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Byron , appears to me , to approach with no inconsiderable rivalship the gloomy Dante , in the delineation of those passions which live and breathe in the most profound depths of the moral structure of our nature . In the peaciling of those which are pathetic , his supremacy , I think , can not be disputed . The Poem of " The Corsair " is of itself , sufficiently dramatic , to have suggested the idea of rendering it suitable for representation upon the Stage . It was a subject , to which I had often anxiously wished to devote my attention , but although often " dream 'd of in my philosophy , " it was a mere thought , unassociated with any thing like a prospect of execution .  --  " Hours that dance away with down upon their feet , " unassailed by the embarrassments of a life of business , are the only seasons beneath whose warmth and sunshine the flowers of imagination burst into bloom and luxuriance . There is a kind of southern aspect in our fortunes , absolutely necessary for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own had not yet felt the influence of so lively and exhilirating a sky , the project was accordingly abandoned . I am indebted for its revival , to the solicitations and encouragement of a friend , ( the late Joseph George Holman , Esq. ) whose name I can never mention , but with emotions of the utmost tenderness and veneration . I can never forget the many kind and endearing testimonies of his affection . My heart is full of their recollections . Connected to him by the warmest ties of friendship , and happy in the reciprocation of an attachment on his part , as disinterested as it was noble and ingenuous , his premature and unexpected dissolution , overwhelmed me with the bitterest sorrow . My acquaintance with him , though comparitively short , was crowded with the improvement of years  --  He was a Scholar , and a ripe and good one , Exceeding wise , fair spoken . and persuading : Lofty and sour to them that lov 'd him not : But to those men that sought him , sweet as Summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endearing hours we have passed together . It feels as if a link were strciken from the chain that binds it to existence , now that he is no more . Had he lived , his critical and discriminating judgment , would have rendered this offering more acceptable to public taste : Now , that his face is hid from us , I dedicate it , imperfect as it is , to the memory of a man , the brilliancy of whose genius , and the excellencies of whose heart , are his best monuments .

Lord Conrad Thy song , Medora , breath 'd a strain so sad , So wild and melancholy soft , it seem 'd A requiem , such as best might suit The tomb of love ill-fated ! Medora . Medora Thus must it ever breathe , without the joy Thy presence sparkles o'er its lay  --  it must , It will give utt'rance to such thoughts as these . Oh ! many a night , upon my couch reclin 'd , When solitude had set its silent seal Upon the world , the slightest breath that mov 'd The bosom of the deep , seem 'd to my fears The prelude of a storm  --  Oh !

Medora . Medora This hour ?  --  it can not , must not be  --  the bark Hath hardly anchor 'd , and her weary crew Require allotment of sufficient time , To brace their spirits for a further cruise . Nay , trifle now no more with my distress ; Thy mirth hath sadness even in its smile . Be silent dearest  --  come  --  our board is spread ; ' T is frugal , but Medora 's hands prepar 'd it . Come !  --  Conrad . Lord Conrad Nay dearest , we must part  --  the hour of stay Hath near expir 'd  --  Gonsalvo brings report Of gathering prows along our coast , arm 'd By the Pacha Seyd ! we must to sea , And meet the tempest , e'er its thunders burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , Tried to the dangers of the fierest fight .

Conrad . Lord Conrad Again  --  again  --  and oft again , my love , If there be life on earth , or hope in heaven , I will return  --  be this thy comfort then ! Fear not , these are no formidable foes  --  Here , in thine island home , thou wilt be safe . A more than wonted guard shall watch its peace , And hover round its shores .

The fourth day roll 'd along , and with it came The roving bandit of our seas  --  we fought , They won  --  despoil 'd us of the wealth we had , And curst our limbs with chains . Time gave at length What hope so long had sought  --  The night was dark , The guard incautious , and a fisher 's boat Afforded chance of flight  --  I seiz 'd the hour , And heaven-directed , find my safety here ! Seyd . The Pacha Seyd How speed the Outlaws ?  --  stand they well prepar 'd To guard their plunder and secure their home ? Dream they of our design , to scorch with fire Their scorpion nest , and quench its flames in blood ? Conrad . Lord Conrad Pacha , the fetter 'd slave who sighs for death , Weeping the wandering freedom he had lost , Hath fate ill-opportune to play the spy ! I only mark 'd the glorious sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And felt my spirit waken , as I gaz 'd Upon his full resplendent orb , too bright , Too beauteous for my lone captivity ! This thou may'st judge at least . from my escape  --  The careless guards who knew not of my flight , May watch as idly when their fues approach  --  Pacha , my limbs are faint , and need repose ; Peace be with thee , peace with all around !  --  Exhausted nature pleads for rest . Seyd . The Pacha Seyd Stay Dervise !  --  stay !  --  I 've more to question thee  --  I do command thee  --  sit !  --  I must know more ! Food for the Dervise , Slaves !  --  thy supper done , Prepare to answer me  --  let thy reply Be full and clear . ( Conrad appears agitated for a moment , but instantly recovers from his embarrassment , and sits down in silence  --  the slaves in the mean time have placed food before him  --  he abstains from touching it  --  the Pacha eyes him attentively . ) Seyd .

Conrad . Lord Conrad Salt seasons dainties , and the humblest root , The simplest rill supply me food and drink . I dare not  --  nay , I would not for thy sway , Nor for the grandeur of thy Sultan 's crown , Taste bread with any . My orders ' laws forbid To banquet , save alone  --  these once transgress 'd , Our holy Prophet , would forever close The door of mercy to my pilgrim steps ! Seyd . The Pacha Seyd Well , as thou wilt , ascetic as thou art  --  One question answer 'd , thou may'st go in peace . How many ?

Lord Conrad ' T is answer 'd ,  --  well ye speed my gallant crew ! ( Slaves , guards and attendants , with Conrad 's troops enter promiscuously and in great confusion , sword in hand  --  the fight becomes general  --  the Pacha retires  --  and after a momentary and destructive contest , in which many of the Turks perish , they are compelled to retire also  --  Conrad 's troops remain . ) Brief time have we for gratulating speech ! Much hath been done , but more remains to do  --  The Pacha hath escap 'd and fled the fight . Pursue him on the instant , he must die !  --  See that a torch be plac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minaret to porch ! Juan . Juan ' T is done  --  Comrades , away !
