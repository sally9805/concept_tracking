Main text ACT I. SCENE I.  --  a SOOTHSAYER is discovered with a great number of magical books on a table , and among them the Roman History and Pope 's Homer , the latter of which he is perusing  --  he rises brandishing his clenched fist . Sooth . Soothsayer The greatest coward on the lists of fame , Whom I can find , is Thersites by name . And in my speech , to-morrow , if I can , I will compare him with that H  --  n . And let me think , for he must have abuse , Ca n't I compare him to the roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea  --  good ! A direful wolf , who licks his chops with blood . Blood is one theme , but I 'll lay greater stress On the immortal freedom of the press , Which will be lost , as I can have no doubt , If editors must have their brains beat out . Murder was in his heart ! I 'll loudly bellow , And cry , assassin ! like a lusty fellow : And , if the court will suffer , I 'll declaim Loudly against  --  " a deed without a name . " Nor , in the speech , will I remain at home , I 'll travel , first to Greece ; from thence , to Rome From thence to London streets I 'll bend my way , Where cockney pugilists despise foul play ; Where , if you give your foe , when down , a banging , The mob will leave you at a lamp-post hanging . But words are wind , which passeth soon away , My matchless speech in print I must display . Now for the means  --  where shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is night ; He whose broad shoulders can sustain , alone , A load of other 's nonsense with his own ? I think of one who 'll be a willing tool , Though he 's a standing theme of ridicule For all the bar  --  but then ( running his fingers in his hair ) the devil 's i n't . The speech is lost unless it 's put in print . " I do remember an apothecary , " &c.; exit SCENE II .  --  a cave strewn over with flaming political speeches , of old date , old commissions and turned coats  --  the giant GRUMBO has a long speech written , over which he is coning  --  he rises with a look calculated to draw " Audience and attention still as night , Or summer 's noontide sir . " Grum . The giant Grumbo Twill be my part , exclusively , to show What these cursed editors have done , should do ; This theme will give me license to portray The wretch , and drag him to the light of day ; " Vengeance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For in my hide he 's been a grievous thorn , Which often has my turn 'd coat badly torn : His press my devious course hath oft berated , A nuisance vile , which ought to be abated . This speech , which I have con 'd with so much care , Ought not to be consign 'd to fields of air ; I know a wight to whom I will repair . exit END OF THE FIRST ACT . ACT II . SCENE I.  --  discovers the KNIGHT OF THE RUM BOTTLE in an office , sitting by a table with three law books thereon , odd volumes  --  a lighted candle almost burnt to the socket  --  a rum bottle beside him , and in the middle of the floor a nameless vessel , three fourths filled  --  the floor six inches deep with dirt  --  and in the room a bed , unmade for six weeks before . enter SOOTHSAYER , in disguise . Sooth . Soothsayer Do I disturb thy meditations deep , Or have I roused thee from thy midnight sleep ? As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thou could'st manufacture speeches Which would reverberate from shore to shore , Shake fair Wyoming 's vale , and make the welkin roar ! Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle Thou flatterest me ; ( hiccups ) I 've done such things , ( hiccups ) but now Excuse me , for I feel ( hiccups ) I do nt know how . Sooth . Soothsayer What aileth thee ? I fear that thou art sick . Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle A constitutional disease , ( hiccups ) which quick Will end : ( hiccups ) I 'll further talk with you anon . Sooth . Soothsayer Speak quick : the glimmering taper 's almost gone . Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle To Susquehanna 's wave I 'll waft thy name , Place it on rec  --  ( hiccups )  --  ords of eternal fame : There 's one thing only of you I beseech , To help me pay the printer  --  write thy speech . One other thing  --  ( hiccups ) Sooth . Soothsayer Already there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers in his hair ) I fear that he will never do . ( at this moment the candle goes suddenly out , and in staggering about to get another , the nameless vessel is turned over by the knight ) Sooth . Soothsayer What , in the name of goodness , do I feel , In copious torrents rush against my heel ? ( knock , knock , knock ) GRUMBO enters , and the soothsayer , unperceived , passes him and escapes . Grum . The giant Grumbo ( feeling about in the dark ) " Fee ! faw ' fum ! I smell "  --  what can it be , that 's mix 'd with rum ? Zounds ! fire and brimstone ! which I never fear , It will not do an instant to stay here . he holds his nose , and takes to his heels END OF THE SECOND ACT . ACT III . SCENE I.  --  a court-room is discovered , crowded with spectators  --  when the trial is about half over , the KNIGHT The Knight of the Rum Bottle is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat himself at the table where the counsel engaged are  --  but , being denied admission , he seats himself exactly where he has no business  --  an understrapper in an attorney 's office , about the time the counsel commence summing up , also seats himself as assistant , and they pretend to write " short-hand . " They sit , and write , and roll their eyes about . And hear the giant roar and make a rout ; The roman soothsayer bellow , stamp and rave , And conjure ghosts of grecians from the grave , And repeat , six score times , " gentlemen of the jury , " And beat and belabor the air like a fury . exeunt . SCENE II .  --  discovers the FIELD MARSHAL in a room covered with bundles of newspapers . Mar . Field Marshal ( solus ) T was bad , t was monstrous bad ; I 'll go no further In making out that he intended murder , That Haviland and Groesbeck saw the whole : He struck with fist , before , upon my soul . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must haul in my horns , I may depend on't. enter the . KNIGHT OF THE RUM BOTTLE , with a proof sheet , which he hands to the marshal . Mar . Field Marshal What 's this ? Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle A proof sheet of your testimony : Pray look at it , and see if it 's erroneous . ( marshal examines it hastily ) Mar . Field Marshal It is wrong in every line and word , T is scandalous , ridiculous , absurd . Why , man , your sentences have no connexion , T is all a hotchpotch ; it defies correction . Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle The counsel now are writing out their speeches . Mar . Field Marshal The counsel ! sure : pray , sir , of them which is ? Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle There 's Grumbo and the roman soothsayer Have both engaged to furnish speeches rare : Then there 's Lothario . Mar . Field Marshal ( interrupting him ) Grumbo , did you say. ? Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle He said so . Mar . Field Marshal If he does as he has said , And you report , I 'll break your empty head : I 'll raise the city , and will storm your castles , Though stronger than a half a dozen bastiles . Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle There 's Grumbo , now . Mar . Field Marshal Let 's hear what he will say . enter GRUMBO . Shall you write out your speech entire , I pray ? For if you do , why then I know the course I must adopt , ( casting his eyes to a pair of holsters hanging up ) as sure as I 'm no horse . Grumbo . The giant Grumbo ( turns pale and trembles ) Field marshal , pray , why do you run so hard on Your servant , ' fore he speaks ? I ask your pardon . I hope that in the speech I 've not offended : To point at you , in no part was intended . Mar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel thing Gainst wives . And then , again you touch 'd on duelling : What did you mean , by matters of that sort You spoke of ? now I dare you to report ( looking furiously at both ) That speech entire in manner it was spoken . Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle ( aside  --  trembling ) I fear that I shall get my calibash broken . Grumbo . The giant Grumbo The speech , if any thing 's obnoxious i n't , Can be abridged before it goes to print . It shall be done ; and nought to public view Shall be disclosed which hinges ought on you . Mar . Field Marshal I thank thee , Grumbo : give me now thy hand , Let us on terms of former friendship stand . ( to the knight ) And now , sir knight , as yours is so erroneous , I 'll write you out my testimony . exeunt Grumbo and knight Mar . Field Marshal ( solus ) I almost regret that I engaged to do any thing in this business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , though imperfect , of an industrious man with some talents , who several years ago , commenced an original undertaking in this city , with whose business these gentlemen of the bar are about interfering ; for the knight , unaided by them , can do nothing . I have also too , on divers occasions , placed garbled statements of interesting trials , sometimes from hearsay , in the columns of my paper , and I have often endeavored to engage deputy clerks to furnish me reports ; and I have sometimes succeeded . And yet , again , sometimes I have infringed his copy-right by publishing from his book without leave . My conscience tells me all this is utterly wrong . exit SCENE . III .  --  discovers the SOOTHSAYER in his room in his shirt sleeves , biting his nails , sweating , pondering , blotting out , and interlining and fixing a long speech . enter GRUMBO , LOTHARIO , and ARISTIDES . Arist . Aristides Gentlemen , I perceive the course you are pursuing towards an industrious member of the profession , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is unjust and most ungenerous . He came into this city a stranger ; he interfered with no man 's business ; he commenced an original undertaking , and has pursued it with perseverance until this time . And the utility of his labors was appreciated by some , or one of you , on the late trial . It is his living . And now will you give countenance , will you aid , abet or assist such a creature as the knight , in making out a report ? will you thus trample on peculiar private rights ? I attended the trial , was neutral between the parties , and am bold to tell you , that it is unpardonable vanity in you , or either of you , to wish your speeches to appear ; for the court excluded all testimony of that to which the greatest part of your philippicks applied . Grum . The giant Grumbo Rights ! has not any man a right in court To sit , take down , and publish a report ? Arist . Aristides I do not deny but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain , that the unnecessary exercise of even a legal right , infringing on very peculiar imperfect rights , dearer , perhaps , to the possessor than legal rights , is unjust and most ungenerous . Why are laws enacted to secure literary property from invasion ? Why but to guard rights sacred , but in themselves imperfect ? Loth . Lothario I feel it 's wrong . Sooth . Soothsayer I almost think so too . Grum . The giant Grumbo But now we 've gone so far , what shall we do ? I 've finish 'd mine . Sooth . Soothsayer Not quite . Loth . Lothario Mine 's not begun , ( aside ) And if it were , ( laying his hand on his breast ) it should not meet the sun In the knight 's book . END OF THE THIRD ACT . ACT IV . SCENE I.  --  the curtain rises , and discovers the knight at a table covered with speeches in different hand writings , reading a note  --  he rolls up his eyes , and looks amazed . Knight . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning  --  sir , I have understood that , under the influence of Grumbo 's client , you intend to mangle , and mar , and misstate the facts . If you do , and neglect to follow , implicitly , my directions , I shall protest against the report . Beware  --  take care  --  how you rear  --  the raging bear  --  who will tear  --  for I declare  --  I will not bear  --  such things  --  ' ' From thee , sir knight . " By day or night , Or any other light , " With thee " I 'll fight . ' " ( rolling his eyes strangely ) I did not expect such a terrible volley , But appearances now begin to look squally . There 's no other way through this tempest to ride , Except to join in with the opposite side . exit SCENE II .  --  a counsellor 's office , a brick building adjoining a large brick house  --  the counsellor has a client consulting him  --  finding him busily engaged , the KNIGHT , on entering , begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in a few moments the client goes out . Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle I wanted to say ( hiccups ) that I 've made a report Of that case which was tried t' other day in the court , In which you was counsel , and made that great speech , Which I fear that no effort of " short-hand " could reach . Alas ! nought remains , but in mem'ry now floats , Of that great production , for I 've lost the notes ; And , there 's really no way the ideas to recover , Unless , my dear colonel , you write your speech over . Couns . Counsellor I write a speech ! I never did such a thing in my life . Besides , I 've no ambition that you should be my trumpeter . I tell you plainly , you 're a sot , an imposter . Do nt come to me about your speeches , Or else this foot shall reach those breeches. the knight takes to his heels enter a YOUNG GENTLEMAN , wearing a cockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that besotted fellow ? he is continually haunting me about his report ; and says my friend , the marshal , has abused him ; and he showed me a reply , wherein the sot sseems to disregard the marshal 's threats . I shrewdly suspect , indeed he intimated , that he wanted a bribe . Couns . Counsellor I tell you what , have nothing to do with him , unless you want a little sport by keeping him drunk . exeunt END OF THE FOURTH ACT . ACT V. SCENE I  --  the KNIGHT discovered in his office , which is filled with huge piles of pamphlets , " taken in short-hand "  --  he has a large new tin trumpet , fifteen feet long , which he is essaying to blow  --  on the table is a rum bottle , filled . enter SOOTHSAYER and GRUMBO . Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle T is done . Your fame to future ages Will pass . with my immortal pages . Not Sheridan , nor even Burke , E'er spoke such speeches as my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specimen Of that which flow 'd forth from thy pen , Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle ( reads ) ' Those scenes are past , and I do not revive their recollection to wound the feelings of any man ; it is now time , perhaps , that charity , with its mantle of oblivion , should cancel their remembrance for ever . ' Sublime ! Soothsayer . Soothsayer ( aside ) A fine mantle , indeed , this must be ; The nymph , doubtless , was airy and gay ; But then , its great use I ca n't see , In canc'ling remembrance for aye ! Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle Dear soothsayer , now , if you 'll be still I 'll read you something from your quill. ( reads ) ' What is about to take place within these walls may form a precedent , bearing with decisive influence upon the mighty question ' , ( 1 ) ' whether our country is henceforth to be the abode of peace or of violence ? ' ( 2 ) ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and juries , are to be the arbiters of justice ? ' Sublime ! Grumbo . The giant Grumbo What mighty question 's this ? you 've stated two ; And why are dirks and daggers brought to view ? I can not see their bearing or their sense , Nor dirk nor dagger was in evidence . Knight . The Knight of the Rum Bottle ( seizing his trumpet ) I do and shall maintain to th ' end of time , That this is grand , and lofty , and sublime . the knight , in trying to make a huge blast with his trumpet , and a rhetorical flourish , adapted to the rapture with which he is inspired , turns over the rum bottle and spills the rum  --  at the same instant the FIELD MARSHAL enters , sweating under a huge brazen speaking trumpet , thirty feet long , in the trumpet end of which he deliberately fits the blowing end of the knight 's trumpet , and fixes the trumpets carefully across the table , running the knight 's trumpet about ten feet out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast ) Mar . Field Marshal I 've just read the report , which in " short-hand " was taken , By that witch of all witches , the great mr. knight ; Though not free from error , ( blast lowered ) being in rum hogshead soaken , The speeches are nearly the same as were ( written  --  low ) spoken . And I now , on the word of an editor , state The report 's interesting , and most accurate . There 's one sad affair , a very great pity , Which with tears should o'erwhelm both the country and city ; Alas ! by the loss of his notes Footnote : 1Kb by the knight , A great speech is strangled ere usher 'd to light !
