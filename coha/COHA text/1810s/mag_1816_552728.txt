txt FOR THE NORTH-AMERICAN JOURNAL . THE Falls of Niagara have been often described ; but the battles that have been fought in their vicinity , and the Various fortune which influenced the events of the late war , have given a strong ad dit*nal interest to the scenery . We are l ) aIticularly flattered in being able to communicate the following extracts , from the journal of a traveller who visited the Ldkes last summer . There are several remarks that strongly depict the hurry of the feelings , the dizzying emo* tion , and the confounding grandeur of the scene , and we think the reader will perceive some picturesque circumstances in the account of the cataract , that have not before been noticed . We wish we could give the additional gratification of engravings , from some of the admirable drawings sketched on the spot by the writer . Niagara River has a great deal to offer to the lover of Nature , and a new interest has been added to its shores , since they became the theatre of war . The traces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and many a spot is pointed out , which was lately the scene of heroick achievement , or of memorable death . This river connects two of the finest lakes in the world , Erie and Ontario . Near its head , where it receives the waters of Lake Erie , on the American side , is the town of Buffaloe ; and the ruins of Fort Erie are scattered on the opposite shore . Eighteen months ago , not a house was left standing in Buffaloe . The men who sought shelter in the neighbouring wood , were taken prisoners or killed by the Indians , who lay there in ambush ; and the women and children fled through the snows of winter , beyond the Genessee River . Such of the inhabitants as survived , have returned with spring and with peace , to rekindle their extin*uished hearths . Buildings , of an improved exterior , cover the ashes of their former dwellings , and the town has already assulne ( l the busy and compact appearance , which distinguished it before its destruction . These buildings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coinfortable summer residence , and each will have several apartme , ts completed before the approach of winter . The point on which Fort Erie is situated , is sandy , with a few straggling houses and little cultivation . A small part // of the front wall of the fort , with an entrance in the centre , is nearly entire . The north east bastion was blown up , and its fragments are found at the water 's edge . The others are in ruins , and the ditch is half filled with water . Near the fort , on its norzh side , is a common grave , where Colonel Drummond , and a large number of the slain on both sides , are interred . At a little distance to the south west , are the remains of Towson 's battery , and behind* the fort is the wood , where the British encamped when they besieged the fort . The American traveller can never visit this spot without emotion ; he will look round for some one who can describe to him , minutely , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out the ( leep ravine and the difficult and till then impassable wood . He will examme the trees that are shattered , and the ground that has been torn up by the balls and rockets , on their passage from the , British camp to the fort . He will water the roses that are already growing on the soldier 's grave . In a few years , however , this ruin will be indiscriminately mingled with the soil ; or a new fort will stand in its place . New branches and new foliage will cover the dismantled trunk of the forest tree . The storm will have levelled these sandy graves ; with the beach , on which they are thrown up . The recollections of misery and the impulses of revenge , will be chased from the mind , by the blessings of peace , and the sympathies of friendly intercourse . Then will the curious and feeling traveller seek in vain for those vestiges of the war , either on the face of the country , or in the hearts of its inhabitants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions . Black Rock is nearly three miles below BuWaloe , on the same side of the river . There is a road to it along the beach , which in warm weather is very pleasant . A small part of it is through a wood , the rest on the edge of the water . A fresh breeze comes across its surface , which is blue and transparent . Graves are scattered along the beach , and the sand is so lightly thrown in , that it apgears as if the wind would blow this covering from the sacred deposit within . Just above Black Rock , the Niagara commences . The margin of the river at this place is a low ledge of black * The wood is north from Towson 's battery . The wood west , is the part where General Porter cut a road and marched his troops to at* tack British battery No. 3. *Tol It . No. 6. 41 // rock , from which the town takes its name . A steep hill i*ises abruptly from the shore , on which there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little distance is the scite of General Porter 's house . This large stone building , and many a comfortable log hut , were destroyed at the same time with Buffaloe. rj7here is but little cleared land about this place . The eminence commands a view of Fort Erie and of the Lake , stretching out to a vast expanse arid in the distance losing its blue outline in the sky . On the right are seen the Niagara , several small islands and Grand Island beyond . Along the upper division of the river the banks are not lofty , but they present together with the islands , a varied and beautiful line on the water 's edge . The Canadian side of the river is cleared , . and in some parts well cultivated* The American shore is still covered with wood . Oak , Maple , Elm , Butternut , Walnut and Cedar trees prevail . Now and then a log hut and cleared field gleam amidst the forest ; but the black stumps* around which the wheat is waving , show that the sun has for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil . The river is divided into two branches by Grand Island , which extt*nds more than two thirds of the distance from Erie to the Falls . This island is low and uncleared . Beyond this is Navy island * and Goat Island , which divides the falls , and many snaller islands . The bed of the river descends gradually , till with in two miles of the falls , and forms a gentle current . Here the aspect of its shores is tranquil . The faint mist which is seen above the trees of Grand Island , and the distant roar , which strikes only the listening ear , show that the danger and coiwnotion are far below . But on approaching the Falls , the scene changes . The roar deepens , the spray rises a lofty column of vapour in the heavens , the rapids , which commence about a mile above the brink of the Falls , now shew their white heads , and the current increases it5 force so fast , as lo threaten to bear the frail bark along with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently heightened by a thuuder storm . There is a landing and wharf a mile and an half above the Falls at Schlosser , and below this , navigation is impracticable . The houses and stores at this place were destroyed by the enemy . On the Canadian side , opposite to Schlosser , is Chippewa , which is a small settlement , with a harbour , and some barracks , // in which a few soldiers are stationed . In consequence of a bend in the rivet on this side , it is two miles and an half by the road from Chippewa to the falls . A mile below , is Bridgwater and the ruins of some large mills , which were destroyed by the Americans after the battle of Lundy 's Lane . Amongst these ruins there is a burning sprieg , the waters of which appear to emit suiphuretted hydrogen gas . This gas does not take fire spontaneously , and continues burning a short time only after it is kindled . At last you arrive at the falls . Many circumstances tend to heighten their effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied. , is dark , winding , and precipitous . That which leads to the east fall is through a cleared wood alon* the a edge of the rapids , of which there are frequent glimpses . On this side are seen a number of small Islands along the brink of the Falls ; all resembling vessels in their form some of them have the outline and nearly the size of a large ship . The rapidity of the water communicates to them the appearance of motion . You fancy this green fleet to be sailing down the stream , and expect every moment , to see it plunge along with the torrent , to the gulf below . The fall is divided into two unequal portions by Goal Island , the face of which is a bare perpendicular rock , of the heighth and character of the precipice over which the river rolls . It is narrow , ( 330 yards wide , ) but extends one third of a nile up the river , covered with lofty trees , whose tops catch the hues of sunset , long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old cedar tree on this side , from which there is so fine a view of the falls , is a sufficiently dangerous station , to excite powerful e ; notion . At a point , advancing a little way over the River , 10 or 15 feet below the top of the bank , the trunk of this tree projects abo* 30 feet in a horizontal direction . A birch tree runs out little above , par . allel with it , and serves for a railing . The branches beyond the centre , form a secure seat , hut on advancing towards it , the roots shake and appear ready to relinquish their ancient hold on the soil . From this romantick seat , suspended in the mist , 150 feet above the bed of the river , tkere is a profile view of the east fall , a front one of the horse shoe , with Goat Island , Table Rock and the foam beneath . There is no other than a profile view of the east fall , on this side The ladder which was formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now lies at the foot of the precipice . The descent , however , is practicable without it . The path winds down the bank of the River , on an abrupt and almost l ) erpendicular rock , of so unequal a face , as to afford a sufficient hold for the hands and feet , while the roots and branches which hana , over most of Ihe way , give an additional security . To this steep Cliff succeeds a bed of loose stones , and still lower are the slippery rocks , which rise immediately from the water 's edge . The ladder on the Canadian side , is entire , and reaches about half the distance , from the top of the bank to the water . The remainder of the way is over loose stones , which afford a very uncertain footing , where it is difficult to stand , and might be fatal to fall . The upper strata of the rock project far beyond the foot of the precipice forming an im* inense arch . Trees , shrubs , and vines hang over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the distance at which they are viewed , a uarrow fringe , to its brow . Little springs which rise in the ground above are continually dropping from this impen ( ling arch , far beyond the adventurer , who creeps cautiously over the loose stones at the foot of the rock . Other streams issue from fissures in the rock , and have deposited their layers of sulphur on the surface over which they run . If any one could reflect , amidst a scene so completely confounding , he would perceive that the loose stones like those over which he is passing must frequently descend , from the projection above , and that the smallest of these , from so great a height would crush Ihe head on which it fell . I learned after I came up , that half an hour before , a quantity of stones had fallen a few feet only from the spot where I sat to take a sketch of the Falls . At that time I was alone . The fishermen who had been busy on the Rocks and even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now returned , with their baskets filled . My friends , having engraved the scene on their memory , were not interested in obtaining a less perfect , though more communicable impression of it , When I found myself in this situation , the roar deepened , * the rock shook over my head , * Great God of Nature ! whose blest sun and showers , Call into action these tremendous powers , Where shall my tongue fit force of language find , To speak the dread sensations of the mind When o'er the impending brink , in hounding sweep , The eye pursued this deluge to the deep , // the earth trembled , with the sound and motion of an earthquake ; the elevation of the fall increased ; it seemed tumbling from the heavens The foam rose in more fantastick shapes , and the whole assumed to my imagination an overwhelming aspect . It was some time before I could command my pencil . I felt a sensation of awe which I could not long endure , and I hastened to return to a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I rejoiced on arriving at the top , to find the rays of the sun once more falling on me ; for though it was only a little past mid-day , the arched precipice cast a cold and awful shadow beneath . The difficulty of the descent on either side , is in perfect congruity with the scene . Indeed it should not be by a smooth and secure path , that the enthusiastick traveller arrives at the Falls of Niagara . His soul must be tuned by danger , obstruction , and novelty of situation , before it can be capable of the pitch to which it ought to be raised by this spectacle . The deep cavern , between the sheet of water and the rock , into which he penetrates , through a storm that is continually generating and bursting , from within , confounding every sense , and even that of feeling , with darkness and floise and motion . The torrent pouring from a height , which the eye can not reach , filling the air with this mighty tumult of roar and foam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , ( although that is hardly possible ) what an insect does he appear in the midst of this wonderful scene . A high hill rises on the Canadian shore , at a short distance from the River . In order to reach Table Rock , it is necessary to descend this hill , which is very steep , and pass over a marsh , on which poles are laid to designate the course . Often winding over stones arid marshy ground through brushwood amidst lofty trees , the path suddenly emerges to the day , and the whole scene bursts on the sight . Here the view is complete , although too vast to be taken Saw its white torrents undulating pour From heaven to earth , with deaf'ning , crashing roar ; Dash 'd in the wild and torn abyss below , Midst dazzling foam and whirling storms of snow . " Whie the whole monstrous mass , and country round , Shook , as with horrour , at the o'erwhelmingsouud . " " This , " says Wilson . the author of the Foresters and the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we lodged , which is more than half a mile from the falls , the vibrations of a fork , stuck in the board , partition were plainly observable across the room . " ? ort Folio , vol. 3. p. 180. // in at once . Before you , are the Horse shoe , Goat Island , and the east fall ; on the right the Canadian shore , as far as Chippewa , cultivated and fertile , interspersed with houses , gardens and rich foliage . Opposite , the A ! nerican shore , crowned with lofty forest trees , and in the distance below , the river gliding away in so unruffled a course , that one can hardly believe it has just issued from this abyss of commotion . Here the east fall , which appears so immense on the other side , shrinks in comparison with the horse shoe , and seems but an accompaniment to this principal branch of the River . The height of the fall on the American side , is between 160 and ITO feet , and its width about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , and its width not quite half a mile . Table Rock is a single stratum of lime stone , about a foot thick ; projecting several yards beyond the perpendicular precipice , and hanging over the gulf below . It inclines a little from a horizontal level . Here you may sit on the edge , with your feet over the chasm , and dip your hand in the torrent as it rushes over the brink . YQu fancy that the rock losing its slight hold , is sliding with you , down the precipice . You believe that you could sail on those clouds of vapour which are rolling around , and are almost tempted to make the experiment . The eagle is often seen here , flying in the mist , while his nest , secure in the unapproachable clefts of Goat Island , is rocked by the torrent , which shakes by a slight but continual earthquake , the adjacent shores . The prismatick colours are reflected from the spray , in different positions , varying as the sun advances in his course . At morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Towards noon , the rainbow floats on the surface below , and sometimes the foam refracting to the eye only the red rays , appears like a bed of roses on a field of snow . It was sunset when we first visited Table Rock . We lingered there , till not a purple lint remained on the column of mist , which rose high on the still air . There is such a flood of light reflected from this mass of white foam , that the falls are distinct , long after every other object is obscured . On returning , our path through the wood and marsh was hardly discernible ; but when we reached the top of the hill , a warm Push still coloured the west , and the evening star shed on us its brightest beam . This scene of tranquil beauty formed a tine contrast with the tremendoui* // one we had just quilted ; a contrast peculiarly grateful to our tired minds , which had expanded to their utmost limits of perception and emotion . Nearly a nile back of the Horse shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , commonly called the battle of Bridgewater , was fought . It is an extensive elevated plain with some small eminences . General Brown having been disappointed in the co-operation of the fleet which he had expected , changed his plan of operations and fell back from Q*ueenstown to Chippewa . On the 25th July , 1814 , the British collecting their forces , marched up the river and were met near Lundys ' Lane , by a detachment under General Scott-an engagement immediately commenced . As soon as intelligence of this reached itme camp , Generals Porter and Ripley pressed forward to his Support , but General Scott gallantly sustained the conflict an hour before their arrival . The whole army was soon engaged ; still the British force , commanded by Generals hall and Drummond , was superiour . The battle began about sunset , amid lasted till midnight , and is considered the most bloody which was fought during the war . Generals Brown and Scott were severely wounded , but did not quit the field . The eager combatants were unmindful of the departure o* day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its close , and shed a pale and doubtful light on the scene . Her rays were brightly reflected , from the polished arins* of the front ranks of the British , while broad shadows concealed the mass behind . Reinforcements arrived to the British , but the Americans could not ascertain their num bers . They opposed and cut down fresh troops , which advanced on them , but saw not and considered riot the force in reserve . The enemy 's artillery possessed a height of great importance ; colonel Miller was ordered to ( lislodge them . The regiment which was to support him fell back* Stifl colonel Miller advanced hrou*h the indistinctness of this light and shade . Bursts of fire flashed across the scene , from the mouths of those engines of destruction , and his mind collected at a glance rapid and luminous , as the lightening of the artillery , all the information requisite for decision and execution. - The height and the cannon were no longer in the possession of the British . During this night of horrour and destruction , the thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torrent , and the // earth was shaken , by a mightier force than the discharge of artillery or the trampling of the war horse ; and when the battle raged no more , and the moon on the verge of the sky ceased to throw her light on the dismal spectacle , the few who escaped unhurt , listened in vain for the well known voice , which should enable them to distinguish their wounded companions , amongst the heaps of slain . That awful stillness , broken only by the low moaning of the wounded and dying , which succeed ( ls the tumult of battle , had here no place . Every sound was confounded in the noise of the torrent , which has for ages passed over the precipice . This field of the battle of Niagara , is certainly a spot of as much interest as any our country affords . its proximity to the Falls of Niagara , the time at which it was fought , the numerous instances of individual heroism , the general valour of our troops , the superiour and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense proportion of dcad and wounded which were found on the field , offer a combination rarely to be met with . Two miles and a halt below the Falls on the east side , there is a beautiful view of them . Near this spot is a spring strongly impregnated with sulphur ; a small stream flows from it through a wood , tinging in its windings , every thing it approaches . A mile below this is a whirlpool . A point projects into the river , and forms a basin into which the water is drawn , producing a counter current . The river thus thrown on a rocky craggy bottom , whirls round , draws down every thing within its influence , and after some time , dashes it up again shivered to atoms . The river is narrower at this point , below the whirlpool , than in any part of its course , being less than one fourth of a mile across . The name of the settlement on the United States ' side of the Falls , is Manchester ; that of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles below Manchester , was burnt during the war , which was the case with most of the buildings at Manchester and on the road between . The banks of the river retain their rocky , precipitous character , as far as queenstown heights . Here they suddenly descend to a level margin , softening away in the distance , till they meet Lake Ontario . The view from this summit is very fine . On the top is a fort , and in the valley below , a village . // Navigation , * which was interrupted by the falls , recoinruences here . The river , which has been so long imprisoned by precipices , escaped from the lofty walls , spreads out to its former breadth , and widens in its progress to the Lake . Fort George on the British , and Fort Niagara on the American side , are situate six miles below qucenstown , at the mouth of the river . There is no settlement at Fort Niagara . Near Fort George are the ruins of Newark . This town , once so flourishing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and orchards , is now a scene of de*olation the most complete which the border presents . It is melancholy to think of the unnecessary destruction ot this thriving town . There was hardly a man in the place .. Women and children were its only inhabitants , and their houses were pluadered and burnt in the month of Decembei*-Not a fence or a fruit tree are left standing , and the ground is overgrown with weeds . Mud hovels , log huts and unfi ; ii*hed buildings afford a temporary residence to the inhabitants , amidst the ruins of their former happy homes . July , 18L5.
