THE following Drama was not originally intended for public representation , or in any way to come before the public eye ; it was undertaken merely for the purpose of filling up the leisure hours of a winter 's evening . Having completed it , however , it found its way into the hands of a late distinguished literary character , whose favourable opinion of the work in duced the author to introduce it on the stage , and the cordial reception it met with there must be our apology for issuing it from the press . The Drama embraces a subject which is calculated to awaken the feelings of the American reader , as it depicts some of the sufferings to which our sea-faring brethren were exposed prior to the conclusion of treaties with the Barbary powers . The scene lies in Tripoli . The plot is not founded on any particular fact , yet the strong allusion which marks the fifth act involuntarily brings to our recollection the magnanimous conduct of our brave countrymen , Commodore Preble and General Eaton , in the time of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drama is of a national cast , party reflections are studiously avoided , and such sentiments introduced as will be congenial with the feelings of every lover of his country .

O the dog , how he look 'd ; he had no sooner felt the lash than he seized me by the throat , and gave me such a terrible trouncing , that I really thought all my bones were disjointed , and that my soul was about taking a last farewell of my poor body .

O , it was a cruel thing to tear her father from her . I 'll speak to her . Immorina ! Immo . Immorina Ha ! is it you , good woman ?  --  see , ( shewing the miniature ) Suphalia , what a placid brow ; a countenance how serene ! those eyes too  --  do they not beam with tenderness and love ? Oh ! he was the best of fathers . Suph . Suphalia Yes indeed he was , and the best of men too . Why , now I remember when you were only eight months old , he used to call on poor old Suphalia , as he was wont to say , and would sit down , and talk so sociably , and tell so many wonderful stories that I thought him the finest man in all Tripoli ; yes , indeed , I did . Not great men , you know , Immorina , do n't commonly do so . ' T is very seldom they call on an old woman to prattle with her , unless , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkling eyes under the roof ! that indeed alters the case amazingly ! O yes , it does . Now I do n't mean to say . Miss Immorina , that your father used to visit me on that account . O no . Immo . Immorina Peace , peace , woman ! You distract me.  --  Leave me . Suph . Suphalia Leave you , Miss ! very well , indeed ! Why , I came here to chase away your stupid melancholy , and just as I become engaged in the matter , its " peace , peace , woman !

I had rather pass my days with that woman who could boast an intellect refin 'd , though she were glad in poverty , than with her , who abounding in riches , is beggarly in mind . Riches , in the world 's estimation , may purchase friends , respectability , esteem ; but can they soothe one agonizing pang , or shed one ray of comfort here ? ( to her heart ) Enter Servant . Ser . Servant A gentleman without wishes to see the Princess Immorina . Immo . Immorina Bid him walk in. exit Servant A gentleman ! Enter Suleiman . Immo . Immorina Ha ! Suleiman , my friend , my father 's friend , welcome , thrice welcome ! Inexpressible is the joy I feel in beholding him who shared so bountifully in my father 's esteem ; and yet , and yet it seems to occasion in this afflicted heart of mine , sorrow , deep sorrow ; yes , Suleiman , it brings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger to the vicissitudes of life , I knew none of its wretchedness and misery . Sul . Suleiman Great minds , Immorina , rise above the evils of this world , and look down upon affliction as productive of the greatest good . It tends to wean our affections from the intoxicating allurements of this life , and prepares us for the delightful enjoyment of unsullied happiness in another . Bear up then , Immorina , not sink beneath the weight of thy sorrows . The fearful storm which hangs over thee , may yet be dissipated , and new scenes of happiness open to thy view . Who can tell but thy father may yet return to save his country , and bless his Immorina ? Immo . Immorina My father return ! O , never , never . Sul . Suleiman The people may relent . Thy father may yet return . But whatever may be decreed , behold in me , Immorina , one , whose life is devoted to thy service ; who will never forsake thee ' till this fond heart shall cease to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thy father by the most sacred tie ; not only for the repeated testimonies of his favour , but by a sense of obligation which binds every good subject to his legitimate sovereign . And how can I evince my gratitude , my loyalty to him in any better way than by aiding his lovely daughter in the day of danger and distress ? Immo . Immorina Generous Suleiman , he was a tender father Seated on his throne , it was his constant prayer , that Heaven would so direct his course , that every act might prove a blessing to his country . I thought him too beloved by all his subjects . Sul . Suleiman And so he was , ' till cursed Ambition infused its poison into the breast of Abdel Mahadi . To him must be assign 'd the cause that wrench 'd the sceptre from thy father 's hand . Immo . Immorina What ! to Abdel Mahadi ! my father 's brother ! my uncle ! Sul Suleiman Yes ! the very same .

Yes ! my father 's fall shall be aveng 'd .

Of this thou canst not be ignorant  --  why then this emotion at the sentence of these captives ! Immo . Immorina No . Suleiman ; I am not , indeed , a stranger to that custom , which in my mind , is so repugnant to that pure spirit of moral obligation , which binds man to man , and teaches him to soften by his compassion , instead of aggravating by new tortures , the sufferings of an unhappy fellow mortal .

Cruelty is the darling passion of his soul . O Suleiman , cruelty such as inhabits this tyrant 's breast , can never be satiated till life itself expires . Sul . Suleiman ( aside ) Adorable creature !  --  Yes , too true , lovely Immorina . Immo . Immorina Hast thou seen the prisoners ? Sul .

But on this spot where first indignant rose Those noble hearts , who crush 'd their country 's foes , As warm though gentler feelings now appear The finer efforts of the mind to cheer . Methinks I yonder see a sneering wight , Who seems to say , " How stale our treat to night !

Some think , perhaps , the debt is overpaid , That deeds of gratitude should now be stay 'd ! Let them then name what monuments ascend , How oft they o'er a patriot 's relics bend , How oft , ( when Phoebus seeks his southern bound , And dreary winter , in his annual round , Brings to their view , that dark and gloomy day , Their country 's saviour fell to death a prey , The deep toned bell renews its funeral peal , And pausing cannon speak the grief they feel . Has it e'er been their wish their love to show No selfish motive do they never know ! Are they unlike the son who love ne'er felt , Whose heart with filial fondness ne'er could melt , Till his good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body part to meet no more ? Then burst his heart ,  --  the wound defies all aid , Till stocks and deeds and cash a plaister made , Which , when applied , at once removes the pain , And the closed wound ne'er opes to bleed again . You 've had this night presented to your view An humble plant  --  in native soil it grew : It rose amid the weeds of busy life And ne'er has felt the critic 's pruning knife ' T is here transplanted in primeval state , To Bloom or wither  --  as may be its fate Then , generous friends , your fost'ring arms extend , Pause , ere you censure , while you judge  --  befriend .
