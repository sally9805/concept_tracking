A neat apartment in the house of Delancy , situated on the banks of the Mississippi . Virginius . Virginius Delancy The alarm like fire , by a tempest borne , sweeps through the Union .  --  The flames of Washington will prove unquenchable , save with the blood of our relentless foe ! Delancy . Delancy England the boasted Bulwark of Religion , has tarnished forever the scutcheon of her glory . The mask of virtue has fallen from her face . The torch , the scalp , the tomahawk and the dagger , supplant the Lion and the Unicorn . Vir . Virginius Delancy But Jackson , our intrepid chief is in the field  --  New-Orleans will become the scene of glory ! ' T is there our country will redeem her honor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delancy South-Carolina may be justly proud of such a hero . I know him well , Virginius ; a very man of iron . Danger and adversity appal him not . They but elicit the resources of his mind and bring his soul completely into action . Behold in him , the gentleman and the scholar , the statesman , the patriot , the soldier and the hero : to make his character complete , the steady , stern , inflexible Republican . Vir . Virginius Delancy Our country has much cause to venerate his name  --  But look , here comes my sister . ( enter Carolina . ) Come , cheer me with your smiles : you shed a gloom on all around  --  ' t would seem that I were going to my grave ; not to rejoin my Regiment . Carolina . Carolina Alas ! my Brother , how can I but grieve to part with you so soon  --  We scarcely hail your arrival , ere we bid adieu  --  Stay with us I entreat , some few days longer . Vir . Virginius Delancy Impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These hours , passed in pleasure , have , you must know , been snatched from the duties of the camp .  --  You would not have me linger here , inactive , while fell invasion , unfurls her bloody banners o'er our peaceful shores . Car . Carolina Indeed , indeed , I would not . Could such a wish escape my lips , these cheeks would crimson with the blush of shame .  --  No , sooner would I meet my brother on the bier , an honorable tribute in our country 's cause , than clasp him forever in these arms , an idle , degraded , ignominious slave ! Del . Delancy Sentiments congenial to my soul !  --  Full well requited are the parent 's cares , who boasts offspring to maintain such precepts.  --  Let the invader e'en pollute our soil , still , fear need not affright the patriot 's soul : Though clouds of horror may o'ercast the scene , at length the sun of Liberty will rise and scatter them before his brilliant rays .

Arbuthnot ' T is terrible to hear the tales these fellows sometimes tell !  --  Last night , a chief brought in five scalps .  --  His account ran thus :  --  I could relate indeed many such . He arrived at a farm , about the close of evening . A woman , the mother of three small children , one at the breast , refreshed him with a bowl of bread and milk .  --  The husband presently came in : he had been at work in his field , and had been in Jackson 's famous Indian Wars . Amb . Ambrister He made him , I trust , repent his patriotism ? Arb . Arbuthnot Mark the sequel .  --  His wife flew into his bosom . His children clung about his knees .

Arundale We 're anxious to learn .  --  M'Cra . M'Craig Draw near .  --  This cypher , by express , from friend Morales of Pensacola will explain the whole . Mark the purport  --  Sir Edward Packingham and Admiral Cochrane , with an overwhelming force , are at this moment off our coast . Arun . Arundale Indeed ! M'Cra . M'Craig New-Orleans , the object of attack .  --  Arun . Arundale And falls inevitably ! M'Cra . M'Craig Should success attend their arms , as a reward for our long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours . Arun . Arundale Save for their General here , all our designs might prosper : but , he is a very Argus . I hate to look at him , though often sure to meet his eye ; and then , he seems to read my inmost soul . M'Cra . M'Craig Proud , insolent and overbearing , he yet maintains a magick spell over the hearts of men . He makes them soldiers by a glance , and those who have ever fought under his command , seem truly to adore him . Col. Coliel Still , I suspect , like the samed Corsican , he will be found at heart , a coward .  --  But to the point .  --  Our plans  --  M'Cra . M'Craig Them have I digested well . The arrival of our British friends made known , our work must be , to spread the alarm ; to exagerate the number of the enemy , and the warlike prowess of their Generals ; while we decry our own Say now , lord Hill , then , that lord Wellington commands . Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and scatter discord , discontent and terror through the land . Foment existing party strifes ; ( of which , God knows , enough exists already ) and thus between the contest of republican and federal views our main design may prosper . Col. Coliel ' T is sketched out with a master 's hand ! M'Cra . M'Craig Those , favorable to our views , will rally . The Patriot , in despair , will yield the contest , while lukewarm thousands , will await the issue , and join that cause which prospers . Arun . Arundale No effort should be spared to clogg the wheels of Government .  --  Our friends are numerous : some hold important stations in the State , and even join the Legislative Council . By hopes , or fears , or bribery , men , though not wholly ours already , shall prove subservient to our views . M'Cra . M'Craig The Legislature now in session , must be managed with some dexterity and skill . Arun . Arundale Throw every obstacle in the way of our Indian Hero .  --  M'Cra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vigilance and zeal : obstinate from childhood !  --  Our only hopes , are , that he fall a victim to the impetuosity of his own rash temper . Col. Coliel Would that some Spanish stiletto would relieve us ! Arun . Arundale What !  --  Col. Coliel Not that I would assassinate , but  --  Arun . Arundale The hint deserves to be improved . M'Cra . M'Craig Turn it in your thoughts .  --  Meantime , make known to friend Morales , whate'er is passing here . He will arrange with Nichols , Woodbine and their worthy colleagues , Arbuthnot and Ambrister , to disclose all secrets to the fleet . Col. Coliel A curse say I , on all Republican Institutions ! Arun . Arundale Amen !  --  They suit not-men of bold , of daring and aspiring souls . M'Cra . M'Craig But let 's away ! We must be active , if we wish to thrive . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE II .

The reestablishment of the old fort at Balize , can not command the river , so I find , as to prevent its being ascended . Jack . Major General Andrew Jackson Let fort St. Philip 's then , be thoroughly repaired and fortified  --  Let the thick growth along the banks , where old fort Bourbon stood , be cut away , and works thrown up , upon that side defended by heavy ordnance . Hay . Col. Arthur P. Hayne Should the Enemy assail us through the Mississippi ; our works at Terre au Boeuf , and at the English turn , aided with flying artillery and fire ships , will be sufficient to arrest their progress . Jack . Major General Andrew Jackson The works proposed , complete , never will our invaders reach the City . Hay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Commodore Patterson , has fulfilled your orders . Lieutenant Jones commands the Gunboats , Captain Newman the fort at Petit Coquille .

Jack . Major General Andrew Jackson In the event of an attack , from that direction , the Rigolets must be defended to the last ! Hay . Col. Arthur P. Hayne Give to our brave aspiring Tars an opportunity , the Rigolets of Lake Borgne , shall vie in glory , with the Straits of Salamis ! ( Enter a Soldier . ) Sol .

Major General Andrew Jackson Difficulties are incidental to important stations : promptness , decision and energy , their only remedies . Clai . Wm . C. C. Claiborne I have a most difficult people to manage  --  Americans , Frenchmen , Spaniards and Englishmen , compose the mass of this population . Among them , much jealousy exists , and differences , as great , in political sentiments , as in their language and habits . Jack . Major General Andrew Jackson This heterogeneous mass , by the chemical spell of military dicipline , must nevertheless amalgamate !  --  The Citizens of New-Orleans , must and shall defend their rights ! Clai . Wm . C. C. Claiborne With deepest mortification am I compelled to own , that , even our Legislative body , is politically rotten ! The Corps of the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were encouraged in their disobedience , by the legislature itself . At present , my hopes rest only on the prompt movements of the Regular forces under your command , and on the militia of the Western States and Tenessee . Jack . Major General Andrew Jackson Men who rely on others to protect them , cease to be Freemen . It is the boasted privilege of Americans to defend their rights in person : never let us trust the sacred charge to hirelings . " The surest defence which seldom fails of success , is a firm rampart of high minded and brave men " with such , New-Orleans can never fall ! Clai . Wm . C. C. Claiborne In refusing to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act , the Legislature , avow a disposition , to embarrass and paralize the military energies of the Country .
