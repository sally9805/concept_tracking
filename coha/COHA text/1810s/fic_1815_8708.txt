WHEN the young muse her early notes would sing , Or spread with modest fear her untri 'd wing ; Let critics aim not at her youthful flight  --  Let candor hear , she seeks but her delight . Vice may behold her hated picture here , And Folly learn to stay her mad career : While warm 'd by virtue , here the gen'rous mind , May see how great it is to bless mankind : How fair is Valor , when her arm she rears , To save her country and the world from tears . Then from our country 's dangers , woes &; crimes , A while look back on Europe 's troubled times .

The star of hope is setting to mankind . And Freedom flying sees no ray behind . When lo ! a race to Csar 's yoke unknown , Come forth to hurl the monster from his throne . Then heaven-born Faith descends to earth again , To aid her sons in breaking Europe 's chain . Their cause she hallows and inspires their souls , The dark fiend trembles and his arm recoils . Shoutings are heard in Freedom 's sacred name , A light she sees  --  ' t is Moscow 's holy flame . Again a smile of joy illumes her eye : Again she spreads her wings to leave the sky . Down to the earth she bends her course once more , The glittering sword of justice goes before  --  The hosts of heav'n behind : While at the sight , The warrior 's arm is nerv 'd with double might .

When the magnitude , number and recency of the events which happened during the emancipation of Europe are considered , and that in writing a tragedy on such a subject , the unities are necessarily violated , it is hoped that the public will not look with too severe an eye on this first  --  and last-poetical effort of a youth . The poplar of the valley can not bear a blast like the oak on the hills ; and if the first be left unmolested , it soon decays of itself . To lighten the load of misfortune by endeavoring to forget that it was imposed , this piece has been written ; and whatever be its fate , the alleviation it has afforded in many a dejected hour , is ample compensation for the labor bestowed upon it .

City of Paris . General Lescourt and Senator Rainouard . ... Lescourt 's seat . Lesc . General Lescourt WHY does the wrath of heaven still fiercer burn Against unhappy France ! Will ne'er her guilt Be washed away , till all her blood is drained ? O friend Rainouard ! I had lately hoped This dark assassin of our country 's peace And man 's repose , would soon be forced to feel The dreadful stings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilds and snows , There dwelt a race , unyielding as their clime : Who never crouched beneath the Csar 's arms , And whom a tyrant never could subdue . But hope fast flies . Again he 's conqueror  --  The Russian army flies and Moscow 's towers Now view Napoleon 's colors waving there . On Borodino 's field the united force Of Russia stood and mixed in horrid strife , Excited by the wild fire of despair . But ' t was her final struggle . There she fell Like tyger twisted in a serpent 's coils . And now what hope is left ? If thou , my friend , Canst see one feeble glimmering ray , O say , From whence it springs . Rain . Rainouard Perhaps I am inclined To look on objects in a fairer light Than reason will approve . But yet despair Has seized me not . Still through these thickening clouds A vista shines . From Russia yet I 've hope . Behold her mighty empire  --  how it spreads O'er half the globe . If but her prince , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well Attempt to stop the motion of the earth , As her to conquer . Lesc . General Lescourt True : but that arch fiend Has ever spread corruption ere his arms . Like thee I once believed , nor arts , nor wiles , Nor intrigue would a sturdy Russian move . But guarded by his virtues and his snows , No bribes could tempt him &; no arms could force : Yet even there , a minister of state Has sold his country for Napoleon 's gold ! Rain . Rainouard But not alone to Russia do I look . What if she fall ? Is not Brittania firm ? That Eden of our world ? that prince of isles ? That fairest pearl rising mid the ocean 's waves ? Dost thou not see her stand and lift her head Like Chimborazo calm above the clouds ? In vain the waves of mad ambition dash And foam against her shores invincible . Her empire 's bounded by no sea  --  no clime . Wherever waves arise or breezes blow Her flag is seen . Her thousand ships convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom 's sweetest sounds are ever heard , Mixed with her canon 's roar . To her the eyes Of millions bound in fetters now are turn 'd . To her proscribed thousands fly and cling As sailors to their boat , when wreck 'd and toss 'd Amid the waves . Nor do they cling in vain . For though all other nations hend their necks , Yet sooner than submit , her towns in flames She 'd wrap , and in a mine as deep as ocean , Plant such a mass of fierce combustibles , As by explosion would uprend her isle And leave the waves to flow upon her ruins . Lesc . General Lescourt Well do I know that England long has been The strong Thermopyl of all the world . But as the monarch of the Indian woods Attacked on every side , at last sinks down Beneath his countless wounds , so Britain soon Must fall . E'en now she totters o'er her grave . Rain . Rainouard England indeed must struggle giant like To keep her balance . But her struggle 's short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to one man . Power , like balloon , When swelled the most , will soonest , easiest burst ; Ambition too , like fire , when gratified the most , The quicker spends the fuel which supplies . Think'st thou that Bonaparte can long retain An empire so immensely great and huge , Stretched from Gibraltar 's to Kamschatka 's straits , And from the polar ice to the warm shores Of antient Greece ? Lesc . General Lescourt Thou hast then hope that France May breathe again  --  the long , long night of gloom Soon end , and from his exile Louis come , To sit upon his father 's throne . I own Thy reasoning strong , and fondly wish it true : But I have looked , and hoped , and prayed in vain So long that now dejection 's midnight gloom Enshrouds my soul . Indeed , in this strange age , Events so counter to right reason fall , That all statesmen 's skill to ken what will be , From what is past , is but delusion vain ; And no prognostications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonaparte . Rain . Rainouard Yet think not hence that justice ne'er will wake . Think not that God from earth has turn 'd his eye . For hung between the heavens and this world , Enclosed by adamantine wall , as thick , As firm as pillars of the skies , there is A bolt of thunder forged in deepest hell , And fraught with mass immense of matter fierce That burns unquenched in the infernal realms : And when the Almighty wills , he bursts away The bars that hold the thunder struggling hard , And pours the bolt upon the tyrants head , With peal so loud that e'en the stars of heaven tremble . Or else with wrath more fierce , he grasps the sword That hangs forever by his side , and drawn , Reflects the bright effulgence of the skies , With such a vivid light , that not the eyes Of mortals nor immortals can endure . This , once with dreadful sweep , round heaven 's expanse he waves . Then down through space , gleaming like meteor , He strikes as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conqueror 's empire and his all . Lesc . General Lescourt Still in high heaven I 'll fearles trust  --  still hope , That soon the Almighty 's arm will be upraised To hurl this monster down , and that kind peace Will bind the wounds of this our bleeding land . But friend , canst thou here longer bear to sit A senator , to vote as Bonaparte Commands , and see him swelled like filthy toad , And casting forth his venom on the good ? For me , it is too much to hide the flame , Which would indignant flash upon that worm , That mud sprung reptile , who the face of kings Slavers so bold , and casts his gauntlet forth Defying heaven . I can not , will not hold , O'er his artillery command but few days more . Long have I done it  --  hoping that the hour Would shortly come , when I might turn its rage Upon his guilty head . Then let us friend , A short time quit this France , until the storm Is overblown , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom greet the ear , And all the wretched find a sure relief . Rain . Rainouard That thought my friend , has long engaged my mind . I give a full assent to such a plan . Lesc . General Lescourt Must I then leave thee , O my native land ? Ye pleasant plains of France ! ye lofty towers Of Paris , and this birth place of my sires ! Yes , I must leave thee , writhing , half devoured Within a bloody tyger 's jaws . But hark ! ( Sound of a trumpet . ) What 's that ? Look , ' t is a courier from the north ; He goes direct to Talleyrand 's . Rain . Rainouard I 'll haste To seize the news . Lesc . General Lescourt Seek first if Russia 's conquer 'd ; Then for the safety of my only son , The captain of chasseurs . Exit Rain . Putting his hand on his breast . A tumult here , Forehodes that all is lost . What ! Russia fallen : My son destroyed ; unwilling victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tho't , too cruel To endure ! Now faithful bitter memory paints That son 's last agonizing look , when forced By stern conscription 's lash , he left my arms . With tears upon his cheek &; on his brow despair , To heaven he turned his eye , and call 'd his God To note , that never would he dye his sword In Russian blood . For me  --  for me alone , He went ; else I should helpless have been forced Upon a cruel world , to beg  --  to die . Alas ! Why did I bind him not at home , And immolate myself , now far advanced , On mad ambition 's altar ! Enter Rainouard . Rain . Rainouard Joy , Lescourt ! Napoleon is defeated . Lesc . General Lescourt What ! What 's that ! Rain . Rainouard The scourge of earth is on the full retreat And has at last been overthrown ! Lesc . General Lescourt Thanks , thanks To heaven ! But by whom ? by God or man ? Rain . Rainouard By both combined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snow ; by hunger and fatigue , And all the woes that heaven e'er sent to blast A murderer of mankind . Lesc . General Lescourt Impossible ! But how canst thou be sure this news is true ? For ne'er did Bonaparte confess defeat . Rain . Rainouard This once his bulletin declares the truth . Here is an extract from his own account . Lesc . General Lescourt Is this a dream , or is it real ? Heavens ' Dare I believe Napoleon beaten flies ! That monster who so long has set at nought The power of the Almighty and of man ? O thought , transporting beyond bounds ! but is The imperial robber like to escape ? Rain . Rainouard ' T is doubtful : for the Russians press him close On every side , and hosts of Cozaks rise Like Hydras round his flying troops . Lesc . General Lescourt And what Said Talleyrand ? Rain . Rainouard Not much . He walked the room And seemed dejected quite ; but every time He turned his face away , I saw him smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle and more dark , Than all the labyrinths of old . But friend , Thus long impatient I 've delayed to enquire If my dear son he safe , that private grief Might not impair my joy , at news so sweet To France and to a suffering world . Rain . Rainouard And I , For that same reason have been silent too . Lesc . General Lescourt Oh ! then he 's dead . Rain . Rainouard On Borodino 's field He either fell or yielded to his foes . Lesc . General Lescourt Alas ! There were upon that dreadful field No prisoners made . It was the field of death  --  The vast and horrid Golgotha of Europe . Ah , yes ! my only child , my refuge , staff , Support in years , has fallen far away From home and friends ! His mangled limbs now find No one to place them in the earth , or raise An humble stone . His winding sheet is snow  --  His funeral dirge the northern wintry blast .  --  But now is not a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a light has burst , More cheering to the patriot 's eye and heart , Than morning twilight 's first faint ray to him , Who all night long has wandered without path , Mid storms and darkness and wild beasts of prey . SCENE II . Talleyrand Talleyrand alone in his Palace . Well , as I 've long expected , ' t is now sure . That Bonaparte has been completely gull 'd ; Caught in a trap with Moscow as a bait . Now will he recollect what I advised ; Not rashly to attack the Russian realm , Till I should reign by intrigue in its court . But he was so much dazzled by his power , That he was blind ; by vanity so swelled , That plain I saw he soon must burst Himself He felt a God , and strove to lift his head Above the clouds . With eyes on heaven fix 'd , He ne'er looked down to see the pit , in which He now has headlong plunged . Should he escape , He will I trust return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature , A base born Corsican usurping power . Then will he meek implore my powerful aid , To reinstate his empire crumbling fast . Once I 'll exert my strength . Within a month Corruption , disaffection , shall be spread Thro ' Russia 's utmost realms . With all her blood The taint shall mix , and fix disease and death In every limb . For never yet did king Or state withstand the intrigue I possess . Footnote : 1Kb And if a heaven there is , I could e'en make Confusion there . Now will I go to assure The Empress that her husband triumphs still . For while the tyrant lives , each dire defeat , We must proclaim and swear is victory great . SCENE III . Empress Maria Louisa Maria Louisa alone . ... Palace of Thuilleries . Why have so many days and even weeks Elapsed , since my dear Emperor has sent A herald of his victories won ? Do yet Those Russians dare resist ? Deluded men ! I mourn their dreadful fate , if more they rouse The wrath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whom to oppose is to resist The will of heaven . I did expect ere this , That my Napoleon , victor would have come From his last conquest , and no more to leave Domestic joys , for tumults , toils , fatigues , And dangers of mad war . Enter Talleyrand . Tall . Talleyrand All hail , our Empress Queen Illustrious ! Louisa . Maria Louisa What news , our noble prince ? Is there yet nothing from the north ? Tall . Talleyrand This hour A bulletin arrived . Louisa . Maria Louisa Hah , tell me quick What it contains . Tall . Talleyrand The Emperor has made A movement retrograde , that he might come More near the sources whence he draws his power , And be prepared the sooner in the spring To march to Petersburgh . In all his course The snows are stained with Russian blood : And now their army is almost annihilate . Each moment hence I shall expect him here . Louisa . Maria Louisa This news , my prince , throws off a heavy load That late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Emperor sent to me ? Tall . Talleyrand His time would not permit . His mind is filled With projects vast , and wars yet unbegun . O , when a soul like his exists on earth , Why do the wheels of time so swiftly move ! Why is the frame that holds a spark so bright , Not made like Hercules , invulnerable ! But didst thou fear , O Empress of the world , That Europe 's king , thy husband , was repulsed ? And that the Russians had drove Frenchmen back ? As soon the flinty tower and Alpine hills Shall sink with age , as his proud empire fall . But I must go ; for things of high import , On which the fate of kings and empire hangs , Demand the constant efforts of my soul . Exit . Louisa . Maria Louisa Soon will these arms contain thee , O my love . But will he go again to cruel war ? What means it that the Russians still hold out ? What is a movement retrogade ? Most sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be almost destroyed . How ill do these agree ! Who knows but this Is all a plan to hide defeat and death . When Talleyrand speaks falsehood , and when truth . Who can decide ? For from his slippery heart His tongue is far removed as east from west , As heaven from earth . Indeed , were all the art Of Hell combined to form a soul like his , So subtle , wily , dark , intriguing , bold , So crooked and so base , yet strong and great , I 'd stake this realm the effort would be vain . This man my husband justly hates and dreads , And never would employ him in the state , Were not his talents so immensely great . SCENE IV . Gen. Lescourt and Rainouard . ... Lescourt 's seat . Lesc . General Lescourt Why in this life is every joy with woe So linked ? Why does fair pleasure always bring Rough misery in her train ? God might have made With equal ease , man heir of happiness Complete , nor mixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose a thorn is ever join 'd To guard it from too eager grasp of men , So pain attends each joy , for our defence Against prosperity 's too mighty flood : For as we can not bear the unclouded rays Of the meridian sun , so neither can we The too bright beams of fortune ; and who meets No woes , soon blinded , wanders from his path , And tumbles in the gulph of vice and ruin . If in a happier sphere our lot had been , Some other race would now form this our link , Or the vast chain of being be destroyed : And ' t is more just that we should fill this blank , Than any creatures else . Lesc . General Lescourt For you who mourn No son nor friends , such reasoning may suffice . Philosophy is good while men are free from woe ; But when affections tender ties are burst , When the dear , loveliest objects of our hearts Are torn at once forever from our sight , Rejecting reason 's rigid reign , we give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And seek no joy , except " the joy of grief . " Rain . Rainouard True , sorrow like the deluge of the world , O'erwhelms the most of men ; but there are some , Safe in the ark of pure philosophy , O'er whom the waves mount not . When Socrates Drank down his mortal , pois'nous draught , he smil 'd As though ' t were nectar ; and he seemed as one Not sinking to the grave , but rising fast To heaven . But who comes there ? It is your son ! Lesc . General Lescourt Impossible ! Good heavens ! It is his shade ! But I will fly to its embrace , though't prove A fury from the lower world . Enter Capt . Lescourt . He flies to embrace his father . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt My father ! Lesc . General Lescourt ' T is substance ! ' T is my son ! It is no spirit ! Rain . Rainouard Indeed it is Lescourt ! Most welcome friend ! We greet you Sir , as risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lescourt Hail noble senator ! Lesc . General Lescourt Almighty God ! My son who late was dead , thou hast restored ! From my full heart , receive unbounded praise ! My child , dost thou yet live ? What angel saved Thee from the grave ? Quick let us know the whole . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt I come from Russia , prisoner on parole . In the first charge on Borodino 's plain , Still faithful to my oath , I threw my sword Indignant on the earth , and mercy 's arm Quick stayed the Russian steel . By this I gain 'd The confidence of all the Russian chiefs ; And now , though I profess to come paroled , Yet am in fact on mission to you sent , Important as our nations fate , as silence Secret . But first , have you received yet Accounts of all our tyrants dire defeats ? And do you know the Russian Emperor 's purpose , To hurl his thunders forth , till Europe 's air Is freed from deadly damps , and fogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulletins confess , but we as well Might search the kennels of the streets for gold , As in those papers for the truth . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Those scenes Which I have viewed I will then brief relate  --  Those awful scenes , at thought of which my blood Stands still  --  my nerves contract  --  my soul recoils , And my brain turns ; for never yet on earth Did mind of man conceive such horrid woes , Such anguish and such slaughter as these eyes Have seen for six months past . But I must first Just cross the way and call on Talleyrand . For as Napoleon saw me in Berlin , He gave in charge a letter to the prince . Exit . Rain . Rainouard The tyrant 's then escaped ; but now meanwhile Let us convey the tidings to the Queen . Lesc . General Lescourt Well thought : for this may quell suspicion strong , That we 're unfriendly to her husband 's power . SCENE V. Talleyrand alone writing . ... Talleyrand 's Palace . Enter Servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chasseurs . Tall . Talleyrand Conduct him here . Enter Capt . Lescourt . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt The Emperor and King , Great Prince , sends this : hands a letter and though I come paroled , Yet so I burn to do his will , should he command I 'd raise my sword against the Russian ranks . Tall . Talleyrand Art thou from Russia now direct ? Capt Lesc . Capt . Lescourt I am . Tall . Talleyrand How didst thou leave our army there ? Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Alas , O Prince , the truth my conscience will not hide No army there is left . ' T is all destroyed And buried lies beneath the Russian snows . Each stream is crimsoned with our blood  --  each field Is fattened with our flesh , &; all the vultures ' maws In Asiatic wilds are glutted now . Tall . Talleyrand And how did our beloved Emperor ' scape ? Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt A few intrepid souls , as panthers fierce That roam in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their efforts to one point , He urged his way through all the Cozak hosts , And fled as if he would outstrip the lightning . Tall . Talleyrand And were the Austrians , Prussians , all o'erthrown ? Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Unhurt the Austrians were allowed to retire , And Prussia 's chief , D'York , with all his force Has joined the Russians . Tall . Talleyrand For such fearless frankness In thy account still more do I esteem thee . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Then ' t is a truth , as wild St. Pierre declares , That one extreme 's enamoured of the other . Aside Exit . Talleyrand breaks open the letter and reads . Prince , Assemble my Senate immediately . I shall be in Paris soon after you receive this . ( Signed ) NAPOLEON . Now France will bleed afresh . Conscription now Will bristle frightful as Medusa 's head . Another army must be had . But much I doubt If Bonaparte can e'er regain those conquests Which he has lost . His veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , not ten Whole years of peace could reinstate . Now firm The Russians will press on , and as the hail Condensing , wax in bulk &; force as they advance . For tyranny is like an arch of stones . If one be torn away the whole must fall ; And nations long oppressed are as wild beasts Confined : if one more bold break thro ' his bonds , The rest will follow soon . I had resolved To prop that fabric , tottering , reeling wide , Napoleon 's empire ; but I knew not then , How deadly was the blow it had received . Upon the centre of the beam that holds The balance in which France and Russia lie , Opposing weights , now will I take my stand , And cast in the preponderating scale My weight : for interest is the only tie That binds me to this tyrant or his cause . Me he dreads  --  Him I both despise and hate . No principle but self shall guide my actions : And if mankind should each look well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mourn . The man who tries to live by perfect right , Is but a foot ball for the world ; and he Who serves his country for his country 's sake , Makes strong the hand that 's raised to spill his blood . SCENE VI . Lescourt , Rainouard , Capt . Lescourt . ... Lescourt 's seat . Lesc . General Lescourt Now let us hear my son , the true account , Of this dread expedition to the north . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt When first five hundred thousand troops were poured Upon the Russian realm , there seemed for her No hope . ' T was second deluge of the world , And wave succeeded wave in endless flood . Like hungry lion crouching for his prey , The Russian troops retired . Our tyrant judg 'd Them overthrown . But when each peasant snatched The torch to plant beneath his native hut , And rather than submit , lift eye and voice To heaven , and calmly plunge within the flames , Sure then Napoleon might have learnt his fate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; urg 'd him to the grave where sleeps His greatness , Borodino 's field . Rain . Rainouard And there Was he o'ercome ? A signal victory His bulletin proclaimed . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt That was in truth The giant blow that smote him to the earth . A short time ere that dreadful day , the Prince Kutusoff came to lead the Russian troops . He seemed a spirit sent from heaven to save The world . He had a mind vast as the skies , Strong as the lightning 's blast . His judgment shone An oracle of fate , and covered o'er With scars , and stars , and years , with certain aim . He hurted the Russian thunder with a force , That crushed the adamantine power of France , And broke the witching charm that bound mankind . On Borodino 's plain he paused to stay The waves that fast flowed o'er his native land . His veterans stood like ridge of rocks fix 'd firm In earth ; himself an Atlas in the midst . From wing to wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brazen mouths Of death gleam horrible . A cloudless sun At length arose . As from St. Gothard 's height , We see the mountains higher , thicker rise , Far as the eye can trace , so on the plain The French battalions lay . As distant roar Of thunder so the fight began . But soon The lines were mix 'd like clouds adversely urg 'd , Condensing , wheeling , thund'ring through the air . As if two comets when most near the sun Should meet , such was the shock . Or either side A thousand cannon now spread death . The sun was hid . One dark , black cloud of smoke shut out the day . There forty thousand sabres meeting , clashed Amid the horrid gloom . There bayonets Unnumbered , in the darkness glaring closed . As when at midnight , thickest clouds o'erspread The sky and hide the earth , save when a flash Of lightning rends the gloom , such was the scene . As if at once from one volcanic mouth , The whole explosive matter in the earth Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if on earth a comet should impinge , Such was the slaughter . As the united yells Of all the Asiatic beasts of prey , Such were the groans of wounded , dying men . But vain were all the efforts of the French . At length they fled as fled the waves when earth Was drowned : Yet fifty thousand Frenchmen there . And thirty thousand Russians sleep in death . Lesc . General Lescourt Oh ! what cruel wound my country felt ! I joy that mad invasion war repelled , But when I think how many Frenchmen died , It bares my heart and stabs it through &; through Rain . Rainouard But if the Russians triumphed , why so soon Did they retreat and their lov 'd Moscow leave Napoleon 's prey ? Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt There was indeed The purest sacrifice earth e'er beheld . Nor yet alone for Russia was it made , But for the world . Kutusoff might have drove The invaders back , but he would make the work Complete . He therefore nobly tore away From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The snare was set  --  was sprung He tangled , fell . In Moscow naked walls alone Remained  --  a body destitute of soul . Soon there around him blazed a thousand fires . Still clinging to their native spot , a few Brave Russians there , commenced the holy work Fast barr 'd beneath their roofs , if Frenchmen came , They wrapped their wives , their children and themselves In flames . Five days the fire raged wild . The winds Of heaven urged it on . O'er Moscow 's plain One sheet of flame was spread , one fiery ocean rolled . It seemed like that dread hour foretold , when all The elements shall melt , and heaven and earth Depart like folding scroll . The smoky columns vast Rose curling , mixing with the clouds , hid sun , And moon , and stars , &; spread through Europe 's realms . That was the atoning altar for all nations . The sweetest incense that e'er rose on high , Was Moscow 's smoke ; and sure if God e'er look . With pleasure on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending from his throne , He smiled . Rain . Rainouard Good heavens ! What a sacrifice ! And what a peoples ! Lesc . General Lescourt But did Moscow 's flames Assist to make Napoleon 's fate more sure ? Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt That was the spot where he had hoped to spend The wintry months , secure from want and cold . But when its embers round him glow 'd , he stood Like one just smitten by despair . Meanwhile Like stormy clouds , the Russians thicken 'd round . From fartherest East , the Tartar , Calmue hordes And Cozaks , streamed like Northern Lights . At length Napoleon fled , and Oh ! what following woes ! From Moscow 's walls to Neimen 's banks , one field Of slaughter spreads . Our wretched soldiers , faint And naked dragged along . The wintry winds And frosts congeal 'd the streams of life . The roar Of Russian cannon and the whiz of balls , And Cozak 's yell increased the horrors of despair . Some weary sunk upon the earth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their limbs Uncovered , sleet drove thick  --  the blood congealed  --  The heart beat not  --  they never rose again . Some sinking on the shapeless drift  --  turn 'd slow Their closing eyes to France , tho't once of home , Heaved nature 's final sigh and died . A loud And hollow groan swelled every wintry blast , And spirits crowding rose to heaven . Rain . Rainouard And did The cause of all these woes , indifferent view His soldiers sinking by the sword and blast ? Was he not ever foremost to defend , And last to quit the field ? Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt With tearless eye Napoleon viewed those scenes which would have pierced A tyger 's heart . What yet remained of strength And comfort to his troops , around himself He drew , and left his army to expire , That he might live . On Berezina 's banks I saw a scene at which my soul recoiled . A bridge was raised . Foremost Napoleon pass 'd Behind him crowds of ghastly spectres press 'd In wild disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged them on . Men , arms and beasts , entangled , intermixed , Thousands of wretches were borne down , &; torn And crushed to death . The stream was choaked with men , Urged headlong in the icy gulph . At length The flames attacked the bridge and furious drove . Still crowd urged crowd , till with united groan They sunk forever in their watry graves . Thus was the arm of the invader broke . Thus did five hundred thousand Frenchmen die . Rain . Rainouard Oh , France ! How hast thou bled ! Thou art accurs 'd Of heaven . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt The noble Alexander now Resolves to follow closely his success , Till Europe 's freed and his proud eagles wave On Paris ' walls I come to sow the seeds Of deep conspiracy within these walls . Arouse then , O Rainouard , and my sire . Stir up each friend to Louis and to man Who yet remains . Try every means to clog The vast machine the tyrant has in play . Check his supplies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere long , to snatch the sword Of justice long since rusted to its sheath , And make it bright in our dear country 's cause . Rain . Rainouard In such an enterprize with all my heart And soul I 'll join . Lesc . General Lescourt And I will risque my wealth , My life , my all , to give the plan success . Rain . Rainouard Then let us go and secret form a band Of all the firm and noble souls in France . The iron base of tyranny 's huge pile We 'll sap , plant thick the mines and try To blow it in the air . But if it stands Too firm to rend from earth , and still our land Is cumbered with its massive weight , we 'll seize The pillars with convulsive strength , tear them away , And perish nobly in the tumbling ruins .

Nowhere Did Russian troops withstand our power . Moscow Was even ours . But swarms of Tartars there , Soon raised their parricidal hands to crush The empire they were summoned to defend . Full fifty cities and four thousand towns They burnt ; and all to glut their ancient hate , Though under color of distressing us . But over all triumphantly we rose .

My allies all Are faithful still . America at last , Has join 'd us in this glorious , holy war . Soon will I go and drive these Russians back Within their frightful clime .

Where late the vineyards smiled , &; fields of corn Waved in the breeze , now wastes &; thorns appear . Where Plenty pour 'd her horn , now Famine stalks . Where once Religion smiled , as zephyrs sweet On summer 's morn , now rough as winter 's blasts . Uncheering Atheism reigns . On every side Despair 's broad footsteps printed deep appear , And Misery 's ghastly front . Where'er we go , We see a mother 's wildly looking eye , A maniac 's stare  --  a widow 's tears , and hear An orphan 's cries , and beggar 's dying groans . Oh , misery ! Oh , distraction ! Rain .

E'en now I am preparing to depart , To pluck new laurels in the north ; but first , ' T is best that you corrupt the Russian chiefs . Tall . Talleyrand When one has more to give than those they serve , ' T is easy to seduce the hearts of men .

Talleyrand His wounds Are sore ; no wonder , for they 're deep : but trash From such a base born thing I scorn to resent . Aside . I own most gracious Sire , my words were wrong . I should have said , because the Russians judge Your army there has met repulse . But still , Another cause exists , why Russia 's chiefs Are inaccessible to all my arts .

The people I 'll annihilate : The land I 'll blow in air and bid the Baltic hide Its ruins . But you my prince I now command , Upon the peril of your head , to try Your utmost to corrupt the Russian chiefs . Tall . Talleyrand Upon the peril of my head !

Are not my sentiments the same with his ? Why do I start ! ' T is so , and shall I doubt My principles to be correct ?

Lescourt Why dost thou O my father , vex my soul With doubts like these ? What mortal will lament The death of Bonaparte ? What man on earth Retaliate ? Gen Lesc . General Lescourt But if you have the right To punish when and whom you think most fit , All others have the same . Thus you would give To base born souls the power to take the lives Of best of men . Thus you would burst the bonds Of social life , and drown the world in vice . Capt . Lesc . Capt .

No doubt the motives of my son were pure As chrystal streams . His heart whene'er it melts , Like melting gold , casts off all dross of self .

So when a fierce wild beast , by hunger brought Around the old , within a trap is caught ; He twists , and turns , and foams , &; tears , &; paws , And rends the earth , and gnashes with his jaws , While horror , fear and rage distort his eyes , Till soon the shepherd comes , and then he dies .

The mist has vanished from my eyes , And all his crimes appear , a mighty sea of blood . Once I supposed I loved him as my soul ; But now I find it was mere fancy 's play  --  A giddy girl 's wild whim .

I 'll mount my horse and ride both day and night Till I find out the brute , and then this sword Shall stab him through and through . Exit . Tall . Talleyrand He exits well ! He thinks that we are pleased when he extols Napoleon to the skies . Louisa . Maria Louisa He is a man Too good to be engaged in such a cause . Would that the Emperor had not such friends . Tall . Talleyrand Would that he had a thousand more . E'en now , This same Lescourt and Senator Rainouard , Are chiefs of a conspiracy wide spread , Against Napoleon . Louisa . Maria Louisa Impossible ! One would suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talleyrand He is the very man who check 'd supplies , And sunk his cannon in the Rhine . Whene'er , You hear a man so lavish of his praise , So blustering with enthusiastic zeal , You may be sure he 's striving to disguise His real thoughts . For nature to herself So true remains , that all attempts to imitate Her perfect works are vain ; and whoso'er Speaks foreign from his heart , will fall below , Or overact . Louisa . Maria Louisa As yet I 'm ignorant Of the human heart , and therefore often duped . But is it true my Prince , that Bonaparte Has gained a victory o'er the allied troops ? Tall . Talleyrand So he proclaims ; but private letters say , A few more victories like that would seal His ruin . Louisa . Maria Louisa Has my father joined the war ? Tall . Talleyrand Not yet . He 's bro't all parties to consent To hold a congress for a general peace . Louisa . Maria Louisa O let their be no peace till I am free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet what is death Compared to those corroding , fingering woes Which I must feel , to drag out life with one So lost to love , to virtue and to faith ! I can reflect on death with soul unmoved . But when my thoughts conceive a state like that , My fancy paints wild furies on my soul : Medusa 's head appears , the serpent 's hiss , Chimeras rage , huge Polyphemus stares , Old Argus wildly rolls his hundred eyes , And all the monsters poets feign , or fear Conceives , stand round in horrid group . Tall . Talleyrand Fear not O Queen ! for peace no more will visit earth , While on the throne of France Napoleon sits , And Russian lives to rear the flag of war Or wave the sword upon the battle field . Now to Lescourt I 'll go to make us known As friends . But first I 'll charge him with the plot , That I may see if calm and firm he stands , When death in horrid aspect storms his soul . SCENE II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . Hah , why does Talleyrand approach this way A whisper in my soul forehodes a storm . I fear the plot 's discovered ; for his soul Is like the electric fire , pervading ever , Creation through . Yes , yes , I read my fate Within his eyes . They sparkle hate and rage . Enter Talleyrand . Tall . Talleyrand I enter without leave to ask you sir , How thrives your plot against Napoleon ? Gen. Lesc . General Lescourt We are lost ! We are lost ! aside . What can you mean ? Tall . Talleyrand All this professed deep ignorance proves guilt . Did you expect to ' scape our piercing eyes ? Prepare your soul to mount the scaffold now . Gen. Lesc . General Lescourt Sword ! Shall I plunge thee in his heart ? No ; heaven Will not approve Calmly I 'll meet my fate aside . My soul is fixed ; and know thou pimp , thou slave , Thou parasite of this base Corsican , Thy racks and scaffolds , can not change a look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The time is near , tremble thou wretch ! ' t is near , When thou and thine must fall . There is in truth A plot against this monster 's power , in which Full thirty million Frenchmen are engaged . It must  --  it will prevail , for ' t is the cause Of God and man . Tall . Talleyrand Forgive , forgive , my friend , This needless trial of your soul . More pure , More bright , thou comest from the furnace flames ; And more do I respect thee  --  love thee now . Receive me as your friend . I am your friend . I join you heart and soul in all your plan To crush our despot 's power . Gen. Lesc . General Lescourt What do I hear ? Tall . Talleyrand You hear a penitent upon his knees , Imploring mercy from the king of kings , And pardon from mankind , for all the woes He 's brought upon the race . You see a wretch Grown gray in sin now seeking to do good . You see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven and earth , to wage eternal war Against Napoleon 's blood reared throne . O press my hand in sign of friendship firm . Gen. Lesc . General Lescourt No , no : ' t is all a farce . It can not be . Tall . Talleyrand Ask'st thou more proof ? Time then shall give thee proof , Strong as the chain that binds all nature 's works . Gen. Lesc . General Lescourt But what know'st thou , by which to judge my plans ? Tall . Talleyrand When late repenting , on my ways I looked , And saw that all was wrong , and that the arm Of this Attila must be withered up Ere peace could dwell in France , my duty urged That I should form a plot against his throne . I wrote forthwith to Russia 's prince , and found With joy , that you had long before commenced The patriotic work . Gen. Lesc . General Lescourt Still , still I doubt . Tall . Talleyrand I can not blame thy doubts : for all my life Has been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal else , so far Has traced the mazy labyrinths of vice , Or found so many openings to the heart . Like Proteus , I 've assumed a thousand forms . And made espionage a science sure As mathematics . And who now believes A word I speak ! Learn , learn O man , from me , To walk in mid day sun , nor hide in mist , Nor work by light of moon or stars ! But friend , Though now you fear to trust my word , yet soon Your son will come , and then your doubts will cease ; And you will find that I am not alone your friend , But e'en Louisa , Empress Queen . Gen. Lesc . General Lescourt My soul Like balance equal poised , preponderates To neither side . But what does it avail To disbelieve ? He certain knows our plans . And what if I believe and he prove false ? My fate will not thereby be made more sure aside O prince , receive my hand as friend . Tall . Talleyrand May heaven Regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lescourt May heaven preserve it free from breach or guile . SCENE III . Louisa and Princess Catherine . ... Palace of Thuilleries . Louisa . Maria Louisa On bed of flowers , sunk down beneath the rest , And hid from general view , one often smiles In vernal bloom , e'en to the summer 's close . While those that rose to light have strewed their leaves Long since upon the blast . So in this life , Whoe'er is raised on high , is but a mark For storms : while he who is unseen , unknown , Glides gently on , nor feels a wind nor frost . O why was I not left to pass obscure My life ! Then would the flower of innocence And peace have bloomed yet upon my cheek : But now its charms are scattered on the winds . Cath . Princess Catherine Still , still the cloud of sorrow shrouds your mind . Why do the brightening beams of hope not drive The must away ? Are not the great and good Combined to free us from this man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed ? Louisa . Maria Louisa Ah ! Who can bring me back my honor lost ! That I have been the wife of Bonaparte , Who can forget ? Though fortune should restore Me to my home , yet there I shall but raise The blush of shame upon my father 's cheek , And draw the tear of sorrow from my mother 's eye . Cath . Princess Catherine Like plants that close and wither at the touch , You are alive to every adverse breath . Too great a sensibility of nerves Impairs philosophy 's more sober reign . No twilight 's milder beams illumine you . You live in brightest day or blackest night . A fancy strong as yours , is telescope To joy and grief . Louisa . Maria Louisa Perhaps what you impute To fancy 's sway , may be a principle Possessed by all ; for greatest sorrows hide the rest As light of day the stars . But as the stars Shine bright when Sol is gone , so when the grief Most heavy flies , the rest will reappear . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer 's arms , could I escape His power , I thought that all my cares would cease . Yet now , when prospects of relief appear , My other woes return  --  a blackening cloud . Enter Talleyrand . Tall . Talleyrand Reports O Queen , fly thick , that Bonaparte Has met a dire defeat . Louisa . Maria Louisa Haste on O time , And prove them true . But whence do they proceed ? Tall . Talleyrand I can not learn ; but if not false , the seal Of confirmation soon will be impressed ; Perhaps e'en now for young Lescourt approaches . Enter Capt . Lescourt . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Hail Empress Queen ! Hail Prince of Benevento ! Hail Princess Catherine ! I hail you all As friends , combined against Napoleon 's power . Louisa . Maria Louisa Welcome Lescourt . Tall . Talleyrand All welcome noble Captain . Cath . Princess Catherine Much joy attend thy safe return , brave youth . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt I bring you news most cheering to your hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies , with Prince Schwartzenberg their chief , Triumphant march for France . Six months ago I should have trembled thus to speak before you ; But I have seen your secret correspondence With all the allied courts , and on the faith Of that alone , I dare to come thus bold . Tall . Talleyrand You 're not deceived Lescourt . Your confidence So nobly frank , shall never he betrayed . Louisa . Maria Louisa to Cath . My royal sire 's then joined the war , and Charles Your brother , Prince of Schwartzenberg is chief . Delightful news ! Cath . Princess Catherine Perhaps their fond embrace We soon shall feel e'en here . Louisa . Maria Louisa O blissful thought ! Permit O heaven , that rapturous hour to come , The sweetest , loveliest hour of life , which sets The prisoner free . Enter Gen. Lescourt and Rainouard . Gen. Lesc . General Lescourt Yes , here he is . My son , My son , art thou in health ? Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Well , well my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I press thy hand with joy . Rain . Rainouard And I thank heaven To see thee here . Is Bonaparte retreating ? Fear not ; but freely speak . All here are friends . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt That I knew before . Yes , yes his army flies In wildest rout . Gen. Lesc . General Lescourt The arm of heaven is with us ! Rain . Rainouard The arm of heaven will save us ! Tall . Talleyrand Next declare O Captain , where and how the blow was struck . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Above the hills and plains round Leipsic 's walls , The cloud of war impending , dreadful , hung , Threatening to burst . The day at length approached ; And heaven as if unwilling to behold Such horrid sight , shrouded its face in storms . But neither fogs nor storms could damp the fire That burnt within four hundred thousand breasts While yet the light of day uncertain shone , The wide mouthed engines poured the fire of death . The sabres waving , gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding bores , The screaming balls flew sure as death 's own shaft . The bristling bayonets there mixed with deadly thrusts , And man , tumbling on man , pour 'd out the stream Of life . Now conquering shouts , now dying groans Alternate rise . Smoke follows smoke , on dust Dust rolls , and flash on flash bursts through the cloud . Twelve hours the heavens were filled with constant roar , And earth deep trembled with the mighty shock . Then night closed down  --  the slaughter ceased , and nought But groans and watchfires broke the silent gloom . But like the calm of nature it presaged Approaching storms . Another day beheld Column on column rush , line charge on line And man on man , as if the universe Of suns and worlds in common centre me . At last our troops in wild disorder fled ; And every field from Leipsic to the Rhine , Ere this is strewed with Frenchmen 's bones . Louisa . Maria Louisa O why Does heaven permit such slaughter of our race ! Rain . Rainouard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live ! Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Yet know you that Moreau is dead ? Tall . Talleyrand Moreau ! Oh France ! That is the deepest wound Of all . That will draw forth a tear of blood . Alas ! Your morning star has faded on its course . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt I stood close by him in his final hour . His soul was full of France ; and by the breath That set his spirit free , this prayer was raised , " O , free my country ! " Gen. Lesc . General Lescourt Ah , thou noble man ! Though laurels deck thy tomb , thy native land Is drowned in tears ! Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Kutusoff too , The chief of other wars , the soul of this , The aged hero of the snowy lock Sleeps in his narrow house . Tall . Talleyrand Thou hast then lost O earth , the greatest soul that ever dwelt Upon thy lap . But still methinks , he guides The allied troops . His misty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imparts his wisdom to their chiefs . Rain . Rainouard He was In war the brightest beam that ever shone . He was a wintry storm to all his foes , But mercy stayed his sword . Beside his tomb , The genius of the world low bends her head And mourns her son . There weeping warriors stand , And e'en Bellona slackens there her reins And drops a tear . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Yet mighty chiefs remain . The Prussian Blucher joins the fire of youth To all the wisdom fourscore years have taught . Old Platoff too , nature 's untutored child , Rolls on his Cozak hosts , like whistling winds , That o'er his native plains , the banks of Don , Wild sweep , and dreadful as December 's storms . Louisa . Maria Louisa When did my father join the allied cause ? Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt A short time since . He strained every nerve To make a peace . But Bonaparte was deaf . Then came the trial of thy father 's soul . Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feelings of his heart impelled To join Napoleon : but love of man And duty to his country and his God Lay in the opposing scale . His warm affection On one side , on the other honor drew , As if they would have rent his soul in twain . Struggling with doubt for one whole day he stood Then like the western sky behind a storm , His soul was calmed  --  Then said he to the Russian Prince , The struggle 's o'er . I join you heart and hand ; My darling child Louisa trust I to my God . Louisa . Maria Louisa O why am I the cause of so much grief To my dear sire . I am not worth his care . Tall . Talleyrand And where is Bonaparte ? Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt Swift as the meteor Of night , he hither flies , a baleful star . Tall . Talleyrand And like the meteor may he shine no more .

Bright image Of higher race of beings . Thee we hail With hearts exulting high , again returned From war victorious , and covered o'er With laurels new , fair as the flowers of spring . Bonap . Bonaparte Senators , among my children now I come . They are to me most dear . My life  --  my all Has been devoted to the good of France . I strove for peace . Our foes refuse all terms . Rain . Rainouard Good heavens ! Can I sit still and hear this trash From such a filthy worm ! O , I shall burst . aside . Bonap . Bonaparte I fought . The victory was mine . But treason made My conquest little better than defeat . I need more troops . Then treachery will meet A due reward , and all my triumphs be complete . France is invaded . Though my wants be great , My children will not murmur now . Rain . Rainouard Footnote : 1Kb Senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Impel me now to rise . Our land is drained To her last drop of blood . Within a year , A million of her sons have been destroyed . All nations view us as the dregs of human kind  --  The very spiders of the infernal realms . No man should fear to tell his king the truth : Much less then we , the ramparts of our fellow-men . Upon our Prince all France now calls for peace . Peace might be had , did not ambition drive him Without a compass on its boisterous sea . Tall . Talleyrand ' T is falsehood , treason which you speak . Desist , Or else your head  --  Bonap . Bonaparte I dare him to proceed . Rain . Rainouard I speak what thirty million Frenchmen feel . Nor will I cease to paint my country 's wrongs , While through this heart the vital current flows .

Bonap . Bonaparte 120 Contented then I go . Come all ye hawks And vultures of the skies , and I will give you The flesh of all the allied vandal hosts Of Europe . Exit . Tall . Talleyrand Yes , there is another life Where such vile monsters meet their doom . O earth , why didst thou not return to chaos When he was born ! Why did not ocean , pitying The kind , burst o'er its shores &; drown our race . O what a wheel within a wheel is man ! A perfect contradiction to himself . What if like Bonaparte were all mankind ? Earth would in crime eclipse e'en hell itself , And Satan viewing such a race would stand Abashed . But when we turn to Russia 's Prince , How bright the picture of mankind appears !

Lescourt and Rainouard . ... Lescourt 's seat . Lesc . General Lescourt Darker &; darker still the night becomes Louder and louder yet the wild winds roar . Storms mix with storms and winds with winds engage . Again the tyger has dragged forth our friends . Three hundred thousand more are gone forever . O never can our country 's wounds be healed . The strings of life are cut . Rain . Rainouard Indeed my friend , Still gloomy is our state . But as the night Is often darkest nearest to the morn , So ' t is with France . The noble Alexander comes ; The glory of our race  --  perfection 's child , To cut the Gordian knot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what can it avail to rear A skeleton devoid of life ? Rain . Rainouard You 're wild Lescourt . Lescourt France yet has sinews , flesh &; nerves ; And in a worthy cause , though wounded sore , You 'd see her arm sweep down full many a foe . Lesc . General Lescourt Pardon my friend , this momentary gust Of grief . I just returned from viewing scenes That probed my heart and sickened all my soul . Conscription in its deadliest form appeared . To see the helpless wretches dragg 'd from home , While wives and children hung around &; begged With frantic screams that their dear , only friends Might not be torn away , Oh ! ' t was too much ! Rain . Rainouard Were I to say whence dire Conscription came , I should explain it thus . When France for blood In torrents shed , some bitter scourge deserved To wash away the stain , no single curse , Nor all on earth could expiate her crimes . The realms of darkness then were ordered to produce Their master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyger gorging then his prey . Soon round it stood , Murder , and Discord , War , Centaurs , Revenge , Famine , &; Hate , &; Death , Chimeras every monster , every pest The subjects of the grim Tartarean king . Each opening then his veins let out a part Of his own blood . A portion of the mass That feeds the eternal fire was next produced . The Prince of darkness standing in the midst , Took the ingredients all , and made a frame In form like unto man . Next from the depths Unfathomable , never searched before , He drew an adamantine jar select , On which was written , " Essence of all Plagues . " Pouring from this upon his work begun , Cemented , firm it stood . Then on the mass He breathed a living soul , of dread design Conceived . The work was done . With shouts pursued , Forth to the earth as one of men it went , And there assumed the name Napoleon . The cursed design  --  the Devil 's choicest gift Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesc . General Lescourt O , what a picture has thy fancy drawn ! Enter Captain Lescourt . Capt . Lesc . Capt . Lescourt The allied troops approach our city 's walls . The distant hills are brightened with the gleams Of steel , and on the plains the Cozaks rove , Like skirting clouds . Our tyrant 's army too , Covers Montmartre 's heights . On either side The countless hosts fix firm their armour on , And snuff the blast of war . The busy chiefs Close thick the lines . The martial trumpets sound Upon an hundred hills , and wake the soul To daring deeds ; and scatter on the winds Each fear and softer feeling of the heart . Soon will the roar of battle reach our ears  --  The battle that decides our fate . Rain . Rainouard Let us Then go and join the allies with our swords . Lesc . General Lescourt Not so Rainouard ; for we should contend Against our friends who are compelled to fight . In Paris let us stay , and make all ready To receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the rage of battle lasts , Endeavor to dissuade the city 's troops From marching to Napoleon 's aid . Rain .

A gentleman 's seat , a little distance from Montmartre 's heights . Alex . Alexander Our ever active chief again has formed Close columns of attack . Montmartre 's heights Must now be forced . O heaven grant that this May end the tide of blood . So much of war I 've seen , that my heart sickens at the thought ; And sickens more , when I reflect that crimes Of one alone have brought such woes on man . Francis . Francis True , brother , long you 've left the sweets of home And mingled in the troubled storm of war . But ' t is a recompense for all your toils , When you reflect that you have burst the bands That bound a weeping world . When you return , All Russia will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe echoes back Your praise ; and what more grateful to the mind Than praise deserved ! Alex . Alexander ' T is not for private toils That I repine . For such a cause as this Should rouse a monarch cheerful to endure A soldier 's lot . Indeed , him shrinking now Earth would disown . But I lament the fate That drives so many thousands to their graves . I mourn the wretched soldier 's fate . He braves The winds , and storms , and death itself and yet For him no laurel waits , no trumpet sounds . Francis . Francis My brother William , has thy father 's pride , The aged Blucher yet come up ? William . William This hour He joined : And finding battle soon would rage , His eyes bedimmed with age , flashed youthful fire , And crimson lighted up his wrinkled cheeks . Alex .

Francis ' T is he , with battle in his eye . Enter Prince Schwartzenberg . Schwartz . Prince Schwartzenberg I come great sovereigns to report the plan I 've formed of the attack : First . on the right , With closed columns Blucher will assault . The left will Benningsen direct and march By files without a fire , till he shall reach The very adverse works . Then must he close , Discharge , o'erwhelm . The centre I shall lead In echellons drawn up , and be prepared To appui the wings . Platoff will form In column of manoeuvre in the rear . When he perceives the adverse lines to reel , Then must he dash upon their ranks with shouts . Alex . Alexander Your plan O Prince , is good . Go prove it such ; And may the God of battles guide your sword . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shield . Will . William And may the palm of victory be yours . Exit Schwartz . Alex . Alexander Let us my friends , now ride along our lines And try to rouse the spirit of our troops . This day decides all Europe 's fate . This day Will wake unbounded joy , or sink the world In hopeless night . Let us then raise our voice , And from the native feeling of the heart , Pour forth the unaffected eloquence Of nature . Will . William The effect may be most happy . Think how Suwaroff on St. Gothard 's mount , Inspir 'd his troops , when by the heavens he swore If victory should forsake him there , to hide Forever in the caverns of the hills . Fran . Francis And how Kutusoff lighted up war 's flame On Borodino 's field , when passing thro ' the lines He bore the sacred symbols of the church , The image of his God . SCENE III .

The busy bustle there , The bugle 's and the trumpet 's mingled sounds , The close formed column &; the lengthened line , All , all proclaim attack . Bonap . Bonaparte How seem their troops My Marshal ? Is their spirit roused for battle ? Ney . Marshal Ney Up , up to heaven . The watch word , " God and Moscow ! " Spreads through their lines as if they were a chain Electrical : and such an atmosphere of war About them hangs , of vital air so wanting , That nought can live but cruelty and death . Bonap . Bonaparte Let the mad vandals come . My plan is fixed ; And they as surely beaten must retreat As they advance . Do you now hear and spread My orders to the troops . Blucher will fall In columns on our left . As he comes on , In every space between his troops advance , The Tirailleurs to gall him on his flanks . Direct the cannon of our front redans To cross fire on his line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot so form That column may meet column . Then throw forward The Cuirassiers and Light Dragoons at speed , And put him hors de combat . With their left Our foes I judge will march in line or files . If in a line , the cannon of our right To one small space will centre all their fire . When that is forced , the corps reserve will charge In column through , and then display .

We 've heard of Spain . Well . Lord Wellington O Prince , recall to mind The fields of Esling , Wagram , Dresden , Leipsic . Benning . General Benningsen Have you , great Duke , so soon forgot the plains Of Albuera , Talavera , Orthes ? Of Toulouse , Salamanca and Busaco ? Well . Lord Wellington Still are they fresh upon my mind , and so By fancy 's power is Eylau 's iron field ; Where fourteen days the cloud of war hid heaven , And sounds of battle rose as if the earth Were tumbling so decay . There first you plucked The laurel from Napoleon 's towering head , And there his star of glory first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isles ! Oft when the roar Of battle ceased , and round their evening fires My warriors sat , thy deeds rushed o'er their souls A stream of light , &; swords were half unsheathed . Well . Lord Wellington When mixed in horrid strife , my lines have stood , And war 's uncertain scales still doubtful hung , To neither side inclined , I oft have cryed , Remember Platoff with his charging host A groan succeeds my voice among my foes , As if the lightning 's blast had smote their ranks . Blucher . General Blucher Could I behold another hour like it is , I 'd bear a life of fourscore years of pain . Fran . Francis ' T is time we should decide , if Bonaparte Shall live or die .

Oh , horrid thought ! Will . William Indeed , one would suppose that hell itself Could not afford a torment too severe . His death can not atone for but the least Of all his countless crimes . Then let him live . Alex . Alexander Each hour hereafter of his life will be More dreadful than ten thousand deaths ; each thought A sword plunged through his soul . Not half so fierce Does Etna 's fire e'er rage , as will the flame Of conscience in his breast . Perhaps e'en yet Repentance may disarm the vengeance of his , God . Spare then his life ; and let all Europe 's prayers Each day implore forgiveness of his sins . Fran . Francis Canst thou , right noble Wellington , declare What wills thy king ? Well .

Alexander O chiefs , the dark , rough storm of war is o'er . The mild blue sky of peace succeeds . You long have been Our cloud by day and pillar in the night . For you the loudest blast of fame shall blow , And echo down the stream of future times .

O may the martial trumpet 's blast no more Impel me to the field ; but may the world Roll on in peace , till war 's fell art 's forget . Blucher . General Blucher For sixty years my home has been the tented field : But now farewell forever , O my sword . Your work is done . This arm will never wield Thee more . These grayest looks  --  these trembling limbs Foretell how near my end . I soon shall join Kutusoff on his cloud . But thanks to God , That now my soul can quit the earth in peace , And looking joyful backward as it flies , Smile with delight . For he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Benningsen The cause of God and man Drew forth my sword ; &; now that cause is served , Could I outshine e'en Mars himself in war , And rival heaven 's thunders with my cannon , One calm domestic hour of peace is worth it all . Platoff . Platoff Though sounds of war are music to my soul While foes remain , yet peace I hail , a welcome beam . Now joyful will I seek my native stream And spread thy fame O sire . Along the banks of Don , On every stone a sign of thee shall rest . Our hards shall raise thy song , and every hunter Wandering o'er the hills shall tune thy praise . Louis . Louis XVIII The work is now complete . Europe is free . The golden age of former times returns . This is the Saturnalia of the world  --  The Jubilee of man . The sound of war Is heard no more .

Ye wild winds cease ! Ye fields , ye beasts , ye flocks exult ! Ye birds , Pour forth your lovliest songs : for now no more The bloody two edged sword hangs o'er the earth Suspended by a hair . Alex . Alexander Throughout the world Let now hosannas and loud pans rise . Ye rocks and woods , repeat them to the skies ! Thou moon and stars , return the joyful notes ! Ye angels let sweet music swell your throats ! Join heaven and earth , both great and small , To hail man ransomed from his second fall . Exeunt Omnes .
