 --  Doubly I 'm a beggar ! Undone by fortune , and in debt to thee ! Otway . ADVERTISEMENT . Those , who have perused the novel of Evelina , will easily perceive the source , whence the fable of this comedy is derived . The novel is deservedly popular , and afforded a story so interesting , and a moral so salutary , that the author could not resist the temptation of bringing it upon the stage . In doing this , however , he has been obliged not only to compress the incidents , but also to introduce new characters , and to modify others in such a manner as to heighten the dramatic effect . The most material alteration is in the character of the " Poor Lodger ; " by which change , the author flatters himself he has enhanced both the interest and moral of his drama . In consequence of these alterations , it was thought best to give new names to the characters , more especially as it would serve the purpose of distinguishing the play from the novel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in point of skill , the author can confidently say , that he thinks it irreproachable on the score of morality ; and that it may , without arrogance , claim the negative praise , of being free from indecency . It may possibly he said , by the fastidious critic , that the author has committed a misnomer , in calling his play a comedy , considering the distressed circumstances of the hero and heroine , and the solemn aspect of some of the principal scenes . Whether this objection be substantial or frivolous , the author feels himself unable to decide , inasmuch as he has never met with any rule which settles the question . Most of Shakespeare 's dramas are of the mixed order , and they are called tragedies , or comedies , as the denoument is happy or disastrous . At any rate , the author does not hesitate to express his decided predilection for this species of the drama . It possesses the united advantages of almost every possible mode of theatrical writing . The alternation of comic and serious scenes , produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is universally pleasing ; and , like light and shade in a picture , creates that relief , which is the soul both of painting and of poetry : nor will it be denied , that the mixed drama has been found , by long experience , to be the most faithful mirror of nature and of life . To those ladies and gentlemen of the theatre , who so ably personated the characters in this play , the author begs leave to present his most unfeigned thanks . He well knows the solicitude which they expressed , and which , he has every reason to believe , they felt , for its success ; and their cordial congratulations on that event , will ever be remembered with pride and gratitude . To the public , also , many acknowledgements are due , for the very favourable countenance with which they received this comedy ; more especially for the distinguished honour which they conferred upon the author , on the night of his benefit . The author likewise rejoices in this second opportunity of thanking Mr. Paine for an epilogue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , January , 1811 . PROLOGUE . Spoken by Mr. Duff . In this bright temple , where the muses sit , Adorning morals , with the charms of wit ; In this dread court , where critics urge their laws , And deal the fatal frown , and blest applause ; A native bard presents , with trembling heart , His first fond effort in the comic art . A native ?  --  Yes ; and sure no critic , here , Will , for that reason , cast a frigid sneer ; If so , he sneers not at the author 's worth , But at that country sneers , which gave him birth . Be just , Columbians , and assert your name , Avow your genius , and protect your fame ; The clime which gave a WASHINGTON to you , May give an Otway , and a Shakespeare too ! To-night , a town-bred bard , with fearful pride . Awaits that fate , your voice must soon decide : His fortune , kind or adverse , you must seal  --  For , from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he craves no condescending grace , Nor asks one frown to leave the critic 's face : No mercy sues for , if he ought to fall , No kindness begs , what is due to ALL : But , on your JUSTICE , proudly rests his claim ; Be that his FAILURE , or be that his FAME ! Of that , he trusts you will not make denial , And , on his COUNTRY , puts himself , for trial ! DRAMATIS PERSON . The Poor Lodger , Mr. Morse . Lord Harley , Mr. Darley .

London  --  An apartment at Mrs. Clifford 's Enter Mrs. Clifford and Harriet . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Ha ! ha ! ha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Har . Harriet Bloomville How should I understand you , when you have been all this time talking in riddles ? Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford To be plain , then , I mean your eyes , my dear . To my certain knowledge , they are capable of most astonishing execution . I can not absolutely say that they have slain their thousands , and their tens of thousands ; but of this I am certain , that they have laid a lord and a baronet most humbly and devoutly at your feet . Har . Harriet Bloomville Nay , if you go on at this rate , I shall think you are laughing at me , in good earnest . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford I believe these two personages never enjoyed and suffered so much of the pleasing pain of love , as they did in your presence , last night , in the assembly room . Har . Harriet Bloomville I see you are determined to enjoy your gaiety , though it should be at my expense . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Come , Harriet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity ; for I am really not trifling with you . True , I am gay  --  and , as your friend , how could I be otherwise , when speaking on a subject which does you so much honour . Har . Harriet Bloomville I acquit you of trifling ;  --  but it would be vanity in me to attempt a reply to your very graceful compliment . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford What , still sceptical ! Well , Harriet , I protest , let the charge of vanity against our sex be never so just , it would be but fair to consider you an exception to the rule . For I verily believe , were one to declare his love , you would hardly credit him . Har . Harriet Bloomville That would depend on circumstances . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford I understand you  --  If his looks and actions should confirm his words , and his character should be a voucher for both ; you would , in such case , believe him . Har . Harriet Bloomville In such case , I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are perfectly agreed . But suppose his every look and action told you that he loved , and yet his tongue were silent on the subject ? Har . Harriet Bloomville Then I should indeed believe him . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford You will allow that we are agreed so far . Har . Harriet Bloomville Perfectly . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Let us now apply these principles to two very strong cases that happened last night in the assembly room . I will begin , then , if you please , with Sir Harry Stormont . As soon as he found that you were an acquaintance of mine , and Lord Harley had led you to the dance , he took a seat by me , and began his inquiries in a strain so enthusiastic , that , for some minutes , I doubted if his brain were not affected , as well as his heart .  --  Ha ! ha ! ha ! Now tell me , Harriet , how came you , afterwards , to refuse dancing with him ? Har . Harriet Bloomville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accustomed to , that I was , in truth , afraid of him . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Afraid of him ?  --  Ha ! ha ! ha ! Har . Harriet Bloomville He talked so extravagantly , that I did not dare to look him in the face , and wished myself out of the room more than a thousand times . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford But after refusing him , you should not have accepted another partner for the same dance . Har . Harriet Bloomville I suppose I was wrong ; but the novelty of the assembly scene , together with the persecuting civilities of Sir Harry , so embarrassed me , that I hardly knew what I did . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford But did not Lord Harley 's attentions contribute also to your embarrassment ? Har . Harriet Bloomville Lord Harley did not say much ; and his politeness is extremely easy . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford His is the true politeness  --  the politeness of the heart . Har . Harriet Bloomville His manners are uncommonly elegant . Mrs. Cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harriet Bloomville His face is all intelligence  --  Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford And his heart all feeling . Har . Harriet Bloomville He appears to have sensibility . O , my friend , the woman , who possesses his affections , must be fortunate indeed . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Then I congratulate you , Harriet ; for I know he is deeply smitten with you . Har . Harriet Bloomville O , that 's impossible . Enter a Servant . Serv . Servant Lord Harley , madam . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Shew his lordship in . Exit Servant . Now , Harriet , only put on half your charms , and , My word for it , he is your slave forever . Enter Lord Harley . L. Har . Lord Harley Ladies , good morning . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Good morning , my lord . Har . Harriet Bloomville ( Courtsies . ) Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford I believe there is no one more punctual in the observance of civilities than your lordship . You are the first gentleman who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lord Harley Indeed ? You may then rank me among the most selfish of them ; for this is one of those pleasures which I can never deny myself .  --  ( To Harriet . ) How is your health , this morning , Miss Bloomville ? I hope it suffered no injury from the assembly last evening . Har . Harriet Bloomville None at all , I thank your lordship . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford I never knew her in better health and spirits than she is this morning . We were just now reviewing the scenes of the assembly , and , I assure your lordship , you were not forgotten amidst the multiplicity of the subjects . Har . Harriet Bloomville ( Aside to Mrs. Clifford . ) Nay , my dear Mrs. Clifford  --  L. Har . Lord Harley Your ladyship really did me great honour . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Miss Bloomville feels under great obligations to your lordship . Har . Harriet Bloomville ( Aside to Mrs. Clifford . ) How can you be so cruel ! L. Har . Lord Harley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clifford For saving her from the vexatious impertinences of Sir Harry Stormont . Har . Harriet Bloomville ( Aside to Mrs. Clifford . ) I never will forgive you . L. Har . Lord Harley How so ? I do not remember  --  Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford You know , Sir Harry is rather extravagant in his manners ; and he was so much so , toward Miss Bloomville , that he really put her in fear . L. Har . Lord Harley The presence of Miss Bloomville would , I should suppose , have awed the rudest manners into the most respectful civility . Har . Harriet Bloomville ( Courtsying ) Sir !  --  Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford ( Aside to Harriet . ) There 's a compliment !  --  ( To Lord Harley . ) And by having you so frequently for a partner , she was saved the mortification of dancing with Sir Harry  --  ( Aside to Harriet . ) Now I 'll go . Har . Harriet Bloomville ( Aside to Mrs. Clifford . ) Do not , I beseech you , do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must beg the privilege of a moment 's absence . Exit . L. Har . Lord Harley I hope , Miss Bloomville , that Sir Harry Stormont was not so dead to every honourable feeling , as to offer you a deliberate insult ! Har . Harriet Bloomville O , no , my lord  --  I wonder that Mrs. Clifford  --  I  --  I  --  L. Har . Lord Harley The subject appears to embarrass you , Miss Bloomville . Will you pardon me for taking such an interest in it ? Har . Harriet Bloomville Your lordship is extremely kind . L. Har . Lord Harley I possibly might have misapprehended Mrs. Clifford . Har . Harriet Bloomville I think so , my lord . Her vivacity naturally leads her to exaggerate . L. Har . Lord Harley And sometimes , perhaps , to be ironical ? Har . Harriet Bloomville Perhaps so , my lord . L. Har . Lord Harley I hope  --  Pardon me , Miss Bloomville  --  I hope you do not think me guilty of impertinent curiosity . It is a never failing mark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) How shall I answer him ?  --  Would that Mrs. Clifford were here . L. Har . Lord Harley How am I to interpret this silence ? Do I , then , stand condemned in your esteem ? If so , I shall consider this interview as the most serious misfortune of my life . Har . Harriet Bloomville My lord , I am sorry you entertain suspicions of this nature . L. Har . Lord Harley Will you , then , permit me to ask for the particulars of this affair with Sir Harry Stormont ? Har . Harriet Bloomville It is too trifling  --  It is of no importance  --  It is really unworthy your lordship 's regard . L. Har . Lord Harley Nothing can be trifling , which concerns Miss Bloomville . Har . Harriet Bloomville Another time , my lord . L. Har . Lord Harley Another time ? Har . Harriet Bloomville Yes , my lord , you shall hear it another time .  --  ( Half aside . ) Where can Mrs. Clifford be ? L. Har . Lord Harley Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to see her , my lord .  --  I wonder what has detained her thus long ! L. Har . Lord Harley I will take my leave , then . Miss Bloomville , good morning . ( Going  --  then returns , and takes Harriet 's hand . ) But , before I leave you , I have a request  --  ( Pauses . ) May I hope for the honour of being numbered among your acquaintance ?  --  ( Pauses  --  Harriet hangs her head . ) To ask for the privilege of being your friend , might be too presuming  --  ( Pauses  --  Harriet continues in the same posture  --  he at length leaves her , and bows . ) Miss Bloomville , good morning . Exit . Har . Harriet Bloomville ( First lost in mute admiration  --  then sighs . ) Heigho !  --  Well !  --  But away with such hopes ! He may only have been trifling with me ! Enter Mrs. Clifford . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Has the bird flown ?  --  What 's the matter , Harriet ? Har @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave me ? Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Rather ask , how I could be so kind ?  --  Not to have left you , at that moment , would have been cruelty indeed . But how is this , Harriet ?  --  I see a tear in your eye ! Har . Harriet Bloomville You should not have left me thus . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Come , I perceive you are affected at something his lordship has said to you . You must confide in me ; for I am your friend . Har . Harriet Bloomville Answer me , then , to this question  --  Will not his lordship sometimes flatter , for the sake of making a pretty speech ? Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford He would never flatter in any affair , where honour required him to be serious . Har . Harriet Bloomville Would he not trifle with the feelings of a simple girl , for the sake of proving his power over her heart ? Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford No ; not for his life . Enter a Servant . Serv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs Clifford Shew him in . Har . Harriet Bloomville Let me go , first . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford No  --  You shall stay . I will not leave you this time . Enter Sir Harry Stormont . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Ladies , I kiss your hands . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Your most obedient , Sir Harry .  --  I suspect that I am indebted to Miss Bloomville for this visit . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Ha ! ha ! ha !  --  I beg your ladyship 's pardon : but I am almost tempted to be uncivil enough to say , that I do n't believe your ladyship suspects any such thing . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford I can only judge by what I saw of your conduct , last night , in the assembly room . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Well , madam , what did you see there ? Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford You there expressed yourself , on a certain subject , with the raptures of a poet ; but , I perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have now brought with you only the coldness of an anchorite . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont To tell you the truth , madam , I do n't feel very happy this morning . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Indeed ? I am sorry for that , Sir Harry .  --  Pray , what is the matter ? Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont A complaint of the mind , madam : - My understanding has  --  has  --  has  --  my pride  --  yes , madam , my pride has been  --  but no matter  --  Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Haw ? Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Why , you must know , madam , that I , last evening , asked a young lady to dance with me , and she saw fit to decline my invitation  --  Afterwards  --  Mrs. Cliff .

Sir Harry Stormont No doubt you do ; for she is not a thousand miles off . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Miss Bloomville Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont ( Bows . ) Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford I have had the pleasure of knowing Miss Bloomville from her infancy ; and I am sure that any transgression she may have committed , ought to be ascribed to mere inadvertency . Har . Harriet Bloomville If , in any part of my conduct towards you , Sir Harry , I have offended against politenese , I most sincerely and humbly ask your pardon . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont ( Kneeling and seizing Harriet 's hand . ) Thus , dear , lovely , adorable Miss Bloomville  --  thus let me seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises . ) Enter Nancy Joblin . Nan .

Nancy Joblin La , now , what signifies that ?  --  Mrs. Clifford will give up to me , wo n't you , ma 'm ; for Miss here is my cousin . Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford I shall certainly not insist upon any thing against Miss Bloomville 's wishes . Nan . Nancy Joblin There now ;  --  I knew the lady would be willing you should go . Besides , Miss , you ha' n't no notion what fine times we shall have . There 's a whole party of us going to Vauxhall this evening . Har . Harriet Bloomville You must indeed excuse me , to-day .

Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford Ha ! ha ! ha ! A new kind of civility , upon my word ! Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Ha ! ha ! ha ! A strange composition , with rather more vinegar than oil in it .  --  Pray , Miss Bloomville , is that your cousin ? Har . Harriet Bloomville A distant one , sir . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Now I should suppose that you were , at least , as far apart as the antipodes . But hey ! what have we here !  --  A most curious piece of animated antiquity !  --  the last precious relic of Noah 's ark !  --  Enter the Widow Danvers . Wid . Danv .

So this is the way you treat me !  --  You 'd better not shew such airs , Miss . Har . Harriet Bloomville Nay , be not angry with me . I did not mean to offend you . Wid . Danv . Widow Danvers Do n't stand talking  --  On with your duds and go with me , this minute ; for I 'm in a hurry . Come , be quick  --  be quick . ( Harriet going . ) Mrs. Cliff .

No  --  I 'll let her know that I 'll be minded . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont ( Approaching the Widow . ) Pray , good great-grandmother of three quarters of the human race , in what age of the world wast thou born ? Was it in the year one , two , or three ? Or did the year four come in before thou saw'st the light ? Wid . Danv . Widow Danvers Faugh ! you 're a fop ! Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont On what terms art thou with the moon , now-a-days ?

Sir Harry Stormont Where does she live ? Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford In the country ; at a place called Berry Hill . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont What is her father ? Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford A villain ! Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Ha !  --  Indeed ? Mrs. Cliff . Mrs Clifford And is no less a personage than Sir Charles Barrymore . Do you know that baronet ? Sir Har .

Mrs. Cliff .

She is an ornament to her sex , and an honour to human nature . You will pardon me , then , if I renew my caution , and again charge you not to trifle with her . Exit . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Well said , Mrs. Morality . You have really given us a very grave and sentimental discourse .

Sir Harry Stormont Go on . Grub . Grub Well , sir , I immediately goes up to the two women of a certain character whom I engaged for this business , and says to them , now , says I , is your time . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Go on . Grub .

Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont How did Miss Bloomville behave , during the time ? Grub . Grub As well as could be expected .  --  But she blushed  --  la ! how she blushed !  --  and she hanged down her head , and begged the women to let her go . But , howsomdever , they wonld n't , and did n't , till they had gone the end of the walk twice . They then quit their hold , and the dear young lady flew from them as swift as a bird from a cage , as a body may say . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Did Lord Harley see any part of this ? Grub .

Lord Harley Your most obedient , Sir Harry . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Have you heard of the strange adventure , my lord ? L. Har . Lord Harley What adventure ? Sir Har .

Sir Harry Stormont Ha ! ha ! ha ! Excuse me , my lord ; but I can not help laughing to think what a couple of fools she has made of us . L. Har . Lord Harley I really do not understand you , Sir Harry . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont No matter  --  I only spoke unadvisedly  --  On the whole , I think it best not to undeceive you in regard to that young lady . L. Har . Lord Harley Nay , Sir Harry , you 'll pardon me , if I insist upon an explanation . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Well then , since you seem to take such a deep interest in whatever concerns this irresistible charmer , I will e'en venture to state to your lordship , one plain , simple , unembellished fact respecting her . L. Har . Lord Harley I want facts , sir , and not insinuations ; particularly where the character of an unprotected female is concerned . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Be not angry then , and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But first , pray tell me what makes you look so serious , my lord ? L. Har . Lord Harley Because I feel so , Sir Harry : And give me leave to say , that such levity on such a subject , is not very becoming a gentleman of your appearance . Now for the fact , sir , if you please . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Pardon , me , my lord , I merely laughed at the comicality of the adventure ; for really this same adorable Miss Bloomville was seen not long ago , walking in a very familiar manner with two gentlwomen , of whose acquaintance , neither you nor I should be very proud . L. Har . Lord Harley Sir Harry , I confess I myself witnessed the same unfortunate scene , to which you so unfeelingly allude , and was as much astonished as you could be But I did not laugh at it  --  I could not have laughed . It excited sensations far less agreeable . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont No doubt you felt ashamed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us both to learn wisdom from this affair , and be more careful , in future , how we lavish our unmerited civilities upon strangers . L. Har . Lord Harley You have doubtless a right to form your own opinion on this subject ; sir , but I hope , while there remains a possibility of her innocence , you will not publish any thing to the disadvantage of Miss Bloomville : justice forbids that you should condemn her to the world , before she has had an opportunity to explain herself ; and humanity requires that we should be silent where we can not praise , rather than noisy where we can only censure . Exit . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Very well  --  very well ! " Humanity requires that we should be silent where we can not praise . "  --  Ha ! ha ! ha !

Harriet Bloomville Did you say so ? Did you employ a falsehood ?  --  Dick . Dick Joblin Do let me go on ; for the most curious part is to come yet . O yes , said the coachman .

Harriet Bloomville And do you think , sir  --  Dick . Dick Joblin La , how can I tell my story when you 're in such a passion ?  --  Well , so I went back and saw Lord Harley , and talked to him about the broken glass ; and told him you were sorry , and hoped he 'd forgive you , because you wa n't none to blame about it , one way nor'tother .

So I thank 'd him , and told him father would be glad of his custom as to any thing in our line of tobacco , and rum , and reasons , and treakle , which I said was very good and cheap of the kind ; and that you , who he danced with , was our cousin , and would be very thankful for any good turn he would do us ; and that I would bring you to see him  --  Har .

Sir Harry Stormont Does she indeed ?  --  Will you let me look at it , my lad ? Dick . Dick Joblin ( Hesitating . ) Hey ? Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont Only at the outside . I admire to see handsome writing . ( Dick hands the letter . ) But hey ! how came the seal to be broken ? Dick . Dick Joblin Why , father did n't know but it might be a kind of love letter , so he thought he 'd just take a sly peep at the inside . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont ( Aside . ) A lucky thing for me ! ( To Dick . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Joblin No : there is n't so much as a word mentioned about love , in the whole of it . Sir Har .

Sir Harry Stormont Your father did wrong . Breaking the seal of a letter is worse than house-breaking . It is a little , sneaking , paltry villany , which , depend upon it , Lord Harley will never submit to . If you have any regard , therefore , for your father , you had better keep this letter from Lord Harley . Dick . Dick Joblin I vow , I did n't think of that !  --  La , sir , what do you think he 'd do to father ? Sir Har .

Tell me  --  On'y tell me , and I 'll be your bounden slave forever . Sir Har . Sir Harry Stormont I 'll first read the letter , and then answer it myself with Lord Harley 's name .
