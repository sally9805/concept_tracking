txt ART . 11. -A bill to establish an Un form system of bankrupteV throughout th' United States . Washington , February 27 , 1818 . THIS bill gave rise to a discussion , which has not yet lost all its interest , or any of its importance . The question , as to what regulations shall he used for compelling the payment of debts , has always been found one of the greatest delicacy and difficulty ; and although the practice of nations , upon this subject , has been extremely various , experience has not yet suggested a system free from important objections . In some countries the insolvent debtor has been viewed merely as a criminal , and punished as such . Other nations have acted upon the idea , that when he had become unable to answer the debt with his property , he should be compelled to do so with his body . ln some of the countries of the East Indies , it is said , the creditor may not only reduce the debtor himself to slavery , but , likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate the chastity of the wife with impunity , though he so doing the debt is considered as discharged . this custom of selling the body of the debtor , who was unable to make payment , likewise existed at Athens and at Rome . Solon re* // formed it at Athens , and in imitation , as it is said , of the . Egyptians , abolished all imprisonment for debt . He would not allow an individual , on account of a private obligation , to be withdrawn from the service he owed to the publick . And an ancient historian adds , that some did justly blame many of the Grecian law-makers , who forbade arms , ploughs , and other things necessary for labour , to be taken as pledges , and yet permitted the person , who used those instruments , to be imprisoned . But at Rome , the usage existed much longer , and was even incorporated into the laws of the Twelve Tables . The cruelties , which it enabled the creditor to practise , whilst he held his debtor in domestick servitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were transported , as he was liable to be , beyond the Tiber , and sold as a slave in a foreign land , rendered this law extremely odious to the Roman commonulty ; and made it the cause of many of those secessions to the Mons Sacer , which sometimes seemed to threaten the very existence of the state . Under the Christian emperours was adopted a regulation of a very different character , by which an insolvent debtor , upon making a general assignment of all his property for the benefit of his creditors , was secured from imprisonment . It was first established at Rome by time Julian law , de bonis cedendis , but was afterwards much improved by Justinian , and formed into that system , which now constitutes the part of the civil law called cessio bonorum. ' * Other nations , whilst they Imave refused the creditor any immediate control over the person of the debtor , have allowed the latter to be confined in the publick prisons , both as a compulsory means of enforcing payment , and as a check to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have no means of discharging . In France , before the establishment of a system of bankruptcy , imprisonment for debt was practised against merchants , although it was not allowed in other cases . The common law of England , for reasons founded in Feodal policy , did not permnit the creditor to seek his remedy either against the land , or person , of the debtor . The first statute in Great Britain , inmtroducing personal execution , When a debtor applies for the benefit of this law , the creditors are called together to deliberate , whether they will grant him a letter of license , by which he is left free from restraint for a limited time , ( omni coeporali cruciotu semoto ; ) or ? receive from him a general assignment of his property , and discharge him altogether from imprisonment . Cod . Lib. 7. // was passed in the reign of Edward I , and was intended , as appears from the preamble , to secure merchants , and encourage trade . The enacting clause is in the following wordsAnd failing goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept in prison till he agree with his creditor . And if he have not wherewith to sustain himself in prison , the creditor shall find him in bread and water . ' The practice is still continued in England and , webelieve , in each of the United States ; though its severity is now greatly mitigated by allowing the debtor to be released after a certain time , upon his taking an oath of his inability to pay the debt , or support himself in prison . And even this limited term of imprisonment has lost its terrors , and in many places , even its inconveniences , from the practice , whic h generally prevails , of extending what are called the gaol limits , so as now to make the confinement little more than nominal . The attempts , which are constantly making to legislate upon this subject , either for the better security of debts , ' on the one hand , or the relief of poor debtors , ' on the other , manifest the dissatisfaction we feel under our present system ; whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituting a better in its place . And it will probably be long before we shall obtain a system suited to all the classes of a community like our own ;  --  a system which , whilst it shows that regard to humanity which the feelings of the age require , shall not trample upon the just rights of creditors , or remove any of those obstacles , which legislators are hound to oppose in the way of dishonesty , idleness , and extravagance . But , in the mean time , there is one class in whom the contraction of large debts not only furnishes no evidence of criminal intention , but in most instances is not imputableeven to extravagance or imprudence . We mean those ei*gaged hi trade and who are more immediately dependent upon the ope .. rations of commerce . Trade necessarily supposes the exis* tence of credit , whilst credit places a man 's success beyond his own control , and makes him , in a greater or less degree , dependent not only upon the good faith , but even upon the skill , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time the greater the necessity of credit amongst any class of men , the greater must be the sacredness with which it is preserved , and the more exact the punctuality with which engagements are fulfilled . It was therefore soon found , that the ordinary means for enforcing the payment of debts would // not answer the purposes of an extensive and liberal commerce . Hence has arisen , in almost every commercial country of the world , that system of laws , denominated Bankrupt Laws . It is a common but very great mistake to suppose , that this system is intended merely or principally for the relief of the debtor . Those , who have hitherto opposed its adoption by us are , for the most part , such as , considering the inefficiency of our present laws for the security of the creditor , have thought that the mischief would be increased by giving to debtors " that more complete relief , which they imagine it is the sole object of a bankrupt system to afford . But the fact is , wherever such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view to the creditor 's advantage . rrI*e first statute of bankruptcy passed in England was enacted in the reign of Henry VIII , when the principles of commerce first began to be understood . It is entitled an act against those who make bankrupt ; ' and the preamble , which is in the following words , will show the spirit in which the act was framed , and the objects it had in view. - Where divers and sundry persons craftily obtained into their hands great substance of other men 's goods , do suddenly flee to parts unknown , or keep their houses , not minding to pay or restore to any of their creditors , their debts and duties , but at their own wills and own pleasures consume the substance obtained by credit of other men , for their own pleasure and delicate living , against all reason , equity and good conscience . IBe it therefore &amp;c . ' Throughout this and several of the subsequent statutes , the bankrupt is uiiformly styled an offender . In process of time , however , more liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give these laws such a character as should operate beneficially upon the debtor as well as the creditor ; and make them the means of preventing oppression in the one , as well as fraud in the other . In France the word bankrupt yet retains its original signification , and is used to dt*ote a criminal . The laws of that country make mention of two kinds of bankruptcy-.simple and fraudulent. -. the former arising from imprudence or extravagance ; the latter , as the word denotes , attended with some circumstances of fraud or unfairness . Both species of bankrupts are amenable , though in different degrees , to the criminal laws . A person , whom we should denominate a Les Cinq codes De L ' Empire Fran*ais. code de Commerce , Liv . iii . A translation of the Code de Commerce , with learned notes , may be found in the Americaii Review , Vol. ii . No. 2. // bankrupt , that is , one who has become unable to pay his debts , but without fault , is said in France , merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankrupt law of Spain makes a similar division of insolvencies with that of France ,  --  as they are marked merely by misfortune , by negligence or by fraud ; and directs that persons , guilty of the latter kinds , be delivered over to the civil authorities for punishment . Thus we find that these are laws against debtors . And though they do in the end afford succour-most liberal and humane succour-to misfortune ; we are authorized in the assertion , that this has , in no country , been the primary object of their enactment , or the only important one which they are considered capable of accomplishing . The principal advantages of a bankrupt law may be stated to be-that they give the creditors a power of checking the career of their debtor , before he shall have stripped himself of the means of making any satisfaction of his debts ; - that they bring to light property of the debtor which would otherwise be concealed from view ; - that they place creditors whose elaims are equally meritorious upon an equal footing ; - that they entitle the creditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that they offer , some of them by direct punishments , others indirectly , discouragements to imprudeuce and extravagance . To effect these objects , the debtor is threatened , on the one hand , with the severest punishments , if he attempts to evade the injunctions of the law ; and , on the other , he is promised , in case his conduct has been fair and honest , greater or less facilities for commencing anew *i course of honest industry . These are professedly the objects of all . bankrupt laws , though they have been stated with more par* ticular reference to the English system , to which our remarks . will be principally applied . The bill which we have placed at the head of this article , and which is the one lately debated in congress , is framed entirely upon the principles of the Eng . lish law ; and should we ever be so fortunate as to obtain a uniform system of bankruptcy , it will in all probability be one after the same model . To the countries we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be added that of fiolland , although its laws on this subject contain no important characteristicks which are peculiar to themselves . This consentaneous practiee of all commercial countries would seem of itself to furnish an argument upon the subject . The same experience , which has taught them , will probably in time // Bankrupt Laws . teach us , that some regulations of the kind are required by the necessities of commerce . We have observed that one of the advantages to Creditor 's contemplated by a bankrupt law is ,  --  that it gives them the power of checking the debtor 's career , when it appears that his affairs have taken a disastrous turn . Ferhaps , in this particular , they have not answered their purpose , so well as was anticipated . the law of England has specified certain acts of the debtor ,  --  such as staying at home , and denying himself to a creditor who comes to demand payment ; flying from the country ; lying in prison for a certain time without procuring bail , &amp;c. &amp;c. ;  - -  - which are technically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of the statute merely to point out some examples of what might be considered the indicia or signs of insolvency . But owing to the construction which has been given to this clause , any one of the acts enumerated , of itself , makes a man bankrupt , and no other proof of insolvency , however conclusive , can be admitted to supply their place . As all the acts , except the one of lying in prison without procuring bail , are voluntary on the part of the debtor ; it follows that a man may be , and in fact it often happens that he is , notoriously and avowedly insolvent , long before his debtors can subject him to the bankrupt laws ; whilst on the other hand a man , by committing one of these . acts , may be made a bankrupt , though he has property sufficient to pay twice the amount of debts which he owes . In the law of France , as it existed before the revolution , flight was the only act of bankruptcy , ' mentioned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . In other cases , if a man refused payment , closed his shop or counting room , made a fraudulent assignment of his property , or committed some other overt act of insolvency ; any one creditor might apply to the consular court , who thereupon cited the debtor before them , when the question of solvent or insolvent ' was tried in a summary way ; the debtor being obliged to produce at the trial all his books and papers . If he were found insolvent , the seals were affixed to his effects and property ; and the bankruptcy was considered as commencing from the moment of affixing the seals . In the commercial code of Napoleon the overt acts , upon which the proceedings against the debtor must be founded , are particularly specified ; and the bankruptcy is considered as commencing from the time , that one or more of them are committed . So that in this particular there is now no real // difference between the systems of England and of France . It may not be expedient to allow the solvency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groundless suspicion , as might sometimes be done , if the law were to leave the acts of bankruptcy or signs of insolvency entirely undefined . But if the laws undertake to enumerate these acts , the enumeration should , surely , be as general and as complete , as the nature of the case will admit of . In this respect the English laws certainly appear susceptible of improvement ; . -. an improvement , however , which wa* not even attempted in time Bill now under consideration . An entire stoppage of payment ; unless attended by some one of the few acts mentioned in the statute , would not authorize creditors in England to sue out a commission of bankruptcy against their debtor . Whether it would upon the whole*be advisable to increase the number of what are termed acts of bankruptcy ' or not , it certainly would be doing no more than justice to creditors , to point out other circumstances , under which , according to the old rule of the French law , they would be authorized to put in issue the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defect in the English system , its influence even in the respect we are now considering has not been unimportant . For to say nothing of the probability that an insolvent person will commit some one or another of the ' acts of bankruptcy , ' he is much more likely , where such a system is in operation , to make an early disclosure of his situation , than he would otherwise be . Under laws like our own , a man in embarrassed circumstances , so far from finding encouragement to avow the state of his affairs , looks forward to an acknowledged failure , as to an event by which all his hopes must be eternally blasted . To pay the whole of his debts he knows lie is unable ; and to effect a compromise of them , can hardly appear much easier , whilst the success of the most equitable arrangement he can propose , may be defeated by a single hardened or exasperated creditor . He therefore studiously conceals his situation , and seeks to recover himself from it by desperate efforts . He rushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls , as in most instances he will , it is to draw others after him , who would otherwise have stood unmoved . But under a bankrupt law , failure would not be viewed as absolute and irretrievable ruin . A person , therefore , in fact insolvent , finding fe*ver temptations to the contrary , would be more likely to yield to the dictates of honesty , // and make a seasonable acknowledgment of his embarrassments . Besides this , the debtor knows that before he can obtain the benefits of the law , his whole conduct must be laid open to the inspection of his creditors , and obtain their approbation . And he can hardly flatter himself with obtaining ( as it is necessary he should ) the assent of two thirds of them to his discharge , if after having himself become apprized of his situation , he shall go on to waste his resources and extend his difficulties , by obstinate and useless attempts . Bat another great advantage , which we mentioned , as resulting from a bankrupt law ,  --  perhaps it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose claims are founded in equal justice . The whole system of favoritism in the payment of debts ,  --  with all its train of assignments , trusts , secret conveyances and friendly attachments ,  --  is do .. stroyed at a blow . By our present laws a debtor has a perfect right to prefer any one creditor to the utter neglect of the rest ; and even an assignment to secure endorsers who have not yet incurred any liability is good , and will be protected . In consequence of which , merchants have now established the principle amongst themselves , that endorsements and accommodation loans are to he satisfied to the last farthing , though the other creditors should thereby he compelled to lose their whole demands . Endorsers , who have given to the debtor that show of wealth , hy which others have been induced to trust him ; who have lent him the false colours under which he has been enabled to push his enterprises beyond what prudence would authorize or his real capital could support ; -. they are to be paid-principal and interest-whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debtor but in the ordinary course of business , is to obtain nothing . A merchant 's endorsers nre commonly those who are best acquainted with his transactions , and would probably be the first to discern any unfortunate turn in his affairs ; yet they may be kept quiet by the assurance that in any event they shall be secured ; - whilst the debtor goes on to make new purchases , and contract new debts . They too , who , for the same reason , could best tell where to seek for the credits and secret property of the debtor , are to be satisfied and quieted by an assignment of all his *visible property ; whilst the other creditors , some of whom probably furnished , upon the sole responsibility of the debtor , the identical goods which have gone to secure the endorsers , are left to seek out the invisible property , as good fortune may direct // them . The prevalence of this idea , that endorsers are at all events to be securetl , would of itself fui'nish a sufficient argument for the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a s*stern from encouraging men , as is sometimes alleged , to trade teo far beyond their capital , that in this way it would have a directly opposite effect . If endorsers were obliged to share , alike with other creditors , ther ashness with which names arc now lent wo N be checked ; and there would be less of that false credit , which a man obtains from the fact , that he has in some instances cornnianded the guaranty of those who are better known , and more confided in , than himself . But a preference of any creditor , whether an endorser or nou , may extend Ihe mischief of a failure infinitely farther , than it would otherwise have reached . Many a man has been ruined by the failure of ancther , who would have remained unshaken , could he have obtained such a dividend , as the property of the debtor was able to furnish . It is the object of the law of Bankruptcy , like that of insurance , to divide amongst many a loss , which must fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is next to impossible for the debtor , however honestly inclined he may be , and however clear his perception of what is right , to make a proportionable distribution of his property . A proposal of the kind would be an acknowledgment of inselvency ; and there is scarcely a creditor who would not consider it as an invitation to secure his whale demand by making the first attachment . An assignment , too , for the benefit of creditors generally , is void ; one for the benefit of particular creditors is only good as to those who assent to it . And a man may reasonably calculate , that so many will agree to an assignment , as may thereby be secured the whole of their debts . Au insolvent person therefore , seeing that he can not deal equally with all , naturally enough perhaps , avails himself of the privilege which the law allows , and gives the preference to those by whom he has felt himself most obliged in the course of his business , or to those in whom , from friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is an object of bankrupt laws , to discover and secure property of the debtor which might otherwise escape the view , or elude the grasp , of the creditor . A very large part of the xvealtli of every merchant is of that invisible kind , termed credits . Under our present law it is always difficult to ascertain where this kind of property is ; and sometimes impossi* Vol . VII . No. 1 . // ide to obtain any benefit from it , when discovered . If , for instance , the debtor has thousands owing to him upon negotia* Ide notes ; we have no means of compelling him to make pay* inent , but the dilatory and now ineffectual one of imprisonment . But by a bankrupt law every species of property , whether con*istiflg of lands , goods or credits , is instantly devested out of the bankrupt , and transferred to assignees , who hold it for the benefit of alt the creditors . The bankrupt is compelled to give Lipon oath , and under the severest sanctions of the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its situation , of his con*'ict towards it , and of the causes by which his losses have been occasioned . Thus creditors are furnished with every facility , which can possibly be given them , for I*ringing within their view and control all the property of the debtor . They are likewise let into the history of his misfortunes ; and are then left to decide how much mercy he is entitled to receive . We have already stated that the laws of France and Spain , for the purpose of discouragirg extravagance and imprudence* have provided punishments for bankruptcies arising from such causes . The laws of England think to attain the same object , by making it optional with the creditors , in every case , whether they will sign the certificate , by which alone the debtor can be discharged from farther liability . It has been plausibly objected to these laws , that they have a tendency to multiply crimes . And the various kinds of fraud , for which they provide punishments , are referred to in support of the objection . This appears as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws against robbery create crimes . In truth , they do so . But then , in both instances , the acts contern*. platedhy the laws precede the laws . Thus men , animofitraudi , ' do secretly or violently possess themselves of their neigitbour 's property ; and then4a*vs are enacted , by which such conduct is for the future made criminal . So debtors do now conceal their property from vie*v-they satisfy one favourite or dreaded creditor to the utter neglect and perhaps ruin of others-they make false representations of their affairs  --  and continue to live in idleness upon property , which in justice bel ngs to other men . All these acts are already practised ; and a bankrupt law would merely pronounce them criminal , and provide punishnients for their commission . It is true that under the best system of bankrt*ptcy , frauds will still , in some instances , be ommitted ; and so , men do sometimes steal , the State Prison notwithstandifl* ' ; and yet we do not consider this as a reason // for abolishing our laws against larceny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , they are but a counter .. part to the rest of the criminal code of that country . There must be something very singular in the construction of a bank rupt law , if it really furnish facilities or temptations to the very crimes , it was made to interdict . In France , although formerly some species of fraudulent bankruptcies *vcre punish .. ed with death , yet after a long experience upon the subject , it is now considered safe , in no case of the khid , to allow a severer punishment than imprisonment for life , and in very few , a severer than imprisonment for a limited term . Imprisonment for years was the highest penalty mentioned in the former law of the United States , or in the Bill we are now consider* ing . Indeed , the man who adds peijury to fraud for the sake of securing to himself property , which in law and morality be .. longs to his creditor ; who seeks to avail himself of the liberal rewards of the bankrupt system , whilst he evades its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who secretly takes a purse from the pocket of a stranger . Since , therefore9 the laws of England have seen fit to punish robbery with death , it was with perfect consistency , that they provided a similar punishment for cases of fraudulent bankruptcy . It only remains for us to consider the provision which the bankrupt law makes for the protection and relief of the debtor . And here we will notice the most important , and in fact , the only essential difference between the system of England , and those of the commercial countries on the continent of Europe . In France , when the person and effects of the debtor have been secured , and the creditors have been furnished with the state .. ment of his property , his debts , and the causes of his misfortunes , if there appear no reason for suspecting him of bankruptcy , that is , of fraud or criminal extravagance , he is per .. mnitted to make the best general compromise with his creditors , that he can . The compromise , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of the creditors , and approved by the vote of three fourths in number and value . TIme terms of it vary according to circumstances . Sometimes there is a general assignment of the debtor 's property , and a release , general or partial , on the part of the creditors .. Sometimes there is no assignment , but the creditors give the debtor a kind of letter of license , or , in other words , give him an extended term of credit . The same mode of proceeding pre .. vails in Holland and Spain ; andIhe whole plan is founded in // a slight extension of the principle of the civil law rule concern* ing the cessio bonorum. ' rihe only advantage then , ( but this is a very great one , ) given the debtor by the bankrupt laws of those countries , is the fre&amp;ng him from the caprice or revenge of any single* creditor , and enabling him to effect such a compromise , as shall appear fair and equita le to a specified majority . But in England the rule is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property of the debtor ; if no fraud can be chargcd upon him , and two thirds in number and value of his creditors will give their consent thereto , the law discharges hini from any fi*ther liability on account of the debts which were , or might have been , proved under the commission . rj his provision we believe to be founded in justice and practical good sense . The law sees the extreme improbability , not to say impossibility , that the cr ditors will reap any real benefit from retaining their power over the debtor , after they have once stripped him of all his property . Take the most favourable situation iii which the dttor is likely to be placed under the Frenclf law ; sUPPOSe that lie has obtained a renewed term of credit , after his insolvency has been published to the world , as it must have been by the I ) roceedings under the bankrupt law , is it possible that lie will obtain that chai acter for respo sibiEt ' * , which is absolulily necessary to his carrying on business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , to whom he already owes more than he is able to pay ? Will others , when they know that , at the end of a certain time , his property must become answerable for debts which he has not , at present , the means of discharging ? The chance must be very small , that at the expiration of the term of credit , lie will be able to make a more complete satisfaction of his debts , than he could have ( lone at the moment of the failure . The law of England , therefore , takes from the creditor no real advantage . True , it deprives him of a right , I e would otherwise possess ;  --  but it is a barren , useless right ;  --  a right to strip the naked , and to butcher the dead ;  --  or else it is a right wantonly to oppress and +o punish , without prosp *ct of producing amendment . The man who desires such a right is not fit to be trusted with it . But whilst this provision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives every thing to the debtor . Without it , stripped of his property , and the xieight of his former liabilities pressing upon him , it is imnpossi he he should ever rise . Indeed , the restoration of the debtor to his hopes and his usefulness , seems // not to have made a part of the policy of the French law . A failure in France operates as a sort of civil death. * The in* solvent debtor can hold no civil office , can not be an exchange broker , executor , trustee or guardian , can never appear upon the publickexchange , until he has obtained a decree of rehabilitation , ' or restoration to his former rights of a merchant . And the condition of his obtaining this rehabilztation is , that he prove that he has paid the whole of his ( lebts with interest and costs . ' A bankrupt law is intended merely for traders . iBut owing to the loose construction which has been given to the English statute , its benefits are often claimed by men for whom they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen from the accidents of trade . The law formerly existing in the United States had , in this part , copied the expressions of the English statute , and was similarly construed . This circumstance was attended with great inconveniences ; which the Bill now before us had provided against , by using such expressions as would have confined its opefr*ation to the proper objects of such a law . Yet this feature of the Bill has been made a ground of argument against it . We would only observe in reply , that whether a bankrupt law , which shall apply to every class of citizens , he desirable or not , we do not believe that it is for congress to make such a law . The expression , uniform system of bankruptcy , ' was undoubtedly used in the constitfltion , in the sense which every commercial nation in the world had attached to it ; and such a power was given to Congress , as part of their general power of regulating commerce with foreign nations , and between the different states . It was wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now suffering from the operation of the bankrupt laws of the individual states . But it is only traders who have any extensive connexions with the citizens of other countries , or other states . The debtors and creditors of men , who are not engaged in trade , may generally he found within the compass of a small neighbourhood . The French Constitution of 1799 , which , we believe , continued in force until the restoration of the Bourbons , contained this clause ; - The exercise of the right of a French citizen is suspended par 1'etat de de*iteu* ' faiii . ' Montesquieu mentions , in terms of strong approbation , a law of Geneva , by which the children of a person , who had died insolvent , were excluded from civil offices , until they had discha. ged the debts of their parent . Esp ( ICS Loix , liv . xx . chap . 1G. // Let Congress then pass a bankrupt law , in the proper sense of the word ; that is , one which shall apply to merchants and traders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass a similar law , which shall apply to farmers , lawyers , day labourers , or all otherciasses of their own citizens , there is nothing to prevent their so doing . We should have no objection to seeing the experiment made , although we have no wish that our own state should be the first to make it . Because a farmer , from a momentary inability to discharge a debt , should hap* pen to commit an act of bankruptcy , ' -instantaneously to transfer his land and all his other property from his possession ; to subject him to the jurisdiction of an extraordinary tribunal ; to compel him , under the heaviest penalties , to give testimony against himself ,  --  . -. would , we suspect , be considered a most grievous hardship ; whilst there is nothing in the pursuits of a farmer , or in the nature of his property , which de .. mands , as in the case of the merchant , or even justifies such a departure from established usage . And as to the benefits which a law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trader who is obliged by the very nature of his pursuits to contract extensive debts . Other . men may occasionally be disap .. pointed of a part oftheir expected income , but the merchantputs his whole capital at risque . He , too , is exposed to perils and accideuts by which other men can not be affected , A storm on the ocean  --  the carelessness of a sailor  --  the failure of a foreign merchant  --  or a change in the politicks of a foreigwgovern .. ment , may defeat the best commercial scheme , and reduce its projector from opulence to beggary . After all , commerce is but a game of hazard ; although , like other games , it has its rules , which it requires judgment to understand and skill to apply . But in other pursuits , knowledge and industry and perseverance are pretty sure to reach the objects at which they are aiming . In other pursuits , at least , the amount of profits may be calculated before hand , with some degree of exactness ; and it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his profits the flwasure of his expenses* But the most important reason for granting this relief to traders is , that without it , they can never recover from the effects of an insolvency . Credit is the life-blood of their business ; and this , a man who has publickly failed will in vain seek for until he has freed himself from his former liabilities . Sach a person , therefore , unfitted by his education for other pursuits , unless relieved by a bankrupt law , generally becomes // a useless burden to society . The number of persons of this description in the United States , is already alarmingly great ; and must be daily increasing . Among them are thousands and tens of thousands , once 4istinguished for talents , enterprise , industry and activity ; who entered upon life with high hopes and flattering prospects . Many of these have so long been the victims of anxiety and disappointment , that their habits of industry are now lost-4heir spirit of enterprise is broken down , * and their talents are dissipated . But this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared , have been living from day to day , upon property not their own ; and which they have . hid from the view of creditors , to whom it belongs , by the veil of fraud and prevarication9 till their moral feelings have become blunted , and the bread of dishonesty has lost its bitter taste . But yet there are many others , whom a bankrupt law would awaken to new life , and restore to their wonted pursuits , with most of their former hopes and all their former capacities for usefulness .
