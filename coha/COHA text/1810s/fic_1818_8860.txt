SCENE  --  A county in England . Preface . IN this state of domestic society , the situation of those who are so unfortunate as to be left Orphans , is comparatively made happy , by the kindness and protection of near relations or friends ; I believe I may say , almost without exception in every rank of life , that comfort and support is given , which can alone make amends to youth for the privation of earthly parents . If property is bequeathed , it is managed with zealous and affectionate activity , for the benefit of the Orphan ; if destitute , education is afforded ; support given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolence can devise . That such were the conduct of society in general elsewhere , is much to be wished , but innumerable instances convince us that it is often otherwise . To those who come from Europe , observation , if not experience , has told many a circumstance of cruel desertion ; where duty , religion and feeling , should have protected , guided , and comforted those who had claims upon the heart and purse , both from affinity and innocence . Here poverty , or even the desertion of a lovely female relative could such an event occur , would not be attended with the dangers and difficulties , such a person would be liable to in Europe : for virtue in a woman , is truly her guardian angel  --  absolutely securing her from insult . Long , very long may those who so religiously respect virtue , study to preserve its source uncorrupted ; and enjoy the consolatory reflection , that should their daughters be left in this Western world , without the advantages of fortune , if they are virtuous , they are safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The character of lady Flinty may appear gross and exaggerated , but there are such persons . Violence of an ungoverned bad temper in an ignorant woman , with a malevolent heart can do much mischief , and compel an husband of a good natured indolent disposition , to act even against his will and so inflict through criminal passiveness , evil upon others , and misery to himself . To exhibit the odious effects of such characters may have a good tendency , inducing the favoured youth of this land to reflect upon , cherish and improve their advantages , and transmit to posterity the same inestimable benefits ; having been controled in infancy , the temper restrained by rational tenderness ; their hearts kindly affectioned by religious and moral impressions : the mind not left in ignorance , but cultivated to the extent of its capacity . Taught in every class of society , to feel for all conditions of life , and to conduct themselves with affectionate meekness in the filial , sisterly or conjugal state ; and rarely do they act otherwise . There is something so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn mortals of the world seek its sweet influence when weary of contentions , arguments , and bustlings abroad . To man ! can human existence offer a more soothing balm than the meek , cheerful , cultivated mind of a wife or child ?  --  To a wife , the virtue , feeling tender mildness of man , is her bliss ; his sense , acquirements , honors and protection , her pride and delight ; to both , the gentleness , love , and obedience of children , are an earthly image of heavenly happiness . Main text Act . I. Scene Scene  --  an apartment in the house of Sir Spendall Flinty.  --  Sir Spendall reclining upon an elegant sopha  --  Anna seated by him , gently rubbing his foot  --  He starts up suddenly , then reclines again . Sir Spen . Sir Spendall Flinty What a twinge . A kingdom , for the man who cures the gout . Anna . Anna Suppose a woman finds the secret out ? I am sure you would not prevent her ruling the said kingdom , however , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would result from bad management . Enter Louisa , and Lucy as if fearful of disturbing Sir S. Sir Spen . Sir Spendall Flinty Not asleep girls , not asleep . Louisa play for me , where is the lyre ?  --  and Lucy give me your favorite song . Louisa . Louisa Is my dear father so much better as to ask for music ?  --  of late you seemed to have lost all relish for it . Sir Spen . Sir Spendall Flinty There has been a jarring in my mind as discordant as evil spirits would delight to inflict . Sing Lucy . Song . Lucy Lucy Sings . Hark ! the loud gun proclaims thy race is run , Celestial orb of day ; The last faint beam has glitter 'd on the wave , New regions hail thy ray . In fancy 's ear how fearful is the sound , When cannon 's thunder pours ; ' T is death 's bold herald on the wat'ry world , Destructive battle roars . O my lov 'd Harry , is it well with thee ? Waves thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be calm O boist'rous sea , And sleep , Bellona sleep . What sighs are those ? what mournful strain breathes low , Borne on the wint'ry gale ? Again ! again ? like Ossian 's trembling harp , My bosom tells the tale . Enter Lady Flinty , she goes up angrily to Anna and slaps her upon the shoulder . Lady Flin . Lady Flinty Get up you insinuating girl , do n't sit idle here ; where is your work Miss ?  --  it would better become you than thus stealing into the affections of Sir Spendall.  --  How many more falsehoods have you told him of my hard heartedness ?  --  get you gone Miss to your apartment . ( Anna rises  --  Sir Spendall looks timidly at Lady Flinty . ) Anna . Anna If I had some of lawyer Trap 's fine insinuating language , I might even steal into the affections of Lady Flinty . Lady Flin . Lady Flinty Impertinent ! begone , ( Exit Anna . ) ( She walks angrily about the room . ) I wonder Sir Spendall that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear it no longer Sir Spendall , either these hangers-on shall quit this house , or I must quit it , Sir Spendall Flinty . There is Miss Lucy too , of whom I have a pretty story to tell , and Emily forsooth thinks fit to do nothing but write love sonnets ; girls that should be earning their daily bread  --  go , go . ( Exeunt Louisa and Anna . ) Sir Spen . Sir Spendall Flinty Tol lol lol , de lol rol . ( Lady Flinty aproaches him with violence . ) Lady Flin . Lady Flinty Past all endurance . Sir Spen . Sir Spendall Flinty Not coming to slap me , my lady , this time as well as the girls ? Lady Flin . Lady Flinty They will slap your face , and mine also very soon : but to end the matter I repeat , Sir Spendall , that unless they are sent from this house , I will go from it . Sir Spen . Sir Spendall Flinty What new offence ?  --  I must be cautious how I turn them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , they are my father 's children , my sisters  --  and I promised to befriend them , in short to be a parent to them , till I should pay off their fortunes . You know our extravagance has exceeded the extent of my income , large as it was , and that I could not keep up appearances any longer , were I to pay their fortunes now . I tell you I can not do it . Be kind to the children and they will be grateful , but while you treat them with proud contempt , and ungenerous suspicion , as at present , what are you to expect ?  --  a worm will turn if trod upon . Lady Flin . Lady Flinty I tell you , Sir Spendall , you shall turn them out ; pray who is to compel you to pay them any thing ? not one of their brothers is in England to assist them , and if they were , thanks to my management , they have not the means to fee lawyers , and where would they find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security of boys in the army and navy ? Sir Spen . Sir Spendall Flinty Would that I had been gifted with a little more sense . Lady Flin . Lady Flinty To what grand purpose would you have applied it ? I should have hoped in treating me more becoming the dignity of lady Flinty , and obliging others to do the same . Sir Spen . Sir Spendall Flinty Worse than a fit of the gout . Dignity ! O dignity , where was mine when I married you ?  --  lost , lost in a fit of intoxication : where was yours , when you flew to Doctor 's Commons for a special licence with laywer Trap , and a  --  Lady Flin . Lady Flinty Hush how loud you speak ; but Sir Spendall , my dear Sir Spendall  --  remember , as your wife , my station should be respected ; besides I have claims upon your gratitude  --  does not Louisa live here in every instance as your daughter and mine ?  --  have I forbid , or opposed your bestowing upon her education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  have I ever divulged the secret of her birth ? Sir Spen . Sir Spendall Flinty No , no lady Flinty , you have not ; no more of this . Where is Trap and Squire Tinsel ?  --  ring the bell if you please my lady , and ask them to play a game of cards ; shut the windows , and let down the curtains , for the weather is raw and cold , and dark as a bad man 's thoughts . ( Lady Flinty rings the bell and the scene closes . ) Scene Scene changes to a sea-port town  --  principal object an Inn , the sign Bacchus .  --  A Sailor enters from the Inn  --  and enter at the opposide side another Sailor  --  he walks lame with a stick , has lost an arm , and his head is bound up beneath his hat . 1st . Sailor . 1st Sailor  --  ( starts with surprise . ) Ben Cheerly ! what my old shipmate , above-board ?  --  welcome ! welcome ! I thought that shot from the yankeys had sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Poor fellow , you have had some hard knocks though . Ben . Ben Cheerly Almost laid up for ever Jack ; but thanks to the generous yankeys , I am alive as you see ; they nursed me more like a friend than foe , and I never would fight them again if I could , with my one fin , but just except indeed , to see another such a glorious battle as the fight on the lakes . 1st . Sailor . 1st Sailor See it poor dog , why one glim is gone . Ben . Ben Cheerly And I would almost give ' tother for that sight ; true blood on both sides , ah , those fellows are chips of the old block , and it seems no disgrace like , to be beat by them . 1st . Sailor . 1st Sailor Ben , how did you get up again ; for we thought you were dead , and had not there been such quick work at the moment my boy , you would mayhap have been hove overboard . Ben . Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , but the last thing I saw with both eyes , was our brave lieutenant Freeman , who fell desperately wounded upon deck . I was made prisoner , and if all prisoners met with such soft hearted kindness as I did , the wounds of the body would hardly be felt . But what became of the lieutenant ?  --  for if he died I would rather have perished for him . 1st . Sailor . 1st Sailor Died ! no my lad . After you saw him fall the colours were presently hauled down , meanwhile some of us cast off the boat , and seeing the lieutenant was wounded , not quite dead , we made bold to swing him into the boat , we would as soon have left our heads as him , and so moved off with our booty in the confusion of smoke and battle . He is now snug in yonder , at the Bacchus ; poorly , poorly enough , but recovering though obliged to move slow , as a traveller ashore . Ben . Ben Cheerly Huzza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to hear he is alive : shew him to me , and tell me all about the rest of our crew ; but to him ! O to him I owe my life after all . Once on dangerous duty in the Northseas in an open boat , did not he , when those biting winds and burying waves made the stoutest seamen slew to leeward , stand to the helm ?  --  look at this fist ; tw ojoints of its clawers were frozen , my biscuit nippers fixed ; when Freeman forcing me to take the last glass of spirits on board , saved me from davy jones , snatched the helm from staggering Tom Pipes and away we spanked ; and yet he was but a Timmy noggy compared to us . Enter Freeman from the Inn .  --  Freeman 's left arm in a sling . Ben . Ben Cheerly Bless your honor . Freeman . Freeman Ben ! honest Ben ! do I see you ? Ben . Ben Cheerly Got off my beam-ends again  --  and right glad to see that you have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us on the lakes . Freeman . Freeman They were enemies worth fighting , and are friends worth having . I could embrace the brave M'Donnough as a brother sailor , though it was his envied fortune that day to conquer Britons : but here my lads , go and drink to this happy meeting . ( Offers money to Ben , who modestly refuses . ) Ben . Ben Cheerly No lieutenant , keep your chink , dock expences are heavy : thank you , though just as if I took it , and besides my main-top is too crazy for drinking grog yet ; but I am weary and must turn in. 1st . Sailor . 1st Sailor Come  --  Bet Blowsey 's are snug births ; beds as clean and soft as a white bear 's back , and when you can drink grog Ben , she will give you some fit for bacchus , as her sign notifies indeed . ( Sailors enter the house . ) Freeman . Freeman And I am weary too ; but once more in my dear native land , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , I should not complain when so many gallant fellows have lost their lives or limbs ; or like you poor fellow , his precious sight ; yet I can not forbear being a little impatient to proceed , still apprehensive that some more heavy days must elapse before I can fold to my heart the objects most dear to it . ( He lifts his hat and discovers a large black patch upon his temple and head . ) This wound if not indulged a while , will cause still more delay . O that I could fly to the tender assiduties of my gentle sisters ; but they can not yet have heard of my arrival . ( Freeman walks slowly off . ) Scene Scene changes to an apartment at Sir Spendall Flinty 's . Emily , Lucy and Anna . Lucy holds a book , Emily and Anna at work . Emily . Emily Certainly this will please lady Flinty ; I have done my best . O Lucy , put down that book , you know if she comes and finds you reading , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctantly looking at the page . ) Lucy . Lucy Poor Camilla , heigh ho ! well , now to work , instead of " to dinner , with what appetite we may . " Anna . Anna I must run down to feed my fawn , whether she comes or not . ( Exit Anna . ) Lucy . Lucy I would we were still at school , O how quickly , how happily the days passed ; how free from any real care . The morning tasks over , we bounded away with our gay companions like Anna 's little fawn , and played like it ; a thousand pranks ; night brought us undisturbed sleep , which gave new energy to our minds , but now  --  ( Sighs . ) Emily . Emily And have we not cause to sigh ! Lucy ? from these perpetual threats of lady Flinty to oblige us to leave the house ? Ah ! hapless indeed are those who early lose their parents Little does she feel for an orphan state ; in vain are all attempts to conciliate her regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprotected , our brothers exposed to every danger and far from us . Lucy . Lucy And if near , possess not the means of giving us an home . It appears to me , where there exists nobleness of nature , and whatever exalts and dignifies it , that too frequently the clog of poverty presses down each generous purpose , binding the will to hard necessity ; now were Frederick rich , or our Harry . Emily . Emily Frederick rich ? Harry rich ? I will not wish it , but that they were above dependence ! blessed with somewhat more than commissions and swords , I do wish ; but riches might corrupt them . Had Frederick competence , I would then offer you and our Anna that protection which a weak brother and an unprincipled woman , seemed determined to withdraw . Enter Lawyer Trap . Trap . Lawyer Trap Good day , young ladies ! good day ; busy , busy , I see ; I am always pleased to observe young women notable ; it keeps their steps and thoughts from wandering . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suppose that thought is stitched to our work ? it can be a thousand miles away from these mechanical movements of the fingers ; and instantly return to penetrate the closet enveloped object . ( Looks at him . ) Trap . Lawyer Trap Witty , witty , upon my credit ; but I came young ladies not to prove your wit , but your judgment ; and to point out a measure which I presume your good sense will adopt . ( Takes out a paper . ) This paper you are requested to sign , and are herein desired to acknowledge certain facts which are specified . First , that you have been educated ; secondly , boarded ; thirdly , lodged ; fourthly , clothed ; and at the expence of Sir Spendall Flinty ! and , as he kindly designs , as soon as practicable , to pay you all that you will be found entitled to ; it is necessary to ascertain what that will be , when certain deductions are made  --  after which  --  Emily . Emily What sir , does Sir Spendall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of our fortunes would have been adequate to defraying every expence we incurred . Trap . Lawyer Trap They are so heavy , that deductions will break in upon the principal . Lucy . Lucy I fear there is no principle in this transaction ; my advice is , to sign no paper whatever , without consulting some friend . Trap . Lawyer Trap And who will you consult ? make me your friend . Anna enters , as he speaks . Anna . Anna Such a lawyer as you , a friend ?  --  yes , as ld . Edward says , when there is so much money in dispute that a client can afford to spare half of it for fees , such a lawyer , might become a friend . Pray Mr. Trap return to the drawing-room and be lady Flinty 's friend , for she can pay you . Trap . Lawyer Trap Come , come , there are honest lawyers . Emily . Emily And such as do honor to their profession , and to human nature . Trap . Lawyer Trap ( Bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady ; indeed my dears I do . Anna . Anna Indeed my dears , he rejoices at it ; let him ask his conscience . Trap . Lawyer Trap ( Not attending to Anna . ) If you will confide in me , I will see justice done to you . Emily . Emily Are you indeed so disposed ? Anna . Anna Would you indeed trust him . I will tell you of a droll caricature I saw the last time I was in town , which amused me much , and if Sir Spendall had not been afraid of , I know who , he would have bought it . Well , there was a dark looking lawyer  --  ( glances at Trap ) represented with an enormous sack tied before him ; his hands were like claws , and his feet were cloven : all around this questionable man were heaps of gold ; money-bags , bonds , mortgazes , and houses too rolling towards his sack ; which with all his might he was striving to thrust into it ; and Emily , if you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valuable commodities , and  --  Trap . Lawyer Trap I think Miss chatter-box , it would better become you to be silent . Anna . Anna Allow me but to speak a few words more , only to repeat what I heard you and lady Flinty say a few minutes ago , about us ; a certain bargain , and a young lady  --  Trap . Lawyer Trap You shall shortly hear what you will not like .  --  ( Exit . ) Lucy . Lucy What did you hear Anna ? Anna . Anna What chilled me , more than the bleak wind  --  a promise made by lady Flinty , to obtain Sir Spendall 's consent to give him Louisa ; if he could induce us to sign a paper . Emily . Emily Can it be Anna ? Lucy . Lucy O he is the very soul of deceit . A dreadful storm hangs over us : I tremble at the idea of seeing her in a fit of rage : she will certainly beat us for offending her dear lawyer Trap . Emily . Emily Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scene changes to another apartment at Sir Spendall's.  --  Louisa seated at a writing-table , notes scatterd about  --  She finishes , and folds up a note  --  directs it and then looks attentivey at the address . Louisa . Louisa This to Lord Edward ; if I mistake not , it will give him pleasure . His eyes sparkle with delight when he looks at Lucy , and her blushing cheek tells , that he is not indifferent to her ; but it will not do .  --  Title and fortune rarely wed with humble merit . Alas ! I know it ; O my mother ! hadst thou moved in fashion 's splendid round , thy feelng heart had not been broken . Thy daughter owned a mother ! and a name ; ( holds her handkerchief to her eyes . ) A mother ! but she dwells in bliss above ; her unsuspecting youth betrayed , her mortal life became the forfeit . happy release , for she could not have borne the world 's contempt and scoffing . Enter Lawyer Trap . Trap . Lawyer Trap Fairest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you are forging new fetters for our beaux ; while they peruse these little billets , so elegantly penned , each heart will add another tribute in praise of your accomplishments . ( He takes up a note , puts it down , then looks at Lord Edward 's . ) This note seems to boast unommon pains ; none can compare with Lord Edward 's invitation . Louisa . Louisa There is no more attention bestowed upon that , than any other . Trap . Lawyer Trap Ah ! you say so . Come let me see how I stand in your estimation ; write me a card . Louisa . Louisa You trifle ; so many are to be written , that you had better assist , than occasion waste of time . Trap . Lawyer Trap That surely is no compliment : but give me the pen thy own dear hand hath held . ( He writes , but Louisa does not notice him . ) Now read what I have written . ( She still takes no notice . ) Nay then , I will read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be mine , dear Louisa . Louisa . Louisa Mr. Trap , you have set too long at the table . Wine has rather unsettled the knowledge of what you say . Trap . Lawyer Trap Wine ! No , no ; I have but drank enough to raise my buoyant hopes to thy fair ear ; and to look into those eyes , and dare to read acceptance . Louisa . Louisa Unparallelled effrontery ; vain conceited man ! my eyes will never speak acceptance of thee ! Trap . Lawyer Trap Pretty dissembler ! exquisitely interesting  --  throw off this playful mask . Have I not lady Flinty 's consent ; Sir Spendall 's consent  --  to be united to you ? Did I not hear your own sweet voice of celestial sound , declare to lady Flinty , I was  --  Louisa .

Lady Flinty And her hand he may take as far away as he pleases ; forward girl . But this night they go . Such insolence to Mr. Trap shall never be pardoned ; such insolence to me also , shall never be shewn again . Out they go . Louisa . Louisa Madam ! Lady Flin . Lady Flinty Yes , madam , they leave the house ; and this evidence of Lucy 's innocent ( sneering. ) conduct , helps them off : Fit for a poor modest girl is such encouragement of a young man of fashion ; it shall never be said we encourage such goings on at Flinty house .

Should you not rather , if you think there is danger for Lucy , warn her against it , instead of turning her out ?  --  by your protection , secure her character from any ill natured remarks ; though I am confident her innocence and prudence will secure the favourable opinion of the world upon every occasion . Lady Flin . Lady Flinty Let her innocence and prudence then , be her security and portion , and the portion of them all . But you also , Miss , have insulted me , and your father 's best friend , Mr. Trap ; but be assured you will be his wife . Sir Spendall ,  --  mark me  --  Sir Spendall will compel you to be Mrs. Trap . ( Exit Lady Flinty . ) Louisa .

Of all creation 's deck  --  Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck . So by St. George , St. Pat  --  and St. Davy  --  Not a man shall be wanting our navy . We sailors love old England , Our king  --  our grog and lass  --  And for this precious Island , Won 'd fight the world en maise . Come on then Bonaparte the grand ! We 'll soon shew how little  --  Your French in all their strength can stand , Against true British mettle . And by St George , St. Pat  --  and St. Davy  --  Not a man shall be wanting our navy . All chorus the last lines , and cry huzza ! Cloddy . Cloddy If poor mother had'nt cried , and taken on so mainly about it , I should have run up rigging before this . But now for the fun  --  here they all come ; stand clear , stand clear . ( A race in sacks . ) Now Roger , now Toney , now Dick  --  heavy heels has it  --  heavy heels has it .

If unsuccessful ; if disappointed in our hope of procuring work , what will become of us ?  --  I fear that Cloddy did not give my letter to the right person ; some powdered monkey took it from him no doubt .

What powdered monkey were you speaking off ?  --  what letter ? Lucy . Lucy ( Confused . ) A  --  a letter lord Edward to  --  Lord Edward . Lord Edward To a powdered monkey Lucy ?  --  what do you write to such ? Lucy . Lucy I write letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Edward Nay , nay , I heard your own beautiful lips express some words so very like a letter and powdered monkey , that I must be doubtful whether you are exactly telling the truth :  --  But a truce Lucy  --  I have done with joking ; and called to enquire for your health , and your sisters , since those horrid Flinty 's behaved so brutally . Lucy . Lucy I thank you lord Edward , we are well ; but  --  Lord Edward . Lord Edward But what Lucy ? ( He attempts to take her hand  --  but she withdraws it . ) Lucy . Lucy Poor and friendless , not in circumstances to receive guests  --  therefore excuse me if I retire . Lord Edward . Lord Edward ( Detaining her . ) Allow me the bliss of contributing to your comfort ?  --  what is the value of money , but as it can procure ease or pleasure ?  --  I have ten times more than I know what to do with rationally ; and rejoice that for once ! I can employ it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the friendly interest you take in us . But lord Edward , we can not lay ourselves under pecuniary obligations . We have applied for work ; resolved to support ourselves . Lord Edward . Lord Edward Work ! those bright eyes dim their radiance ?  --  no Lucy , work for your amusement but no more . Those pretty fingers are not formed to labor . Lucy . Lucy Brighter eyes and more delicate hands have earned a daily pittance ; it is more honorable to work than to beg ; and I have pride , lord Edward : there are few to whom I would be under obligation . Lord Edward . Lord Edward I had flattered myself that I stood above the list of common acquaintances in your esteem :  --  In mine how high do you stand ?  --  Esteem , do I say ?  --  you dwell in my heart !

Lord Edward Let me read my fate . ( Takes her hand and looks earnestly at her  --  she attempts to disengage herself . ) Dare I interpret , from that soft blush : and downcast eye , that Edward is not hated . O let me be your fond  --  faithful protector  --  place you in ease and affluence . Lucy . Lucy You have a father  --  a mother  --  noble friends to consult :  --  Without their approbation , never shall I hear you again on this subject .

Freeman I do not turn you out my lord , but you will do me the favor to take leave of this house ; and for ever !  --  I have heard your character , it is dissipated ; and am led to infer from the contempt in your countenance , when , as I entered , you named marriage ; that honor has no share in your visit here . My sister is too poor to receive the addresses of a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an honorable connexion ; and too virtuous to listen to any other proposals , even from your prince , lord Edward .

Dame . Dame Spindle I 'll do my best endeavors , so long as squire Pinch do n't find us out ; but if he should come and catch me at such doings , as making fire in this room  --  wearing out the chimney  --  the floor  --  the chairs  --  nothing I could say would save me from his fury , and I should lose my place . But come , the bacon and eggs are piping hot ; nice new laid eggs and a fine brown loaf , better than your sea fare , master Freeman ; but you must eat it in the kitchen .

What must it cost those hair brained galloppers , who style themselves travellers . How much precious gold do they waste and lavish  --  Sin , sin , better to wear away a little of their proud flesh in wholesome foot exercise . Well ! I can not accuse myself of squandering away money for any purpose whatever ; there it is  --  guinea upon guinea  --  pretty shiners  --  and then , in the bank  --  O how the name of Packwell Pinch is honored !  --  the great stockholder !  --  the rich commoner !

Free . Freeman This is a situation most unpleasant . Fred . Frederick Will my old uncle be ever hard hearted ?  --  O Freeman ! it distresses me to tell you , that he is my uncle . I have experienced his harshness , and know that he will indeed compel your sisters to quit the farm .

O , while your bosom glows with the divine impulse of benevolence , let it expand ; bestow upon those who will bless you every day of their happy lives  --  a portion of that wealth which is no better than a lump of dirt , while hoarded up . Pinch . Mr. Pinch Prodigal in every thing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . ( He looks at Freeman . ) But you can mould me as you please  --  while I look at you I am charmed into compliance  --  and can refuse you nothing . ( Goes to his desk and writes  --  Skin jumps about with delight . ) Skin . Skin Now I am no longer ashamed  --  but can look at you too . Pinch . Mr. Pinch By this I engage myself to give to my nephew Frederick  --  my Fairfield farm  --  worth seven hundred pounds per annum . Sign it , Skin , as witness . Skin .

Free . Freeman I thank you my good Sir . This day you will call the brightest of your life  --  when at its close , good actions stand by  --  to clear the deck for the last conflict . ( Exit Freeman . ) Pinch . Mr. Pinch ( Puases. )  --  I am spell bound surely . O that I had married and been blessed with such a son . What a wonderful impression !  --  my heart unfolds to the warmth of an undescrible sensation  --  new and delightful  --  I feel as if a better man  --  and worth a friend . Skin . Skin That shews the benefit of keeping company with warm hearts . Now your honor , I am going to set open every window , dust the rooms  --  rub the tables  --  turn out the plate chest  --  wash all your grandfathers and grandmothers faces in the long gallery  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you  --  as you go along . ( Pinch sits down to write  --  Exit Skin  --  the scene closes . Scene Scene changes to the Wood . Frederick  --  He takes out his watch . Fred . Frederick When I consider the consequences that may result from this duel , I shudder : On the one hand , should Freeman fall  --  his sisters are again totally unprotected , their elder brothers abroad  --  driven from their native land by Sir Spendall 's injustice ; unable to redeem their property by paying those fees which the law requires  --  they have left their country to find support elsewhere  --  and who shall protect these lovely girls ? Enter Freeman hastily . Free . Freeman I hope I am true to the moment ? Fred . Frederick You are ! Lord Edward has not arrived . Would that we met for a better purpose . Free . Freeman I meet you with inexpressible satisfaction  --  my mind is relieved from a dreadful weight . Fred . Frederick Have you received an apology from lord Edward ? Free . Freeman No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will promote your happiness and mine . Fred . Frederick A gift , for me ? I can not comprehend .  --  ( Freeman gives him a paper  --  which he reads . ) Dear Freeman ! how shall I express my gratitude ?  --  language fails . ( Takes Freeman 's hand affectionately . ) Free . Freeman Let all thanks be given to our Emily ; and O , be the protector of my Lucy and Anna  --  One more request  --  If I fall  --  give this to her for whom it is directed : She is dear to my heart  --  as Emily to yours . ( Gives a packet . ) Fred . Frederick O may you live to  --  Enter Lord Edward , and his friend  --  The seconds measure the ground  --  and all exchange bows . Lord Edward . Lord Edward Are you ready Sir ? Fred . Frederick A British sailor is ever ready to meet an honorable death  --  which honor calls that , we are preparing for each other . My professon obliges me , unhappily , to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemies of England . By meeting you thus , I put it in your power to add injury to insult . An apology can however do away the cause of our meeting  --  with that , though much aggrieved , I will be satisfied . Are you disposed to make it ? Lord Edward . Lord Edward No ! Sir ! Free . Freeman What are your intentions if I should fall ?  --  behold the powerful protector of Lucy . ( Points to Frederick ) Lord Edward . Lord Edward I came here Mr. Freeman to change shot , not words . Free . Freeman If you should fall lord Edward , picture the mournful distraction of your parents , lamenting the untimely death of an only child  --  to whom they look for the support of their name , and in whom they expected to see their own virtues reflected ! and with lustre :  --  Will you blast their hopes ?  --  rend their hearts with ceaseless anguish and regret ?  --  anguish for the eternal loss of one so dear to them ; unavailing regret that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you not return to Bloomfield ?  --  ( Leans upon the young man who accompanied him . ) Fred . Frederick Lord Edward was not worthy to be called friend ! after his late conduct . Lord Edward . Lord Edward Am I , indeed , become so contemptible  --  to one so valued ?  --  Fred . Frederick Be worthy of imitation , be truly noble , and confess that you have done wrong  --  have acted unlike a man of true honor  --  acted from the impulse of passion  --  not reason . ( Lord Edward throws down his pistol . ) Lord Edward . Lord Edward I am conquered . Pardon Mr. Freeman  --  more  --  give me your friendship ! I will endeavor to deserve its continuance  --  and never again , my dear Frederick , will I forfeit yours . ( Offers a hand to each  --  they pause in expressive silence . ) Adieu ! I 'm off for Oxford  --  where I will severely take myself to task  --  and correct my levities  --  then I shall hope to be as worthy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Enter Emily , Lucy and Anna . Lucy clasps Freeman to her bosom  --  Emily and Anna press around him . Emily . Emily Have we found you dearest brother ?  --  and you here also Frederick ?  --  then all must be right . Anna . Anna O happy , happy , indeed . ( Freeman affectionately takes their hands . ) Free . Freeman My sweet sisters  --  what a joyful meeting is this . Lucy . Lucy And are you indeed unhurt ! quite well ? Free . Freeman Yes , my Lucy  --  and so is Lord Edward  --  we have met and parted friends ; he is gone to Oxford  --  sincerely sorry for his indiscreet and unreasonable conduct .  --  And now , Emily , let me conclude this morning 's eventful transactions  --  by making you the happiest of the happy .  --  ( Freeman gives Emily 's hand to Frederick  --  she looks surprised and confused . ) Fred . Frederick Yes my Emily  --  I hope now to retain this hand a prisoner for life .  --  Your excellent brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  which puts it in my power to solicit the performance of a promise I would not relinquish for diadems . Unalterably yours  --  my whole life shall be employed in contributing to your happiness . Free . Freeman Her answer is in her eyes  --  O my sisters ! there is a never failing providence ! directing events through their proper channel for the advantage of all who trust the helm to the supreme guidance of unerring wisdon ; and though for a season the element looks dark , and stormy gusts almost overwhelm us , yet the good will patiently wait a prosperous gale  --  and finally arrive at the port of bliss .  --  ( Curtain falls . ) END OF THE PLAY .
