txt The . 1 buses of Political Discussion . LOOK at the examination of political questions in our own land , ( for we need not go one step further* ) and you would hardly suppose , that writers for the publick , had any settled feelings of their responsibility , or stopped to ask themselves , what influence they were exerting , or what might be its consequences . I am riot speaking now of the careful knave , , who has his eye upon preferment , and abuses the judgment and confidence of those who are to help him on . He measures his power very well , and looks distinctly to its effect . There are mischiefs and abuses in the discussions of men , who are honest and intelligent enough for the best cause ; of men who are too ignorant for the wholesome support of any ; and of others , who hope to make up in selfish prudence and acquiescence , what they lack in strength , decision , and independence . We have the resolute partisan , bound hand and foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures-.monopolizing truth , and yet shaming her spirit . We have the ignorant and vain , blustering in the // newspapers and publick meetings burning for notoriety ; and what is worse , finding readers and listeners as proud and prodigal as themselves , of the abused privilege of saying every where , whatever one thinks . If we go to a higer class of teachers , we shall meet the rash and decded politician , who would as soon part with his integrity , as keep back or mitigate a single article of his stubborn system . He is separated , perhaps by a few peculiarities of sentiment , from the calmest and most deliberate men about him-men too , with whom he mainly agrees and commonly acts ; but he will not stop to adv ise with them ; he plunges into the multitude with his novelties or eccentricities ; a most conscientious oracle truly , who would set the people in an uproar , when there is no safety but in calm cooperation , merely that he may send out his own opinion , or perhaps establish his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with publick feeling , or to humour men 's infirmities . He is too honest for that . It is enough for him that he is right ; and if others can not relish the coarse or ill-timed truth , they must look to it themselves . In times of dismay and confusion , when sacrifices , not of truth but of pride , are to be made ; when honest conciliation should mingle with uprightness , he will , with the best purposes in the world , harass and thwart the united efforts of men no less sincere and intelligent than himself . But rash and stern teachers are not the only ones who are censurable . There are men of a timid , selfish cast , who go for honest men , and would make you think they are *only prudent and busy for the Commonwealth . And it is sad , that the most successful school for prudence here , is that of popularity ; of getting and keeping office . Such teachers are rarely out of fashion with the times . Their patriotism is exceedingly flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They lead a life of apologies , and retractions , and new resolutions , so that the ignorant might take them to be as rash and erring as the lightning , though fair , honest , and repentant withal ; while those who see things better , believe that they are not loth to seem in errour , for the sake of putting on the charm of penitence and of respectful deference to the wisdom of the people . // Such teachers as these adopt popular and accomodating rules of political judgment and action . To day you will hear of measures not men , with an understanding , however , that the rule may be turned about with the changes of tomorrow . Again , we must fall in with the majority , either because it never errs , or because it is the safer side , or because you may rescue something from popular violence , by appearing to humour it . They have no indignation at guilt , unless it be unpopular ; no eloquence in urging duties which men are Wsckward to perform . They love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to be , in some humble measure , the source of their happiness . Such guides are the very last to inspire honourable confidence , or give stability to public opinion . They may keep things tranquil and gay about us , at least for a time , but they will add nothing settled or awful to the character of a nation , and nothing permanent to its welfare . The main thing is , for every political teacher to know his responsibility . A great man will , without vanity , feel somewhat in awe of his own influence ; especially when he sees that men are readier to adopt errour than detect it : that in the heat of political strife , they are eager after symputhy , and willing to fall in with the suggestions of any one , who seems interested and zealous for them , and who lends his reputation and powers to their support and direction . It is the duty , then , of those who think they owe their opinions to the publick , to understand pubhick sentiment and direct it wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their motives , but to look well to the probable effect of what they are publishing . They must use their influence prudently , for none can be stronger , more beneficial , nor more fatal . Some , indeed , hold , that in a free country , there should be a full expression of opinion , no matter how much it may differ from common or ancient notions and prejudices . We are told , that there are remedies enough for all errour , in general intelligence , and in the habits of inquiry and controversy , in which all have been brought up . The danger then of doing harm by publishing the wildest , the most portentous errours , is really so slight , that it ought not to be once thought of , when the advantages of unrestrained // communication are considered : such as a spirit of honest crutiny , independence of character and self-respect , a sense of one 's own importmce in society , the chance of getting at all political truth , and thus making the state sounder and happier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of extravagance , it goes too much on the supposition of human perfection , of the fairness and considerateness of men . It supposes that they have leisure , inclination , and ability to examine political questions thoroughly ; to sit down and make a business of growing wiser . This will hardly do , at least with respect to the generality of men . They should be jealous and enlightened , for they have much to do for the state ; but they can not he schoolmen , for their condition requires them to be in action . Their school is out-of-doors , under the hot sun , in the very stir of the world . They can not retire to sheltered port icos , to argue about the rights of man ; the blessed level of society ; the uses of fresh experiment or whimsical theory ; all which have at times made fools or knaves of the wisest , and surely can have no better luck with the unlearned . It should be remembered too , that where government , as in a free state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the penple , they must have some settled principles , some common feelings and opinions , which shall bring them to act in concert , and depend on each other . And these are not generally the result of any great reflection or inquiry ; but may often be referred to safe attachments and prejudices which we can not easily explain , or have had no time to look into . But for all this , we should hardly think men indebted to the teacher , who should , in his rage for improvement and free discussion , break up their earliest principles of action , undertake to scour off the rust of their old sluggish faith , and to make them ashamed of owing their safety to what he calls their ignorance . Such a teacher has to learn that there is a half-gotten wisdom , which is much worse than none , making deplorable havock among men , whose minds were sober and clear , till they were perplexed by truths they could not fathom , or were tempted to form to themselves glorious and fatal illusions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *surest way // is to fix attention upon principles that are obvious , practical , and essential ; such as a plain man wants to keep him safe and consistent in the discharge of his civil duties ; such as may be recalled without effort , and applied with almost instinctive promptness . When he sees intelligent men earnest in holding out and illustrating such truths and principles , he will feel some confidence in their powers and sagacity ; he will be sure of their honesty , because they address him in a way he can understand , and one that lays every passion asleep , which can clog or darken his judgment . He will be shy of teachers who presume to perplex him , or counteract the effect of sober instruction , by throwing out their opinions at random . But political discussion should be calm as well as practical . Our institutions and privileges are too costly to be the prey or theme of stormy and troubled eloquence , such as kindled the old republicks to madness , and led them to deal with the state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now considered as an insult to the flee , to tell them that they must respect deliberation , order , and settled habits ; and be content to keep their sympathies and ambition at home , under the control of good sense and sound morals . Still there are dangers of false excitement and corrupt eloquence even now . Men have not yet got over their love of being moved , of coming to their duties with feverish preparation , rather than with calm and brave resolution . And if you want bad men to succeed , the best thing you can do for , them is to form and cherish in the people a habit of excitement , of approaching their interests with heated minds , of looking upon truth as cold and spiritless , unless it is fairly on fire , or relieved and garnished by eloquence . Once get up this taste , in support of the honestest principles , and by and by you will find other teachers in your places , turning your weapons to most admirable uses , and lighting the torch of hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be misunderstood , nor considered as cold to the passion of eloquence , when it pours fresh and in torrents from a warm and full heart . I know that imagination was not given us in vain , *o be derided by the half-starved , calculating , frozen thinkers , who are too economical of intellect to // spare one needless thought ; too strait and puritanical in their rhetorick to admit illustration , if it come in ornament and magnificence . Let truth have all its natural lights and helps . The teacher of religion or politicks should bring to his aid all the force and riches of his genius . And if his heart is in the act , he will not fail to express his zeal , to pour life and glow into his thoughts , and stir up in others , the deep and solemn interest that is working in his own heart . But there is nothing unnatural or forced in this ; no attempt to produce excitement heyond the importance of the subject , or out of the subject ; to make men feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or because it delights the vanity , or advances the selfish purposes of the teacher , to hold the hearts of others in his hand , and play on them as pleases him . The interest that is excited grows up naturally ; the attention is fixed and sharpened ; a manly , discriminating taste is formed , and our moral perception is quickened . Another thing which deserves consideration , is the practice among our every-day political writers , of dwelling mainly , if not exclusively on popular topicks ; and rarely , or never entering on any discussion , independently of passing events and present excitement . The temptation is , indeed , strong to take men at the very moment they are formed to your hand . The writer is most willing to go through his drudgery , when the world is as eager to listen as he can be to impart . He longs to be felt and admired to-day . He tells you , that it is not for him to start inquiry and interest , and lead men coldly alongto conviction , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any thing but thrift . He is to throw himself into the crowd , and wait till the pressure of events has touched and moved them , and opened their minds to deep and immediate impressions . He will find listeners enough , when he talks to men about their own thoughts and alarms . He will lay his hand on the heart with power , when it is warm and tender . His instructions will go nearer home , when supported by present experience , and the uses of experience will be wider and surer , if explained and enforced , when the remembrance of what we have past through is yet unworn. // There are sprightly declaimers , who entertain themselves with this pretty talk about popular excitement . They seem to be as ignorant as children of the dangers to which it exposes the teacher as well as the multitude ; that his mind , his calm judgment may be swept away by the tempest about him ; or that it may become so buried in the present , as never to stretch into other times ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes , bearings , or connexions ; as if they might return , or be followed by worse than themselves . The fact is , we have talked about the wholesome agitations of society , till we are come to look upon peace as a state of intellectual sluggishness ; to think that men will not consent to listen till they have begun to burn ; that the mind gets its healthiest spring from popular turbulence , and will acquire best when it is most troubled . Think , for a moment , * hat hopeful progress will be made by men , who are hurried , raw and unprepared , from their regular industry , into the school of faction or revolution , to study their duties and rights , and lay up the lessons of experience . We see events crowding upon each other in a sweeping and wasteful tide . The crimes and wonders of yesterday are lost in the vaster ones of to-day . The wave that now rolls on the shore , is washing away even the desolations of the retreating one . And yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to studying facts ; you would initiate them in their duties , and form in them habits of calm reflection ! Much of this might indeed be effected , if political excitement were only a strong , generous desire , in the whole state , to bring about some definite good . But we know it to be contentious , blind , selfish , and bitter , laying men naked to all sorts of influences . And the wicked may thrive then ; for every office is held out to every man , and what should be deserved only , may be stolen or bought . They may make profit of treachery . They will work craftily upon the same passions which you are trying to feed with virtue . And the poison will travel as far as the blood , and through the same vessels too . No doubt , it is all right to make a fair use of opportunity* of general attention and warmth . But the writer , who waits till excitement comes , wastes the best hours which the people have for learning and preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , when its course is tranquil . This indifference is one of the plainest of all publick mischiefs . Even in a despotism it is an evil ; for even there the power of opinion is felt and respected . Let the soverign say , if he chooses , that his authority is his own ; that he owes no account of its exercise to any constituent . Let him plan and resolve by himself , and feel the web of his policy shaking and going to pieces , if the people but approach him . For all this , he is looking about for ever to know what is thought of him , and how far he may presume upon the forbearance , or build upon the affections of his subjects . In the government men live under , and in its administration , we may always read their character and influence ; and how important is this truth in a free state , where publick opinion is every thing , and its full and just expression , at the very foundation of freedom and security ; where honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people from trusting him too far . I shall hear , perhaps , that this supposed indifference to the state is all a dream of my own ; that men are always fond enough of meddling with government ; of touching it , however faintly , by an opinion or a vote . But take them in ordinary times ; the best and soberest men in the community , and you will.see how willing they are to forget past oppressions and insults , and to leave the country and the rulers to themselves ; how slowly they are startled by the early encroachments of power ; how content they are to give up elections to those , who have more leisure for the state , or more eagerness for their own preferment . There are dangers of indifference then , as well as of passion , And the guides of society can do no. better nor more honourable service , than making men intelligent and watchful when there is no fever in the blood . If the people will presume to take upon themselves the vast and solemn charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work upon their hands . They should be constrained to think , wheij there is time for it , for they have much to learn . Their only excitement must be a deep concern for their own welfare . Their zeal must be given only to their duties ; and they must take good care , that // they do not justify by their indifference , the rough reproach , which some one has cast upon their ignorance ; that the bulk of mankind have nothing to do with laws , but obey them . The safety of a free people is in the principles , taste , and calm habits of thinking , which they acquire when the mind is sober , and looks widely and fairly . They can then learn the worth of their actual blessings , and will grow more and more fond of what is settled and venerable , by associating it with their long happiness . They will thus be less subject to sudden changes of sentiment or condition . There will be something like natural growth in their alterations and improvements . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shaken out of their old feelings and principles , but will apply them as guides and restraints . And when the calm and level have come again , they will not sink into lethargy for want of excitement , but will return to their former state , with new wisdom and stronger attachments than ever . In such a nation , you will see every thing brisk , healthy , and conscious . A man moves there with an assurance of his dignity , with no sluggishness or wantonness in his freedom , and looking upon his duties as upon his happiness .
