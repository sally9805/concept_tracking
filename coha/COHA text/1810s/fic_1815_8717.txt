TO WILLIAM GIFFORD , Esquire , Author of the Baviad and Moeviad ; Translator of Juvenal 's Satires ; Editor of Johnson 's and other ancient Plays , &c.; &c.; &c.; MY DEAR SIR , YOU are , perhaps , not well apprised of all the trouble to which you have exposed yourself by the favourable sentiments which you long since expressed for " the Yankey in England . " Footnote : 1Kb But for you , the manuscript which introduced this acquaintance would not have seen the light . Hence arises the virtual claim on you for patronage . Of my manner of proceeding , you will be informed by an extract from my letter , dated in April last , which possibly you may not yet have received . It was introductory of Mr. T  --  , from whom I have not yet heard . " For myself , be assured , my dear Sir , I shall never be unmindful of your kind attentions to me , and the candid and friendly expressions contained in your letter of the 25th March , 1807 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time since I left England , the Comedy see Note at page 6th , which you were so obliging as to read and criticise with so much candour and friendship , I profited by your valuable remarks , by suppressing the character of Metroman , and putting his business in furthering the development of the plot , into other hands . I made some other material alterations , in retaining entire the parts which you observed could not be improved . I moreover sketched some critical and explanatory notices on the Yankey character , which will accompany the Play , if ever it should be published . " It was by your judgment ( from which , indeed , I could not appeal consistently with my own ) that the literary adventurer , Metroman , has ceased to exist , justly charged with want of importance : a charge which , admitting it to be a capital crime , would operate so powerfully in thinning the world of its inhabitants , that Mr. Malthus might safely disband his organized corps of destroyers , Footnote : 1Kb famine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying is but too well known . That for preserving in existence those characters which you have saved , remains to be seen . The revolutions in taste as well as in politics , succeed each other with such unprecedented rapidity , that you , who are so much in vogue , and possess so much power to day , instead of giving , may be under the necessity of receiving protection to-morrow . Everybody knows that you have as many enemies as there are surviving friends of those numberless innocents who have fallen victims to your pen . It would be an idle task to attempt to conceal that the De La Crusan School , the whole Blue Stocking Club , and half a score of the offspring of Thalia and Melpomene , have come to an untimely end by those homicidal weapons , your Baviad and Mviad , which you pretended to have used only in sport . Knowing , as you do , the sentence passed on Selim the Persian , Footnote : 1Kb who was tried in England , some sixty years ago , for high crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you are accused , ) it is wonderful that you rest so unconcerned about your future fate . In requital for your kindness I shall just give you a friendly hint on this subject . If a prosecution should be instituted against you , I know not where you can find safety , except in these hospitable regions of the new world . Should the avenger of blood pursue , here you will find a plenty of cities of refuge . You have no notion , my good Sir , how many Princes in disguise , Knights of the shire , and gentry in distress , have favored us with their company ; nor how narrowly we escaped the honour of having an Imperial name added to the list . In the mean time , if you will permit so abrupt a change of style and subject , I will take the liberty of saying there are many in this country who think , notwithstanding all these imputations , that your writings have contributed very much towards the preservation of the purity of the English language ; and that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains to be done in so good a cause .  --  With these sentiments I am happy to concur , in repeating the assurances of the great regard and esteem with which I am your sincere friend and humble servant , D. HUMPHREYS . Humphreysville , Sept. 1 , 1815 . NOTE . The title of the following play has been changed from Comedy to Drama , for reasons , perhaps , not so obvious to others as conclusive to myself . The observations which have sometimes been made on that species of Dramatic productions , denominated by the French la Comedie larmoyante , have not escaped notice . Gay and serious scenes , it is apprehended , may not appear unnatural in the same play . To mingle incongruous matter , without any discretion , in the same scene , can not fail to produce an ill effect . Variety keeps the attention from flagging . It does not appear to be detrimental in any respect , provided it occasions no interruption to the progress of the business . The same caution should be observed so far as not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the catastrophe . Expectation should , as much as the plot will permit , be kept up until the final denouement . Whether the scenes which were intended to be humorous and spirited , or those of a more serious and impressive nature , are the least exceptionable , must be left for others to determine . It will be sufficient for my purpose if they should not be found either heterogeneous or discordant in such a degree as to furnish any just cause for disgust or disapprobation . With the moral tendency of the whole , my mind is perfectly satisfied . FABLE . Footnote : 1Kb TWO young gentlemen , educated at the same College in America , but influenced by private connections and different political views , took opposite sides in the American revolutionary contest ; and though necessarily separated for a long time , still cherished that ardent friendship which in their juvenile years they had contracted for each other . During this long period of separation , both experienced great vicissitudes of fortune ; and both , while their talents and adventurous dispositions at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matrimony and suffered heavy domestic calamities . Stuart , who fought on the British side , and was a General officer in that service at the time of the play , had been reported among the slain in India , and his wife , on learning the fatal news , expired with the shock , in giving birth to a daughter , who , by the management of a shrewd and well educated chambermaid of the mother , became the favourite and adopted heiress of a rich widow , then returning to England . The vessel in which they embarked foundered in a storm . The benevolent widow and all the passengers perished , excepting the orphan , the attendant , and a little servant girl ; all of whom reached Lisbon in safety . Here , this crafty and aspiring woman appropriated to herself the widow 's whole legacy to the orphan ; and assuming the character of a lady of fortune , placed the injured child in a convent . The General , after his recovery from a wound which gave rise to the report of his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressing occurrences , and remained still ignorant of the existence of his daughter . Davis , the other friend , who went to sea to seek his fortune , was taken prisoner by the English , and having escaped from prison by uncommon address , found refuge in a respectable family , where he privately married a young lady by her father 's consent . Compelled to fly , for fear of being discovered and apprehended , the boat in which he was embarked for France was upset in crossing the Channel , and he drowned , according to a circumstantial report , which was confirmed by such unquestionable evidence as to be fully believed by his disconsolate wife . The birth of a male child having ensued under such afflicting circumstances , occasioned her falling into a delirium , which continued for a long time . During this period , the infant was taken from her . After the return of her reason , all search proving vain , she embarked for Lisbon as the companion of a wealthy lady , going there for the benefit of her health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found an asylum in the same convent to which the orphan from India was , a little while after , brought for education . Attracted by mutual sympathy , they were soon united by sincere and strong affection . During an excursion for their health to Cintra , they met with an amiable and accomplished merchant from Lisbon , who became enamoured of the young lady , and was in turn beloved . After her return to the convent , to avoid taking the veil or being compelled to marry a young Frenchman , she escaped in disguise , and , with her foster mother , arrived in England . The ardent lover being informed of this adventure , rashly assumed the name and character of the Frenchman , ( with the hope of obtaining information from the Frenchman 's uncle , ) followed them without a passport , and , by the extravagance of his passion and frenzy , suffered himself to be guilty of such conduct as to be convicted as a spy , at a most critical moment , when England was fraught with treason and threatened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first educated as one of the Bluecoat-Boys in London , and afterwards brought up in a commercial house of the first eminence in Lisbon , and ultimately taken into partnership , he , by a natural concurrence of circumstances , is discovered to be the son of the Admiral ; to which rank , in the Russian service , Davis had risen by his merit , under an assumed name , which , after his capture and escape from prison , a regard for his own safety obliged him to take . The coarse manners and profligate character of a French adventurer would not have been admitted , but for the sake of making him a foil to the ancient nobility of France . In forming a matrimonial connection with the Countess , interested motives operated on both sides . He gained a fortune . She , a title . After having added another immoral action to the catalogue of his crimes , his profligacy meets with a just retribution . Mr. and Mrs. Newman hold respectable situations in the Countess 's establishment , and are introduced as agents indispensably necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and completing the denouement . He is an American of good education and morals , who had formerly been employed on a commercial agency in foreign countries , and who had lately escaped from slavery in Algiers . Mrs. Newman is the same unlettered girl who was in the service of the rich widow on her passage from India , and was saved from the wreck with the orphan and her attendant .  --  She must be supposed to have considerable interest with the Countess , as her confidant . Passionate and indiscreet , actuated by a sincere but jealous attachment to her husband , she copies her lady closely in some things , and is reclaimed by his affectionate but decided conduct . The Roman Catholic Priest , exemplary for his piety , arrives , opportunely , to offer the consolations of religion to a person shrinking with terror at the immediate prospect of death , struggling on the rack of conscience , and hurried to the brink of despair , between the torture of doubt and the horror of suicide . To prevent the appearance of too much resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrought in them by altogether different processes of the reasoning faculty . Extraordinary as the incidents are , they do not appear out of nature ; nor any of the results beyond credibility . By laying the scene in one of the most frequented seaports in the world , where passengers are incessantly arriving from all quarters , the writer has , without any apparent effort for the purpose , preserved the unities of place and action . The same circumstance has enabled him to give a farther appearance of verisimilitude to the whole , by confining the time for the completion of the plot , to that of the representation . The perusal of this Drama , founded on such assumed facts , leads irresistibly to a consideration of the assertion which has sometimes been made , that there exists no national character in the American people , whose ancestors came from so many different countries of Europe . Sketches OF AMERICAN CHARACTERS . IT will be observed by those into whose hands the following sheets may fall , that an attempt has been made to sketch three distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whose discriminating features are principally to be attributed to education . Little hazard of contradiction will be incurred by asserting , that more knowledge adapted to the common use of life , is diffused amongst the common mass of people in this , than in any other country . Of the higher attainments the same may not be asserted . There is less apparent difference between well educated men in Europe and America than is commonly imagined . Between those in England and the United States there is scarcely a shade of discrimination . For the cultivation of the human mind , the labours of the same classical authors are common to both . In forming taste , the same course of studies is pursued . But Americans in general , and more especially in the Eastern States , from the smallness of their fortunes , the necessity of applying themselves to some profession , and the consequent want of leisure , have fewer opportunities than Englishmen , for indulging themselves in the pursuit of abstract science , or the acquisition of ornamental accomplishments . Under these particular disadvantages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manners , or in their conversation or style , in many instances , suffer by a comparison with men in the first circles of society in other countries . Some of these Americans , emerging from obscurity , have reached the summit of renown , by services in the cabinet and achievements in the field ; while others have been not less distinguished for literature and discoveries , or for promising specimens of genius in the useful and fine arts . This , it will be noticed , is the first class of characters , marked as distinct in the division , to which the attention is referred . No people ever before commenced their existence as an independent nation with a language so copious and so refined as was the English , at the time of the declaration of Independence . In no other nation , with equal population and resources , had education ever before been so much and so unremittingly an object of attention . From this state of things , it is naturally to be concluded , that the English language is not generally spoken any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In New-England , where property was more equally distributed than elsewhere , schools , academies , and colleges , were early founded , while the first settlers were still suffering in penury , struggling with embarrassments , and surrounded by perils . A number of youths , who were not educated at the colleges , had the advantage of what was called a grammar school education . This system of preparation for different employments , still continues in practice . The young men , brought up in these secondary seminaries of learning , in their intellectual acquirements , are inferior to those whose education has been described , and superior to those who are educated in our common country schools . They are competent to perform the high duties of useful citizens , or hold important offices under our representative government , with credit to themselves and advantage to the community . For the sake of illustrating more particularly the last , though not the least important branch of the system for forming men of business , an allusion may be made to the regulations adopted by Connecticut ; where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better organization than in most other States , and certainly with not less beneficial consequences . Public or free schools , kept for a certain number of months in each year , in the several school districts , into which the inhabitants of all the towns are divided , are established by law , and provided with instructors . The school fund , or capital appropriated to this purpose , amounts to more than 1,200,000 dollars . Each town draws in proportion to the taxes it pays , on what may be denominated the grand list or levy . In addition to this support , the schools , by means of voluntary assessments , are in most districts kept open for instruction throughout the whole year . Thus , the poor can not lack opportunities of having their children instructed in reading , writing , and keeping accounts . In the greater part of these schools , which are under the direction of school committees and visitors , English grammar , geography , and several other branches of practical knowledge , are likewise taught . To the instruction communicated in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , normal institutions , the mental improvement of the third description of characters is limited , in early life . They not unfrequently add much afterwards to their original stock , by their own judicious observation , in mixing with mankind ; as well as by the help of books , whenever their avocations will allow them time for reading . In Newman , the education and manners of the second class are intended to be exemplified  --  In Doolittle , those of the last . Newman should be represented as possessed of good sense , with a little propensity to Yankey drollery . These dispositions should be accompanied by a faculty of judging characters correctly , together with abilities and information sufficiently extensive to render him useful in almost any situation . Several young men of this description , without patrimony or patronage , having gone abroad in the spirit of honorable enterprize , have succeeded beyond their most sanguine expectations in making their fortunes . They offer respectable models for imitation . The application of the word Yankey has often been vague . It has sometimes been applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New England men in particular ; and then to the inhabitants of the interior parts of New-England , as distinguished by a peculiar idiom and pronunciation , as well as by a peculiarity of character . In this last sense it is here used , for designating " the Yankey in England . " In the second acceptation of the term , the natives of New-England are proud of having the appellation applied to them . If ever accident gives a claim to honorable distinction , in this , at least , they may applaud their good destiny . The character of the Yankey , from whom the play derives its name , is little understood in several parts of America ; still less in Europe . Although this Yankey , whose characteristicks in the abstract are designed to be personified in Doolittle , may be fairly a subject of risibility on account of his dialect , pronunciation , and manners ; yet his good qualities , even in the estimation of a rigid censer ; will , doubtless , more than compensate for his singularities and failings . Made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural and excessive curiosity , confirmed by habit ; credulous , from inexperience and want of knowledge of the world ; believing himself to be perfectly acquainted with whatever he partially knows ; tenacious of prejudices ; docile , when rightly managed ; when otherwise treated , independent to obstinacy ; easily betrayed into ridiculous mistakes ; incapable of being overawed by external circumstances ; suspicious , vigilant and quick of perception , he is ever ready to parry or repel the aacks of raillery , by retorts of rustic and sarcastic , if not of original and refined wit and humor . How far , as a new character , he is suited to figure on the stage , must be left for others to decide . Of the rest of the dramatis person it is inexpedient to anticipate any thing which might tend to relax the attention , or disappoint the expectation . The same observation will apply , with respect to the conduct and catastrophe . Other Americans are put in action to multiply incident , heighten contrast and add interest to the denouement . Their characters must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment and manners , than by the colloquial style of the interlocutors . Example places objects in a stronger light than description . They are more prominent , and , as it were , more palpable . Beauties or deformities thus embodied , have a more powerful influence to please or disgust . A well-regulated Theatre , where virtues and vices are brought into action , and where poetical justice may be done to all , has been considered in almost all civilized States , an excellent school of manners and morals . A licentious and profligate Stage is the reverse . But we must take care not to confound the use with the abuse , in this any more than in other subjects . The printing of a new play , in a State where the acting Footnote : 2Kb of plays is prohibited , seemed to require the foregoing elucidation of the principal object . No apology is necessary . None intended . No dramatic performance should meet with encouragement , at the representation of which a husband and father would not willingly suffer his wife or daughter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulted with profanity or ribaldry , nor the virgin cheek be made to blush at indelicate expressions , that should stamp with indelible infamy some of the wittiest productions of a former age . The public taste , it is hoped and believed , is becoming daily more and more correct . It is not paying an unmerited compliment to say , no blandishments of genius and art , no fascinating charms in the preparation of pieces for the Theatre , if at the same time they are poisoned by vice and obscenity , can hope to be approved by the American public .

Exeunt . Curtain is drawn and discloses Count and Countess St. Luc , seated at a breakfast table , helping themselves , sipping coffee , and speaking alternately . C'tess . Countess St. Luc No ! Such expenses in this last voyage from Lisbon to London , which has been protracted so much beyond our first calculation  --  No ! It is impossible . C't . Count St. Luc I had flattered myself you have jewels here , on which this sum could be raised : besides , I have reason to believe , you have somewhere a casket , which you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I own I did expect  --  C'tess . Countess St. Luc At present , it can not be . C't . Count St. Luc I urge no farther . You will think seriously of what I have been saying . C'tess . Countess St. Luc Yes , I will ; but , my dear Count , since our protege , in the convent of Odivellas , will not profess and take the veil , we must get her safely married , to avoid future trouble . C't . Count St. Luc Right . We must . C'tess . Countess St. Luc You will no longer oppose her becoming the wife of our friend , Dr. Metroman  --  a wit , a poet , a man of talents for society ; in short , a genius and a gentleman , worthy the hand of a Duchess . Under existing circumstances , it can not be disagreeable to you . C't . Count St. Luc Nothing could be so grateful to me as to contribute to your satisfaction , if she had not been destined for my nephew , the Count de Favart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . C'tess . Countess St. Luc You knew my intention long ago . Mr. Metroman will transport her to the interior territories of the United States . And you are sensible of my motives for wishing her as far from us as possible . C't . Count St. Luc There will be no difficulty in that , after her marriage with my nephew ; for which , I have given him my promise . C'tess . Countess St. Luc And why did you , without consulting me ? C't . Count St. Luc I deemed it superfluous . A connection so eligible , such honor conferred by an alliance with his blood ... I am positive , there can be no serious objection on your part . C'tess . Countess St. Luc But I am positive there can . C't . Count St. Luc Not when I tell you , as I now do , it is an affair finished . You are only jesting , my sweetest ! You will not persist . C'tess . Countess St. Luc But I will , my dearest ! And I shall let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officious to interfere in what was settled before I had the honour of being acquainted with you ; and in what you have , of right , no concern . C't . Count St. Luc Nay , that is going too far ; and so to conclude the matter , I tell you once for all , she shall marry my nephew . C'tess . Countess St. Luc And once for all , I say she shall not . C't . Count St. Luc What signifies your saying ? C'tess . Countess St. Luc As much as yours . C't . Count St. Luc Do n't irritate me ! C'tess . Countess St. Luc Nor me ! I shall let you know who will govern . C't . Count St. Luc ( Sneeringly ) Lofty pretensions ! Your pride may be mortified when the world shall discover what your ladyship has been . C'tess . Countess St. Luc Insinuate ! When we return to Portugal , where I 've some influence , I 'll make Lisbon too hot for you  --  I 'll ... C't . Count St. Luc Hot ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot drug .

Mrs. Mellin Brought up in the school of adversity , poverty and privation have no unusual terrors for me.

I am quite gay ! If ever I am sad , ( sighing suddenly ) it is only when I reflect that I am a poor , unknown foundling , and have nothing to offer in return for all your more than maternal kindness . Oh ! Oh ! Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin Say nothing of that , I entreat you . In acting as a mother , according to my feeble means , the pleasure , I trust , has been mutual . Our thankfulness for past favours , belongs to Providence . In our flight we left Portugal empty-handed , and I am not without apprehensions of your being reclaimed as a subject of that government .

How can you make such an extravagant assertion ? Rich ! an heiress , indeed ! Maria . Maria I maintain it . I am  --  and I will prove it too . I shall be the heiress of your virtues  --  worth more than money . Besides , I 've money now , in hand  --  Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin Maria , are you beside yourself ? Maria . Maria No. ( with archness ) See THIS ! ( shewing and shaking the purse ) Hark ! substantial chink for emigration ! Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin ( With astonishment ) What ! What is that ? Money ?

Maria ( Gaily ) Huzza ! huzza ! Now for America . I am ready . After paying all our bills here , if there should not be quite money enough for both our passages , ( for they charge confoundedly high in war time , ) do you know what I propose to myself ? Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin No : doubtless , some wild freak , nobody but you would have thought of . What do you intend to do ? Maria . Maria To work my passage .

( singing out ) Yeho ! Yeho ! Yeho ! When rocked on the dizzy mast , amid the darkness of the midnight storm , you will hear me sing out , Yeho ! yeho ! avast ! belay , there ! lads ! below ! Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin What rhapsodies ! Your imagination runs away with your reason . When will you be serious , my sweetest child ? Maria . Maria I am serious . And when we have reached America , I will earn our bread for both of us : yes ; for both of us ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , if but a crust , I shall share it with my dearest mother : and then , it shall never be moistened with her tears , while I can wipe them away with a kiss . ( kisses her cheek . ) Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin Do not make me weep with your innocent simplicity . Inconsiderate , as you are , you know nothing of the hard rubs and jostlings to be encountered in this rugged world . Poor , inexperienced girl ! You gain for us a livelihood ! You ! Maria . Maria I  --  yes  --  I  --  and I will tell you how I will do it . First  --  let me consider  --  ( in deep reflection ) what I will do first : first , I will go on the stage . I can sing , dance , and play on the guitar , harp , and piano-forte . And why ca n't I act tragedy and comedy ? I never thought of it before  --  but I can  --  for , when animated by filial piety , I feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of my ability . So , when the good-natured audience , who will always side with innocence in distress against ill-natured critics , shall know , that , while I strive to please the public , it is also to maintain a mother ; you will see such crowded houses , and hear such thundering applauses ; clap ! clap ! clap ! as shall make your very heart and soul exult in the talents and success of your little Maria . Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin Delightful reveries ! Supposing you fail . Maria . Maria No : I wo n't fail . I wo n't suppose any such thing . I ca n't fail . Well ; for argument 's sake , I will suppose any thing to please you , mama . Why , then I will turn to profit , my skill in making artificial flowers , in lace , fillagree , and embroidery of all kinds . Now what is your opinion of that ? Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin Oh , child ! you are not going to a land of luxury . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Your skill , I fear , in case of need , would turn to an unprofitable account , and leave us to starve in the MIDST of PLENTY . Maria . Maria Starve , in the MIDST of PLENTY ! You ca n't discourage me so . Never fear THAT . While eating is in fashion , nourishment must be produced from the earth . I can dig . Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin You dig ! Maria . Maria Yes . I know how to cultivate a garden . Blossoms ! ( poor things , ) like me  --  Fruits ! like you , mother . If no other employment is to be found , and fortune offers no other resource , I will preserve our independence , by extorting a reluctant subsistence from a churlish soil . Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin You , ( though an orphan , ) never knew hardship . And can you accustom that graceful form and those delicate hands to such gross occupation ? Maria . Maria Yes : in such a case , these hands shall WORK and WORK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep a wink . I will wear these fingers to the bone ! Mrs. Mel . Mrs. Mellin Heaven avert the necessity ! You were not formed for such a lot . You are too feeble . Maria . Maria It is true , I am not quite a Goliah , or a Hercules ! But , I presume , I am as big and as stout as Jack the Giant-killer  --  and in STRENGTH you shall see I am a very mammoth ! when there shall be need of exerting IT for a mother . I hear voices approaching  --  we are interrupted just at the moment when I was about claiming the fulfilment of your promise to tell me your story , previous to your coming to Portugal .

The remembrance of the sweet scenes in the Orange-groves of Cintra , that witnessed our plighted vows , when last I met her , for a while at liberty from the Convent , most delicately fair in convalescence ,  --  confirm that courage , which conscious virtue only can inspire !

But where have you been , my old friend ? What have you done , since you raised a Company , were wounded in America , and had your wound cured in England ? I learnt thus far from our friend Williamson . Gen. General Stuart I went to India , with the fairest prospects . Adm . Admiral Dixon Did you carry your wife there ? Gen. General Stuart Yes ; alas !

General Stuart Before it was known that I was living , a lady took the orphan and our maid , ( that smart , well-educated American girl , you may remember , ) under her protection . They embarked for England , and were lost at sea . Oh !  --  ( pausing thoughtfully ) But , you must have had your adventures too . I , a loyalist hereditarily , for my father eat the King 's bread . You , a whig , descended from the New-England pilgrims  --  turned seaman  --  taken prisoner  --  how came you to be an officer of such rank in a foreign service ? The last intelligence I had , concluded with your having been captured and sent to prison . How and when did you get out ? Adm . Admiral Dixon I entered Fortune-prison , amidst a crowd , in my worst sailor 's clothes . In a few days , having dressed myself in a complete navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that manner , and was prepared for it , ) I walked out through the sentinels , like a gentleman . Gen. General Stuart A pretty Yankey trick  --  to disguise yourself like a gentleman ! Not the first you had played , my old companion ! Did you get off safe ? Adm . Admiral Dixon Yes ! I exchanged clothes with a farmer , and was concealed sometime in the house of a clergyman , whose angelic daughter I married privately , by his consent . Gen. General Stuart ( Suddenly ) Not the first amorous scrape ! You , so cautious when young , taken the first bait ! You , who were accustomed to speak so lightly of matrimony , so soon caught in the marriage-noose ! ( perceiving the Admiral to be too serious for jesting ) I beg pardon . What followed ? Adm .

If ever you can return , or send for this beloved child , when I shall be dead and gone  --  you will prove a father as well as husband to her  --  I know you will . She fainted . I fled . I was a brute , not to have staid and died there . Gen. General Stuart Not so , my dear friend . I should not have seen you now . How did you escape finally ? Adm . Admiral Dixon Six of us embarked for the French coast . The boat was overset in a storm . We were taken up by a British sloop of war . It was then I changed my name , for fear of being recognized as the person for whose apprehension a reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery ! Were you sent back to prison ? Adm . Admiral Dixon No . Ledyard and I had our choice to be sent back , or go on a voyage of discovery . As we were not to fight against our countrymen , we chose the latter . Our ability and zeal were not unnoticed or unrewarded . He was made an officer of marines : I , a midshipman ; and recommended for promotion , which I obtained , soon after our return . Gen. General Stuart Did you find your wife ? Adm . Admiral Dixon Never ! I heard a vague report of her having been delivered of a son , and conveyed by some strange accident to Lisbon . On my arrival there , no person of her name or mine was to be found . I entered the Russian service in an advanced rank .  --  Life had become a burden .

Admiral Dixon There 's cause for vigilance : But , have you a family ? Gen. General Stuart I am happily married . Are you ? Adm . Admiral Dixon No : and never will be . The wound inflicted by the loss of my dear Louisa , no length of time can cicatrize . Gen. General Stuart Pshaw ! Time mollifies grief and heals the deepest wounds ; or we were most miserable indeed . A charming widow is going with you in the same packet to America .

( Enter master of the hotel . ) Gen. General Stuart Have you heard any further particulars of those two ladies of whom we were speaking this morning ? Master of the Hotel . Master of the Hotel None , sir . I believe they are embarrassed in their circumstances ; since , in order to pay for their passages , they have pledged their jewels . Gen.

General Stuart No . Away ! away ! stop them before they can escape . Exeunt precipitately . Enter Mrs. Mellin and Maria from the opposite door . Maria . Maria Such a scene I never witnessed before ! I easily escaped from the closet : but I am still trembling . Ah ! he is gone too ! But  --  yet  --  that best of men  --  will save us yet . But  --  but  --  Let me turn the conversation to your story . Is it not possible your husband may still be living ? Mrs. M. Mrs. Mellin No . Impossible ! He was drowned ! No doubt remains . Maria .

Mrs. Mellin No . Had he been alive , I must have heard of him , from the diligent search I made . Maria . Maria What became of him ? Mrs. M. Mrs. Mellin During my derangement of mind , a fox-hunter from a distance , a dissolute fellow , who had made dishonourable proposals to me , took him away . I have no intelligence since  --  I caused search after search to be made , in vain . He is dead . I , desolate ! Maria . Maria How did you get to Portugal ? Mrs. M.

Contented to die , where I was unknown  --  I fainted by the way . A lady , ( a saint , I trust , now in Heaven , ) going to Lisbon for her health , recalled my fleeting spirit , and took me with her as a companion . ( sighs ) Oh !

What is your history ? Favart . Monsieur Favart ( Sighing ) My parents I never saw . I was born in the south of England ; transferred from Christ 's Hospital , in London , to Lisbon , and educated there , in a commercial house of eminence ; I became a partner in it . Gen.

General Stuart Did you not assume a false name and character ? Favart . Monsieur Favart That was my first error ; a crime peredge the fact ; but , hope to be forgiven , when the cause shall be known . Gen. General Stuart What was it ? Favart . Monsieur Favart The guardian of the young lady , ( an emigrant from France , ) was in England , and expected a nephew , whom he had not seen for many years , to marry her . I foolishly , rashly determined to pass for this nephew . Being known as such on board the vessel , I could not abandon the name and character . Gen.

Monsieur Favart Insensate , as I was ; crazed with love ; racked between doubts and fears ,  --  I embarked in too much haste to think of any thing , but my Maria ! Gen. General Stuart Why did you resist the attempt that was made by justice to take you into custody ? Favart . Monsieur Favart My reason lost in the wretchedness of my situation , and hunted as a Frenchman , like a wild beast ; I fain would flatter myself the rashness of youth , and the madness of despair will not be considered an unpardonable crime . I own it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gen. General Stuart No proof of innocence , however plausible your tale ! ( Enter Admiral Dixon . ) Gen.

What reduced you to this condition ? Favart . Monsieur Favart Love  --  madness  --  and despair . Adm . Admiral Dixon Whence , and who are you ? Favart . Monsieur Favart From Portugal . An outcast from the birth , who never felt a mother 's fond embrace ; nor heard a father 's monitory voice . Most favored by Providence ' till this disastrous occurrence !

Who knows what Heaven may have in store for others ? looking at the prisoner ) I speak not of unnecessary rigour  --  I know it will not be practised . For , supposing the worst that may happen , what can England have to fear , and from what quarter ? Gen. General Stuart ( With great ardour ) Much . From every quarter .
