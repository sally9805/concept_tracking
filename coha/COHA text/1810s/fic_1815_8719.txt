... ' Sdeath ! I 'll print it , And shame the rogues ; your interest , sir , with Lintot . Pope . TO THOMAS HOPE , Esq . THE FOLLOWING PAGES ARE RESPECTFULLY OFFERED , AS A SMALL TRIBUTE OF RESPECT , FOR HIS LIBERAL &; UNSOLICITED ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE WORK , BY THE AUTHOR . HUTTON Fashionable Follies " Let me hope that everyone will profit by our example and learn that fashionable follies are indeed fashionable vices , and that though Fashion may lead a man to the commission of many crimes , she can justify none . " PREFACE . The profound alchymists , in the reign of Charles the First , swore they had discovered a wonderful elixir , which was an absolute antidote to mortality : and I have the honour to assure the gentlemen , interested in this sublime epistle , that had they no other merit , the notice which I have taken of them , is alone sufficient to save their fame from perishing . Unconscious of the honour I have long intended them , they are ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deranged imagination , which the author has mistaken for wit ; or reciting a lecture on heads , in the Arcadian , **29;0;TOOLONG stuff of prose titupping on a Parnassian pony . Nevertheless , wherever they may be , the unqualified panegyric of this preface will reach them , and tickle their ears , like  --  umph ! no matter for the likeness , as my friend , old lawyer Quillet would say . But to leave these damnable faces and begin : First , To that sagacious arenaut , Donald M'Kenzie , Esq .  --  hush ! I can hear you quite hither  --  No passion  --  I am not going to give an account of your journey to the moon , in that famous balloon , Made with vast labour and a vast of thread ! Nor am I going to say , how you visited Vulcan  --  that 's all moonshine !  --  Nor inform the world that you beheld the limping deity forging lightning , And beauteous Venus , O ! disastrous lot ! Mixing up thunder in an earthen pot ! Nor how you procured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you found so far superior to the common bullet and rosin , long in vogue , as to preserve them in the histrionic Olympus , and use them , ever since , in the theatrical thunder gust !  --  I wont mention a word of this  --  therefore , be composed ; be calm ; do nt put yourself in a passion . " What ! " methinks I hear you say  --  " what ! my name fixed to a preface , and be calm ! " Not so loud , sir ; if you please ; of what are you so apprehensive ? Of compliments and commendations ! O ! fie ! I despise flattery . Heaven help the while !  --  your superiority of genius and talent begets you admirers  --  let them praise you ! " But why mention me at all ! " Peace , and I will tell you . To give you a proof of my affectionate , most affectionate friendship ! ! Pray , sir , do nt you remember , how handsomely Mr. Pepin treated Mrs. Wilmot , about the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia ?  --  By the by , that is nothing to either you or I  --  but , my very dear friend , you know , that Mrs. Wilmot determined upon taking a benefit in this city  --  that upon making known her intention to your very dear friend ,  --  myself , he presented her with Fashionable Follies , believing that it might assist in the accomplishment of her hopes . You took your part  --  made me a promise that you would exercise all your abilities as an actor , to do justice to the cast ; and your power , as acting manager , to bring the piece out in the best manner possible . Very well  --  this was an exercise of that urbanity , which the world knows to be your peculiar characteristic !  --  But , sir , why did you , afterwards , return your part to Mrs. Wilmot , and flatly refuse to suffer the performance of the play ?  --  Was this conduct compatible with that gentlemanly character , which you once offered to establish on the Jersey shore ?  --  Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extenuation , that your company could not do justice to my play !  --  Admirable flatterer !  --  But it is equally true , that you told others , that your reason was , a want of merit in the piece ! !  --  Candid judge ! Monument of veracity ! Modern Longinus ! But , sir , let me whisper in your ear , the absolute why and wherefore Fashionable Follies was not represented . You had all missed a benefit , and you determined , Mrs. Wilmot should have no chance ! " There was the rub , and so you bore your point ! " As to the merits of the play , no one will accuse you of being a judge ; but the public will now have an opportunity of forming an opinion for themselves , and this is another why and wherefore I publish it . A few more words , and with you I have done ; without hoping that , what I have said , can possibly affect you ; because you have so often spoken the prologue of old New Castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I acts for fun and not for fame ! And though the stage I loves as life , She is my mistress , not my vife ! Sir , you have committed a rape upon my play  --  by endeavouring to rob Airs . Wilmot of any service it might have been to her in the advancing of her benefit , and the author of those advantages he might have received from its appearance . I shall therefore divide this rape of the play into four distinct , heads , " to let you know my thoughts ! " The rape indecent , The rape dormant , The rape abortive , The rape desired . The rape indecent ;  --  because you committed it upon a lady 's , pecuniary resources . For which you claim my  --  admiration ! ! The rape dormant ;  --  because beneath the most specious appearance , to me , slumbered your Intention to commit it . For this you have my  --  esteem ! The rape abortive ;  --  because you did not succeed in your intention  --  Mrs. Wilmot gaining a benefit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For this you have my  --  pity ! The rape desired ;  --  because the most ardent wishes of your heart were for the destruction of the play . For this accept my  --  contempt ! And so , with all due deference , I take my leave of your attempts . To Mr. Dwyer  --  Nay , start not , as I have done at one of your heavenly faces !  --  I 'll be mild and gentle  --  " and brief , for you 're in haste . " I consider your conduct in this affair , far less reprehensible , than your managerieal colossus . Though you and the company did follow his example  --  So I have seen  --  the similie is fine , And wonderfully pat , though rather old ; When rising Phoebus shoots his rays benign , A flock of sheep come skipping from the fold :  --  One restless sheep cries , baa ! and all the throng , Lambs , ewes , and wethers , bellowing , pour along . As an actor , sir , you stand pre-eminent among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steevens himself , on hearing you , would stand like . Laughter holding both his sides . Yet I have some fault to find with you . The reader of the play who has seen you act , will not believe that the part of Delany is unsuited to your talents . You acknowledged the truth yourself . You took the Prologue from my hands  --  promised to study both it and the above part , and yet the labour of study was so burdensome to an actor , who had studied  --  Reader would you believe it  --  EIGHT whole parts in the entire range of the drama ! ! Wonderful ! You gave up your part  --  and why , forsooth !  --  Was a man , that had starred it all over America  --  " who had travelled from London to Kamschatka  --  had ching-chinged to a Chinaman 's joss  --  smoked the calmut of peace with the descendants of Powhatan , and danced the war dance with the Catabaws , " to submit to the " stale , flat , and unprofitable " drudgery of studying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a previous promise !  --  The underlings of the theatre , following your example , threw up their parts , and this is the principal why and wherefore Fashionable Follies was not performed . Though you are , by no means , so censurable as the the acting manager , yet to you , in a great measure , may be attributed the non-appearance of my play . Had you declined studying the part of Delany , when first presented to you , which by the by , as an actor under engagements with a manager , you could have had no right to do , I should have been content ; but as it was , you stand accused  --  And so , with Mr. Dwyer , I have done . As to the proprietors of the house , since they were mere pipes played upon by every Rosencrantz and Guildenstern about them , I shall let them rest in peaceful obscurity , not leaping over any ribands to come at them . To the public , I would observe , that this play , after a delay of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge of its claims to representation ; and say , whether the why and the wherefore convinces them that I have been unfairly dealt with . What I have declared is correct to the minuti , and every promise stated to have been made by the gentlemen , before mentioned , was absolutely given . To their decision , I trust the fate of my Fashionable Follies , convinced that they ever will be Well pleased to praise ; but not afraid to blame , Averse alike to flatter or offend . THE AUTHOR . PROLOGUE , WRITTEN BY JOSEPH M'COY , ESQ . Prompt to protect , with bounty even profuse , The motley brood of every foreign muse ; Will you turn churls to night and judge severe , Because the author sits amongst you here ? What ! will your easy goodness rest content With worn-out plots and hacknied sentiment ; With scenes , a hundred times daubed o'er and o'er , When daubed anew , they come from foreign shore ? To distant authors courteous welcome give , And bid exotics in this garden thrive ? Prone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumm'ry of the German stage ? And yet will you , when here a native bard , Timid and anxious , seeks your fond regard , Sharpen your wits and watch him , close as chaste , Lest he has some design to spoil your taste ? No , let it ne'er be said in future times , The muses found no favour in these climes ! Let not a cold neglect of taste and art , Check the free pulse of genius ' throbbing heart : But fire the enthusiast with your kind applause , And he is armed to conflict in your cause : Bold to repel the slander , dealt severe , That blasted genius droops and withers here , Prove you can prize his liberal toils to night , And strike one blow to do Columbia right .

Enter MISS POSITIVE and MARIA . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive But let me tell you , Miss Prate-a-pace , Miss Maria Dorriville , your impertinence is insufferable to a lady of my superior parts and respectability . Surely , girl , you must have forgotten yourself ! Maria . Maria Dorriville Girl ! ha , ha , ha , my dear Miss Positive , I did not , indeed , I did not think it improper , or that it could rouse your anger , to ask a simple question , what your age was ? Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive Girl , girl , do you know what you are about ? this is too much . Do you know who I am ? Maria . Maria Dorriville Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous Mr. Positive . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive Yes , his beloved , his  --  Maria . Maria Dorriville Elder sister , madam . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive Very well , miss , very well . ( with great vexation . ) Maria . Maria Dorriville Nay , nay , my dear  --  Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive It is no matter , miss , but I shall acquaint my brother with your impertinence . This is always the way when people of quality stoop so low as to extend their protection to the reduced . Yes , miss , this comes of it . Maria . Maria Dorriville Madam ! Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive Had you been left to follow the follies and broken fortunes of your mad father , the daughter of the delinquent Dorriville would not now have had the opportunity of insulting the sister of her benefactor . Maria . Maria Dorriville Insult you , madam !  --  Had that sister a heart , warmed by the genial current of sympathy , she would scorn to wound the feelings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , lecture me , too ! I hope I know my duty . Maria . Maria Dorriville Indeed you do not . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive How ! Maria . Maria Dorriville I say you do not , madam , for your first and greatest duty is humanity . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive Very fine , miss , very fine : this is very fine rodomontade to a lady of my standing in the city , and my wealth and respectability in the country . Maria . Maria Dorriville You touched upon a chord , Miss Positive , that aroused all the feelings of a daughter 's soul , and must seek the cause within your own bosom , if my words offend . And let me say , madam , that Charles Delany 's father was the villain who ruined mine . Nay , more , that the man who pays his adoration ( scornfully ) at the shrine of Miss Positive 's charms , is he who at this very moment holds those very bonds which were obtained by robbery ! Miss Pos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the vilest robbery ! not by the midnight thief , who seeks the solitary spot where undefended wealth affords an easy prey ; but by the smiling villain , by whom the unsuspecting victim is lured from the paths of virtue , who seizes the moment when his insidious wiles have lulled the admonitions of reason , to lead him to the gaming table , where all is staked upon one fatal throw , and in a moment lost forever ! Such a robber was Delany 's father , such a hapless victim to his artifices , mine . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive You can talk very finely , miss , but my brother shall be made acquainted with your unbecoming pride . If I am to be insulted by your rudeness , I shall reside no longer in the house of an abandoned brother . Maria . Maria Dorriville Miss Positive , I intended no insult , nor did I expect you would wound my feelings by touching on the misfortunes of my father . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive Nor would I , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the charming Charles Delany has sagacity enough to discover , in spite of your insulting beauty , the merit that lies concealed beneath this garb of maiden modesty , must you take upon you to be jealous ? Maria . Maria Dorriville My dear Miss Positive , for mercy 's sake , do nt be afraid , I 'll never be jealous of you . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive That 's right , my dear child . Maria . Maria Dorriville Besides , ' t would be absurd to think of rivalling you ; no , madam , your superior qualifications come between Delany 's eyes and my beauty , by which the latter suffers a total eclipse . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive I did not suppose  --  no , no , not absolutely rival me  --  the man who seeks my love  --  Maria . Maria Dorriville Is unworthy mine . ( aside ) You need be under no apprehension . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive O ! no . But I hope you do not mean to try your charms upon Delany ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be sorry to see you meet with a disappointment . My feelings wont permit it , indeed . Maria . Maria Dorriville Indeed , I believe you , and now shall we retire ? Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive Yes , my dear , and depend upon it , you shall partake of my happiness as the fair enslaver of the universally admired , Charles Delany . O ! how the disappointed fair ones will cast their envious eyes upon me , as I ride , the admiration of the throng , with the first and only object of my affections . " Happy dog ! " cries one , to my husband . " O ! the malicious creature , " cry the women , " how she now displays her long concealed charms ! " ha , ha , ha , how I shall triumph . Wont it be enchanting ? Maria . Maria Dorriville O ! certainly . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive Pray , Maria , my dear , what colour would you have our curricle ? Maria . Maria Dorriville Green , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why child , you are absolutely mad ! green , what , why that means jealousy , as the immortal Shakspeare says , " ' t is a green-eyed monster . " Maria . Maria Dorriville What think you then of red ? Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive ( screaming ) That 's worse still , wantonness , fie , fie , fie ! Maria . Maria Dorriville That would never do , indeed , for you , my dear Miss Positive . ( then aside ) As I live , the very thing . Miss Pos . Miss Charlotte Positive No , no , let me see , I 'll have it blue and white , the true emblems , my dear Miss Dorriville , of chastity and innocence . exit . Maria . Maria Dorriville Poor Miss Charlotte , how I pity her , for I am certain , in spite of all his promises , he never means to marry her ; yet her silly vanity would not only strive to make her appear years younger than she really is , but absolutely persuades her that Delany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all others the most despicable . And yet , I am as much in love as poor Charlotte . O ! Edward , Edward , if you knew how tenderly I love , I fear you would despise me. exit . SCENE II .  --  A room in a country inn ; a table , pen , ink and paper . CHARLES DELANY enters , fashionably dressed , boots , spurs and a riding whip . Del . Delany Holloa ! house , demme , have you all gone out ? I say , Chambers , where the devil are you ? here I whisked to the country upon my Canada paddle , as hot with love as an eel in the sun . Why Chambers . Cham . Chambers Coming , sir . Del . Delany Come along then , you crab . If I succeed in this scheme , I shall be the happiest dog in America . I 'll take her from the old fox , Positive , drive like the devil to Brighton , thence to New York , take lodgings . Yes , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No matter , it 's a fashionable folly , and fashion justifies any thing , Footnote : 1Kb Chambers ! Enter CHAMBERS . Cham . Chambers Here , sir . Del . Delany Quick , quick , get me a lobster , pickles , bread , butter , and turnips , or I 'll heave the garret into the cellar . Cham . Chambers The lobster shall be boiled in an instant . Del . Delany Sooner , sooner . Cham . Chambers It shall , sir . ( going ) Del . Delany Here , Chambers , come back ; let it be roasted . Cham . Chambers Roasted , sir ! Del . Delany Roasted , you crab-nose looking craw-fish , roasted . Cham . Chambers Why , sir , I never heard of such a thing . Del . Delany How should you hear any thing , so far from the city ? Cham . Chambers But do you really mean that I shall cook the lobster in this manner ? Del . Delany To be sure I do . Cham . Chambers Very well , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cham . Chambers It shall be done directly ; but , sir , this is , as a body may say , changing the course of nature . Del . Delany Huzza ! I have done it . Do you know , Chambers , that 's just what I 'm after ? It runs in my blood . Cham . Chambers Indeed ! Del . Delany What 's a man good for in this world if he 's not deaf to the calls of nature ? Why I should have been as poor as a travelling priest , if my father had let nature take her course . Cham . Chambers Why that 's all remarkably true , sir . If I were to let nature take her course , sir , my heart would melt at every body 's misfortunes , and I should give away all my substance . Del . Delany That would never do ; but , my lean publican , to look at your body , one would think all your substance was gone already ; ha , ha , ha . Cham . Chambers To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Del . Delany However , you are right , never let such an ancient feeling as pity enter your heart ; it 's an unfashionable folly , I never heard of since the days of John Howard . Pity ! every man of mettle would laugh at you , you would be hooted out of civilized society . Cham . Chambers That is remarkably true , sir . Del . Delany I mean to overturn nature entirely . My father did so before me , for curse me if ever I saw a dollar of his money until nature overturned and cheated him . He died . Cham . Chambers That was strange , that nature should cheat him . Del . Delany Yes , considering how carsedly it was in his nature to  --  Cham . Chambers Why was it , sir ? Del . Delany Yes , it was a way of his , a fashionable folly . He always lent his friends money to play , and then with loaded dice , heh ! Chambers , he won it again , and more too . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if they did n't call him the Hon. Charles Delany . But I never had any of it until his death . Cham . Chambers How happened that , sir ? Del . Delany He kept it in trade . Cham . Chambers What , sir , a merchant ? Del . Delany A merchant sir ! do you mean to insult me ? do you suppose that my father would waste his time in making out invoices , filling up bills of lading , or calculating duties ! no , sir , no such dishonourable employment . He kept two faro banks and three billiard tables sir . Cham . Chambers Wheugh ! Del . Delany But , Chambers , get what I ordered . Cham . Chambers Instantly , sir , ( then aside ) two faro banks and three billiard tables ! these may be follies now-a-days , but when I was young they punished them as crimes . exit . Del . Delany I have got clear of that infernal , musty hole , my study . Why should I study , when nature has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material qualification , impudence ? Now for old Peregrine . I know Maria 's his daughter , although he ' s potitive she is not . Now there he 's wrong , for it 's impossible for a man to say , it 's a wise father that knows his own children . I 've heard my dad say , he often met his children ragged in the street and did not know them . Can Maria be the delinquent 's daughter ! Poh ! old Dorriville took her with him . I 'll marry her  --  no I wo n't , but I 'll bilk old Perry  --  get a pair of Canada ponies for the mammoth curricle , and Maria shall be mistress of myself and fortune . It 's fashionable . Chambers . Enter CHAMBERS . Cham . Chambers Did you call ? Del . Delany Is the lobster ready ? Cham . Chambers No , sir . Del . Delany Has my servant arrived ? Cham . Chambers No , sir . Del . Delany When he comes , send him to me. exit CHAMD . Capt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are right . ( within ) Del . Delany What 's all this ? Enter CAPT . DORRIVILLE . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville If a fellow had a heart as hard as a howitser or the breech of a nine pounder , he could not be cruel to those coaxing chamber maids . Curse me if Diogenes could scarcely resist them . Here I am at last , within a few miles of the spot . My sweet Fanny  --  Del . Delany Who the devil 's this ? Sir , I have the honour of being your servant . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Thank you , sir , it 's the first time I ever had the honour of having one . But zounds , I do nt intrude  --  I do nt presume  --  Del . Delany Yes , you do , but I pardon you , because it 's fashionable to be impudent . Doubtless you 've some end in it . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville ( aside ) I think I have seen that face before . By heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To bring to chastisement the base traducer of a father 's fame , and press a beloved sister to my bosom ! Del . Delany ( aside ) It looks much like him . Sir , you are a wonder ; who the devil are you ? Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville A wonder , sir , as you have just now assured me ; but no more a wonder than that I am a man . A villain deluded my father to the gaming table , bewailed his losses , lent him money to regain what he had lost , and styled himself his friend , while practising to undo him . Should not this , sir , rouse me to revenge ? ( deeply affected ) Del . Delany What 's the matter with me ! ( aside ) Revenge ' no , sir , your father is not the only one that has been ruined by gambling and such like fashionable follies . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Follies ! I should have styled them vices . Del . Delany That 's not the style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some silly old puts , but the word has been expunged from the modern vocabulary . If a blood , sir , was not to frequent the billiard table , stake at faro , keep a girl and ogle with her at the theatre , he would be hissed out of genteel society . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville And have our modern bucks no desire to avoid being stigmatized with the appellation of fools ? Del . Delany That depends upon it 's being fashionable or otherwise . Now-a-days it 's fashionable , and I should thank any man that would call me a fool . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Indeed ! Del . Delany But you were mentioning your father . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville My father was obliged to fly ; I learnt this from my guardian , some years after , although he would never reveal the villain 's name that ruined him . Del . Delany No ! that was unfortunate . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville It was . I entered my country 's service , and am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sister , and if possible , to discover and chastise the destroyer of my father . Del . Delany My dear fellow , you look very much like a friend of mine . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville And you like one of mine . Del . Delany Indeed ! Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Charles Delany. ( taking him cordially by the hand ) Del . Delany George Dorriville  --  Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Hush ! no Dorriville ; that name is blasted , and until restored to its pristine purity , it belongs not to me . To you , Charles , and to my guardian , I will be known ; but I have assumed the name of Risible , and the character of levity , the more effectually to conceal myself from those who formerly knew me . Del . Delany Mum 's the word then . But have you seen service , George ? Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville I have . I was with the brave unfortunate Decatur , when treachery slew him in the arms of victory ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in burning ruin , rolled the curling smoke in volumes to the skies ! now we are along side  --  on board  --  the match is applied  --  she blazes , a fiery monument to the glory of our tars . Del . Delany By my soul , ' t was gallantly achieved ! Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Left the Chesapeake in the Mediterranean  --  came to the Chesapeake in the Hornet  --  arrived at Baltimore  --  want a passage , says I , to the skipper ; What name ? Jack Risible  --  always laughing  --  ha , ha ha ; Del . Delany Damme , but this is overturning nature entirely . ( aside ) Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Kissed the bar maid  --  jumped into the stage coach  --  turned the turtle with us on the road ; yet here I am , arrived safe , after all my dangers . Del . Delany So you 've taken this method to deceive your acquaintances , and wish to discover your father 's principal creditor ? Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Exactly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear of it . ( aside ) Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Yes , Delany , a man may make every witless blockhead believe that he 's no fool at all . Poh , says he , looking into himself , I 'm a Solomon , there 's a very idiot , do n't know a pike from a punch bowl , and so in the folly of another finds an excuse for his own . So much for example . But beneath this garb of levity , I conceal a son seeking the restoration of his father 's fame . Del . Delany That 's filial gratitude , I do n't like that . It 's not justified by fashion . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Fashion ! Del . Delany Yes , there 's Billy Sprightly , t' other day , called the old dad , a damned put , because the weight of his purse drew the strings rather tight ; and the next day forged his name for a few hundreds . Fan Feather , called her mother a fool , because she said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simple , ran away with Joe Slang , a beau taylor , because her father said marriage was rather too fashionable . But let me hear , Dorriville , what you intend to do to your father 's creditor when you discover him . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Demand an ample restoration of my father 's fame and property . Del . Delany But if he refuse ? Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Why , then I 'll turn Turk and treat him as a christian . Del . Delany What is your guardian 's name ? Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Positive . Del . Delany So then , Maria is his sister . ( aside ) And are you going thither immediately ? Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Instantly . I long to embrace my sister , and speak my gratitude to the best of men , for his care of my dear Maria . Del . Delany ( aside ) If he goes there , before Maria is in my power , my plans are ruined . How shall I act ? ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) George , I believe I have befriended you . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville You have my note for money lent when I stood in need . Del . Delany Damn the money ; but would it give you satisfaction to return the obligation ? Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville I have panted for an opportunity . Del . Delany Which offers now . ( taking his hand ) Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville I may see Mr. Positive and my sister first ? Del . Delany That will never do . If you are once seen there , you can be of no use to me , as it is from Peregrine I 'm about stealing the sweetest creature in the world . A few hours delay to serve a friend , George  --  Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville I 'd forego much gratification to serve you , so let us hear ; but in the first place , who is it that has brought you from that tabernacle of knowledge , the city ? When I left America , you expected to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the head to the heart ? love brought me , you sword-fish , that chubby archer , and Venus , the beautiful handmaid of Hymen . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Aye , and now you are going to elope with some round-faced country girl , with black eyes , and cheeks as red a rose . Del . Delany Zounds ' no . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville With whom then , at this distance from town ? Del . Delany With one of the most delightful , delectable girls in the world . An eye like the peepers of genius , and her whole form as much superior to the goddess of beauty , as a bishop is to a village preacher . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville You have commenced a dangerous voyage ; but I can not blame you , Charles , for I adore my Fanny . Del . Delany Who is she ? Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville One whom you seem to despise , a round-faced country girl , with black eyes , and cheeks as red as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of her , while dishonour is coupled with the name of Dorriville . But , Charles , before I hear more of your plan , does the lady love you ? Del . Delany That she shall herself tell , when she thanks you for your assistance in her flight . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Then , Charles , proceed . Del . Delany The lady 's name is , Julia Danvers . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville Danvers ! our late neighbour 's daughter ? I never knew he married . Del . Delany Nor did he , but what of that , my dear fellow ; you would not have a man a saint because he never married ? could n't he have a daughter , without having a wife , eh , George ? It 's a fashionable folly . Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville And with her consent you mean to carry her off . Del . Delany Exactly so . I only wish you to keep a look-out in the rear , while I make off with the spoil . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pretended to be cursedly smitten with the virgin charms of the old tabby Miss Positive . She 's as vain as a peacock and as ugly as an owl , without a grain of his wisdom . And now , my dear fellow , I am going to whisk her off to parson Grumble 's , and all you have to do is to cover our retreat . Then we 'll be secure , and call upon Perry for his blessing before supper . Will you assist me ? Capt . Dor . Captain Dorriville I am astonished that Mr. Positive should refuse your offers . Del . Delany Zounds ! he do n't refuse ; he 'd be very glad of the match ; but Julia and I are too fashionable to put up with a chimney-corner marriage ; we want eclat , and its fashionable to elope now-a-days , that 's all .

Come , lord , sir , how could a man of your travel , be so mistaken . But I had forgot what brought me here , farmer Ploughby 's sober son wants you . Per .

Robert So I told father , but he said , Mr. Perry , am one who do say a great many things and never does any ; so I thought I might venter , because I know you loves charity , and that am my business here . Per .

Ah ! my fair friend , you can not be ignorant of the love which your virtues and your charms have inspired me with . Maria . Maria Dorriville Edward . Edward . Edward Positive I have sought you to disclose that love and hear from you my doom . At your feet I kneel and pray you to pronounce it . Maria .

( Edward reads it ) Edward . Edward Positive At the wood and alone ! that must not be . Maria . Maria Dorriville There can be no danger at such an hour , and should any one attend me , the object of my going may be defeated . Consider too , perhaps my father , unwilling to be publicly recognized , has returned and waits to see me . Edward . Edward Positive It may be so , indeed . I shall say no more , beloved Maria , to prevent your going . But who brought this letter ? Maria . Maria Dorriville Solomon delivered it to me , but I did not enquire from whom he received it .

Destruction ! can it be possible ? yes , here comes the man I least , at this moment , wished to see . I 'll retire and observe him . ( he withdraws . ) Enter DELANY . Del . Delany So , all is secure : Dorriville swallowed the bait and ere to-morrow arrives , Maria will be in my power . I have managed this business like an experienced one . It 's true I shall be censured , but it 's a fashionable folly and I shall be thought more of at the faro . By all the darts in Cupid 's quiver , here comes the lovely angel !

Captain Dorriville ( aside ) Execrable villain ! Del . Delany I 'll take lodgings for you in the city ; you shall have me all to yourself , without the nonsensical and unfashionable ceremony of marriage . You 'll be the admiration of the town , all the men will adore you , all the women envy you : and I shall be the happiest devil in world . Maria . Maria Dorriville Devil you would be , indeed .

Maria .

So , so , she 's gone , and all my fashionable hopes of boasting I had ruined a virtuous woman , are blasted . ' Sdeath ! how curst unlucky it was , that she should slip , as it were , through my fingers ! but for that damned mal apropos appearance of her brother , whom I supposed safe in Ploughby 's cottage , she would ere this , have been snug in the next chamber . Damnation ! to be foiled after such a daring attempt , is too bad . But I will have vengeance . I must be speedy though , for if he gets to Peregine 's , he will be safe , and I laughed at too soon . Grenouille . Enter GRENOUILLE . Gren . Grenouille Ici , mon maitre , que est ce que voulez ? vat would you ave avec moi ? Del .

I sent for you , Mr. Fixum , to intrust you with the most important action . Here is a note of hand , payable on demand ; speed with it to the wood which separates my estate from Positive 's . Do you take me ? Bail . Bailiff It is n't the first time I have taken you , Mr. Delany , he , he , he . Del .

Bailiff What ! the delinquent I had such a chase after , about sixteen years ago ? Del . Delany No , his son . But have you been a scoundrel , so long ? Bail . Bailiff Four years to the back of it . Del . Delany What a conscience of rascality you must have . Bail . Bailiff Faith , sir , a bailiff should have no conscience , and no feeling , or the scenes he sometimes witnesses , would ruin him in his occupation . Yet I have done some good actions in my life . Del . Delany When did such a miracle occur ? Bail . Bailiff The time I routed your father 's last faro bank was one . Del . Delany Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorriville 's note for some time ; he has just returned from the Mediterranean , and  --  Bail . Bailiff I do n't like this job , sir . Del . Delany Why ? Bail .

Delany Pshaw ! take the note and do your duty . Bail . Bailiff I dare not refuse . ( takes it ) If he refuses the lady  --  Del . Delany Demand the money . Bail .

( offering his purse ) Dor . Dorriville You are not charitable ! ( seizing his hand But you mistake the nature of my sorrows . Per . Peregrine Positive Why are you not poor ? Dor .

Peregrine Positive That is  --  damn it , sir , who the devil are you ?  --  what was your motive in sending for me ? Dor . Dorriville O ! sir , the greatest , the most tender motive , that could actuate the breast ! the fond , the long lost father , anxious for his children 's safety . ( much affected ) Per . Peregrine Positive Your words are unintelligible to me , but why did you do this ? a father  --  but I can not speak  --  damn it , sir , how am I to give you tidings of them ? Dor .

Will your patience indulge me a few moments , while I relate the circumstances which have brought me to the condition you behold ? Per . Peregrine Positive Zounds ! if your preface thus affects me , I am positive I can not hear your tale out : yet , if I can alleviate your sufferings , though my heart should break , still I would attend . Proceed . Dor . Dorriville Thirty years have passed , since cruel fate deprived me of the best of father 's . Per . Peregrine Positive That loss was irreparable ! Dor . Dorriville To me it was particularly so : but let me pursue my tale . I , of course , as his only child , fell heir to all his rich estates . Though reared in the nursery of affluence , this sudden acquisition of immense wealth , did not elevate my pride . Per . Peregrine Positive Then you deserved to have it all . What a noble field for the exercise of benevolence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trust I was not unmindful of that sacred duty . Never came a face of sorrow to my door , but that the grateful smile of joy illuminated its departure . Per . Peregrine Positive That was noble . Dor . Dorriville ' T was but the fulfilment of my duty . For what are riches given us , if not to make the wretched happy ? Per . Peregrine Positive Certainly . Dor . Dorriville Yet , sir , unsuspecting those , who styled themselves my friends , while basking in the sunshine of my prosperity , and sucked my substance , like the voracious leech , I was lured into the lap of fashion and of sensual pleasure , from which the transition is rapid to destructive dissipation . Per . Peregrine Positive That was unfortunate . Dor . Dorriville While reason was asleep and reposed upon the bosom of the fury , chanced introduced me to a lady , whose beauty charmed my soul , and whose virtues awed me to respect and veneration . Per . Peregrine Positive Zounds ! sir , did you find virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , no ; she turned aside as she saw the harlot advancing , and though compelled , by necessity , to live near the orgies of debauch and ebriety , she lived retired and untainted by them . Per . Peregrine Positive I never heard any thing like this before . Dor . Dorriville In short , sir , I woo 'd , I won , and upon promising to retire from the thoughtless votaries of sensual pleasure , I wedded with Amelia . Per . Peregrine Positive Amelia ! why , zounds ! sir , I had a friend , a faithful friend who married , an Amelia . Dor . Dorriville Indeed ! Per . Peregrine Positive Yes , sir ; but I was always confident she would be the ruin of him . Dor . Dorriville And were you not mistaken in your supposition , sir ? Per . Peregrine Positive Why , to say the truth , I was a little out in my guess for that once . Dor . Dorriville The marriage rites performed , we left the world and returned to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in happiness and peace , during which time , my wife blest me with a son and daughter . What were the follies of the world to the delights of domestic life ? as my infants would lisp the tender names of mother , father , and the tear of rapture stood trembling in Amelia 's eye , I would not have exchanged my feelings for the world 's empire . Per . Peregrine Positive Sir , this must , indeed , have been felicity , although , being an old bachelor , I never experienced such an earthly paradise . Dor . Dorriville Into this paradise a serpent crept , but , unlike our progenitors , I was deceived by him . This fiend , this leviathan in infamy , styled himself my friend and gained my confidence entirely . Often did my Amelia , warn me to beware of him , but so completely had he coiled himself about my heart , that even she could not persuade me to suspect him . Per .

Dorriville Step by step the villain led me to that dissipation from which I had so long withdrawn myself , and at last , O ! horrible ! at the faro bank , which too late I learned he had instituted , he himself , my friend , for my destruction , I staked and lost my all ! Per . Peregrine Positive Why , sir , this is exactly the story of my friend ! Dor . Dorriville Your patience , sir . I flew home , and disclosed the fatal truth to my Amelia . No upbraidings passed her lips , a settled melancholy preyed upon her soul , and in three weeks , I followed the best of women to tnh grave . ( much affected . ) Per . Peregrine Positive ' T was terrible , indeed ! Dor . Dorriville Soon after , the villain produced my bonds against me , and as they embraced more than all my property , I was obliged to fly , although a friend offered to advance the surplus , which I refused , since it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , I placed the pledges of Amelia 's love , and fled to India , where , by sixteen years of honest industry , I have amassed four times the wealth , my treacherous friend despoiled me of . Per . Peregrine Positive Why this was the situation of my friend ! ( gazing steadfastly at Dorriville ) He placed his children under my protection , when he fled . Dor . Dorriville And have you carefully protected the dear pledges entrusted to your care ? Per . Peregrine Positive What do you take me for ? Dor . Dorriville For one who makes humanity an occupation ; for a friend to the unfortunate . Per . Peregrine Positive I am positive , sir , that I am not ; but if you could inform me , where I could find this afflicted father  --  Dor . Dorriville Well , sir , if I could  --  ( anxiously ) Per . Peregrine Positive Then , sir , I would grasp his hand , would hold him to my heart and whisper in his ear , that twelve years after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's service , which , his good conduct has since changed to a commission .

Per . Peregrine Positive Certainly I would . Do you call a duty , being charitable ? Dorriville was my friend , lent me the very money which has since increased to a clumsy fortune . Nay , more , were Dorriville here , I would tell him that the son of his false friend , who has gone to his account , through my persuasion , has consented to return his bonds and estate whenever he appears . Dor . Dorriville All-seeing Providence , thy ways are just ! ( kneels ) Per . Peregrine Positive What means this fervour ? Dor . Dorriville Do you not know me , Peregrine ? ( rising ) Per .

Dorriville O ! Peregrine , how shall I repay you for your kindness to my children ? Per . Peregrine Positive Can you , Charles , ask such a question ? I thought you knew that one embrace , would overpay me for all . But come , you must to my house . Young Delany , though curse , me if I can see for what , has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorriville Indeed ? Per .

THE END . Back matter EPILOGUE . WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR . To be spoken by Maria . Well , patrons , how like you our play ? ' t is Fashion , Which many here , take great delight to dash in ; Fashion , celestial sound ! I hope that you Have found the fashion , which we 've shown you , new . Ah ! see Miss Damson in you full crammed box , In floating ringlets waves  --  her wig 's soft locks ; While Bobby Slyboots , with an anxious mien , Ogles beside her , and she hopes , unseen . Dear Susan ( sighs ) sighs ,  --  ah ! Bobby , is it you ? I 'm squeezed to death ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm suffocated ; but my dear , You know it 's all the fashion to be here . There 's Mr. Easy in that box , ods life ! Talking to every woman  --  but his wife . While she , good soul , to advocate the plan , Except her husband , talks to every man ; Because it 's fashionable .  --  Dr. Grumble , Who looks so pleasant  --  I 'm your very humble : ( bows ) What ! has my lady used her tongue again ? Poor soul ! no matter , pray dismiss your pain ; Look not so grum , and conquer all your passion , Because , you know , with us , ' t is all the fashion . Damme , cries Tom , insult me , sir , your name , sir , Dick Bluster , damme , sir , you 'll find I 'm game , sir .  --  Fashion demands a challenge from the wight , But fashion seldom makes the heroes fight . Mercy ! who 's that , beside the widow Spangle ? Alas ! poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that ugly elf , Who thinks of no one , but his odious self : Hear him , he speaks , eh ? Dangle , vat 's de reason , You praise no author or actor all dis season ? Damme , cries Dangle , what is that to you , Do you pretend to be a critic too ? To praise an actor I would ne'er refuse , But it is all the fashion to abuse . Thus fashion leads , and all her vot'ries follow , Like list'ning hounds that mind the huntsman 's halloo : And here should Fashionable Follies find Critics indulgent , and our patrons kind ; Now let their hands a native author laud , And make it all the fashion to applaud .
