txt ART . XIII . . * . N'arrative of Voyages and Travels in the *N'ortherm and Southern Hemispheres , comprising three voyages rmtnd the world , together with a voyage of survey and disecreery in the . Pacjjlck Ocean and Oriental Islands . By . ilmasa Delano . Boston , printed by E. G. House , 1817 . NOTWITIISTANDING the many obvious incitements to hookmaking , which are apparent to us , we can not help sometimes falling into conjectures about the motives , which could have lead to the publication of many of the works that appear . To make a book of five or six hundred pages , is no small matter after all , let its subject and merits be what they may . Amid // the reward which should be obtained , as an adequate compensation for the labour , ought in no case to be inconsiderable . The goodness of the market is doubtless a powerful provocative to authors , as well as to labourers in every other calling ; and we are inclined to the opinion , that writers of voyages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source . A great proportion of the reading part of the community look only for amusement . To such persons , novels and books of travels have much more powerful attractions , than works of any other description . There are , besides these , a class of people belonging to the reading genus , of imaginations too sluggish to be excited by fiction , and minds not sufficiently cultivated or strong , to bring works of taste or science within their reach ; and who depend therefore altogether upon the traveller and navigator , for their literary supplies . Happily for the numerous writers of travels and their readers , this species of composition does not call for great powers of mind . He must be dull indeed , who can not give a tolerably interesting account of very interesting places . And a man who is in the way of travelling much-more especially upon the ocean-may often chance to be thrown upon parts of the globe , a simple narr*ition of facts relating to which , however awkwardly told , will be , in no inconsiderable degree , useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as.to find no description of readers whatever* willing to accompany him on his expeditions , will himself have the greatest cause to lament his own folly , by being left to settle the whole fare . And should some tempest-beaten mariner , who had made three or four voyages round the world , of three or four years each , with only the success of getting safe home again , ( a kind of success , perhaps , the least desirabble to himself , and it might be to his friends , of any he could have looked for , ) contrive to share the loss of his luckless adventures with the publick , by puhlishing an account of them ; we should hardly have the heart to find much fault , provided the damage to the community extended only to the immediate contribution . It is to be observed however , that this is not always the case . There are works of this denominatiom* , properly ranking under the head of professional books , in which the writer undertakes so to describe places , and make such practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of any others , who have aftevwards to pursue the same track . And here the responsi // hility becimes imposing . To the reader for amusement , it were indeed of little moment , whe , ther the advantages of a given course  --  the safety of a particular h*rbour-*  --  or the best means of obtaining slq ) plies , are , as stated by the narrator , the results of a good judgment and sufficient experience ; whether the bearing of rocks  --  the position of islamis-and the danger and extent of shoals , be laid down with great exactness . But to the lonely navigator of a distant and unfrequented sea , to whose keeping the lives and property of others have been committed , and who in an hour of danger and doubt , when his own judgment could no longer assist him , has resorted to such a book , for its proffered guidance , the case is far different . And we should be slow to say , that a man was deserving of censure only , who , actuated either by vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heedlessly put at risk the existence and interests of his fellow beings . The book before us , a present to the community from Capt . Amnasa Delano , is an octavo volume of about six hundred pages . The reader will think the size very reasonable , when he comes to find that he is carried in it three times round the world ; on a voyage of survey and discovery in the Eastern Ocean ; and further favoured with a biographical sketch of the author , written by a friend . Capt . Delano observes in the preface- " No seaman from the United States has enjoyed the same opportunity for observation and discovery in the Eastern Ocean , which was afforded to me by the voyage I made with Commodore M'Clure . My remarks upon the navigation along the coast of New Holland , Van Dieman 's Land , New Zealand , and round Cape Horn , will also be new to my readers , and , I am confident , of great value . " And a little further on ; " It was also thought expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as might render the book interesting and instructive to lands-men , and as should give me an opportunity to offer my sentiments , as they occurred upon various topicks , in morals , condition , and character . " Capt . Delano appears then to have had two things in view ; first , to give such an account of the navigation of the seas lie traversed , founded on personal observation and experience , as might be of great practical importance to seamen ; and , secondly , a description of places and events , which , when aided by his own remarks , would afford entertaining and improving information to general readers . We shall endeavour to select such passages from this work , // as will convey to our readers some idea of its merits in the latter point of view , and then make any observations , that our scanty means of information will admit of , with regard to the other , which we deem indeed by far the most important , and should suppose must have been the principal object with the author . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , death , and burial of Major Samuel Shaw , one of the gentlemen who contracted for the building of the ship Massachusetts , the vessel in which Capt . Delano begins his adventures ; and goes on to give the respective histories of the person who was contracted with , of the draughts-man , and of the master builder , Daniel Briggs , and his four brethren ; interspersed with such judicious remarks , as the characters , occupations , and exits of the several subjects suggested to our author . We are then carried , by a very admirable division of the subject , from the contractors , builders , master-builders , and their respective relathes and friends , and their families , to the ship built ; and receive a very minute and entertaining relation of the various parts of which the Massachusetts was composed ; spars , beams , masts , keels , yards , decks , &amp;c. &amp;c. with their exact dimensions . This is followed by a comprehensive biography of every officer and seaman ; and we bare at length happily hauled off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , in the year of our Lord 1790 , at precisely 4 o'clock in the afternoon . It is to be lamented , that by a ve*'y unfortunate oversight of Capt . Delano , we are left entirely in the dark as to the names , characters , &amp;c. of the persons who were collected on the wharves to witness our departure , although it is mentioned in a general way , that the crowd was uncommonly great . but of justice to Capt . Delano , we would express our satisfaction at the singular benevolence he has evinced , by introducing the lives of so many of his acquaintances into this narrative . It is well known how pleasant it is to see one 's name in I ) rint ; and the persons noticed , with their friends , rnu*t feel highly gratified with the civility here paid them . Capt . Delano has certainly done much more in this way , than could possibly be expected of him , considering he has made but one volume-indeed we think there can scarcely be many persons , natives of Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation or other , more or less distant , handsomely mentioned in the course of this work . As Capt // Delano seems to have intended his book for something of a precedent to afterwriters , we can not but hope they will be careful to profit by his example in this particular-it can cause but little inconvenience to the writer ; ans*vers exceedingly well for filling up ; makes the book very popular-a majority of the publick being under obligations  --  and is certainly vastly agreeable to readers of all sorts . After arriving at Canton , the Massachusetts was sold to the Danish company there ; the crew disper*ied ; and Capt . Delano , at Macao , a town in the province of Canton , falls in with Corn . M'Clure , who had been sent out from Bombay by the English East India company , with the command of two vessels , the Panther and Endeavour , on an expedition to the Eastward , to visit the Pelew Islands , New Guinea , New Holland , the Spice Islands , and others in the Eastern Ocean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gentleman , to join in the cruise . On their run from Canton to the Pelew Islands , they touched at the port of San Pio Quinto , one of the Babuyane islands , for the purpose of taking in wood and water ; and Capt . Delaiio relates with great good humour an experiment that was made on his credulity by his fellow officers . Two of them , having returned one evening from a day 's duty on shore , produced a number of substances which they said they had found in the course of their rambles , and supposed to be gold ore , but very judiciously added , " that as they knew so little of minerals , and did not much like to labour for nothing , in collecting what might subject them to ridicule when they should return home , they doubted whether they should go out again to increase their specimens . " Capt . Delano , whose imagination was not a little excited by the artful dqscriptions they had given him , and thinking them too faint-J* carted in the business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged to it by his friend Drummond , a Scotchman , and one of the gold discoverers , who , clapping him on the shoulder , said , " Odds , mon , if you are set upon this , there is my large canvass bag , which will hold two or three bushels ; take that , and my Malabar boy * ith you for a guide ; he knows the place where we found these curious ores , and you can return with a back load of gold . " After a night , as he says , of South Sea drcams , * he sat out upon his enterprise . The Malabar boy could speak no English , and Capt . Delano unfortunately nothing else ; so , with as much communion together as such circumstances would admit // of , they passed the day in the most fatiguing and gainless search for a substance , the supposed specimens of which were taken , as he afterwards discovered , from the ship 's medicine chest . At the close of the day , he returned again to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following description of his feelings and reflections ; - " When I was seated in perfect silence on a rock in the rivetr near its source , and could hear the echo of the waters through the awful stillness of the desert , mingled with the occasional , but unintelligible , expressions of anxiety by the poor Malabar boy ; and when I remembered that I was at an almost immeasurable distance from my native country , in the service of a foreign power , the victim of an imposition , which appeared to me under various aspects , and now in a savage spot , where the natives might be every moment upon me , I confess I was not very far from that mixed mood of melancholy mortification and terrour , which required but little more to overcome me for the hour . Had I been attacked , desperation might have roused me , and made me brave ; vexation and pride , however , were my friends and supporters , till better feelings regained their elasticity and force , and after leaving the rock for the shoreIand*the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted to restore my seif-controul and the consolations of hope . The feelings which I then experienced , have taught me how to judge of the sufferings and wants of men , whose spirits fail , when they are at a distance from home , and appear to themselves to be cast out from the sympathies of the human family . It is an evidence of as much folly as it is of inhumanity , to say that none but weak and dastardly minds are subject to these impressions . Good talents and lively imagination , a temperament o in enuousness and honesty , and those qualities of the soul , which give the charm to decisive and efficient characters , serve only to add bitterness , under such circumstances , to the feeling of desolation . Whoever may have command of men abroad , let him not , when he finds any ot them oppressed with these feelings , begin to despise and reproach them , as mean and pusillanimous ; let him learn human nature better , and by kindness , by increased manifestations of sympathy , by diversifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th.eir condition , let him oTadually raise their hearts , invi*orate their resolution , and bind t*em to duty , virtue , and friendship forever . Many are the instances , in which generous and feeling minds have baen ruined , and only relieved by death , when they were subject to the command of others , and during a period of depression were inhumanly treated without the means of redress . Sailors and all men , even of the meanest education , have the essential qualities of high minds , and are exalted and improved , at the same time that they are won , by generosBy and kindness* " // We think this extract does much credit to the feelings and good sense of Capt . Delano , and we are perfectly willing that our readers should consider it as a specimen of his style , but not on our authority. ; we rather suspect , from a comparison of this , and a number of other passages , with the general finish of the work , that the friends , whose revision of it has been acknowledged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprieve from the statement of . latitude and longitude , the veering of winds , and delineation of liarhours , must have given rather more polish to these parts , than was perhaps altogether consist7ent with a strict adherence to the style of the author . On describing the island of Timor , Capt . Delano takes occasion to give a pretty long account of the remarkable facts relative to the ship Bounty and her mutinous crew ; -a very interesting notice of which many will recollect to have seen in the Quarterly Review for April and July , 1815 , under the article of Porter 's Cruise in the Pacifick Ocean . The facts were shortly these ; . - . In 1789 , the British ship Bounty was em* ) loyed in conveying the bread-fruit-tree from Otaheite to the British colonies in the West Indies . On her passage between these places , a part of her crew , headed by Fletcher Christian , the master 's mate , mutinied ; put the commander , Lient . Bligh , and eighteen others , into the launch , set them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieut . Bligli by good fortune made the island of *I imor , from whence he returned home . As soon as the news of this affair reached England , Capt . Edwards was dispatched with the Pandora to search for the mutineers ; fourteen , out of five and twenty , were found at Otaheite , but no traces could be discovered of Christian and the rest of them , who had left Otalieite in the ship , with the intention , a.s was said , of never returning to it . Nothing more was heard of them , nor were they conjectured to be still in existence , until February 1808 , more than eighteen years after the mutiny took place , when Capt . Mayhew Folger of Nantucket , in this State , chanced to touch at Pitcairn 's island , in the South Pacifick Ocean-before then , supposed to be uninhabited-and there very unexpectedly met with the only surviving mutineer , Alexander Smith , in the manner and situation afteri*entioiwd . About six years later than this period , Sir Thomas Stains and Capt . Pip*n , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , and from their account of it , was ma ( lC up the article referred to in the Quar // terly Review . Capt . Delano assigns as a reas6n for introducing the narrative here , that from being possessed for a time , of the manuscript history of Capt . Edwards , and from repeated conversations had with Capt . Folger for the express purpose of learning the particulars of his interview with the extraordinary inhabitants of Pitcairn 's island , the information he was enabled to give , was more minute , and of an earlier date , than any before published . The following extract appears to be the substance of what he learned from Capt . Folger . " The Topaz , in which he sailed , ( speaking of Folger , ) was fitted and owned in this place by James and Thomas H. Perkins , Esquires , and crossed the South Pacifick Ocean in search of islands for seals . Being in the region of Pitcairn 's island , according to Car*teret 's account , he determined to visit it , hoping that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of his voyage . " As he approached the island , he was surprised to see smokes ascending from it , as Carteret had said it was uninhabite4 . With increased curiosity , he lowered a boat , and embarked in it for the shore . He was very soon met by a double canoe , made in the manner of the Otaheitans , and carrying several young men , who hailed him in English at a distance . They seemed not to be willing to come near to him , till they had ascertained who he was . He answered , and told them he was an American from Boston . This they did not immediately understand . With great earnestness they said , you are an American ; you . came from America ; where is America ? Is it in Ireland ? ' " Capt . Folger thinking that he should soonest make himself in. telligible to them , by finding out their origin and country , as they spoke English . inquired , Who are you ? - . We are Englishmen . - . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you see . ' - . ' How then are you Englishmen , if you were horn on that island , which the English do not own , and never possessed ? .. - . We are Englishmen , because our father was an Englishman . ' . - ... Who is your father ? ' With a very interesting simplicity , they answered , Aleck. ' . - . ' Who is Aleck ? - Do n't you know Aleck ? ' - How should I know Aleck ? ' . - . ' Well then , did you know Captain Bligh of the Bounty ? ' At this question , Folger told me , the whole story immediately burst upon his mind , and produced a shock of mingled feelings , surprise , wonder , and pleasure , not to be descrihed . His curiosit*y which had been already excited so much on this subject , was revived , arid he made as many ihquiries of them , as the situation in which they were , would permit . // " They informed him , that Aleck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained alive on the island ; they made him acquainted with some of the most important points in their history ; and with every sentence , increased still more his desire to visit the establishment , and learn the whole . Not knowing whether it would be propel ' and safe to land without giving notice , as the fears of the surviving mutineer might be awakened in regard to the object of the visit , he requested the young men to go and tell Aleck , that the master of the ship desired very much to see him , and would supply him with any thing which he had on board . The canoe carried the message , but returned without Aleck , bringing an apology for his not appearin* , and an invitation for Capt . Folger to come on shore . The invitation was not immediately accepted , but the young men were sent again for Aleck , to desire him to come on board the ship , and to give him assurances of the friendly and honest intentions of the master . They returned however again without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety , and would not allow him to expose himself or them , by leaving their beloved island . The young men pledged themselves to Capt . Folger , that he had nothing to apprehend if he should land ; that the islanders wanted extremely to see him , and that they would furnish him with any supplies which their village afforded . " After this negotiation , Folger determined to go on shore , and as he landed , he was met by Aleck and all his family , and was welcomed with every demonstration of joy and good will . They escorted him fromii the shore to the house of their patriarch , where every luxury they had was set bofore him , and offered with the most affectionate courtesy . " lie , whom the youtns in the canoe , with such juvenile and characteristick simplicity , had called Aleck , and who was Alexander Smith , now began the narrative , the most important parts of which have already been detailed . It will be sufficient for me to iutroduce here , such parts only as have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional interest to the general outline , by a few touches upon the minute features . Smith said , and Ii pon this point Capt . Folger was very explicit in his inquiry at the time , as well as in* his account of it to me , that they lived under Christian 's government several years after they landed ; that during the whole period they enjoyed tolerable harmony ; that Christian became sick , and died a natural death ; and that it was after this , when the Otaheitan men joined in a conspitacy and killed the English husbands of the Otaheitan women , and were by the widows killed in turn on the following night . Smith w* thus the only man left upon the island . " // It seems that Sir Thomas Staines , in a letter addressed to Vice Admiral Dixon , states , that Christian " fell a sacrifice to the jealousy of an Otaheitan man , withiix three or four years after their arrival on the island ; " and another account received from the mate of Capt . Folger 's vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks into the sea . But Capt . Delano affirms , on the authority of Folger , that the statement , above made by him with respect to this circumstance , is the correct one . " Smith had taken great pains to educate the inhabitants of the island in the faith and principles of Christianity . They were in the uniform habit of morning and evening prayer , and were regularly assembled on Sunday for religious instruction and worship . It has been already said , that the books of the Bounty furnished them with the means of considerable learning ; - Prayer books and Bibles were among them , which were used in their devotions . It is probable also that Smith composed prayers and discourses particularly adapted to their circumstances . lie had improved him . self very much by reading and by the efforts he was obliged to make to instruct those under his care . lie wrote and conversed extremely well , of which he gave many proofs in his records and his narrative . The girls and boys were made to read and write before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their improvement . They did themselves great credit in both , particularly the girls . " " When Smith was asked if he had ever heard of any of the great battles between the English and French fleets , in the late wars , he answered- ' How could I , unless the birds of the air had heemi the heralds ? ' He was told of the victories of Lord Howe , Earl St. Vincent , Lord Duncan , and Lord Nelson . He listened with attention till the narrative was finished , and then rose from his seat , took off his hat , swung it three times round his head with three cheers , threw it on the ground sailor like , and cried out- ' Old England forever * The young people around him a*'peared to be almost as much exhilarated as himself , and must have looked on with surpriLe , having never seen their patriarchal chief so excited oef ore : Smith docs not appear to have shown any inclination to leave the island . The houses are represented as uncommonly neat , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ng men were employed in the fields and gardens ; and in niaking canoes , household furniture , implements of agriculture and fishing gear  --  the girls in making cloth fmoin the cloth tree , and attending to their domestick concerns . The // aprons and shawls worn by the latter , were made of the bark of the cloth-tree . When the island was visited by Capt . Folgei* , Aleck did not endeavour to conceal his real name of Alexander Smith . We find however that after-visitors mention him under the name of John Adams . Captb Delano attributes this change of name , to the fears excited in Smith , by the information he received from Capt . Folger , of the search made for the mutineers by Capt . Edwards in the Pandora , and supposes the one assumed , to be taken from that of President Adams , which was a prominent one in the account given to Smith by Folger of the federal constitution of the United States , which had gone into operation since this establislmnient on Pitcairn 's island . The number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Capt . Delano , amounted at this time to thirty four , including women and children ; this number was increased , when Sir Thomas Stains was there , to forty ; and it is afterwards put by the Reviewers at forty six , besides infants. - We confess that we deemed this account of the Pitcairn family sufficiently interesting , fully to compensate us for the break it occasioned in our author 's narrative . And we persuade ourselves that the same view of it will also avail us with our readers , as an excuse for having madc so copious extracts . The portion which we have selected , , appears never to have been published before , and certainly is entitled to the more consideration , for representing the appearance and conduct of these happy islanders on the first visit ever paid them ; indeed , so singular and encouraging am* example is presented by Smith , of the tendency of the human heart to virtue , when a removal from the deceptive and debasing pleasures amid pursuits of the world has suffered time passions to become calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice it , should it on that account come to the knowledge of but one person the less . The next chapter is devoted to " reflections on the history of time Bounty , and of Pitcairn 's Island . " And if Capt . Delano ( lid not receive the same friendly assistance in the construction of *tq timat we formerly hinted at , we do him injustice . *Xe ought to observe , to the credit of Capt . Delano , that tlironglm the whole of this book , lie speaks of himself with the same al ) parent openness and impartiality , as of any third person , amid shows no inclination to conceal anecdotes , that might be amusing , from a frar of the effect they would have // 255 Delano 's toyages and Travels . upon his character with the reader . During his last voyage , whilst in Bass 's straights , his adventures were well nigh brought to an unfortunate conclusion , by the sudden sinking of a boat in which he , together with his brother and four others , were passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , of the company were drowned . And the represeritation of his feelings on seeing them die , is given in so bold and undisguised a manner-is so different from the affected accounts we usually get from survivors in such cases , and at the same time so descriptive of the selfishness whicjr always operates when great interests are at stake , that we can not forbear extracting a small part of it . After stating the manner of the boat 's sinking , their distance from the land , which was about a third of a mile , and how much he was encumbered by his dress , he says , I was just heading for the land , when looking to the left , I saw one of my faithful sailors , a Swede , by the name of John Fostram , making towards me with all possible exertion. 1 turned my head from him , and used every effort to prevent his reaching me , which I greatly apprehended he would ; but the poor fellow , finding his attempts fail , relinquished the oar he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowering , until his strength being entirely exhausted , he gave up , and sunk . I never , until then , had experienced any satisfaction in seeing a man die ; but so great is the regard we have for ourselves when in danger , that we would sooner see the whole human race perish , than die ourselves . I remember but few incidents in the course of my life , that were more gratifying to me , than that of Fostram 's sinking ; for I was not only relieved of the dread of his involvin* me in his own fate , but had likewise the oar he relinquished within my reach , which I immediately siezed , and headed again for the land . Very soon after , I observrd another of my poor distressed sailors , a native of Nova Scotia , named Willia&amp;Thomnpson , making towards me on the right hand . I pulled from him , though he did not give me so much uneasiness as the former , as he was at a greater distance . This poor fellow soon met his fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift to procure his oar , and placed it under rue , and then once more headed for the land . " We might readily go on to make other selections sufficiently amusing , did we not think it necessary to hasten to the few words we have to say , of the merits of this work , as it relates to navigation . Although it has been but a few years since the circumnavigation of the globe was attempted , and // we should almost venture to say , that until very lately , many persons could be found somewhat undecided in their notions , as to the element in which it was performed ; yet so well directed have been the efforts of the English to add to the stock of information on nautical affairs  --  and so well have these efforts been seconded by the enterprise and activity of our own countrymen-that a voyage round the world has now got to be quite an every day affair . Byron , Wallis , Carteret , Cook , and Vancouver have been successively sent by the English government into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast of America , upon voyages of survey and discovery-.all of them able meti , and well appointed . In addition to this , various expeditions of a similar nature have been fitted out , under the direction of private companies ; and numberless individuals too , both of that country and our own , invited by a lucrative trade in skins , on the North*vest Coast , have not been backward to brave the dangers of these remote seas ; nor do we mean to assert , that these enterprises have been confined to the English and Americans . The French and Russians have shared also in the honour and prefit of them . After the acquaint-* ance with these waters , which must have been obtained from so ample means of information , we may well conceive that Capt . Delano would have but a poor chance of relating any thing very novel . Whoever would wish to acquire a satisfactory knowledge of the ports and islands in these regions , the character , customs , and resources of their inhabitants , would doubtless look for it to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose object it is to become a *kilful navigator there , would do well to seek his instruction from the eminent men , who have been expressly selected to furnish it . All this , however , does not convince us , that a book , like the one in hand , if substantially correct and sufficiently minute , may not be of some use . In this country , where commercial enterprise is carried to a very great extent , the officers of our most valuable ships must often be young men , and not always fully experienced in the voyages they undertake-many of them too , from the nature of their early education , and their active duties , but little inclined to search for information in the voluminous and scientifick works of such men , as we have mentioned . A book of less pretension , written by one engaged in the same occupation with themselves , of the same country , possibly an acquaintance , and in // the practical style , and homely , inartificial manner , which we should expect from a man bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found by his own experience to be the most useful , would be much wore likely to draw their attention ; and in the cabin of a merchautman , might perhaps bear some comparison with works , that in their general nature , were infinitely more valuable . We are sensible that oF the correctness of the statements , and the soundness of the advice given by Capt . Delano , we are not very competent judges . We have , however , made inquiries of gentlemen , whose experience in these seas ought to give great weight to their opinions , and they inform us , that as far as their knowledge extends , the work is generally correct . In many instances the observations are very minute , and made with such an air of confidence , as would hardly be ventured upon , but by one who felt well convinced of their justness . N or does the author hesitate to differ in many instances from very high authorities . With respect to the passage round Cape Horn , concerning the dangers of which , there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who represent its hazards to be generally magnified ; and in speaking of the harbour of Valparaiso , he asserts that many of the remarks made by Vancouver relating to the prevailing winds there , in the winter months , and the courses and distances , are incorrect , and advances as a reason for the confidence he has in his own opinions , that he had " entered , or been in the port of Valparaiso , in nearly every month in the year , " whereas Vancouver was there " but one short visit , of a month or two . " Taking into view the nature of the remarks made by Capt . Delano , and relying upon the opinion we have received of his general correctness , we should think this iiarrative might be of some use to seamen , not experienced in the voyages he describes ; and that persons who read for amusement , and whose taste is not liable to be offended by homeliness of style , may b* entertained by it .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
