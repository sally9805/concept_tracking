Gusman . Gusman Well , his highness 's things are all ready for him to put on , the moment he gets up , which I expect will be shortly , as Don Csar his Secretary was to be with him early this morning ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going )  --  but odso  --  I had forgot ; the sweep is at work among the chimnies , and ' t is likely he may throw some of his dirt down here ; I 'll therefore cover his highness 's clothes with this Napkin . ( Throws the Napkin over the clothes )  --  and now to hurry on breakfast . Exit . Barogo . Barogo ( up the chimney , gives the sweep 's cry , then comes down , shaking his clothes . ) What a cursed trade this is of mine ! all dirt and no profit ( staring round him )  --  bless my soul ! where have I got to ? here 's a pretty place indeed ; why is it possible there can be such fine things as these in the world ? faith I never could have believ 'd it  --  oh Lord ! oh Lord ! it almost makes me giddy ; ( perceiving an arm chair , ) now what can this be for ? bless me ! what a comical machine ; in my opinion it must be meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nicely at his ease ; I 'll try how it feels , ( sits down. ) by the saints , but ' t is monstrous comfortable  --  but zounds ! if any body should come in and catch me  --  ( runs to the door and listens . ) I do n't believe there are any women in this house , or else they are all asleep ; for I hear no talking  --  as for the lackies , why they are all snoring in their beds , whilst we poor devils are oblig 'd to work away both body and soul for half their wages  --  ( looking at himself in the glass )  --  perhaps that is the reason I look so ugly ; ah it 's all the same both before and behind ; suppose I just clean myself a little with that Napkin , and see how I should look then  --  ( takes up the Napkin and discovers the clothes )  --  bless me ! what 's here ? finer ! and finer still ! what gold and silver !  --  I wonder how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands . ( Spits on his hands , and wipes his hands and face with the Napkin )  --  Now for it !  --  ( puts the cloak over his shoulders , and the hat upon his head )  --  why they were made on purpose for me , nothing could fit better  --  ( runs to the door again and listens )  --  ah ! all are as fast as churches , and snore like so many friars :  --  ( looks at himself again in the glass )  --  what it is to be a prince !  --  methinks I have a most royal looking face  --  by the mass , I have a great mind for once in my life , to be a great man from head to foot ; I have an opportunity , and egad I 'll make the most of it  --  The worst come to the worst , they ca n't hang me for it , for I do n't believe it 's treason . I may perhaps escape with only being kick 'd out of the house , and that wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his own clothes and puts on those of the Prince , a large robe , which covers him down to his feet , the hat and boots. )  --  Oh , I must have been measur 'd for them , these fit me to a hair . ( Looks at himself and swaggers about . ) I defy the Prince himself to look better in them  --  one would imagine I had been a great man all my life : but what 's here  --  ( looking at a side door )  --  this leads into another apartment  --  I 'll e'en see what 's inside : while I 'm at it I might as well satisfy my curiosity , for I 'll be sworn I shall never have the opportunity again . Exit at side door . Enter Prince in his night gown and slippers , from a door in the upper entrance . Prince . Prince of Oresca ' T is in vain to think of rest , I have not clos 'd my eyes , the suspicions excited by Eleonora 's conduct , banish sleep from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I have a thousand reasons to believe her faithless  --  the Duke  --  this Opera singer  --  even Don Csar my Secretary  --  and yet , to hear her protestations  --  her seeming fondness  --  P'shaw , these are but put on , to further her interest . ( scats himself in an arm chair with his back to the door where Barogo is gone out Re-enter Barogo , but perceiving the Prince , returns into the room frighten 'd , puts out his head , with the door half open . ) Bar . Barogo Zounds ! I 'm scar 'd out of my wits  --  luckily he did'nt see me ; who the devil can this fellow be ? Prince . Prince of Oresca But why should I expect her to be more true to me , than to so many others she has deceived . Bar . Barogo Egad I should almost think this was the Prince himself , for I 've heard say , that your great folks are always melancholy . Prince . Prince of Oresca Ah ! now I find too truly , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barogo Yes , it must be him . Prince . Prince of Oresca ( rises . ) I must be convinc 'd  --  if I could by any means disguise myself , and be witness to her ingratitude  --  but how to effect this ? if I trust to my servants , they will betray me . Bar . Barogo Zounds ! I hope he wo n't come in here  --  if he should , there would be a pretty kettle of fish Prince . Prince of Oresca ( perceiving Bar go 's clothes . ) Ah ! what do I see ?  --  by what lucky chance  --  Bar . Barogo Why , one would think he had lound a prize . Prince . Prince of Oresca From whence could they come ? ( looks at the chimney. )  --  Oh ? I perceive . Bar . Barogo He must be a conjurer . Prince . Prince of Oresca I must lose no time , but make the most of this fortunate chance ,  --  ' t is true enough that accident often serves us better than design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts on Barogo 's cap , shoes , jacket , &c.; and sticks the brush in his belt . ) Bar . Barogo What the devil is he going to do ?  --  damn it !  --  I hope he wont spoil my clothes . Prince . Prince of Oresca Thus disguis 'd I defy any body to know me . Bar . Barogo I believe you . Prince . Prince of Oresca I will steal to the door of Eleonora 's apartment ,  --  but lest I should be surpris 'd by some of my servants who would certainly spoil my project , I 'll go directly . Bar . Barogo What with my clothes !  --  mercy on us !  --  however if he chooses to swap I 'm agreed . Prince . Prince of Oresca ( taking a key out of the waistcoat he had pull 'd off , and rolling his clothes up in his night-gown , which he hides under the chair . ) Fortunately I have the key of this private staircase ; now for it . ( as he is going , Enter Gusman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Make haste then ! ( entering perceives the prince . ) Prince . Prince of Oresca Zounds ! I 'm discover 'd . Bar . Barogo I shall be hang 'd . Gus . Gusman ( to the Prince . ) What are you doing here , eh ?  --  what 's this ? ( perceiving the napkin. ) why he has been wiping his dirty face with this napkin  --  you impudent rascal ! Prince . Prince of Oresca ( aside . ) He little suspects who I am  --  I must dissimulate  --  oh my lord ! Gus . Gusman My lord ! lord me no lords ! but be off  --  march-decamp  --  and quick , you had better , I can tell you . Prince . Prince of Oresca But sir  --  Gus . Gusman I 'd have you to know , we have rogues enough in this house , without you . Prince Prince of Oresca Well but  --  Gus Gusman What ! do you prate ?  --  stay here a minute longer , and I 'll fetch a cudgel which shall make you scamper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , without a towel . Bar . Barogo Treat a Prince in this fashion ,  --  what the devil will he do with me ? Prince Prince of Oresca ( aside ) This rascal will certainly make good his word . ( running towards the private door . ) Gus . Gusman ( stopping him , and taking him to the chimney ) Stop ! stop !  --  have the goodness to go back the way you came , and that quickly too , and before me . Bar . Barogo I think his highness has got into as bad a scrape as myself . Gus . Gusman Stop ! before you go , see if you can clean up a little of this dirt you have made , we are not paid here to be your servants , I can tell you , so see that it is done by the time I come back , or I 'll make you wish the devil had you . Exit . Prince . Prince of Oresca I had like to have paid pretty dearly for my curiosity , or been oblig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care now . ( Exit at the private door , which he fastens after him . ) Bar . Barogo ( comes out . ) So he 's gone !  --  I believe I 'd best make my exit the way he was intended to go . ( runs to the chimney . ) But zounds ! if I should be caught up the chimney in these clothes , it might not be taken for a joke ,  --  I should cut a pretty figure to be hang 'd for stealing , so I 'll e'en pull off these and sneak out with  --  Gus . Gusman ( without ) I 'll trounce the rascal ! Bar Barogo ( who is undressing , but hearing Gusman , comes down to the front ; turns his back to him , and endeavours to hide his face . ) Zounds ! there comes the fellow with the cudgel . Enter Gusman with a stick . Gus . Gusman ( goes up to the chimney . ) So you are gone , are you ; ' t is well for you . ( turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highness up and dress 'd already !  --  and without ringing for me to assist him . Bar . Barogo So he takes me for his master .  --  Well , that is natural enough , as he took his master for me . Gus . Gusman I must go and call Don Csar , and bring his highness 's breakfast . Exit Bar . Barogo Ha ! ha ! ha ! here 's a comical caper ! well to be sure , what respect is paid to fine clothes !  --  lucky rogues ! who have it in their power to wear ' em . But courage ! courage ! Barogo , since you are mistaken for the Prince , why not make the most of it ?  --  His real highness is not likely to return immediately  --  I certainly have a most stately gait , and may very readily be mistaken for him by those who are not acquainted with him  --  a little impudence , I perceive , will be necessary  --  well , thank my stars , I 've a tolerable share of that  --  first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brings an arm chair down to the front and sits . ) Now I am ready to give audience . Enter Gusman with Chocolate , &c.; on a waiter . Gus . Gusman Your highness 's Chocolate Bar . Barogo ( aside ) My highness 's chocolate ! a very pretty beginning , if the end only turns out as well ,  --  I must speak by signs , for fear my voice might not be found quite so impressive as my appearance . ( He makes signs imperiously to have his breakfast , taking care to hide his face . Gusman puts the waiter on the small table which he brings down to Barogo , then retires behind . ) Gus . Gusman His highness seems very reserv 'd to day . ( aside . ) Bar . Barogo ( holding the cup to his nose . ) Ah ! this smells well  --  now shall I drink it , or not ?  --  I think it would be a pity to let it get cold  --  so great a man as the Prince of Oresca , would always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse it , that fellow is looking at me , I must get rid of him ( makes signs for Gusman to leave him , Gusman bows and exit . ) These fellows observe all their master 's actions to ape them in private , but I must dispatch ( eats and drinks ) oh charming ! delicious !  --  what delightful stuff this chocolate is !  --  and such toast and butter  --  a beef steak , and a tankard of porter now , would make it a feast fit for a king ; ha ! ha ! ha ! egad it would be a good joke , if while I am eating the Prince 's breakfast , some of the servants should catch him , and make him sweep one of his own chimnies  --  he ! he ! he !  --  eh ? what can be in this glass . ( drinks ) Poh ! poh ! ( spitting it out. ) t is only water , is it possible that a prince will bend his mouth to such common stuff ? Enter Gusman announcing Don Csar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barogo ( aside . ) Curse it , visitors already . Gus . Gusman ( aside to Don Csar . ) He has not spoke a word this morning , I ca n't guess what can be the matter with him . D. C. Don Csar ( to himself . ) I hope he has not discover 'd any thing . Gus . Gusman ( removes the chocolate , &c.; and says in passing Don Csar , whom he makes observe the action of Barogo who hides his face with a handkerchief . ) His highness must have got the tooth-ache . D. C. Don Csar I imagine he has . Gus . Gusman going off , aside . ) There is the Prince 's prime favourite , a rascal who picks his pocket every hour of his life  --  I hope his highness will find him out . Exit . Bar . Barogo ( aside . ) I wonder what he is going to say . D. C. Don Csar My Prince , I attend your commands ; I was inform 'd your highness wish 'd to speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I compos 'd for your highness to Signora Eleonora your mistress , who expects it this morning ? Bar . Barogo ( aside . ) Which I suppose is like all other love letters , full of nonsense . D. C. Don Csar Here it is , together with the two hundred Piastres , which your highness has the kindness to promise to her Ladyship and which are mention 'd in the letter . Bar . Barogo People do n't make such presents as these to virtuous women . ( aside . ) D. C. Don Csar Here is the sum in rouleaux. ( place 4 rouleaux on the table . ) Bar . Barogo ( putting a rouleau to his nose . ) This smells even better than the chocolate . ( aside . ) D. C. Don Csar ( aside . ) I hope to have my share of them . ( Barogo feigns to read the letter . ) I dare flatter myself your highness is no less satisfied with the style , than her ladyship will be with the sum . Bar . Barogo ( aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . D. C. Don Csar As the letter is not long , if your highness wishes to transcribe it now , I will immediately send it to her ladyship . Bar . Barogo ( after making a sign to him that he will not , says apart. )  --  I must prevent that ; two hundred Piastres to a creature of that sort is too much . D. C. Don Csar I will have the honour to  --  ( is going to take up the money , but Barogo makes signs to leave it , and begone ) ( aside . ) I hope his highness has not chang 'd his mind  --  if he should ' t is a hundred dead loss to me . Exit . Bar . Barogo Thank heaven , I 've got rid of him  --  this talking by signs is mighty convenient , it prevents a man 's talking nonsense , at all events . Enter Gusman and Susan . Gus . Gusman My lord , the Lady Eleonora 's waiting woman , begs to have a moment 's audience of your highness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket . ) A plague take this new trade of mine , if I am oblig 'd to give audience this way , to every one that comes . ( he continues to hide his face with his handkerchief . ) Gus . Gusman ( to Susan . ) You see the tooth-ache prevents his talking , but do n't be afraid , go to him . Bar . Barogo ( apart . ) I know what she has come for , I suppose her mistress has sent her for his money Gus . Gusman ( aside to Susan . ) Do n't spare Don Csar . Sus . Susan Leave me alone . Gus . Gusman I 'll go and call in the famous French Dentist , that 's lately come to town . Exit . Bar . Barogo ( aside . ) A Dentist ! the devil ! that wo n't do for me  --  ( ogling Susan )  --  Oh the bewitching little rogue ; how I could claw her !  --  I hope in my quality of Prince , I have some privileges here  --  yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should be in a pretty pickle  --  I must take care she does'nt see my face , or my Royalty is blown to the devil . ( He seats himself upon the sofa , and makes signs for her to sit by him . ) Sus . Susan ( Curtsies and refuses . ) My lord ! ( he insists. ) indeed my lord  --  this honour !  --  Bar . Barogo ( aside . ) Honour ! ha ! ha ! ha ! she would'nt think much of that if she knew me. ( he takes her hand , which he kisses at her several replies . ) Sus . Susan ( aside . ) His hands are very hard and black for a prince  --  ( to him )  --  Oh my lord !  --  fie !  --  pray deign to listen to me . Bar . Barogo ( suppressing his voice . ) Yes , yes ! Sus . Susan I confess my lord what I am going to say , would ruin me with my lady , were it ever to come to her knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes cast to the ground , to shut them with his hand , and embrace her. )  --  Oh fie ! my lord !  --  indeed now  --  pray listen to me . Bar . Barogo ( suppressing his voice . ) Yes , yes ! Sus . Susan Indeed your highness . I could not in conscience , suffer you longer to be the dupe of those whom you love much better than they deserve . Bar . Barogo Oh ! oh ! Sus . Susan In the first place , your highness has one in your service , who robs you day and night . Bar . Barogo ( aside . ) Only one ! humph !  --  that 's nothing in a great man 's family  --  eh ! eh ! Sus . Susan In the next , the Signora Eleonora , is in concert with that hypocrite Don Csar , to share the spoil , each can pilter from you . Bar . Barogo Ah ! ah ! Sus . Susan And to crown the perfidy , she is leagued with this opera singer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , and if possible , ruin you . Bar . Barogo Hum ! hum ! Sus . Susan If your highness would deign to answer me one word ? Bar . Barogo Hem ! hem ! Sus . Susan Perhaps my lord imagines what I have said , proceeds from spite and envy to my mistress ;  --  but I can prove to your highness , that I have advanc 'd nothing but the truth . ( she rises and searches her pockets )  --  Where are these letters ?  --  I thought I had them about me  --  but I give you my honour , your highness shall see them , if you will grant me permission , I will bring them to you instantly . Bar . Barogo ( embracing her . ) Yes , yes ! Sus . Susan ( aside , going out . ) I 'm in amaze !  --  I declare the Prince is quite another man . Exit . Bar . Barogo You are right , he is another man sure enough  --  ha ! ha ! ha !  --  what nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for her return , let me be off  --  ( noise without ) Zounds , somebody else coming !  --  will they never have done ? ( gets into the chair . ) Enter Gusman . Gus . Gusman Felix , your highness ' venerable tutor , has taken the liberty to call for an answer to the petition , he sent your highness a week ago . Bar . Barogo ( aside . ) If he had as well chosen his time to present it , he would have stood a better chance . Gus . Gusman If you knew my lord , how deeply he is distress 'd  --  ' t is true your royal father made him a considerable present , but , having plac 'd his money in the hands of a false friend , who became bankrupt , ( of which there are so many this year , )  --  poor Felix now finds himself reduced to beggary . Bar . Barogo ( aside ) This is a very different case  --  a thought strikes me ! zounds , it is good !  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my place ,  --  this poor fellow is much more deserving of the money , than the jade for whom it was intended ; and who , no doubt , has already received to much . ( he gives the four rouleaux to Gusman . ) Gus . Gusman What my lord !  --  all this money for poor Felix !  --  how he will bless you !  --  will you permit him to throw himself at your highness ' feet ? ( Barogo still continuing to hide his face with his handkerchief , makes signs that he will not )  --  I will inform him that your tooth-ache , prevents your giving him audience . Exit . Bar . Barogo My tooth-ache ! ha ! ha ! ha !  --  well , happen what will , I do n't repent having done this good action ,  --  but having help 'd this poor old fellow out of his difficulty  --  I must now think of my own , and be off quick , while I am alone .  --  What 's that ? somebody else coming ,  --  and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's all over with me , that was the way the Prince went out  --  it must be himself  --  unfortunate devil that I am , what will become of me !  --  what shall I do ?  --  where shall I hide myself ?  --  eh ! egad under this table . ( hides himself under the table that is covered . ) Zounds ! here he comes ,  --  I wish he 'd swap clothes again !  --  I 'm tir 'd of royalty . Enter Prince from a door in the flat . Prince . Prince of Oresca I have not been able to discover any thing ; and yet , my disguise has not been altogether useless , as it has thrown this letter into my hands , which was given me at Eleonora 's door , to deliver to Gusman my valet  --  the honours me too much , not to be careful of my commission  --  it is apparently some intrigue ,  --  first of all , however , let me put on my own clothes , and hide these to serve me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . ) So , now I 'm finely fix 'd . Prince . Prince of Oresca I must think of some means to repay the poor devil from whom I have borrow 'd them , and who is no doubt now , in a very awkward predicament . Bar . Barogo He must be a conjurer . Prince Prince of Oresca ( having put on his nightgown , &c.; hides Barogo 's clothes in the same place . ) Though yet very early , the streets are already lin 'd with artizans of all sexes and ages ; they go cheerfully to their occupations , while the rich are endeavouring to prolong a sleep , an hundred times interrupted , by disquiet , and remorse .  --  But I forget my commission ( rings a bell , and seats himself in the chair Barogo had left. )  --  I likewise feel an appetite . Enter Gusman with a letter . Gus . Gusman ( surpris 'd . ) What is he so bad that , he has undress 'd himself again ! ( gives him a letter . ) My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prince of Oresca ( apart . ) This poor Felix , still troubles me , I must indeed do something for him , I have ascertain 'd the facts , and find his disaster is but too true ( puts the letter on the table , and gives the packet he brought in to Gusman. )  --  Gusman see what is in this packet , which I find here address 'd to you . Gus . Gusman ( aside . ) Who the devil could have brought it here ? Bar . Barogo He little suspects that he is talking to the carrier . Prince . Prince of Oresca Stay , it looks like Susan 's hand , I am curious to know what she has written to you ; let me hear it . Gus . Gusman Decorum my lord forbids  --  Prince . Prince of Oresca I tell you I wish to hear it . Gus . Gusman I fear my lord to abuse your condescension . Prince . Prince of Oresca Have enough yourself , to obey me . Gus . Gusman ( having opened the packet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highness . Prince Prince of Oresca ( after reading the second envelope . ) He is right  --  ' t is pleasant enough that I should be the bearer of letters to myself  --  Bring me my chocolate . Gus . Gusman ( astonished . ) My lord ! Prince . Prince of Oresca ( opening the letter , and not attending to Gusman. ) ' t is Susan writes to me. ( reading ) " My lord , I have enclosed you the letters , of which I had the honour to speak to you "  --  to speak to me ,  --  I know not what she means , ( reads ) " not being able to have that of delivering them to you in person , as my lady is just rising , and detains me in the room . "  --  Let me see these letters , of which she pretends to have spoken to me.  --  Ah !  --  they are address 'd to Eleonora ,  --  can it be possible ; this is from the Duke , to whom I have lost such sums of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner "  --  Bar .

Prince of Oresca ( reads . ) " I shall be with you this evening to supper , the Prince will doubtless be of the party , and we shall play  --  take care then to provide the cards and dice with which we are so well acquainted . you know the rest , Adieu " Vastly well indeed . Bar . Barogo He smells a rat . Prince . Prince of Oresca My eyes begin to open  --  I blush at my own weakness ,  --  the perfidious  --  ah ! the other is from Don Csar . ( reads the other letter . ) " You teaze me my dear Leonora to procure you the two hundred Piastres the prince has promis 'd to send you , as is after our bargain , "  --  Bargain ! ( reads . ) " It was not as much to my interest as yours to get it as soon as possible ; I will speak to him about it again this evening , and I will press him so strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; I embrace you and I love you . " Bar . Barogo So the cat is out of the bag . Prince . Prince of Oresca Am I then surrounded by ingrates and rascals ?  --  can I be such a dupe ? Bar . Barogo You are indeed . Prince . Prince of Oresca Here then have I made at a moment when I least expected it , the discovery I have so long been endeavouring to make  --  But I must dissimulate  --  ( seeing Gusman ) How !  --  did I not order you to bring my chocolate ? Bar . Barogo Hem ! hem ! Gus . Gusman Why yes , but I would remark to your highness , that you have had it already . Prince . Prince of Oresca Me ! Gus . Gusman Yes , my lord , and with more than common appetite , for your highness demolished every thing , even to the glass of water . Prince . Prince of Oresca You are pleas 'd to be merry , sir ! Gus . Gusman As a proof of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I had the honour to serve you . Prince . Prince of Oresca And you would persuade me that I have breakfasted this morning ? Gus . Gusman Certainly my lord , and your highness was at the same time dress 'd . Prince . Prince of Oresca And I am still in my nightgown . Bar . Barogo Ay , there 's the rub . Gus . Gusman Don Csar , my lord , who came in just as you had finished , can bear witness of the fact  --  luckily here he comes . Enter Don Csar . Prince . Prince of Oresca Don Csar , this fellow would persuade me that I have seen you this morning , and that I was at breakfast when you came in . D. C. Don Csar I know not my lord , whether you had in fact breakfasted , but I know that your highness had a cup in your hand , when I had the honour to deliver you the letter and the two hundred Piastres , for Signora Eleonora . Bar . Barogo Now comes the devil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a letter , and two hundred Piastres for Eleonora ? D. C. Don Csar In four rouleaux of fifty each my lord , which you ordered me to leave upon the table , your highness being dressed and sitting in that chair . Prince . Prince of Oresca Would you make me believe that I have lost my senses ? Bar . Barogo That would be comical enough . D. C. Don Csar I protest my lord , what I have informed you , is nothing by the truth . Gus Gusman My lord , I saw the rouleaux , and as soon as Don Csar had left the room , Susan , Signora Eleonora 's waiting woman , came in , and was seated with your highness upon the sofa for some time . Prince . Prince of Oresca Gentlemen , you will be good enough to put an end to this jest , or I shall know how to punish your audacity ! Gus Gusman ( aside . ) His brain is turned . D. C.

Gus Gusman Surely your highness has not forgot that you sent it to poor old Felix  --  ' t was myself your highness charged to deliver it to him , and he was much mortified that you would not suffer him to thank you in person , but endeavoured to express his gratitude in the note I just now brought from him to your highness . Prince . Prince of Oresca I am in the clouds . ( opens the letter from Felix and reads . ) " My Prince , how shall I speak my thanks for the two hundred piastres bestowed on the most devout of your servants .

Doctor Petitequeue C'est impossible mi lor have not hear de fame of le celebre Docteur Petitequeue Arracheur Des Dents  --  il est votre tres humble serviteur ; Francois by nation . Dentiste by trade , et Gentilhomme by profession . Prince . Prince of Oresca And pray what is your business with me ? Bar .
