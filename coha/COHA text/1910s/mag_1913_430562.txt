 | The article which here follows was written in May , 1864 . Two or three times extracts have been read from it at private gatherings ; otherwise it has lain undisturbed and practically buried all these years . Only a portion of the original , though distinctly the larger portion , is here printed . As it was written nearly fifty years ago , it naturally expresses views which I do not now entertain and says things which I should not now say . But it seemed best to leave it as it first appeared in order to give a faint conception of the way men , at least some men , thought and felt in the midst of the mighty struggle which was then going on . Accordingly no alteration has been made save what has been rendered necessary to connect sentences where intervening paragraphs have been omitted , or where certain passages have been transposed . One instance only is an exception . In deference to the more amiable feelings which have sprung up since " the late unpleasantness , " wherever the word rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the word Confederate has been substituted when I speak in my own person . IT was about one o'clock in the afternoon of the third of December , 1862 , that we took the cars at Alexandria for Union Mills . The precise situation of the latter place none of us knew , and it was soon evident that our scanty stock of geographical information was not to be largely increased by the answers given to our inquiries by the inhabitants . The Virginia poor white is a man of more  | than average intelligence who knows where he lives himself , let alone any acquaintance with points more remote . " A right smart heap of a way , I reckon , " was the reply usually made in the genuine native vernacular . This pursuit of knowledge under difficulties was , however , rewarded at last by the information that Union Mills was a station on the Orange and Alexandria Railway , where the track crosses Bull Run , and was the extreme point in that direction of the defenses of Washington . From that city it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shut out the view of the place we had left behind , seemed to shut out also at the same time all the sights and sounds of civilized life . Everything bore the marks of decay . A few houses could be seen from the cars as we passed by , but most of these had long been deserted and were fast going to ruin . No ploughed fields , no fences , no landmarks of any kind , existed to show that men cared longer either to own or to cultivate the soil . The smoke of occasional fires , slowly rising from the depths of the pine forests on each side of us , and the scattered tents of the soldiers guarding the road , were almost the only evidences of life that broke the monotony of desolation . The entire region was rapidly returning to the abandonment and waste from which the labor of successive generations had rescued it . The day , too , was a cold and cheerless one , imparting an additional gloom to the scenes through which we passed . Green and gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional tufts of grass , still struggling to retain their freshness amid the general decay , seemed only tO give by contrast a more leaden look to the folds of snow-clouds which hung heavy on the hills . On we whirled through plains covered by dense thickets and between hills surmounted by impenetrable forests of pine ; through Annandale , past Burke and Fairfax and Sangster 's stations . The train stopped at last without any particular reason for so doing that could be gathered from  | anything visible in the neighborhood . Here , however , was our destination . We had reached the limit of Northern sovereignty . Loyalty stopped short at the little stream which rolled at our feet and only looked beyond . Before us lay the bloody debatable land , on which more than on any other part of the continent had fallen the curse of war in its heaviest form . The few persons who still clung to the soil , bound to it by an iron necessity , had long given up thought or care for the morrow , and lived only the aimless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The region had become historic ground ; but like all historic ground , had become so at the price of tears and blood . As we got off the cars , I looked for the mills which had given their name to the spot . One glance was enough to show that they were in a far more ruinous condition than the Union , after which they had been called . The building was entirely torn down , and the mill-stones , lying alongside of the stream , were the only evidences of the noisy life which they had survived . The owner had not stayed behind to save the miserable remnants of his property . While ground is getting to be historic , it loses altogether its attractions as a residence for human beings . The line guarded by our brigade was part of the outer line of the defenses of Washington , and extended from Wolf Run Shoals on the Occoquan to Chantilly . But the whole distance was never at one time picketed by us . The outposts were stationed along the lower course of Bull Run as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left that stream , which , rising in the Manassas mountains , there turns off to the west . Whence Bull Run received its name , none of the inhabitants seemed to know ; but it was probably due to the same taste which called a rivulet emptying into it Cub Run , and gave to one of the most beautiful tributaries of the Potomac the name of Goose Creek . There is , however , some justice in the title , if not much poetry . For though ordinarily a quiet but always swift-moving stream ,  | Bull Run under the influence of winter rains quickly becomes a roaring torrent , rapidly rising , overflowing its banks wherever it passes through level country , and bearing down to the Occoquan , in its rushing current , large fragments of ice , blocks of wood , and now and then an uprooted tree . Its fall is always as sudden as its rise . Below Union Mills the scenery through which it flows is of a character so romantic as to have made its beauty felt even under the dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there rushes on through meadow-land and gorge , by sloping hillsides and under overhanging cliffs , while the path along its eastern bank , trodden by our patrols , wound its way over heights and hollows , through groves of laurel and the desolate ruins of what had once been great forests . On the opposite side overshadowing us , were frowning ramparts of rock , sentinelled by gigantic pines , seemingly as motionless and to mortal eyes as enduring as the hills upon which they stood . These lofty parapets , which nature had built , were at this point the real defenses of the line ; for there are few places in which Bull Run is ordinarily too deep to be fordable by infantry . Our life was in many respects a hard one . The long line of from eight to sixteen miles , guarded by our brigade , required that officers and men should go on duty nearly every other day . The winter , too , was a cold and cheerless one , with storms of rain and snow frequent and severe . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of April . If this was the " sunny South , " it was quite a general feeling that we had got on the shady side of it . On the fifteenth of March there was a thunder-storm , accompanied by a fall of snow or rather of sleet , ? a circumstance to me somewhat surprising , and which left my meteorological ideas , never very clear , in quite a mixed state . In addition to the severe weather , the whole country for three months seemed one complete sea of mud ; and much as has been said of it , nothing too mean , nothing too vituperative  | ever has been said or ever can be said of Virginia mud . Yet down there they call such soil " sacred . " The constant exposure either killed the men of weaker vitality or rendered their discharge a necessity in consequence of the diseases they contracted . Still it was no harder life than many others were having at the same time and doubtless not so hard as some . We grumbled , of course ; we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army is apt to think that the privations he endures are far worse than those endured by anyone else ; that the particular ground upon which he sleeps is encumbered with much sharper protuberances , the particular stone he uses for a pillow is much harder , the particular air which surrounds him is much chillier , the particular rain which falls upon his person is much wetter , the particular mud in which he marches is much stickier , and the particular rations served out to him much fuller of animal and vegetable life , than the particular ground , stone , air , rain , mud , and rations which enter into the experience of any other individual . It is the soldier 's privilege to grumble ; and the deprivation of it could never be counterbalanced by any increase of pay . It is the one thing that binds him to the life he has left behind . He has surrendered his free-will . He sometimes eats , and even relishes , food which at home he would not give to any cat or dog of respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not think of washing his hands . He goes to bed at dark , and gets up at ridiculously early hours . On the march he inhabits a dog-kennel , which courtesy and the regulations call a shelter tent ? probably because it affords no shelter . Vague memories only linger in his mind of that far-away past , that pre-existent state , in which he ate oysters , and drank wine , and lounged about luxurious apartments . True , occasional delicacies do astonish his pork-oppressed stomach ; bottles of wine , surreptitiously procured , do sometimes gladden his heart ; and carpeted rooms with sofas and easy  | chairs drawn up before cheerful fires , do now and then refresh his frame . But such events are rare . They appeal , moreover , to the outer man only . They enervate while they delight . Not so with the grumble . That is the natural outgrowth of his condition . Station him on the summit of the Blue Ridge amid cold and sleet and snow , and he grumbles ; station him in Fifth Avenue , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the bitter thoughts , engendered by the manifold discomforts of his life , find their way into the great universe , and there pass into vacancy . He is a fool who regards such utterances as serious ; he is a greater fool , as well as a traitor , who would think to act upon them . Our hearts were always loyal , whatever our lips might say . Ours was the fault-finding of that earnest devotion which wished the government to do more , not of that mulish opposition which wished it to do nothing . It cleared our minds for the contemplation of the happy scenes of that good time coming , when the wars would all be over , and we should have gone back from the border . Many a winter night , tired out with long patrols , with feet wet , with bodies chilled , did we sit cowering and shivering over some feeble fire on the outposts , and " indulge our sacred fury " in grumbling at the hardships we suffered , at the courage and capacity of the generals by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government we served . Then with hearts relieved , our thoughts would wander far away , in the long hours that followed , from the barren hills and relentless skies which encircled us , to cheerful rooms in Northern homes , curtained away from the chill December air , populous with books , radiant with the firelight , more radiant still with the light of love . All around were visible traces of the Confederate occupation . Our camp was about a mile north of the railroad , in the direction of Centreville , and was also at an equal distance from McLean 's Ford , well known as the place where p 391 a body of our troops under General Tyler suffered a severe repulse in the first advance of the army of the Potomac . In front of us was a deserted village , as it might be called , of huts built of pine logs and plastered together with earth . A collection of habitations , similar in construction though much larger in number , existed , and probably now exists , just across Bull Run at Blackburn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former residences of the Southern troops were still more abundant . The telegrams which used to announce , during the winter of 1861-1862 , that the rebels were dying off in consequence of exposure and privation , must have lied even more than ordinarily ; for no quarters that have anywhere been provided for our troops could have excelled in comfort these huts , when occupied by the enemy . Ruined forts , in all cases made of earth and many doubtless never mounted with cannon , were scattered over the country ; while rifle-pits half full of water , stretched for miles in every direction . One , in particular , running along the main road from Union Mills to Centreville , was so completely hidden by the trees and dense undergrowth as to be hardly visible at the distance of a few feet . All through this region ? in fact , throughout the borderland between the two armies ? the houses , which had been deserted by their occupants , had been pretty generally burned down . Those which had been left standing were as a rule thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look to the landscape . Of actual fighting , during the months we were in the defenses of Washington , we saw little or nothing . Rumors of wars always abounded ; but an occasional shot exchanged with some wandering bushwhacker or prowling guerilla from Mosby 's band , made up the sum total of our field operations . If , however , we were not disturbed for ourselves , Washington was for us . That city was always excited , always uneasy , perhaps necessarily so from its comparatively exposed position , and the vast interests involved  | in its permanent and unbroken possession by our authorities . But confident as we were in our own safety , the reports that constantly reached us from its streets , in regard to the perils by which we were surrounded , aroused no other feeling than amusement . One could hardly say with truth that the solicitude felt by the city for our safety , was fully returned by us . The great attraction of Washington in our eyes was that , so far as we knew , it was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , sentiment on our part did not go . There was never any of that regard expressed for it which we should naturally expect would be felt for the capital of the nation . Were it not for the public buildings , it seemed to be a general feeling with us that it would be much better for our cause if the city were six feet under ground . This feeling , of course , did not prevent our being alive to the disgrace , and consequences more direful still , involved in its capture . If , however , we did not see much fighting , we heard enough of it . The hills which slope down to Bull Run from Centreville to Wolf Run Shoals are a perfect sounding board , reechoing the report of any artillery engagement that takes place between them and the Manassas and Kittoctan mountains , and even , when the wind is favorable , between them and the Blue Ridge itself . The bombardment of Harper 's Ferry in September , 1862 , was distinctly heard at Union Mills , which is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement was made by any portion of the army , of which the artillery did not give early , if not very satisfactory , information . The sound , according as it grew fainter or louder , told usually how the day was going . Such times were ever with us times of interest and eager expectation . The noise of a cannonade is always exciting , and always pleasant ? if a good way off . I remember , in particular , how the report of the artillery , opening the cavalry action at Upperville on the twenty-first of June , 1863 , startled all the camps . I could not but think , that  | beautiful Sunday morning , that while thousands of mothers and sisters , both North and South , were praying , in the words of the litany , that a good Lord would deliver their sons and brothers " from battle and murder and sudden death , " those same sons and brothers were at the very moment furnishing a peculiar commentary upon those petitions by striving to cut one another 's throats . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hateful . I doubt whether there is any man living who really loves fighting for its own sake . The mystery of death , confronting and overshadowing the spirit , awes at such a time the most boastful and presumptuous . Yet there is a terrible fascination about a battle , in spite of the dread uncertainty and horror that attend it , which can not be explained by any feeling of duty , of pride , still less of curiosity . These , of course , had their weight with us . We could not expect to feel at ease in our comparative safety , while our fellowsoldiers were falling ; and restlessly wandering about the camps , we listened eagerly for the tidings of fierce conflicts , whose far-off sound reached our ears , but in whose mighty passion we could not share . Nothing occurred during the month of December to disturb the monotonous quiet of our life , except a hostile raid , really insignificant in its proportions , but much magnified at the time by uncertainty and apprehension . Slocum 's corps , in marching from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenses of Washington ; and the advance of a portion of that force from Fairfax station , where it had been encamped , separated from the main body a part of Stuart 's cavalry , variously estimated at from six hundred to two thousand men . With these were four pieces of artillery . To make good their escape they were forced to go through our lines . This they did successfully , crossing , on the twenty-eighth of December , the Orange and Alexandria Railway at Burke 's station , where they captured some of the guard and telegraphed , it is said , various impu- dent messages to the Quarter-Master General . After cutting the wires and tearing up a small portion of the track , they passed on to the North . The troops in the defenses of Washington south of the Potomac , were everywhere put under arms . Our brigade was ordered out , and detachments from it sent to guard different points and to close , after the most approved fashion of scientific warfare , several military stable-doors , out of which the horses had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind an extempore fortification thrown up at McLean 's , a huge saw-log , blackened in the fire , was mounted by some of our officers on a pair of cart-wheels which were found near the place . This piece of artillery , pointed threateningly across the stream , had quite an imposing effect when seen from a distance , and , I doubt not , has done as good service as most of the heavy ordnance in the defenses of Washington . But no enemy ever came to try its strength . Where , indeed , that band of horsemen went to , I never could find out . I fancy they must have lost themselves somewhere in that boundless North , towards which , when last seen , they were heading ; for though day after day I read the newspapers with scrupulous care , never a word or hint could be found in them of the fate which befell those bold riders . But no one could fail to be struck at the time with a feeling which seemed to be universal among our troops , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuring us , we would be willing to reciprocate the favor . We would offer no opposition to their escape , provided they behaved themselves properly , and did not put us under that painful necessity . This is not very complimentary to our soldiers ; but although it would be far from being true now , it was too true then . A general gloom hung over the army iii consequence of the repulse of Burnside at Fredericksburg . But , in particular , the daring and yet successful raids of Stuart on the Peninsula and in Pennsylvania had given , at that time , to the arm of the Confederate service corn- manded by him , a reputation and prestige which subsequent events have failed to confirm . Moreover , it was felt that little or no reliance could be placed upon our cavalry , which alone could properly have any hope of intercepting such flying bodies of the enemy . It was usually worsted by half of its number , or at least believed so to be ; and if it chanced to be successful , seemed itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was at that period an object of contempt with all of the infantry . A remark of one of the soldiers of the Pennsylvania Reserves , while undergoing punishment , expressed a feeling then very common . When he enlisted again , he said , he was going to join the cavalry ; for he had been in ten battles , and had never seen a dead cavalryman yet . It is hardly necessary to say that no such feeling prevails now . The rapid rise in conduct , in reputation , and in general morale of that arm of the service , its transformation into the formidable body it has now become , is , to anyone acquainted with its previous condition , one of the most remarkable circumstances of the war . January , February , and March were naturally the months that tried most severely the endurance of the men . A part of that time it seemed as if one half of the various regiments would be collected every morning at their respective surgeons ' quarters at the bugle-call for the sick ; while to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing the words generally sung to it throughout our command : Come all ye sick ! Come all ye sick ! Come and get your quinine , Come and get your quinine , Come and get your quinine pills ! Among so large a number there were doubtless some who feigned illness . But the triple volleys that reechoed at the twilight of so many successive days over new-made graves , proved that exposure and privation were telling fearfully upon the health and lives of the men . Their bodies were  | generally sent home ? a fact which the soldiers with ghastly facetiousness held out to one another as the great inducement to die at that spot and time . If they fell in the coming battles , whose shadow darkened us ever from out of the future , their fate might possibly be ? yes , probably would be the fate of their comrades whose uncovered bones still whitened the plains of Manassas . Boards are always , to any large army , wherever encamped , the greatest of rarities and of luxuries ; and at that place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rude coffins of those we buried . Two members of the company to which I belonged , died of smallpox , and of course their remains could not be removed . It is some consolation to know that to them , if not to those who live to lament them , it is no sorrow . I doubt not they sleep as peacefully in their solitary graves on that Virginia hillside , as they would in the crowded churchyards of their Northern home . The fact of our remaining so long in one encampment saved our men from dying to any extent of any of the United States General Hospitals . Dying to the regiment , I mean . War may slaughter its thousands , but these slaughter their tens of thousands . When a soldier leaves a regiment in active service for one of the United States Hospitals , he practically leaves it forever . At first , if he became well , he was detailed ; if he remained ill , he was discharged . Now he is put into the Invalid Corps , which is a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , he may as well be dead . Vainly will he seek to return , vainly will his officers strive to reclaim him . The grip of the . surgeon-in-charge upon him has a tenacity alongside of which the connection existing between the Old Man of the Sea and Sindbad was a tie of the most frivolous character . Military authority is far-reaching and mighty ; but it is the puniest of powers when it comes face to face with quinine and calomel . One of my own men , able-bodied and thoroughly healthy , was on duty with his company three  | weeks ; the remaining period of his service he has so far spent in a United States General Hospital . Several times he made efforts to return to his regiment , but all to no effect ; and at last I sent him word , if he knew when he was well off , he would stay where he was . During the latter part of February and the beginning of March , the emigration from the South began to approach to the dignity of an exodus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of our brigade at the rate of from twenty-five to seventy-five a day . They were mostly foreigners , leaving the Confederacy in which they could no longer find a livelihood . A very few were citizens fleeing before the Conscription Act , which was at that time said to be enforced throughout Virginia with merciless rigor . The appearance of these emigrants was saddening in the extreme . Every day a silent , sorrowful procession of old men , young men , women leading little children by the hand , almost fainting with weariness , passed our camp under guard to headquarters. , Their earthly possessions were usually all carried on their backs , but the household goods of some in more fortunate circumstances were packed in rickety wagons , drawn by horses so skeleton-like that it seemed as if they would fall to pieces were it not for the harness . All of these persons told the same sad story of distress and destitution in the South ; and their looks would have convinced the stoutest disbeliever in the policy of starvation that they did not come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Heintzelman , the commander of our corps , issued in the latter part of March , the guards were instructed not to allow any person from the Confederacy to come in . Yet for a long time afterwards , many came up to our lines and sought to gain an entrance , and even stayed days and weeks in houses near by in the vain hope of at last being admitted . Their presence only added to the general distress . It was the season when the products of the pre- vious year were nearly if not altogether used up , and the products of the new year had not as yet come on . The inhabitants could not enter our lines ; they lived too far away from any sources of Confederate supply to obtain any food from that quarter . Although provisions were occasionally sent out to them , but little reliance could be placed upon a succor so precarious . All along that part of Virginia just outside of the region occupied by our forces , the destitution in many families at that time was terrible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen with weeping declared themselves starving , and gratefully accepted the hard fare shared with them by our soldiers . This was not common ; but it actually happened . The cold weather and the mud prevented any drilling worth speaking of during January , February , and most of March . Consequently , when off duty there was nothing for either officers or men to do ; and here the monotony of military life made itself most severely felt . Till a man keeps a diary , and attempts to set down in it the acts which he regards as worthy of special record , he never fully appreciates how little happens in his daily experience outside of eating , drinking , and sleeping . In our peculiar situation all of these had with us an unnatural prominence . Dinner was as much the great event of the day , as to wellregulated individuals who aim to be healthy , wealthy , and wise , slumber is of the night . All of the intellect and skill of the camp was constantly engaged in the effort to get up new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certain of the feats of the culinary art , then and there accomplished , would have brought tears to the eyes of Soyer , Vattel , or any others who have greatly cooked . My own masterpiece was a pancake , against which forks vainly struggled and knives could not prevail ; the capacity of which to resist foreign impressions was only equalled by the sublime tenacity with which the separate particles of matter , constituting its internal economy , clung  | to one another . Cooking was , indeed , our pleasure in prosperity and our solace in adversity ; and with ever-varying but always remarkable and hitherto unheard-of experiments on meats and vegetables , we whiled away many dreary hours of the long winter , and on several occasions cheated ourselves into temporary and delusive anticipations of having once , at least , a good meal . True , there were other things to be done . Lessons were to be learned and recited in the Tactics and the Regulations ; but in spite of their attractions these works could not be studied all the time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Books were not easily procured , were too heavy to be carried , and were always liable to abuse and destruction while lying about a camp ; consequently , the inducements to create a large library were never very powerful . Works that anywhere else I would not have thought of looking into , there were eagerly welcomed and diligently read . I individually went through a course of Beadle 's Dime Novels and Waverley Magazines , and just before we left the defenses of Washington , felt exceedingly obliged for a loan of Tupper 's " Proverbial Philosophy . " No one , under such circumstances , could fail to be impressed with the fact that the mental deterioration of a man long connected with the army , if stationed far away from his fellow-men , must be rapid , unless his situation or his character is peculiar , or unless his position is so high as to call into requisition and develop the moral powers which react upon the mind . Any regimental officer , if he applies himself , can in a year 's time learn all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimental duties . After that he may as well die for any further use his brain will be to him ? of course so far as regards acquisition , not action . His knowledge will not be materially increased , though it will certainly be less liable to be forgotten , if he remains in the army fifty years . In camp there are no inducements  | from without to resist the tendency to be lazy when he can just as well be lazy . His pay is the same whether he be much or little informed ; and his promotion depends not upon his ability , but upon his seniority or the political influence he can bring to bear . In active service he can learn nothing if he wishes . He can not take with him books to read or to study . He can not carry his investigations beyond the simplest elements of his profession . His individuality is lost . He is part of a great and complex machine , is called into action and assigned to duty without any consultation of his tastes , of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confined to a narrow circle of ideas , which the solitariness of his profession and its want of contact with other professions and other modes of thought prevent ever being enlarged or broken up . Of the grand movements of the times , the hopes which exalt , the fears which depress , the passions which agitate , he knows nothing . I soon ceased to wonder why some of the older officers of the regular army , who had spent their lives largely in outpost service , seemed so stupid . That was a result they could hardly help . One of our ablest corps commanders , himself a graduate of West Point , once told a friend of mine that a West Pointer knew more the day he graduated than he ever did afterwards ; and the remark , however untrue even then of many , and however exaggerated of all , was unquestionably prompted by a knowledge of the necessary consequences that follow the enforced inaction of mind and body and want of contact with society , which are peculiar to military life as lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II On the twenty-fourth of March , headquarters were changed from Union Mills to Centreville . With them to the latter place went all the regiments of the brigade , which  | had been stationed at the former . During the whole of the month the air had been filled with rumors of great enterprises in which we were to have a share ; and this movement looked as if our strength was to be collected for some offensive purpose . Nothing came of it , however , if anything was ever intended . Ever since the war began , I had heard of Centreville . There had been assembled the first body of Southern troops which could justly be styled an army . There the reserve of McDowell 's forces , drawn up in line , had checked the advance of the enemy after the first disastrous battle of Bull Run . There had been encamped during the winter of 1861-1862 that formidable multitude , estimated by the varying shades of contempt or fear as numbering everywhere between fifty and two hundred and fifty thousand , ? against whose possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation the startling and inspiriting despatch that Washington was now regarded as safe . I had seen the name of the place so often and so many times in such large type , I had heard so much of the importance of its position and its reported natural and artificial strength , I had known it so long as the central point of mighty armies , that it is no wonder my conceptions of it had assumed a vastness and grandeur which its actual condition was far from realizing . Centreville is a broken-down village , which before the war had about four hundred inhabitants , but now would muster scarcely more than fifty or sixty . The houses are all old , all dirty , all dilapidated . Most have never known paint and the few which have known it have long since forgotten it . Nearly all are built in that peculiar Virginia style which consists in flanking each side with a tremendous chimney of brick or of stone ? this last appendage of Northern mansions forming in Southern domiciles a " peculiar domestic institution " by itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodwork of these buildings  | has in many cases been burned or torn down , leaving the lofty chimneys still standing . The place had always a thriftless , ruined appearance ; and , as might be expected , has it more especially at the present time . Everything has gone to seed ; for in addition to the natural shiftlessness of the inhabitants , the war forbids any extensive or expensive indulgence in modern improvements . But miserable as the town looks , so far as it is the creation of its miserable inhabitants , the scenery about it is magnificent . As if to compensate for the failure of art , nature has been more than ordinarily bountiful in beauty . The village is situated three miles east of Bull Run on the range of hills which slope down to that stream . Right before it lies the vast plain which the conflict of two opposing civilizations has twice made a battle-field . Those desperate struggles disfigured the ground with shattered and ghastly wrecks of humanity which man left unburied , committing to the more merciful agencies of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native earth the bodies and bones of those who have fallen . This broad tract of level country stretches to the Manassas mountains , which stand up clear against the western sky ; while beyond them and the intervening valley , far away on the edge of the horizon , can be seen the misty cones of the Blue Ridge . Naturally we had rarely come in contact with the best representatives of the people of Virginia . In the regions where active military operations had been going on , the finest mansions were fairly sure to be deserted and dismantled , and those who had occupied them had almost inevitably gone to Dixie or the deuce . But within the lines , especially well within the lines of the defenses of Washington , a number of families of all sorts and conditions still continued to dwell . To a man brought up in the North the ignorance , or rather the illiteracy of some of these inhabitants seemed amazing . During the last months of our stay in Centreville , I was connected with the provost- marshal 's department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought into frequent contact with the families in the neighborhood . All passes for citizens were granted at our office , and before given , the signature of each person was required to a printed oath that the pass would not be used against the interests of the United States . Nothing surprised me more at first than to have individuals whom I knew as men of apparent respectability and possessing some landed property , confess that they could not write their own names . That , however , was too common there to be long a matter of wonder . As for loyalty , they hardly knew what the word meant . In fact , the unreal world of dreams never furnished a more intangible collection of spectres than the Union men of the South ? that is , the Union men of the kind we heard so much of at the beginning of the war , and have seen so little of since . The ceaseless pressure resulting from the occupation of the soil and the lack of confidence in a failing cause has , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of allegiance . But I never saw in the South an actively loyal man , one who had a reason for the faith that was in him , who was not either an anti-slavery man or rapidly becoming so . There are , indeed , a few knockkneed , blear-eyed individuals who profess themselves equally addicted to the Union and to slavery ; but the earnest workers on both sides scarcely affect to hide the contempt they feel for these fossilized fragments of the old Union . The women everywhere were naturally the most outspoken . Relying upon the protection afforded them by their sex , they often gave expression to their sentiments in a manner so violent as to cause evident uneasiness to their suspected and therefore more suspicious male relatives . These were sometimes at great pains to check the intemperance of the language used by their wives and daughters , and to explain away the meaning of their words . They might succeed in restraining the older ones ; but the girls were never to be deterred by any dread of remote con- sequences from saying anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is but fair to state that their conduct sprang more from a love of mischief than from any other feeling . The most insulting remark ever made was the standard reply to any observation upon the ragged condition of the Confederate troops , that Southern gentlemen did not think it necessary to dress up in order to slaughter hogs . The origin of this speech was contemporaneous with the first advance of the Union army , and from the frequency with which it is still repeated I judge it to be the culminating effort of the female mind as now found in Virginia . The women of the families which continued to dwell within the lines of the defenses of Washington , though no less disloyal , were in other respects an improvement upon the majority of their Virginia sisters whom I had previously encountered . They were bright , lively , intelligent brunettes , and were as contrary , tantalizing , spiteful , and otherwise agreeable as girls , the world over , generally are . One of the most attractive of them , mentally , physically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyr in the cause of Southern rights . Whether sincere or not in her feelings , she had her wish to some extent gratified , as after we had taken our departure , the provostmarshal who next succeeded ? a wretch evidently as hardhearted as he was hard-headed ? sent her to Washington to become an inmate ? probably a temporary one ? of the Old Capitol prison . It was at this time that the policy of employing negroes in the military service of the United States was adopted by the government . Upon no other subject could the indignation of these damsels be sooner aroused . Language seemed powerless to express their disgust and wrath , whenever the topic was brought under discussion , as we took care it should be often . One day I propounded to one of the prettiest and most pugnacious of these how near to her she  | would allow me to come , provided I was put in command of a negro regiment . " Not within fifty miles , " was the spiteful answer . I vainly tried to reduce the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down a furlong or even a rod . The cloud-compelling Jove himself could not have moved that indomitable damsel one inch . In spite of their constant , boastful assertions that the South would never succumb , there was in all they said an undercurrent of doubt and sadness . This was partly due to the confident tone of the Northern troops , which no defeat or disaster could ever shake . " When do you think the war will be over ? " was the question always asked . " 0 ! in five or six years , " was a common reply , sometimes because such was really the belief , but oftener prompted by the desire to create the evident feeling of depression which invariably followed . Such an answer always made them look sadder , though doubtless in many cases unconsciously ; for they , if no one else , recognized the resolution that lay behind it . Indeed , the one thing which has characterized the sentiment of the Northern soldiers during the struggle which has so long continued , has been the determination that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that it shall go on until everywhere throughout the entire land the integrity of the nation shall be acknowledged . Whatever be the result of the mighty conflict which has already wasted so much of treasure and blood , the feeling prevails in the army as powerfully now as it did at the very beginning , that rather than have the Union broken up , better it were that the whole land should return to the desolation from which centuries of toil have reclaimed it , and the civilization of the future begin its work with a theodolite and a surveyor 's chain . One could not help having , however , a sentiment of compassion for these girls , in spite of their defiant speech , dwelling as they did within our lines in the midst of an alien  | and hostile soldiery . Theirs was , indeed , a dreary prospect . For them the future held out little hope and less promise . One year , two years , had swept by , and still the mighty struggle which both parties entered upon as a mere holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers had all gone to the wars . Rarely came any word across the lines to tell of the fate which had befallen them . Day after day dragged on slowly in their solitary lives , with only occasional messages at best from those of whose constant companionship they had been defrauded . Marrying and giving in marriage there was no more . Throughout all the borderland of Virginia that had practically ceased . Even wherever there were men , the times were too unsettled , the chances of supporting a family too doubtful , the future too full of darkness and despair , to warrant such a step . It seemed as if the growth of the population would be brought to a standstill through the want of faith and hope . Life was too wretched to be inflicted upon anyone who could be saved from the curse of living . In all of my journeyings in Virginia north of the Rappahannock , I do not recollect to have ever seen a child under two years of age . Stripped as the country had been of men capable of bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general search-warrant would find fifty wherever active military operations have been going on . With a severe snowstorm in the early part of April the winter passed away . The long-reluctant days of sunny weather came at last . Camps were decorated with pines and cedars from the neighboring woods , and the rows of white tents were half hidden in the avenues of overshadowing evergreens . With the sunny weather came also the wives and , in a few cases , the daughters of many of the officers . Crinoline swept through the company streets with as much assurance as if they were the streets of a Northern city . Picnics were planned and went off with music and dancing , very much like picnics anywhere else ?  | except that the ladies were nearly all married , and it never rained . Excluding the drilling , it was a lazy , happy , dreamy time . All was quiet on the Potomac , the Rappahannock , and on Bull Run . The officer of the outposts lounged on the fresh grass , watching the silent sunny plain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never to be relieved . The officer of the day sat in his tent , smoked cigars , drank uninspiring lemonade , and wrote letters . The terrible bugle-call for drill was the skeleton in our closet . Had it not been for that , ours would almost have been the life of the lotus-eaters over again . Even with it , all that was needed to bring back the life we had left behind was the presence of woman ; and I , for one , felt little disposition to blame those who sent for their wives and daughters , in spite of the frowns of some of the powers that be . For certainly to a cultivated mind the one great privation of military life is the lack of female society . Day after day to see men only ; to hear nothing but their talk , often earthy and sometimes gross ; to be ministered to in sickness by their clumsy hands , and in sorrow by their clumsy sympathy ; all these are ever-present facts which give one a peculiarly vivid " realizing sense " of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparative quiet of the garrison than in that active service where the hurrying incidents of assault or defense , of flight or pursuit , drove from the mind all thoughts save those of the stern questions of success or failure which presented themselves for solution daily and hourly . Fortunate was she who came to us in our solitude ; for in the dreary monotony of camp life our imaginations were always ready and willing to invest with the attributes of a goddess any woman whose appearance gave us the least excuse for so doing . During the winter , when our stock of beauty ran low , it was natural that she who had even very moderate pretensions to it should be rated high .  | Our lady visitors ornamented the dress parades of the various regiments through the months of April and May and even longer . It required some courage for them to stand their ground . Hints from division headquarters that they were not needed came thick and fast and threatened soon to become orders . Some retreated early in May along with Hooker ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforced bade a respectful but obstinate defiance to the military authorities . Insinuations that they were or might be in the way , that movements were in contemplation , made no impression upon these indomitable fair ones . Stay they would , and stay they did ; some even late enough to part for the last time with their husbands before the march to Gettysburg . The retreat of Hooker from Chancellorsville turned our attention to digging . It is a very fortunate thing for me that I have no military reputation , for if I had , it would doubtless be forever ruined by what I am going to say . The extensive fortifications of Centreville always seemed to me a humbug ? a gigantic imposition upon the credulity of the American people . They are made up of a chain of small forts , of value only as a defense against a direct attack in front , and almost utterly powerless to resist an assault from the flank . These were the only works that cost any labor , and these could have cost but little . Riflepits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rifle-pits , as every soldier knows , are the creation of a few hours . What nature has done for the defense of the position is another , question ; but the elaborate fortifications , which tasked for months the military genius of Beauregard to construct , existed only in the fertile minds of newspaper correspondents . That he himself did not regard Centreville so highly as some of our civilians , is clearly shown by his falling back to the line of Bull Run on the first advance of the army of the Potomac . It may have been no object to attack these works ; it probably was not . Nor do I mean to  | say that they could have been taken without great loss of life . Very few places are , so far as I have had an opportunity of observing . But it seems never to get through the heads of some men that the strength of a position depends not so much on its fortifications as it does on the number and spirit of the soldiers who hold it , and the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigade spent several days in digging rifle-pits and building batteries ; and as we never expected them to be used , we endeavored to make them appear as ornamental as possible . They were , when we departed , the best fortifications to be found at or near Centreville ; but by this time , doubtless , Beauregard has all the credit of their construction . If any troops are now stationed at that place , they pretty certainly point them out to visitors as triumphal monuments of his ceaseless activity and engineering skill . From the first of May to the middle of June the weather was exceedingly warm . The skies seemed made of brass , not a drop of rain falling for six weeks . Our life was more quiet , if possible , than before . We were scarcely even disturbed by rumors ; bugs and flies were the only terrestrial enemies which annoyed us . The former were everywhere . You swallowed them in your food ; you snuffed them up your nose ; you speared them in the bottles of ink with your pen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered almost a curiosity . Day after day passed by , unmarked by anything more impressive than the inevitable six hours of drill . But this unnatural calm ended so abruptly that a few days only constituted the transition period from it to the excitement of military life in its sternest form . I was lying in my tent on the afternoon of Sunday , the fifteenth of June , when I saw several horsemen ride up to division headquarters , which were on the opposite side of the road . In a little while the news went like wildfire through the camps that the eleventh corps , the advance of the army of the Potomac , was coming . It was a thunder- bolt from a clear sky . Not even a rumor of any movement in progress or in contemplation had reached us previously . At first the report could hardly be believed ; but a little later in the day , those standing on the forts surmounting the heights could see the rolling clouds of dust that almost hid from view the southern sky . About sundown General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay encamped for the night near Blackburn 's Ford on Bull Run , and did not reach Centreville until the next morning . It was followed immediately by the first and the fifth corps . On Wednesday the seventeenth , the third corps arrived ; on Friday the nineteenth , the second , and about the time we were leaving the place the sixth corps made its appearance . From the first moment of the coming of these troops the monotonous quiet of Centreville was entirely broken up . Every day some new body of infantry , cavalry , and artillery came and went . The ceaseless march of men to the North , the long and seemingly endless trains of baggage and ammunition wagons , the entire ignorance that prevailed even among the highest officers , as to the movements of either army , and the thousand reports to which such ignorance gave rise , all these kept the place in a constant tumult of excitement . Rumors that Lee was in Pennsylvania , ? rumors that he was directly in our front , ? rumors that he was retreating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shenandoah valley , ? rumors that he held the gaps of the Manassas mountains , ? rumors that we held them , ? rumors that the occupation of the Pennsylvania border was a mere feint to draw away our troops from Washington , ? rumors that it was but the beginning of a general invasion of the North , planned long ago and now carried into execution , ? rumors that Lee had been outgeneralled by Hooker , ? rumors that Hooker had been outgeneralled by Lee , ? these and numberless others of a similar character followed one another in endless succession . Every man had his theory and by constantly asserting it  | soon became convinced of its absolute truth , and finally proclaimed it as a fact . Confused by the reports of every hour , which contradicted the reports of the hour previous , we could only wait for the development which the future would bring . We were not kept long in uncertainty . With the smoke-clouds that in a few days rose from the field of Gettysburg , passed away all the mystery that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy . In the rumors in regard to the destination of our own brigade we naturally had a very lively interest . As day after day the endless columns of troops marched through Centreville , it was a question eagerly asked by everyone , whether we were to go or to stay . The answer came speedily . On the twenty-third of June orders were received to be ready for the field with ten days ' rations . We had been transferred , we were informed , to the second corps of the army of the Potomac , commanded by General Hancock . So on the twenty-fifth of June " the band-box brigade " ? as our new associates styled it ? with drums beating and banners flying , bade adieu to the defenses of Washington and took the road to the North . In a little more than a month afterwards , it reached the Rappahannock on its southward march from Pennsylvania ; but in the meantime it had left in Northern graves and hospitals more than two thirds of its effective force .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
