THERE is , I am per-suaded , a tendency in many of us to reckon too absorbedly our own difficulties and to give but scant regard to the difficulties of others . This I have observed frequently , not i only in our associations with those of our own kind , but very especially in our relations with creatures we assume to be of a lower order than ourselves . I believe my own opportunity for observing the difficulties and disappoint-m.ents of certain members of the animal kingdom to have been somewhat excep-tional . It first came to me by way of residence ina very delightful house in . the country which it was my privilege to live . It is an old house , as age goes in America , eighty or more years having passed over the oldest of its low gables . Before we came to it the owner had not lived in it for many years . People had camped there from time to time ; it had served during one summer as sanctuary to some episcopal nuns who set up a chapel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vespers in and i out of its twilit chambers ; but they remained a short two months only and then went on again , they and their i chanted services , leaving it voiceless and tenantless ? tenantless , as to human kind . When we came to it there were many problems , difficult enough , certainly , to be met before the beautiful old rooms of pleasing and aristocratical proportions could be made comfortable and livable . Rut 1 know now that I reckoned these problems much too curiously and with too scant regard for the far greater difficul-ties our advent must have put upon all the shy creature folk who had up to that time found the old place convenient and habitable enough . In front of the house a wide brook brawls or pauses in little pools to med-itate under the hazel light of the birches and maples of a most lovely woodland . Into this woodland the long veranda , running the length of the house , faces directly . It is but a step , say , rather , the mere dip of a wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of those cornices and crevices of pillar and window-frame where nests may be built so commodiously , away from storm and uncertainty of many kinds ; so , too , it is but a step , or let us say a mere flying squirrel-leap from the drooping wood branches to the mossy veranda roof , and thence a swift squirrel-run of no distance at all , along the varied eaves , and tinder them where secret openings offer , and then but a flash of four-footed speed to the inviting safety and quiet of the old rafter attic ? an ideal place to raise baby squirrels . When we arrived that day the house was occupied , at its edges and corners , and even between its closed attic shutters , by birds of every householding and houseloving variety ; and in between its many walls , and in its upper rooms and closets and air-chambers and low , long attic , by squirrels and chipmunks ; and here , there , and everywhere , we soon learned , in all kinds of unobservable but plainly audible places , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the completeness of this occupancy , but looking back now with full knowledge , I have a sense of shame and crudeness as I think what our coming must have meant to all those many denizens of that long , rambling , quiet old mansion . I had then , it must be remembered , not a thought of them . We were reckoning so absorbedly our own discomforts of moving attendant on our arrival , that we gave not so much as a thought to their calamities of withdrawal . The birds were the first to go . I remember the frightened dart of one of them close to my face when I first stepped from the front hall onto the veranda . Such a frightened whirr and clipping and cutting of the air to get through it and away , as though a panic had seized her . And another on the branches just beyond the veranda , on her way , no doubt , back to her nest on the window-casing where now she dared not alight . Such incredulous flitting from branch to branch , such twitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the head , such bird exclamations ! Then she spread herwings and flew away , no doubt to circulate the news . What Huns and . Vandals threatened the country of her safety ! I think the first week , certainly the second , at most , saw all the birds gone . The squirrels and chipmunks , too , though they stayed on a trifle later , were not long in departing . There were councils and hurried scamperings , hushed pauses , and now and then ? when I got an actual glimpse of one of them ? an attitude of intent listening , a tiny paw held dangling in front of a visibly heating heart , then the quick , noiseless drop to all-fours , the drooped tail , the flash of speed , then the leap into leafy invisibility ? only the branches left swaying , remembering . We had an Irish cook , who called all this tribe ? red squirrels , gray squirrels , and chirunks ? indiscriminately , " the munks . ' " God bless us ! Look at the munks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She came to me the second morning , after what I take to have been a sleepless night : " Did you hear last night , mum ? ' T was a shame to any decent house . And but for it 's bein ' here in this heathen country , at the back of God 's field , and not a Christian locomotive to be had for miles , I 'd pack up and be gone before I 'd stand another night of their riotin ' ! I ca n't stand the rakish things , mum . " " What is it you can not stand ? " " The munks , mum ! " It was she , a devout daughter of the Church , who had said ' it . I made no amendment ; I only , I am sorry to say , offered her as consolation this : " Do n't worry about them . They will not stay now we are here . They will find other homes for themselves . " Yes , I said just that , and gave it to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those altogether shy denizens given to quick abdication . But the mice being , I take it , of a somewhat more reasoning and philosophical order , more inclined to treaty and capitulation , remained , after I know not what cautious considerations and watchful consultations among themselves . That these must have been sufficiently serious I am convinced , for we heard at first very little indeed of their doings ; as though they meant to wait and study this phenomenon of our usurpation before taking any risk with powers so unlikely and unknown . But as time passed , their attitude toward the heavens and their horoscope must have altered . Doubtless there was some hope matters were not so bad as the old and experienced among them had prophesied . Appropriately quiet in the day , in the night they began to dare and to recover what was , I suppose , some of their erstwhile freedom or old-time happiness . They began cautiously to come and go ; to advance creepingly ; to explore ; to inquire and pry ; to examine and study ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had a strange way of lying quiet at night ( of all times ! ) and pursuing their busy activities in the day , when all good mouse citizens were in bed and asleep ! Well , so far so good . Perhaps the mice set this down to a special providence . However that may be , it is certain they acted on the intelligence , for at night , having now become well informed as to our habits , they began to come and go , if still a little cautiously , yet with increasing freedom . I used to lie awake listening to them . One would scurry across the floor wildly , overhead , forget something and run back for it Another , carrying a burden , would in fright or haste drop it , scamper away as though terrified ( oh , good gracious ! ) ? and then would dare to go back for it , and roll it away soundingly into safety . I am inclined to think a certain pleasure was attendant on these dangers , and that among them , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay ; for there were among them now ? oh , bead-eyed , venturesome spirits ! ? certain delicate squeakings that had all the effect of laughter ; I could have sworn their feet tittered ; there was ? I do assure you I am speaking the truth ? something giggling in their gait . They were not . I am sure , without their Co ! chases and Cassandras ; but , despite these , they began ere Iong to have certain celebrations . Go to ! Let old White-Whiskers , who foretold calamity , take himself off and lie with his nose on his paws ! There are better things in the world than prudence ! Celebrations there certainly were , though of what exact kind I am unable to state ; weddings , very likely ; town meetings , it may be , with the ladies present and welcome ; picnics , in all probability ; and christenings , I lean to believe , at which I make little doubt they drank deliriously of dandelion wine . One must not - demand too curiously where they got it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well corked . I only know that circumstantial evidence is strongly in favor of the belief that they had it , and that in large quantities . How else is it conceivable they could so far forget our presence and their own risk ? For I heard them coming home late one night between the rafters , shortly before dawn , in an openly riotous manner . Prudence they had flung to the winds . Their behavior was wholly ramshackle and reckless . Such squeakings ! such tumblings and titterings and scramblings as could only have occurred among those totally oblivious to all danger ! Such a drunken dropping of acorns and other picnic viands ! with little shrieks from the ladies ! Too evidently they had determined to eat , drink and be merry , come what would . I could not help laughing myself with . them , yet I sobered , too , at such recklessness on their part . This was no mere indiscretion ; it was sheer folly . I have no way of knowing whether any Daniel rose to warn them . If so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or , it is possible , too , they had not the requisite education or conscience to enable them to read the moonlight on the rafter wall for writing of an ominous character . AND VICISSITUDES OF MICE 507 When I wakened in the morning not a sound nor evidence . Like Bottom , it seemed to me that I had had a most rare vision , for daylight had laid a hushing and dispersing hand on them also . Then suddenly I knew it all for reality . Not a beady eye among them , of course , that was not closed now ; in the day-time twilight of old rafters , all of them , without doubt , slept , dandelion deep , their noses and their whiskers on their tails . Meanwhile time and events went forward . Miss Layng , a North-of-Ireland woman who kept house for us , while I attended to the work required of me in my study , appeared before me with a white and sleepless face . Miss Layng had ominous colored hair , which she heaped each morning in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleness , and unalterable determination were composite . She stood before me now like an allegorical figure of " Justice , " or " Commerce , " or " Law , " bearing in one outheld hand a magenta " Dutchman 's head " cheese . " You heard them ? " She spoke with quiet severity . I looked inquiring , innocent . She disregarded this , as a person too much above a lie herself to recognize one . " I think we shall need six traps , at least . Cook says she will not stay unless they go . She says one ran across her face last night ! " ( Oh , the riotousness of them ! More than I had suspected ! ) At this moment the cook herself appeared , far less allegorical , comfortingly real , a lemon-squeezer in one hand : " Oh , mum , I ca n't be saying exactly whether it did or not . Maybe it did , belike it did n't . But they do get me that nervous with what they might do ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , solemnly . She turned the Holland cheese toward me . In its side was eaten what could only be called a cavern . She stood there exhibiting it , eloquent , without need of words . Meanwhile , my own mental processes were busy , delightedly . Of course , of course ! Here was a revelation and an accounting ! It was this , undoubtedly , that had been the occasion of so much merriment and wild celebration . And how altogether natural ! For days they had been fearful , and oppressed with dark anxiety . What harm might not such a race as ourselves bring them . Other powers had fled before us . They had remained ! But who dared tell the outcome ? Dark prophecies ! Somber forebodings ! Unthinkable possibilities ! And then ? then ? when the dark-minded and old among them pointed out optimism as the sheerest folly ? then came this proof of unlooked-for benevolence ! Age and pessimism received their due . Caution and timorousness were flung to the winds . Old wives and grandfathers were flouted and their cautiousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the victory were in the hands of the young , the optimistic , the full of faith ! Come , ladies ; come gentlemen ! Pay no heed to these pessi mistic aged people . Preserve your faith in life ! Here is good warrant ! Quick ! uncork the bottles ! Bring the baskets along ! This is a day for feasting , for feasting ! Look upon this magenta miracle of benevolence and be convinced . Life is kind ! Where is a man with heart and imagination so dead who would not understand , by the light of all this , why the night had seen such celebration ? How well understood now was the daring of the gentlemen , the almost hysterical gayety of the ladies ! Meanwhile Miss Layng waited . " I thought I would get six traps , but wished to speak of it first , otherwise you might wonder to see so many on the bill at the end of the month . " In this cryptic yet crystalline fashion the problem of their fate was presented to me . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the proper maintaining of an honorable household , the retaining of a housekeeper and a cook with all that this implied as to my own comfort , and ? a whole community of I know not how many fathers , mothers , children , stepchildren , brothers , half-brothers , uncles , aunts , cousins , first cousins once removed , prophets , sibyls , lawgivers . Need I say which I felt constrained to choose ? Six were caught the first night . Six the first night ! In the very midst of their rejoicings and the apparent favor of their divinity ? six ! What a subject for a rodent lEsehylus ! How they must have set themselves to ponder it ! How and by what neglect or unintentional disrespect had they offended the gods , who but a while before had shone so kind ? Six ! And , as in the reapings of war among ourselves , these were bound to have been the best and most adventurous spirits . I paused to look at only one of them . What a sleek and likely fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a father of a family he would have made , nay , perhaps was ! After that I asked Miss Layng to spare me all bulletins and statistics ; but by the frequency with which I came across her in the halls , or just emerging from closets , holding far from her between horrified fingers a small magenta trap rigged with wires and a dangling tail , T knew the number was large . I knew , too , by signs other and quite as authentic . The riotous junketings had indeed ceased . The community was without doubt sobered and , it may be , led to think of its sins , its gods having turned against it . There was less frolic and gladness in the world than there had been . I confess all this seemed to me a loss , or , more exactly , a kind of waste . The wiser and the brooding East does not throw such things away . Are there not many folk in India , of tawny skin and gentle eye , who regard the humbler orders as sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can not believe them to be a less destructive or garrulous race ! ) welcome to the temples ? There does not Kim 's sacred bull go about in the market streets and select the best vegetables for himself ? I was discontent with our order of things , not to say conscience-stricken , and thought much about it . How we patronize and humiliate and rout and exterminate these humbler folk , mused I. With how marked an arrogance we deal with them ! How we impose our morals upon them and bid them live up to our laws or be gone ! They must exist in the presence of a perpetual ultimatum . No court is held for their benefit ; no appeal possible save to mousetraps with their inevitable death penalty ; no more chance of getting their case fairly ON THE DISAPPOINTMENTS AND VICISSITUDES OF MICE 509 stated before us than before the Red Queen . Who ever listened to even their most able eloquent attorney ? " My lords , " he begins , with nervous whiskers , " the case of my client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six little ones at home , my lords , and not a mouthful to eat ! If this , my lords , if this be not ? " " Off with his head ! Sentence first " ( the inevitable sentence ! ) , " verdict af-terward ! " So we behave ourselves atrociously toward these who , though of a humbler order , are yet susceptible , I doubt not , of sensibilities and sorrows and enjoy-men ts . These things are disturbing to philosophy and troubling to the heart . How shall we with a conscience justify ourselves in the eyes of the animal creation ? Humbler folk than ourselves , yet I can not think that mice suffer by a comparison . I have attended to them with much speculative attention , and I have found them a peaceable people without malice . The worst offence that I have to record against them is the demolition of several fine hooks in my library , but it was done ( it is not fair to hide this testimony ) with the high intent of providing a comfortable nest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As much can not be said for the destruction of Louvain , for the shelling of Rheims . They have purloined my cheese and been sly as to my soap and tallow candles , but not , you will note , that they might grow disproportionately fat and sleek thereon ; no , nor for the sake of banking these riches to exchange them later for horseless carriages in which to loll lazily or to pursue madly some unwholesome excitement ; no , nor yet to lay such things by in hoards and stores in such a manner as to make it difficult or impossible for others to have the same pleasure as themselves . No ; they took only what hunger rendered legitimate , a few satisfying nibbles at the candle , then leaving it free , with a fine democracy , for the next man to take whatever was his need . Where shall you find me a millionaire , or even a moderately conscientious business man amongst us , with as generous ' and as democratic a tendency ? We who are so sharp with them , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thieved as little as they Nor have I ever , for all my listenings , been able to hear any quarrellings or recriminations amongst them . Solicitous cautions , dangerous adventure , frolickings and gigglings and squeaking laughter I have heard , but nothing to compare with our harshnesses , spoken and unspoken , nor do I believe them capable of our spites . I have met , as have most of us , with days of such from honorable men and women which I do not believe a mouse ? of a so much lower order ! ? would for a moment be capable of In the face of uncertainties and disappointments such as theirs , what would become , I wonder , of our philosophy ? Yet they would appear to maintain their gentleness unspoiled . We who take offence so readily ; would we not boast if we forgave a man seven times seven ! They , it would appear from easily collected data , do , in all likelihood , forgive seven hundred times seventy , and make no ado about it at all . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you another chance to be generous . I was sitting once in the library of the old house , to which I have alluded , reading . Stillness and the stars were out ; a fire burned on the hearth , for the night was cold . I read by the light of a lamp a book that I loved . At my feet slept Commodore , my collie , his pointed nose resting on his paws . On the rug by the fire was the old tortoise-shell cat , Lady Jane , a spoiled but endeared companion . Both had had their supper so bounteously that the dish of milk lay unemptied still on the hearth , and , like the Giant in the fairy tale , they slept " from repletion . " They slept and / read , and for comfort of mind and body you might have gone far that night to find three so content as we . And then presently I became aware of a little timorous shadow that was not a shadow , after all , but a tiny , tiny mouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - nor'west , sou ' - sou ' - east . It tasted the possible danger with its whiskers . It tasted again and made sure , delicately , like a connoisseur . Could the great adventure be risked ? I can give you no idea by what sensitive soundings and testings and deliberations and speculations it at last crept into the flickering firelight . I wish I could convey to you the delicacy of its behavior , manners to make those of Commodore and Lady Jane ( they with their sounding titles ! ) seem crude and greedy and plebeian . Its little pauses said , " May I ? " Its delicate deliberations conveyed , " If I am troubling no one ? " Its hesitations offered , " If I may be so bold ? " And then , after these preliminaries , it took its place how politely on the brim of the flat dish of milk and drank , and raised its head , and drank , paused and drank again , thankfully , daintily . Once I thought it offered a courteous toast to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept on ! Oh , if they had known ! Oh , the mews of disappointment and the terrible barkings and the Fi-fo-ftim there would have been ! But no , they slept OR , and at last , having supped but lightly , the little mouse took itself away , carrying with it neither money-bags nor marvelous hen , nor golden harp . A true story and a fairy tale all in one , if you like ? and without the questionable ethics of its more famous prototype . What do they make of life ? Their stoicism , their gentleness , their never-jaded curiosity perpetually tempt my speculation . That they are a people of vicissitudes and disappointments due largely to ourselves needs no arguing . What opinions have they of us ? What effect have our behaviors on them ? A consistently gentle people , they are treated with unvarying severity . What have they in lieu of logic to make life bearable ? And what reward is there for their virtues ? Or , are they too simple at heart , as yet , to ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence ? Is life that dear to them ? And what , in the way of religious speculation of a crude , early order , might they he supposed to entertain ? I would like to be delegated to investigate and report upon mouse mythology . I can hardly rid myself of the idea that in their present is , as it were , some dim glimmering of our own past . They seem to me testing the world as we ourselvesmust have done when we too were less established , when we also were in a position scarcely less precarious , eons before any written records were kept , long before man had learned to remember at will for the quick purposes of convenience and comparison ? in a dim , dim foretime when to us , in some early Caliban existence , the outward world was as Prospero , unaccountable , and possessed of strange whimsies and quick with unwarrantable revenges . " When a tree , " says Frazer , tracing in his Golden Bough the beginnings of mythology , " comes to be viewed no longer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its abode , which it can quit at pleasure , an important advance has been made in religious thought . Animism is passing into polytheism . " I can not help wondering from time to time , whimsically , whether those quiet denizens of that old house had made " an important advance in religious thought " ; was " animism , " with them , passing into polytheism " ? Were mousetraps deceptive and evil gods with ter-rible snapping jaws , or but the abodes of these evil deities ? And for philosophy and metaphysic , what had they ? In that dim attic world was this perhaps an entire people in its mythopceie age , their gods descending and ascending miraculously , leaving a magenta cheese as incontrovertible evidence , or as unaccountably visiting them with swift and crafty destruction ? I am inclined to think their world is a colored one , fertile in fables . It would not surprise me to find that a small wooden object , known to us of a different development as a mere " mouse-trap , " is to them some Dis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple personalities . That there are other gods besides ? the great and awful Cat , the less omnipresent but not less terrible Terrier ? I am not disposed to doubt ; nor do I think they lack the shining ones also , as quiet as the others are full of movement , as conducive to life and wellbeing as the others to death and destruction ? bright , effulgent ones of the godlike color of cheese , or silver sheen of tallow and paraffine ; and back of all these , it may be , some elder deitiesourselves ? the older gods with OlymON THE DISAPPOINTMENTS AND VICISSITUDES OF MICE 511 pian powers , who can establish earthquakes ; who can wipe away entire communities ; gods and goddesses whose heads are in the clouds , whose movements are terrific , who shake complete creation when they walk , and with unthinkable besoms sweep with horrible sweepings , and periodically visit the world with awful scourges and hellish visitations of order and cleanliness . I would not pretend to be acquainted with mouse literature , but I would venture a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Djinns , genii , and affrites ? can it be thought they lack them ? if the unaccountability of the world be , as it would seem to mc , the basis of all literature and the origin of all fable , philosophy , entertainment and speculation , can it be denied they have extraordinary inducement ? If our own world seems full of chance , and forever breaking away from bonds and Probabilities , I only ask you to compare it with theirs ! ? in which the unaccountable is the sole certainty they possess . I awoke one morning in the late fall , and began to dress , giving no thought whatever to them and their problems . When I came to put on my shoe , however , I could no longer ignore them . In the toe of it , stowed away safely , were three hickory-nuts ! Some sleek-coated citizen , with a winter house in mind , had wandered in those purlieus thinking to begin the arduous labor requisite to the building of a home suitable to the long , dark season nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , by a miraculous bounty , waived ! Mark you and observe ! Here was provided for him a home such as his best skill could never have contrived . A place how warm , how neat , how conformable ! That his acceptance was immediate was testified by his already accumulated stores . I paused and took them in my hand ; ? one , two , three . There was a saint , I am told , who allowed the birds to build in his two palms , and did not rise from his knees until the fledglings were ready to fly from the nest . Neither was I a saint nor could I afford such beneficence . I was pressed for time , as God 's saints , I believe , never are , and I needed my shoe . I slipped it on as I had slipped on its mate ; I tied its lace neatly , gave the bow an efficient pat . and walked away in it . It is true , I did put the three hickory-nuts on the bureau . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I never saw them again . Miss Layng , the terrible goddess of order , probably flung them out of the window with mutterings . But I ask you only to picture the romance and it may be the terror of the thing to the one who had laid such delightful plans , who had enjoyed such anticipations ! House , stores , hopes , social aggrandizement , everything ? gone ! carried off entire , by God knows what spirit ! and not so much as a vestige left to tell the tale ! I do not forget that it is the custom to speak of mice as destructive ; yet may it not be that we use that word concerning them , after ail , with something of a bias ? I picture one of them on his way to seek a few bits of newspaper for the lining of a nest , and I imagine him suddenly endowed with the ability to read the inky characters . He pauses in amaze . His eyes bulge and devour the news beadily . And what news it is ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since our great war 's beginning ; of aged innocent citizens shot , women violated , children sacrificed , cities destroyed ! His hand goes over his heart to quiet its violent beating . " Ah , what a race of gods they are ! " thinks he . Or , he reads this from a recent account of the bayonet practice at Plattsburg ? whatever " bayonet " may mean , and whatever " Plattsburg , " for these accessories of civilization lie ahead of him some eons . " Aim for the vitals , " he reads . " Do not fire until you feel your bayonet stick . Thus you will shatter the bone , and you can then withdraw the blade . At the same time , try to trip your enemy with your left foot , so that he will fall forward . " None of this is clear to him . This is the deportment , without doubt , of the immortal gods ! Fancy the consequences of kis . attempting to trip his enemy , the Mouse-trap , or the Cat , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are powers and potencies to which he can only look forward in dim futures , when the mouse tribe shall have attained , in eons hence , perhaps , to a higher order of being , and to these godlike practices . But that , however glorious , is but a far dream ! Meek and gentle and forgiving , in his inferiority , he lends himself devotedly once more to his labors , and nibbles the newspaper , carrying off small pieces of it very destructively to build that near-by nest in which soon are to be born tiny creatures as gentle and inferior and destructive as himself . To one who has studied mythology with a reverence for its revelations , it must often have seemed that man is kinder than his conception of the mighty powers that try him . Job would seem to be , rather than the Deity , the hero of Job 's tragical story ; and how much nobler , to cite a most obvious instance , is the ancient Greek than his deities . However impious this may appear to the pious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful as are our own gods ? Authority , Mammon , Sentiment , Public Opinion , Superstition , Fear ? and many as have been our sacrifices offered up to them , yet may it not be that humanity , frail , and so largely at their mercy , retains some sovereign nobilities still unvanquished by them ? Have not we like these gentle mouse denizens of whom I have spoken , had our own disappointments and vicissitudes ? Have not our conceptions of our duties and privileges and rights and gayeties been but poorly adjusted to those powers whose awful retributions we have tempted ? Yet I am inclined to hope that , notwithstanding all this , we shall still preserve some gentleness that can not be conquered ; some virtues which , let these terrible powers descend upon us as they will , can not be obliterated ; that we shall be , till the end , some thing better than our fate , something more kind than our destiny . I have but speculated widely concerning mouse mythology . Truth compels me to state it is to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can give you nothing authoritative as to their philosophy . But this I know : they have maintained their gentleness , and arc a reproach to those I take to be their gods . All else is but speculation and possibility , but this is the evidence of their lives . They are a meek and a forgiving people . Think only what they endure at our hands , who justly make so great a matter of a Belgium violated , and forget , in a god-like manner , when it so pleases us , a violated Congo , or a divided Persia , or a Poland outraged and cut to pieces , but not defended . How gentle , how consistent , how without spite , or grudge they remain toward those unalterably hostile to them . With what mildness not matched among us do they conduct themselves . How they preserve their cheerfulness , their good nature , their kindliness . Have you not heard with what gayety they roll hickory-nuts away ? Has your ear not witnessed their gigglings and rejoicings ? But their virtues go deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ail , that , however provident in other matters , they store up no malice , they preserve no hate . Of this I have had testimony . Once I lay ill in that house of which I have here written . I had been very wretched , but my physician , seated now by my bed , promised me I would soon be well . Then we spoke together as we were wont to do of matters of a philosophic kind , then paused . On the bed beside me was a tray bearing some invalid dainty , but untouched by me . At the bottom of my bed , on the footboard , was atinymouse . No ; itwasnotrhesame adventurous spirit who has visited the giant 's castle and drunk from the plate of milk ; this one was smaller and more slender . We did not speak . He came down cautiously , very gently , to the coverlet , then delicately up one fold , down another , pausing , listening , hesitating to take note ; pausing , waiting , foot delicately lifted , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very carefully about this , smelling and inspecting it ; yes , I would have sworn inspecting . It had every air of his wanting to know whether they had brought me the right and well-cooked food . He tasted nothing save a tiny crumb on the tray itself , and then , as though satisfied , was gone . I hoped for another visit , but waited for him in vain . He was a little fellow , sleek of skin , with a black , beady eye , and very delicate whiskers . I never saw a daintier foot .
