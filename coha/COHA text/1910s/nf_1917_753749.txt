I had the privilege of co-operating with him to a slight degree on that second edition , and was in consequence able to appreciate the tremendous amount of work he voluntarily took upon himself to do ; I say voluntarily , because his publishers , anxious to supply the strong demand for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little later I undertook to translate this second edition into English for Messrs . Bell &; Sons . Only a few months had elapsed , the tournaments at Petrograd , Chester , and Mannheim had taken place , several new discoveries had been made , and it is the greatest testimony to Edward Lasker 's indefatigable devotion to the Art of Chess that I am able to say that this is not a translation of the second edition , but of what is practically a new book . It contains a new preface , a chapter for beginners , a new introduction , new variations . Furthermore , a large number of new games have taken the place of old ones . I have no doubt that any chess player who will take the trouble to study CHESS STRATEGY will spend many a pleasurable hour . Incidentally new vistas will be opened to him , and his playing strength increased to a surprising degree . The author says in his preface that he appeals to the intelligence and not the memory of his readers . In my opinion , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment of position . Than the playing over of games contested by experts I can hardly imagine a greater or purer form of enjoyment . Yet I must at the outset sound a note of warning against its being done superficially , and with a feverish expectation of something happening . Every move or combination of moves should be carefully weighed , and the student should draw his own conclusions and compare them with what actually happens in the game under examination . This applies particularly to some of the critical positions set out in diagrams in the course of the exposition of the several games . The reader would derive the greatest possible benefit from a prolonged study of such positions before seeking to know how the games proceed . After having formed his own opinion about the merits of a particular position , he should compare the result with the sequel in the game in question , and thus find out where his judgment has been at fault . The deeper study of the theory of the openings is of course a necessity to the student who wishes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must precede it . To him Griffith &; White 's admirable book , Modem Chess Openings , will be a perfect mine of information . There are thousands of variations , and in most of them the actual game in which they were first tried by masters is named , thus adding to the interest and value of the work . I must not omit to mention the invaluable help afforded me by my friend Mr. John Hart , to whom my warmest thanks are due . @# JULIUS DU MONT . @# AUTHOR 'S PREFACE @# THE large majority of chess players who would like to improve their game , have not the necessary opportunity of pitting themselves against players of master-strength , or at least of obtaining the desired instruction from personal intercourse with them . It is for such players that the present work is intended . The books on which the learner has to rely hardly ever serve his purpose , being mostly little more than a disjointed tabulation of numberless opening variations , which can not be understood without preliminary studies , and consequently only make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various lines of play may become clear , after the student has made an exhaustive study of the subject , but very few would have either the time or the inclination for such prolonged labour . Therefore another shorter and less empirical way must be found in which to acquire the understanding of sound play . My system of teaching differs from the usual ones , in that it sets down at the outset definite elementary principles of chess strategy by which any move can be gauged at its true value , thus enabling the learner to form his own judgment as to the manoeuvres under consideration . In my opinion it is absolutely ESSENTIAL to follow such strategical principles , and I go so far as to assert that such principles are in themselves SUFFICIENT for the development and conduct of a correct game of chess . Even though instruction in chess is possible on very general lines alone , yet I think it advisable and indeed necessary to explain the application of such principles to the various phases of each game of chess . Otherwise the learner might unduly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for himself certain essentials that could more profitably be pointed out to him . With regard to the way in which I have arranged my subject and the form of its exposition in detail , I have thought out the following plan . After discussing at length the leading principles underlying sound play , I have first treated of the OPENINGS , in which such principles are of even more deciding influence than in any other stage of the game , as far as could be done on broad lines without having to pay attention to middle and end-game considerations . I proceeded as follows , by taking as my starting-point the " pawn skeleton " which is formed in the opening , and round which the pieces should group themselves in logical fashion . As a consequence of the pawns having so little mobility , this " pawn skeleton " often preserves its shape right into the end-game . Applying the general strategical principles to the formation of the pawn skeleton , the learner acquires the understanding of the leading idea underlying each opening without having to burden his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to find a correct plan of development when confronted with unusual forms of opening . The most important result of this system of teaching is that the learner does not lose his way in a maze of detail , but has in view at the very outset , the goal which the many possible variations of the openings are intended to reach . Before I could proceed to the discussion of the middle game , I found it necessary to treat of the principles governing the END-GAME . For in most cases play in the middle game is influenced by end-game considerations . Here also it has been my endeavour as far as possible to reduce my subject to such principles as are generally applicable . Finally , as regards the MIDDLE GAME , to which the whole of Part II is devoted , I have again made the handling of pawns , the hardest of all problems of strategy , the starting-point for my deliberations . I have shown at length how the various plans initiated by the various openings should be developed further . To ensure a thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of games taken from master play , with numerous and extensive notes . Thus the student has not to rely only on examples taken haphazard from their context , but he will at the same time see how middle-game positions , which give opportunities for special forms of attack , are evolved from the opening . It has been my desire to make the subject easily understandable and at the same time entertaining , and to appeal less to the memory of my readers than to their common sense and intelligence . I hope in that way not to have strayed too far from the ideal I had in mind when writing this book , namely , to apply to chess the only method of teaching which has proved productive in all branches of science and art , that is , the education of individual thought . If I have succeeded in this , I shall have the satisfaction of having contributed a little to the furthering , in the wide circles in which it is played , of the game which undoubtedly makes the strongest appeal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I INTRODUCTORY @# I. RULES OF THE GAME @# A GAME of chess is played by two opponents on a square board consisting of sixty-four White and Black squares arranged alternately . The forces on each side comprise sixteen units , namely a King , a Queen , two Rooks , two Bishops , two Knights , and eight Pawns . All units move according to different laws , and the difference in their mobility is the criterion of their relative value and of the fighting power they contribute towards achieving the ultimate aim , namely , the capture of the opposing King . Before I can explain what is meant by the capture of the King , I must set out the rules of the game in full . Diagram 1 shows the position the forces take up for the contest . The board is so placed that there is a white square at the top left-hand corner . The Rooks take up their positions at the corner squares , and next to them the Knights . Next to those again are the Bishops , and in the centre the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square , and the Black Queen on a Black square . The eight pawns occupy the ranks immediately in front of the pieces . From this initial position , White begins the game in which the players must move alternately . The pieces move in the following way : The Rook can move from any square it happens to be on , to any other square which it can reach in a straight line , either perpendicularly or horizontally , unless there is another piece of the same colour in the way , in which case it can only move as far as the square immediately in front of that piece . If it is an opposing piece which blocks the way , he can move on to the square that piece occupies , thereby capturing it . The piece thus captured is removed from the board . The Bishop can operate along either of the diagonals of which the square on which he is standing forms part . A Bishop on a White square can there fore never get on to a Black one .  --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #Kt #B #Q #K #B #Kt #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #P #P #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Kt B Q K B Kt R  --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --  - a b c d e f g h DIAG. 1 . The Queen commands both the straight and the oblique lines which start from the square she stands on , and therefore unites the power of both Rook and Bishop in her movements . The King has similar powers to the Queen , but curtailed , inasmuch as he can only move one step at a time . He therefore only controls one neighbouring square in any direction . The Knight plays and captures alternately on White and Black squares , and only reaches such squares as are nearest to him without being immediately adjacent ; his move is as it were composed of two steps , one square in a straight line , and one in an oblique direction . Diagram 2 will illustrate this . Footnote : I should like to quote my friend Mr. John Hart 's clever definition of the Knight 's move , though it may not be new . If one conceives a Knight as standing on a corner square of a rectangle three squares by two , he is able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only move straight forward , one square at a time , except at their first move , when they have the option of moving two squares . In contrast to the pieces , the pawns do not capture in the way they move . They move straight forward , but they capture diagonally to the right and left , again only one square , and only forward . Therefore a pawn can only capture such pieces or pawns as occupy squares of the same colour as the square on which it stands . If , in moving two squares , a pawn traverses a square on which it could have been captured by a hostile pawn , that pawn has the right to capture it , as if it had moved only one square . This is called capturing EN PASSANT . However , this capture can only be effected on the very next move , otherwise the privilege of capturing en passant is lost .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8  --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --  - 7  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 * *  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 * *  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 * *  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 * *  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 2 . If a player succeeds in reaching the eighth rank with one of his pawns he is entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception of the King , in place of such pawn . Each move in a game of chess consists of the displacement of one piece only , with the exception of what is termed " castling , " in which the King and either Rook can be moved simultaneously by either player once in a game . In castling , the King moves sideways to the next square but one , and the Rook to which the King is moved is placed on the square which the King has skipped over . Castling is only allowed if neither the King nor the Rook concerned have moved before , and if there is no piece between the Rook and King . Diagram 3 shows a position in which White has castled on the Queen 's side , and Black on the King 's side . Castling is not permitted if the King in castling must pass over a square attacked by a hostile piece . A square ( or a piece ) is said to be " attacked " when the square ( or the piece ) is in the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece ) is said to be covered or protected if an opposing piece occupying that square ( or capturing the piece ) could itself be captured . When attacking the King it is customary to call " check , " to notify the opponent of the fact ; for the attack on the King  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 K R R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 3. must be met in some way or other . This can be done by capturing the attacker or by interposing a piece ( this is not possible in case of attack by a Knight or a pawn ) , or lastly by moving the King to a square which is not attacked . The latter must not be done by castling . If it is impossible by any of the three methods above mentioned to avoid the attack upon the King , the King is said to be checkmated , and the game is ended . If a King is unable to move , though not attacked , and none of his remaining pieces can move , the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn . A game is also drawn when neither side has sufficient material left to enforce a mate . ( Compare page 63 . ) If a player resigns his game before he is actually mated , he acknowledges that in the end mate is unavoidable , and the game is counted as a loss to him . A game is null and void if it is shown that a mistake was made in setting the board or men . The same applies when in the course of the game the position and number of pieces have been altered in a manner not in accordance with the proper course of play , and the latter can not be re-constructed from the point where the error was made . If a player having the move touches one of his pieces he is under compulsion to move it ; if he touches a hostile piece he must capture it , provided that the piece can be properly moved or captured in either case . This rule is of no effect if the piece so touched can not be moved or captured , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not left the piece to be moved , the latter can be placed on any accessible square . If a player touches a piece with the sole object of adjusting its position , he must apprise his opponent of his intention by saying " J'adoube " beforehand . It is best to move the King first when castling . If the Rook is moved first , and unless the King is played almost simultaneously , a doubt might arise whether castling or a Rook 's move only was intended . If a player has castled illegally , Rook and King must be moved back , and the King must make another move , if there is a legal one . If not , any other move can be played . A player who makes an illegal move with a piece must retract that move , and make another one if possible with the same piece . If the mistake is only noticed later on , the game should be restarted from the position in which the error occurred . @# II . NOTATION @# A special notation has been adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is necessary for students of the game to become thoroughly conversant with it . The original and earliest notation is still in use in English , French , and Spanish speaking countries . It is derived from the original position in the game , in that the squares take the names of the pieces which occupy them . Thus the corner squares are called R 1 ( Rook 's square or Rook 's first ) , and to distinguish them from one another QR1 or KR 1 ( Queen 's or King 's Rook 's square ) . The squares immediately in front are called QR2 or KR2 . A distinction is made between White and Black , and White 's R 1 is Black 's R 8 , Black 's R 2 is White 's R 7 , White 's K B 3 is Black 's KB6 , and so on . K stands for King ; Q for Queen ; B for Bishop ; Kt for Knight ; R for Rook ; and P for Pawn . In describing a capture , only the capturing and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When confusion is possible , it is customary to add whether King 's side or Queen 's side pieces are concerned , e.g. KRx Q Kt . In this notation it is necessary to bear in mind which Kt is the Q Kt , which R is the KR . This becomes increasingly difficult as the game goes on and pieces change their places . Many sets of chessmen have one Rook and one Knight stamped with a special sign , to show they are King 's side pieces . This is not necessary in the case of Bishops : a white KBis always on white squares , a white QBon black squares . A more modern notation is the algebraic notation , which has been adopted in most countries . It has the advantage of being unmistakably clear , and also more concise . Here the perpendicular lines of squares ( called files ) are named with the letters a-h , from left to right , always from the point of view of White , and the horizontal lines of squares ( called ranks ) with numbers 1-8 as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White pieces stand is always called the first ; thus the square we named White 's QB2 or Black 's QB7 is now called c2 in both cases . Black 's QB2 ( White 's QB7 ) is always c7 . In capturing , the square on which the capture takes place and not the piece captured is noted , for the sake of uniformity . In the case of pawn moves , the squares only are noted . O  --  O stands for castles on the King 's side ; O  --  O  --  O stands for castles on the Queen 's side ; : or x stands for captures ; + for check . In the following opening moves , both notations are used for the purpose of comparison : 1 . P-Q 4 P-Q4 1 . d4 d5 2 . P-QB4 P-K3 2. c4 e6 3 . Kt-QB3 P-QB4 3 . Ktc3 c5 4 . PxQP KPxP 4. cd : ed : 5 .

K V B F H O-O ( O ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE mental development of the chess player is a gradual struggle from a state of chaos to a clear conception of the game . The period required for such development largely depends upon the special gifts the learner may possess , but in the main the question of methods predominates . Most beginners do not trouble very much about any particular plan in their study of chess , but as soon as they have learnt the moves , rush into the turmoil of practical play . It is self-evident that their prospects under such conditions can not be very bright . The play of a beginner is planless , because he has too many plans , and the capacity for subordinating all his combinations to one leading idea is non-existent . Yet it can not be denied upon investigation that a certain kind of method is to be found in the play of all beginners , and seems to come to them quite naturally . At first the pawns are pushed forward frantically , because there is no appreciation of the power and value of the pieces . Conscious of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it must be advantageous to employ the greater power of the pieces , but is chiefly concerned with attacking the opposing pieces with his pawns in the hope of capturing them . His aim is not to develop his own forces , but to weaken those of his opponent . His combinations are made in the hope that his adversary may not see through them , nor does he trouble much about his opponent 's intentions . When most of his pawns are gone , then only do his pieces get their chance . He has a great liking for the Queen and the Knight , the former because of her tremendous mobility , the latter on account of his peculiar step , which seems particularly adapted to take the enemy by surprise . When watching beginners you will frequently observe numberless moves by a peripatetic Queen , reckless incursions by a Knight into the enemy 's camp , and when the other pieces join in the fray , combination follows combination in bewildering sequence and fantastic chaos . Captures of pieces are planned , mating nets are woven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where five pieces are available for defence . This unsteadiness in the first childish stages of development makes it very difficult for the beginner to get a general view of the board . Yet the surprises which each move brings afford him great enjoyment . A few dozen such games are by no means wasted . After certain particular dispositions of pieces have proved his undoing , the beginner will develop the perception of threats . He sees dangers one or two moves ahead , and thereby reaches the second stage in his development . His combinations will become more and more sound , he will learn to value his forces more correctly , and therefore to husband his pieces and even his pawns with greater care . In this second stage his strength will increase steadily , but , and this is the drawback , only as far as his power of combination is concerned . Unless a player be exceptionally gifted , he will only learn after years of practice , if at all , what may be termed " positional play . " For that , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to lay the foundation for a favourable middle game , and how to treat a middle game , without losing sight of the possibilities of the end-game . It is hopeless to try to memorise the various openings which analysis have proved correct , for this empirical method fails as soon as the opponent swerves from the recognised lines of play . One must learn to recognise the characteristics of sound play . They apply to all and any position , and the underlying principles must be propounded in a manner generally applicable . And this brings me to the substance of my subject , round which I will endeavour to build up a system compatible with common sense and logic . Before I proceed to develop my theme , I shall set down a number of elementary rules which will facilitate the understanding of such simple combinations as occur at every step in chess . If we ignore the comparatively small proportion of games in which the mating of the opponent 's King is accomplished on a full board , we can describe a normal , average game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their available forces more or less advantageously to execute attacking and defensive manoeuvres which should gradually lead to exchanges . If one side or the other emerges from the conflict with some material gain , it will generally be possible to force a mate in the end-game , whilst if both sides have succeeded by careful play to preserve equality of material , a draw will generally ensue . It will be found a little later that a single pawn may suffice , with some few exceptions , to achieve a victory , and we shall adopt the following leading principle for all combinations , viz. loss of material must be avoided , even if only a pawn . It is a good habit to look upon every pawn as a prospective Queen . This has a sobering influence on premature and impetuous plans of attack . On the other hand , victory is often brought about by a timely sacrifice of material . But in such cases the sacrificing of material has its compensation in some particular advantage of position . As principles of position are difficult for beginners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present and to devote my attention first to such combinations as involve questions of material . Let us master a simple device that makes most combinations easy both for attack and defence . It amounts merely to a matter of elementary arithmetic , and if the beginner neglects it , he will soon be at a material disadvantage . Diagram 4 may serve as an example :  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #Q #Kt #R #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #Kt #B #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P  --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --  - 3 P Kt Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P B Q R P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 4 .

Therefore I can play P-K4 , provided the six units captured at K4 are not of greater value than the six white units which are recaptured . In the present instance both sides lose a pawn , two Knights , two Rooks , and a Bishop , and there is no material loss . This established , he can embark on the advance of the KP without any fear . Therefore : in any combination which includes a number of exchanges on one square , all you have to do is to count the number of attacking and defending units , and to compare their relative values ; the latter must never be forgotten . If Black were to play KtxP in the following position , because the pawn at K 5 is attacked three times , and only supported twice , it would be an obvious miscalculation , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It is difficult to compare the relative value of the different pieces , as so much depends on the peculiarities of each position , but , generally speaking , minor pieces , Bishop and Knight , are reckoned as equal ; the Rook as equal to a minor piece and one or two pawns ( to have a Rook against a minor piece , is to be the " exchange " ahead ) . The Queen is equal to two Rooks or three minor pieces.  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #R #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #Kt #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P B P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 5 . Chess would be an easy game if all combinations could be tested and probed exhaustively by the mathematical process just shown . But we shall find that the complications met with are extremely varied . To give the beginner an idea of this , I will mention a few of the more frequent examples .

Neither can the Bishop capture on K5 because of R X Kt. leaving the Bishop unprotected , after which BxKt does not retrieve the situation because the Rook recaptures from B6 . A second important case , in which our simple calculation is of no avail , occurs in a position where one of the defending pieces is forced away by a threat , the evasion of which is more important than the capture of the unit it defends . In Diagram 7 , for instance , Black may not play KtxP , because White , by playing P-Q6 , would force the Bishop to Kt4 or B1 , to prevent the pawn from Queening and the Knight would be lost . A further example of the same type is given in Diagram 8 . Here a peculiar mating threat , which occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #B #Q #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #Kt #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 R Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 Q  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G H Diag. 8. infrequently in practical play , keeps the Black Queen tied to her KB2 and unavailable for the protection of the B at BI . White wins as follows : 1 . KtxB , KtxKt ; 2 . RxKt , QxR ; 3 . Kt-B7ch , K-Kt1 ; 4 . Kt-R6 double ch , K-R1 ; 5 Q-Kt8ch , RxQ ; 6 . Kt-B7 mate . We will now go a step further and turn from " acute " combinations to such combinations as are , as it were , impending . Here , too , I urgently recommend beginners ( advanced players do it as a matter of course ) to proceed by way of simple arithmetical calculations , but , instead of enumerating the attacking and defending pieces , to count the number of possibilities of attack and defence . Let us consider a few typical examples . In Diagram 9 , if Black plays P-Q5 , he must first have probed the position in the following way . The pawn at Q5 is attacked once and supported once to start with , and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 . R-Q1 , 2 . R(B2)-Q2 , 3 . B-B2 ) Black can also mobilise three more units for the defence in the same number of moves ( 1 . Kt-B4 or K3 , 2 . B-Kt2 , 3 . R-Q1 ) . There is , consequently , no immediate danger , nor is there anything to fear for some time to come , as White has no other piece which could attack the pawn for the fifth time .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #B #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #R #Kt #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P Kt P B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 R P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 9 . It would be obviously wrong to move the pawn to Q6 after White 's R-Q1 , because White could bring another two pieces to bear on the P , the other Rook and the Knight , whilst Black has only one more piece available for the defence , namely , his Rook . The following examples show typical positions , in which simple calculation is complicated by side issues . In Diagram 10 , the point of attack , namely , the Black Knight at KB3 , can be supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack , but the defensive efficiency of one of Black 's pieces is illusory , because it can be taken by a White piece . The plan would be as follows : White threatens Black 's Knight for the third time with Kt-K4 , and Black must reply QKt-Q2 , because covering with R-K3 would cost the " exchange , " as will appear from a comparison of the value of the pieces concerned . The " exchange " is , however , lost for Black on the next move , because  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #Kt #B #Q #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #B #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #P #Kt #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 B P Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Q R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 10 White 's further attack on the Knight by Q-B3 forces the Rook to defend on K3 , where it gets into the diagonal of the Bishop , which at present is masked by White 's Knight .

Beginners should devote special attention to this position , which is in practice of frequent occurrence . It can be easily perceived that the Bishop can not capture the pawn at B7 on account of P-QR3 . But to take with the Knight would also be an error , because Black would then keep chasing away the covering Bishop . 1 . P-Kt4 ; 2 . B-Q6 , K-B3 ; 3 . Kt-K8 , B-B2 ; and wins one of the pieces . Finally , one more example , in which one of the defending pieces being pinned makes simple calculation impracticable . In Diagram 12 it seems at first sight as if Black could play KtxP : although White can pin the Knight with R-K1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #B #K #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 #P #P #Kt #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Kt R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 12 and then attack it once more with his Knight , Black would appear to have sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to double Rooks , because if he does so , after his R-K2 Black would play the King away from his file and allow the Knight to escape . But White can , by a simple sacrifice , bring the slumbering R at R1 into sudden action : 1 . ... KtxP ; 2 R-K1 , B-B4 ; 3 . Kt-B3 , Kt-Q3 ; 4 . RxKt , KtxR ; 5 . R-K1 , and White wins two pieces for his Rook . These illustrations will be sufficient to give the beginner an understanding of economy of calculation in all kinds of combinations . His power of combining will grow speedily on this basis , and thrive in the fire of practical experience . Where an opponent is missing , the gap must be filled by reference to such books as treat of the science of combination and give examples taken from actual play . @# CHAPTER III GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CHESS STRATEGY @# In bringing the teachings of this book under the collective heading " Chess Strategy , " it was not in any way my intention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chess-board and military operations in actual warfare . In trying to seek such analogies there is great danger of being led astray , and little likelihood of gaining knowledge that might be of use in practical play . Plain common-sense will give us all we need , without our being influenced by those tactical and strategical considerations that have been found useful in war . The following definition may not be out of place : Strategy sets down the whole of the problems which must be solved in war , in order to attain the ultimate result aimed at ; tactics solve such problems in various ways , and according to the conditions prevailing in the particular case . Sound strategy , when setting the task , must never lose sight of tactical practicability , and only a thorough knowledge of tactical resources makes correct strategy possible . Now we shall not under any circumstances , as unfortunately even great chess masters have done , seek in outward similarities justification for transferring to chess the teachings of the strategy and tactics of war . It sounds pretty enough to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces represent the various kinds of forces : the pawns represent the infantry , the Knights take the place of cavalry , the Rooks do the work of heavy artillery , sweeping broad lines ; the different ways in which the pieces move find a parallel in the topography of the theatre of war , in that the various battle-fields are more or less easy of access . But it is quite unjustifiable to assign to the Knights the functions of scouts , and to say that Rooks should stay in the background , as heavy artillery , and so on . Such pronouncements would not have the slightest practical value . What we take from the science of warfare is merely the definition . In each game the strategy of chess should set us the tasks which must be accomplished ( in order to mate the opponent 's King ) , and tactics point the way in which it is possible to solve such problems . Correct chess strategy will only set such tasks as are tactically possible , and , if we wish to expound the principles of chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of our observations . If here and there the results of our deliberations bear some analogy to actual warfare , we may certainly give way to a kind of aesthetic satisfaction in that our own occupation has some parallel in real life , but we must never fashion our principles in accordance with such fortuitous circumstances . Having surveyed the problems we have to solve , we can now plunge into our subject . In the first chapter , when considering special cases in elementary combinations , we have already noticed the important part played in each skirmish by the balance between the attacking and defending units . Speaking quite generally , common-sense will tell us that , in all operations on the chess-board , the main consideration for the defence will be to maintain that balance , and that there is only justification for an attack when it is possible to concentrate more forces on the strategic point than can be mustered by the defence . However , one very important point must not be neglected , though I did not touch upon it when discussing elementary combinations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contending forces is by no means established by their numerical equality . A paramount factor is the mobility of such forces , and as soon as it is no longer one of the elementary cases of capture and recapture described previously , this factor must be taken into account in order to decide , on a general survey , whether there is a sufficient defence to an impending attack , or whether one 's own intended attack is likely to prevail . That mobility is the first and foremost consideration should be self-evident , since the relative value of the pieces can only make itself felt by their greater or lesser mobility . Except in certain positions , which are brought about by some particular array of the pieces , the intrinsic value of a Rook is greater than that of a Bishop , because it can command all the squares on the board , whilst a Bishop is tied to its own colour ; Knight and Bishop are considered equivalent , because the Knight 's advantage in being able to act on all the squares of either colour is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagonals . Two Bishops are , generally speaking , of greater value than two Knights , because together they also act on all the squares , and their command of long diagonals is a clear advantage . The whole of this valuation , however , comes to nought when the pieces are hindered in their mobility by the peculiarity of any particular position .

In Diagram 14 , the numerical equality of forces will not save Black , because bad development reduces the mobility of his pieces to such an extent that he has no resources with which he can parry the impending attack .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #K #R #B #R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #B #Q #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #P #P #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P Kt B Kt P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P Q P K P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Queen side , and Black is unable to concentrate his forces quickly enough for the defence of the jeopardised entrenchments . Let us therefore bear in mind that the mobility of the pieces is the deciding factor of their efficiency , and that mobility is the highest criterion by which to judge the merits ( or demerits ) of their operations . We will now consider this principle in its application to the three stages of play , namely , the opening , the middle-game , and the ending . @# CHAPTER IV THE OPENING @# The only pieces available on the first move are the Knights . In order to develop other pieces as well , it is necessary to move pawns first , and such pawn moves will be best as give an outlet to as many pieces as possible . For quick development is of the utmost importance , and he who succeeds first in placing all his pieces , from their initial awkward positions , to such places as give them command of the greatest possible number of squares , has the better chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows that White , having the first move , is , so to speak , always morally justified in attacking , whilst Black should assume the defensive . It is a step in the right direction , to appreciate the truth of this proposition . Unfortunately most beginners fail to realise it , and so pave the way , from the first , to the loss of the game . There are not many developing pawn moves to choose from . Apparently from the point of view of quick development only P-K4 and P-Q4 need be considered , since they free both Bishop and Queen , whilst other pawn moves liberate one piece only . Generally speaking it is only required to move two or three pawns to allow all pieces to be developed , and it is good , on principle , to make only such pawn moves in the opening , which are necessary for the development of pieces . To play other pawns really means the loss of a move . To " lose a move " means to make a move which is not essential to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a move " results also from playing a piece to a given square in more moves than necessary . I shall now give a few games showing the far-reaching consequences of losing moves . The first one is a typical though glaring example , which is very instructive and came to my notice some time ago : 1 . P-K4 P-K4 2 . P-Q4 PxP 3 . QxP Kt-QB3 4 . Q-K3 Kt-B3 5 . P-KR3 ? I will not discuss the system of development adopted by White in his first four moves . The last move , however , can at once be recognised as faulty . It is the loss of a move such as occurs in the vast majority of games played by beginners . It was unnecessary to prevent KKt-Kt5 , since the Knight could not hold that square permanently . In any case B-K2 would have had the same effect , and developed a piece at the same time . 5 . ... B-K2 6 . P-QR3 ? ? This , of course , is very bad . The consequences of this loss of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castles 7 . B-B4 At last a developing move . 7 . ... R-K1 8 . Q-QKt3 Another Queen 's move . The attack on the Bishop 's Pawn may be very tempting , but must necessarily be incorrect  --  and why ? Because White is much behind with his development . It is useless to analyse any kind of attack in face of this fact . The beginner finds it hard to get used to this way of thinking . He prefers to try to unravel a long string of variations and combinations , in which he will mostly lose his bearings . Even stronger players obstruct their own powers by refusing to see the value of judging a position on general merits . They lose valuable time in thinking out endless variations , to maintain positions which could be proved valueless by general and logical deductions.  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #B #Q #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #Kt #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 B P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P Q P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Kt B K Kt R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 15 Then , as in the present position , retribution comes swiftly . 8 . ... P-Q4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the opening of the K file for the Rook is most dangerous , for the White King . 9 . BxP KtxB Black could have played QxB at once . 10 . QxKt QxQ 11 . PxQ B-Kt5 double ch 12 . K-Q1 R-K8 mate A further example in which the loss of moves occurs , though not so glaringly , is the following famous game , which Morphy played against the Duke Karl of Brunswick and Count Isouard in the Royal box at the Paris opera-house. 1 . P-K4 P-K4 2 . Kt-KB3 P-Q3 According to the principles set out above , Kt-QB3 would have been better , since the text move shuts out the King 's Bishop . 3 . P-Q4 Now the King 's Pawn is attacked twice . It would be bad to support it with Kt-QB3 , as White would exchange pawns and then Queens . Black would thus forfeit his chance of castling and lose much time in bringing the King into safety and the Rooks into play . P-KB3 , of course , is impossible , as it is not a developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's Knight . Protecting the pawn with the Queen would also block other pieces , and QKt-Q2 can not be good , as it blocks the Queen 's Bishop . Since it seems impossible to protect the King 's Pawn , the only alternative would be to exchange it ; indeed it is on the whole the best course , although it allows a White piece to take up a dominating position in the centre . Wishing to avoid this , Black plays 3 . ... B-Kt5 and , by pinning the opponent 's Knight , indirectly protects the King 's Pawn . This manoeuvre is , however , ill-advised , as Black is forced to exchange the Bishop for the Knight . The Bishop will have moved twice , the Knight only once , therefore White will have gained a move for his development . 4 . PxP BxKt Should Black play PxP at once , White would exchange Queens , release the pin , and win the pawn . 5 . QxB PxP 6 . B-QB4 White has now two pieces more in play than Black , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen , which Black himself has brought out , begins to have a threatening effect on Black 's game . 6 . ... Kt-KB3 7 . Q-QKt3 Q-K2 Black can not cover his King 's Bishop 's Pawn with Q-Q2 because 8 . QxP wins the Rook , whilst now Black could play 8 . ... Q-Kt5ch in reply , forcing the exchange of Queens . The text move , which is forced , blocks the Bishop , and at the same time prevents the development of the King 's Rook , all of which is the direct consequence of the loss of one move . 8 . Kt-B3 White rightly disdains the gain of the Knight 's Pawn , but prevents the exchange of Queens in developing a piece . He proves the superiority of his position much more convincingly in that way . Black must now lose yet another move to protect his Knight 's Pawn . 8 . ... P-B3 9 . B-KKt5 P-Kt4 Black must try to develop his Queen 's Knight at last . He can not play QKt-Q2 at once , since his Knight 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in the text , probably thinking that now White also must lose a move to withdraw his Bishop . But in view of the fact that Black 's game is wholly undeveloped , and that he plays practically several pieces down , White sacrifices his Knight for two pawns : he foresees the position which occurs a few moves later , when Black is hemmed in on all sides . 10 . KtxP PxKt 11 . BxKtPch QKt-Q2 12 . Castles QR R-Q1 This is the only piece available to cover Q2 , for the King 's Knight is pinned . White has another piece in reserve , his King 's Rook , and against this Black is defenceless. @#  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #K #B #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #Kt #Q #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 B #P B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 Q  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 K R R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 16 @# 13 .

" This is the curse of every evil deed That propagating still it brings forth evil . " The logical sequence of the moves in this game , as pointed out in the commentaries to it , is borne out by the curious coincidence that I once had the opportunity of playing a game in exactly the same sequence of moves , against a player to whom Morphy 's " brilliancy " was unknown .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  The leading principle of all opening moves is made clear by the foregoing pages , namely , rapid development of pieces , and consequently the avoidance of the loss of a move in any shape or form . Before treating of the various systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of PAWN PLAY . Each opening is characterised by a well-defined pawn formation , and concurrently a certain method in the development of the pieces . Naturally the formation of a pawn skeleton is not an independent factor , but must be evolved with a view to facilitating the favourable development of pieces . But when considering the form of a pawn position and that of the pieces , we can not shut our eyes to the fact that pawn formation must necessarily be the dominant consideration in our mind . Pawn formation is of a more permanent character than that of the pieces , in consequence of the latter 's greater mobility . When we have made a rash move with a piece , to which our attacking disposition may have tempted us , we may still have a chance of retrieving the position by timely retreat . Once a pawn has moved it can not turn back , and only after the greatest deliberation should we embark on changes in our pawn formation in order not to disturb the balance of this " static element " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeleton which was formed in the opening often weathers the storm and stress of the middle game , and frequently preserves its character right up to the end-game . I will therefore make pawn formation my starting-point in an attempt to show the way through the maze of the openings on the basis of general strategical principles . If our pawn skeleton is to promote the freedom of all the pieces , we must not build it up with the narrow view of developing minor pieces only , but must consider from the very first in which way it will enable the Rooks to get into action . We can unite these tendencies in making the CENTRE OF THE BOARD the main field of action for all our forces . This means for both sides K4 and Q4 , and also in a lesser degree QB4 and KB4 . We shall get a clear insight into the positional advantage of having command of the centre later on , when discussing the middle game . At present I will only touch the subject in a general way , explaining it in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding for pawn strategy in the opening . In the course of further deductions , after the grasp of this difficult stage of the game has become stronger , I will go into details which will allow the subject to be stated in a more precise form . Placing the pieces in the centre is of value , because there they have more mobility than near the edge , which , of course , limits their range of action , and also because from the centre a concentration of forces on a given point can generally be effected in the quickest way . In most cases two centre squares become inaccessible at once , through the opponent placing one of his pawns in the centre ; therefore it would seem a good plan to lure that pawn away , and this is rendered feasible by playing P-K4 or P-QB4 when the opponent has a pawn on his Q4 , and P-Q4 or P-KB4 when he has a pawn on K4 . In the following we will consider such manoeuvres as could apply either to White or Black , from the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as pointed out above , a sort of birth-right . Naturally , should White lose a move , as , for instance , 1 . P-K4 , P-K4 ; 2 . Kt-KB3 , Kt-QB3 ; 3 . P-QR3 ? the position is reversed , and Black is bound to obtain the initiative which is White 's birthright . The pawn moves mentioned above also have the tendency of giving the Rooks an opportunity for action . A Rook standing behind an advanced pawn may support its further advance , or , if the pawn should be exchanged , might get an open file . The damage we wish to inflict on our opponent we must , of course , try to avoid ourselves . Thus we will not easily give up a centre pawn unless we can obtain some other advantage in doing so . This advantage may be , that in exchanging the centre pawn we open up lines of attack for our pieces , or that we are able to place one of our pieces in a commanding position in the centre of the board . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 1 . P-Q4 P-Q4 2 . P-QB4 His aim is to tempt Black 's centre pawn away and to make his QB4 and K4 accessible for his own forces . Black might be justified in taking the pawn , if he really could hold the pawn thus gained . We shall show later on that this is not so , and that White can win it back easily and advantageously . Therefore Black is more likely to play 2 . P-K3 . Not 2 . ... Kt-KB3 ; for after 3 . PxP , KtxP ; 4 . P-K4 would open White 's game and drive the Knight away at once , gaining a move . Supposing , however , Black plays 2 . ... B-B4 ; should White now think mechanically , " I will take his centre pawn and consequently have the better game , " his deduction would be wrong . For after exchanging his Bishop for the Knight , which otherwise would drive his Queen away , Black brings the latter into a dominating square in the centre .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --  - 8 #R #Kt #Q #K #B #Kt #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #P #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P #B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Kt B Q K B Kt R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  - A B C D E F G H @# Diag. 17. 3 .

P-K3 Castles QR and P-K4 is again a threat hard for white to meet . This position shows , that to bring one 's opponent 's centre pawn away and to keep one 's own , does not under all circumstances mean the command of the centre , but that the opening up of files and diagonals for one 's pieces towards the centre is an important moment in the fight for positional advantage . Considerations of this kind will help to improve our judgment in many of the various openings treated in the following pages . We will class the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a ) Black 1 . P-K4 ( b ) Black 1 . Any other move B. White 1 . P-Q4. ( a ) Black 1 . P-Q4 ( b ) Black 1 . Any other move C. White 1 . Any other move We shall find that openings classed under C generally lead to positions treated under A and B. A. We have already come to the conclusion that after 1 . P-K4 , P-K4 White does well to try to force the exchange of Black 's centre pawn on Q4 or KB4 , and that Black will try to counteract this , unless by allowing the exchange he gets a chance of exerting pressure in the centre by means of his pieces . We will first see what happens when White undertakes the advance in question on his second move . Superficially the difference between 2 . PQ4 and 2 . P-KB4 is that in the first case the pawn thus advanced is covered , while in the second it is not . An opening in which a pawn sacrifice is offered , is called a " gambit " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P-Q4 is only a gambit if after 2 . ... PxP White does not recapture the pawn . Nevertheless this opening has been called the " centre gambit , " and though the denomination is not correct we will adhere to it , as it is in general use . A very considerable difference between the centre gambit and the King 's gambit lies in the fact that in the former acceptance is compulsory , whilst in the second it may be declined . For : 2 . P-Q4 threatens to take the King 's Pawn . To defend it by means of 2 . ... P-Q3 is unwise , since White exchanges pawns and then Queens , by which Black loses his chance of castling and impedes the development of his Rooks . 2 . ... Kt-QB3 is also bad , since after 3 . PxP , KtxP ; 4 P-KB4 , White drives the Knight away , gaining a strong hold on the centre , and Black has no compensation for giving up his centre pawn . It may be mentioned here that after 2 . ... Kt-QB3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin with it would be inconsequent , since P-Q4 was played in order to clear the centre , and moreover it would block up a diagonal which could be most useful to the King 's Bishop . We conclude now that Black can not hold his pawn at K4 . He must relinquish the centre by 2 . ... PxP . He will now either attempt to bring away White 's King 's Pawn by advancing his own QP to Q4 , or try to utilise the King 's file , which was opened by his second move , and operate against White 's KP . The Rooks are indicated for this task . We shall refer to the execution of these plans later on . In the King 's gambit , White 's attempt to bring away Black 's King 's Pawn may be safely ignored . The move 2 . P-KB4 does not threaten to take the King 's Pawn , as Black would win White 's KP by Q-R5ch . Black can therefore develop in security with 2 . ... B-B4 , and if then White prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Black protecting his King 's Pawn with P-Q3 , as the King 's Bishop is already developed . After 4 . B-B4 , Black has still no need to protect his KP with Kt-QB3 , but can play Kt-KB3 first , because after 5 . PxP , PxP ; 6 . KtxP would be answered by 6 . ... Q-Q5 winning a piece . Black keeps the upper hand in these early encounters because he has made a developing move with a piece , whilst White has played a pawn move which is useless for the purpose of development . @#  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #Q #K #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #Kt #P #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 B P P #B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 Kt P Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R B Q K R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H @# Diag. 18 .

If then White plays P-B5 in order to hinder the development of Black 's QB and to bring out his own , the pressure on Black 's KP is relieved permanently , and sooner or later Black will break through on the Q file , as his QP is no longer needed at Q3 for the support of the centre pawn . A different pawn formation is the result if White enforces the exchange of Black 's centre pawn at once . This he can do by playing P-Q4 , e.g. : 2 . P-KB4 B-B4 or 4 . P-B3 Kt-KB3 3 . Kt-KB3 P-Q3 5 . P-Q4 PxQP 4 . P-Q4 PxQP 6 . PxP B-Kt3 5 . KtxP Here Black can get an early advantage by attacking White 's KP , taking possession of the K file after castling on the K side .

They will be found in books treating of the analysis of the openings . It is therefore unwise for the beginner to accept the gambit , unless there be a chance of compensation for the disappearance of his centre pawn , by forcing the exchange of White 's centre pawn as well . The following line of play would fulfil this condition : 1 . P-K4 , P-K4 ; 2 . P-KB4 , PxP ; 3 . Kt-KB3 , Kt-KB3 ; 4 . Kt-B3 , P-Q4 ! Black thereby abandons the gambit pawn .

It may now be just possible for Black to avoid the many threats which White can bring to bear with his beautifully placed forces , perhaps by giving back one or both of the pawns gained .

After 4 . KPxP , QxP , Black 's position is at least as easy of development as White 's . In the position set out in Diagram 19 , White can not play P-K5 , because Black wins a pawn by PxP without hindering his own development in the least . The equalising power of Black 's P-Q4 in all KP openings where White has played P-Q4 can be noticed in many variations . I shall now give a few typical examples , which will show the line of play that can be adopted in many similar cases , and which can often be evolved one from the other by altering the order of the moves . @# I.

In no case should Black forfeit his chance of playing P-Q4 . It is tempting after 2 . P-Q4 , PxP ; 3 . Kt-KB3 to cover the pawn at Q5 by P-QB4 , but in that case White would sacrifice a pawn by P-QB3 , by this means opening the Queen 's file for himself , and so preventing Black from ever playing P-Q4 . Thus , for the loss of a pawn , White has a paramount advantage in position . For after 4 . ... PxP , 5 . KtxP ( Diagram 20 ) White has developed both Knights , and his Bishops are free , whilst Black has none of his pieces out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen 's Bishop , leaving K2 as the only square for the King 's Bishop ; finally the " backward " pawn Footnote : A pawn is said to be " backward , " when it can not move into cover by another pawn. at Q3 is open to constant attacks and is difficult to defend .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #Kt #B #Q #K #B #Kt #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R B Q K B R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 20 The best plan for Black is to decline the doubtful gift of the pawn and to bring about one of the positions , as sketched above , in which , by playing P-Q4 early in the game , Black is sure of the free development of all his forces . Black is able to play P-Q4 early in all such openings , where White does not force the defensive move P-Q3 by attacking Black 's King 's Pawn . For instance , in the King 's gambit , since the move 2 . P-KB4 does not threaten PxP , Black can reply at once by 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PxQP , P-K5 ( to permit of Kt-KB3 , which at present is not feasible on account of 4 . PxP ) ; 4 . P-Q3 , PxP ; 5 . QxP , White is a pawn ahead , but his Queen obstructs his KB ; therefore Black has better developing chances and should be able to win the pawn back at the very least . A second example is the Vienna game , which proceeds as follows : 2 . Kt-QB3 Kt-KB3 3 . P-B4 P-Q4 ( Diagram 21 ) If White plays 4 . PxQP , Black can play P-K5 , as in the Falkbeer gambit mentioned just now . In answer to 4 . PxKP , on the other hand , Black can play KtxP without having the slightest difficulty with his development . For instance , 5 . Kt-KB3 B-K2 6 . P-Q4 P-KB3 7 . B-Q3 KtxKt 8 . PxKt Castles 9 . Castles Kt-B3 or B-KKt5 and Black also will soon have an open file for his Rook , with no disadvantage in position .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 8 #R #Kt #B #Q #K #B #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R B Q K B Kt R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A B C D E F G H Diag. 21 . There is , however , one opening in which Black has the utmost difficulty in preventing White from getting a positional advantage in the centre . It is called the Ruy Lopez , and is held by many to be the strongest opening for White . The initial moves are : 1 . P-K4 , P-K4 ; 2 . Kt-KB3 , Kt-QB3 ; 3 . B-Kt5 . With this move White at once attacks the Black KP , though indirectly , by threatening to exchange the B for the Kt . To make the capture effective , however , White must first protect his own King 's Pawn , which would otherwise be lost after 4 . BxKt , QPxB ; 5 . KtxP , Q-Q5 ! . At first , therefore , Black need not provide against the threatened exchange . I shall treat at some length the various defences from which Black can choose , and in studying this most important King 's side opening , we shall have occasion to note many points of general interest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different systems of defence can be distinguished : either Black will try to maintain his centre pawn , or else , giving up the centre , try to gain some other advantage as compensation . Black can only maintain his centre pawn if he can prevent his QKt from being exchanged . As is readily seen , White can attack Black 's KP a second time with P-Q4 , whilst after Black 's P-Q3 any other defensive move would hinder development . These considerations lead to the first main line of defence in which Black plays 3 . ... P-QR3 . After 4 . B-R4 Black has the option of releasing the pin by playing P-QKt4 at some opportune moment . If White elects to exchange his Bishop for the Kt forthwith , he can remove the Black centre pawn after 4 . ... QPxB by playing 5 . P-Q4 , but the exchange of the B for the Kt gives Black a free development and in consequence a good game .

Castles ; he does not trouble to protect his KP as its capture would allow his Rook an open file on which to act against the opposing King ( compare Games Nos. 14 and 17 ) 5 . ... B-K2 . Now Black can capture the KP without much risk , as the Bishop is on the King 's file . 6 . R-K1 , White covers his pawn , and thereby threatens to win a pawn by BxKt . Therefore Black must not delay playing 6 . ... P-QKt4 . After 7 . B-Kt3 , P-Q3 ; ( Diagram 22 ) White can not yet execute the manoeuvre which underlies the whole tendency of the Ruy Lopez , namely P-Q4 , maintaining the pressure in the centre , because after KtxQP , 9 .

White could also obtain a rapid development by Kt-B3 , P-Q3 , B-K3 or Kt5 , but this arrangement is not popular , because Black can play Kt-QR4 and exchange the valuable KB . The pawn at QB3 supports an advance in the centre , and also provides a retreat for the KB . The QKt can be developed in this way : Kt-Q2-B1-Kt3 or K3 . Black , however , must try to round off his pawn position on the Queen 's side , by moving his QBP into line . Black 's pawns at K4 and QB4 then exert a pressure on White 's Q4 . And this pressure threatens to be reinforced by B-Kt5 . From these considerations the following development seems to be natural : 8 . P-B3 , Kt-QR4 ; 9 . B-B2 , P-B4 ; 10 . P-Q4 , Q-B2 ( to support the KP ) ; it leads to the position in Diagram 23.  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #B #K #R  --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #Q #B #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #P #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #Kt #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P B P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Kt B Q R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 23. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pawn move is justified . It deprives Black 's QB of its only good square , and saves the KKt , the co-operation of which is urgently needed in the centre . This system of opening will receive more exhaustive treatment under the heading of " Middle Game . " ( Compare Game No. 12 . ) In the second main line of defence , of which I shall treat now , Black renounces the maintenance of his KP , and makes an attempt to find compensation by attacking White 's King 's Pawn . The King 's file , opened by the disappearance of the Black pawn , offers opportunities for that purpose . After the first few moves we arrive at the following position , which  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #Q #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #B #B #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  - 6 #Kt #P #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 Kt P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R B Q R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 24. may be reached thus : 3 .

R-K1 , PxP ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh move is compulsory , because the loss of a pawn after BxKt is in effect threatened , now that the White KP is supported by the Rook . Black 's intention of exerting pressure on the KP is now difficult of execution , because his pieces are very cramped and hinder one another in a restricted area . The KB in particular can not be brought into action without great difficulty , for instance by : R-K1 , B-KB1 , P-KKt3 , and B-Kt2 . It is therefore advisable for White to develop his QB at Kt2 instead of at Kt5 , in order not to give Black a chance of exchanging his troublesome Bishop . ( In a game Bernstein-Emanuel Lasker , Moscow , 1914 , there happened 9 . BxKt , PxB ; 10 . B-Kt5 , P-KR3 ; 11 . B-R4 , Kt-R2 ; 12 .

I have already pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the attack on the open King 's file . Let us now consider in which way this attack can be planned . There are two essentially different lines , according to whether Black interpolates P-QR3 or not . After 3 . B-Kt5 , Kt-B3 ; 4 . Castles , KtxP ; 5 . R-K1 , Black gets out of it comfortably by playing Kt-Q3 , B-K2 and Castles , and White can not permanently prevent Black 's game from being freed by the advance of the QP . P-Q4 for White on the fifth move is therefore stronger . Black can not very well exchange the pawns , leaving the King 's file quite exposed , and must submit to White playing PxP , maintaining the pawn at K5 and preventing Black 's P-Q4 for some time to come . The opening might continue in this way : 5 . P-Q4 , B-K2 ; 6 . Q-K2 , Kt-Q3 ; 7 . BxKt , KtPxB ( to make room for the Kt ) ; 8 . PxP , Kt-Kt2 ( Diagram 25 ) .  --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #B #Q #K #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #Kt #P #P #B #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P Q P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Kt B R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A B C D E F G H Diag. 25 The whole of the manoeuvres now centre round Black 's endeavours to force his P-Q4 , and White 's attempt to prevent it .

Whilst White has a pawn firmly posted in the centre , Black has a Knight there which will soon be driven away . White 's Q4 , the basis of his centre , is entirely in his hands , whilst Black 's Q4 is exposed to a steady pressure by the White pieces . Finally Black 's QKt is unfavorably placed , obstructing as it does the QBP and preventing its falling into line with its fellows . Diagram 26 shows the position after 9 . P-B3 . The latter move prevents the exchange of the B after Black 's Kt-R4 , an exchange which would allow Black to round up his pawn formation with P-QB4 . The experts are not yet agreed as to the best continuation for Black in this critical position . To be considered are the moves B-QB4 , B-K2 and Kt-B4 . B-K2 is preferred nowadays to B-QB4 , as QB4 should be kept free for the KKt in case the latter is driven from his dominating position , e.g. 10 . R-K1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case Black exchanges the Knights , he only furthers White 's development without doing anything towards strengthening his Q4 . If Black covers the Knight with P-B4 , White plays PxP e.p . and Kt-Kt5 , rids himself of Black 's QB , and thereby weakens Black 's QP still more . Kt-B4 would therefore seem to be the best choice , as the QB becomes mobile again after White 's B-B2 , nor can White  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #Q #K #B #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #Kt #B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P #P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 B P Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Kt B Q R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 26. play P-Q4 as yet .

P-K4 , P-K4 . In most cases , Black 's centre pawn being open to attack by White 's P-Q4 , we find an early break-up of the centre , and concurrently the opening of the Ks or Qs file for the Rooks . That is why games opened in this fashion have been classed very generally as " open , " whilst all the other openings are called " close games . " Lately the distinction has been abandoned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the centre can be cleared occasionally . We attain typical close positions when Black does not play 1 . ...

On principle it does not seem advisable for Black to play P-Q4 on the first move in reply to 1 . P-K4 . Although White 's centre pawn disappears after 2 . PxP , QxP , Black loses a move through 3 . Kt-QB3 , and his Queen has no place from which it can not be driven away very soon , unless it be at Q1 . This , however , would amount to an admission of the inferiority of the whole of Black 's plan . There are two moves which deserve consideration as a preliminary to P-Q4 , namely , 1 . ...

White has more scope on the King 's side , where his pieces will have greater mobility , and prospects of attack . Black 's chances are on the Queen 's side . Both sides will have to advance more pawns in order to obtain openings for their Rooks , and use them for the attack , since they have no future on the K and Q files , as was the case in the openings mentioned hitherto . The obvious moves to this end are : for White the advance of the KBP , for Black that of the QBP and sometimes even of the QKtP , that is when the QBP has not been exchanged for the opposing QP , but has pushed on to B5 . In Diagrams 29 and 30 we see the chains of pawns formed by these manoeuvres .

In consequence White must postpone P-KB4 in order not to intercept the action of the QB on R6 . Now , in that case White 's Pawn at his K5 has not sufficient support against the attack by Black 's P-KB3 ( Diagram 31 ) , and the latter move gives Black the advantage .

A developing move can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If White plays P-K5 now he gains time for his advance of P-KB4 , as Black 's Knight must retreat .

Kt-B2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice BxPch , as mentioned above , was threatened . 14 . Castles Kt-R5 15 . R-Kt1 P-QKt4 If White does not wish to lose so many moves with his Kt , he can effect the intended protection of his QP as follows : 7 . Q-Q2 P-QR3 not P-QB4 at once , because of Kt-Kt5. 8 . Kt-Q1 P-QB4 9 . P-QB3 II 7 . P-B4 Castles 8 . Kt-B3 P-QB4 9 . B-Q3 P-B4 10 . Castles Kt-QB3 and so on . In both cases White has an easy development , whilst Black has no convenient square for his Queen 's Bishop . To avoid this drawback Rubinstein has evolved the following variation , in which provision is made from the first for the freedom of action of the Queen 's Bishop : 3 . Kt-QB3 Kt-KB3 4 . B-Kt5 PxP to open the diagonal for the Bishop at QKt2 , e.g. : 5 . KtxP QKt-Q2 6 . Kt-KB3 B-K2 followed by P-QKt3 and B-Kt2 . We will now leave the French defence and turn our attention to the Caro-Kann , of which the initial position was shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different systems of development , according to whether White plays P-K5 or gives Black the option of exchanging pawns by 3 . Kt-QB3 . In the first case a very noticeable difference from the French defence is , that Black can bring out his Queen 's Bishop . Here the process of development may be : 3 . P-K5 B-B4 4 . B-Q3 BxB Not B-Kt3 , because White could play P-K6 ! and paralyse the whole of Black 's game by preventing his playing the King 's Pawn . 5 . QxB P-K3 6 . Kt-K2 or KR3 Through this the move P-KB4 , which fits into this pawn formation , is kept in reserve . While White 's development is easy and natural , Black has difficulty in finding good places for his King 's side pieces . The game can proceed generally speaking on the lines of the French defence . Only Black can hardly attack White 's centre with P-B3 , since the Pawn at K3 would be weak in the absence of the Queen 's Bishop . On the other hand , Black would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since to reach QB4 his pawn would have made two moves instead of one as in the French defence . A certain compensation lies in the fact that White 's attacking King 's Bishop has been exchanged . In practical play it has nevertheless been shown that White 's attack is more likely to succeed , and for this reason a variation introduced by Niemzowitsch has been tried several times ; it aims at the exchange of Queens in order to weaken and retard White 's threatened attack , and to gain time for Queen 's side operations . 6 . ... Q-Kt3 7 . Castles Q-R3 or Kt4 But after 8 . Kt-B4 , QxQ ; 9 . KtxQ , White is so much ahead with his development that Black 's chance of equalising the game would seem questionable . If White plays Kt-KR3 on his sixth move , he foils at once Black 's attempt of forcing an exchange of Queens , as he could play 8 . Q-KKt3 . On the whole we can conclude that in the Caro-Kann defence White obtains a good game by 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in vogue , namely , 3 . Kt-QB3 , PxP ; 4 . KtxP , Kt-B3 ; 5 . KtxKtch , KPxKt or KtPxKt , gives Black an even chance , for although he loses his centre pawn he obtains a good development , and later in the game he has opportunities of exercising pressure on White 's QP through his open Q file . Except the French defence and the Caro-Kann , there is no game in which an irregular reply to White 's 1 . P-K4 necessitates any special considerations either in development of pieces or pawn formation . In all such cases it is sufficient to maintain the pawn centre and to occupy such squares with the pieces , whence they can not be driven away with the loss of a move . Just one example : If Black plays 1 . ... P-QB4 ( Sicilian defence ) , White will not play his King 's Bishop to B4 , because Black can reply P-K3 , and gain a move by P-Q4 . B. Let us now consider the openings in which the first move is 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be cleared as early as in the openings beginning with 1 . P-K4 , P-K4 . The advance of a second centre pawn , which there led to a clearance , is not feasible in this case . White does not command his K4 , and for some time to come he will be unable to advance the K pawn beyond K3 . In consequence the K file does not seem a likely opening for the Rooks , and another file must be found for them . The conclusions arrived at for Black in the French defence hold good for both sides in the opening now under consideration , and accordingly the QB file is that most advantageous for the Rooks . The advance of the QBP strikes at the opposing centre , and , that being of paramount importance , the Queen 's Knight must not be developed at B3 before the QBP has been pushed on . Another development might be conceivable for the Rooks ; viz. on the KB file , and also the KKt or KR file ; here , as we shall see , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a pawn attack . But in this case , too , although it seems unnecessary to play the QBP , it is advisable to develop the Knight via Q2 , as there is a constant threat of the QB file being forced open subsequently by the opposing forces . We will start with the games in which the QB Pawns are played in the earliest stages of the opening , so that the pawn skeleton in Diagram 35 forms the basis of development . The sequence of moves is of moment , because the advance of the KP , whether forced or not , determines the possibility of bringing out the Q Bishops . The simplest process of development based on Diagram 35 is the following , in which both sides block up the QB .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #Kt #B #Q #K #B #Kt #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Kt B Q K B Kt R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 35 2 .

To play P-QKt3 before castling is very dangerous , because Black can play PxQP and pin the White QKt with B-Kt5 , forcing B-Q2 , when B-Kt2 was the move intended , e.g. 6 . P-QKt3 , BPxP ; 7 . KPxP , B-Kt5 ; 8 . B-Kt2 , Kt-K5 ; 9 . Q-B2 , Q-R4 ; 10 . R-QB1 , QxP . In order not to relinquish the square at QKt4 to Black , White can also try the following manoeuvre : 6 . PxBP BxP 7 . P-QR3 Castles 8 . P-QKt4 B-Q3 9 . B-Kt2 If Black imitates White 's moves , viz. 9 . ... PxP ; 10 . BxP , P-QR3 ; 11 . Castles , P-QKt4 ; 12 . B-Q3 , B-Kt2 , the result is the symmetrical position in Diagram 36.  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #Q #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #Kt #B #P #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P Kt B P Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 B P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Q R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 36 When treating of the middle game , we shall find that even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move is still at work . In order to obtain a more thorough understanding of the Queen 's Pawn game , we must now turn our attention very closely to the opening moves . Already on the second move White can play 2 . P-QB4 and turn the game into a Queen 's gambit , which Black can either accept or decline . Black would be justified in playing 2 . ... PxP , and so furthering White 's object of getting his ( Black 's ) Queen 's Pawn away , if he could permanently hold the gambit pawn , or if the giving up of the square at Q4 fits into a reasoned system of development . The latter was , for instance , the case in the play leading to the position shown in the Diagram 36 . But Black is well advised to wait until White has moved the King 's Bishop before taking the pawn on his QB5 . This forces the Bishop to move twice , and Black regains the move he lost in his development , when he played PxP . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : 2 . P-QB4 PxP 3 . Kt-KB3 Kt-KB3 4 .

If Black plays instead : 5 . ... P-B3 , White wins back his pawn with 6 . P-QKt3 , PxKt P ; 7 . PxP , PxP ; 8 . BxPch by QxP , and moreover is much ahead with his development . These considerations point to the conclusion that after 2 . P-QB4 there is no inducement for Black to take the pawn . On the contrary , he will cover his centre pawn , which White wishes to tempt away , either with P-K3 or P-QB3 . The attempt to develop the Queen 's Bishop before playing P-K3 is not to be recommended , because the Q Kt 's pawn remains unprotected and open to an immediate attack by 3 . Q-Kt3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P-K3 and 2 . ... P-QB3 , I will first discuss the former , as being the more natural of the two , since P-QB3 does not fit into the scheme for opening the QB file for the Rooks . White , on the other hand , can bring out his QB before playing P-K3 , in this way : 2 . P-QB4 , P-K3 ; 3 . Kt-QB3 , Kt-KB3 ; 4 . B-Kt5 , and the game might proceed as follows : 4 . ... Q Kt-Q2 . ( Diagram 38 . ) No fault can be found with this move , although it blocks the Bishop , since the latter can only be developed effectively at Kt2 . Moreover , the Knight at Q2 supports the projected P-B4 . White can not win a pawn now with 5 . PxP , PxP ; 6 . KtxP , because of KtxKt ; 7 . BxQ , B-Kt5ch . Therefore 5 . P-K3 must be played first , and after B-K2 ; 6 . Kt-B3 , Castles ; 7 . R-B1 , P-QKt3 ; 8 .

Here Black has the advantage of being able to avoid the pinning of his Knight by the opposing QB . 2 . P-QB4 P-K3 3 . Kt-QB3 P-QB4 4 . Kt-B3 Kt-QB3 ! Now Black threatens QPxP with an attack on White 's Queen 's Pawn . If White plays P-K3 we get the position mentioned in connection with Diagram 35 . If he wishes to bring out his QB first , he must anticipate Black 's threat by BPxP . After 5 . BPxP KPxP the third of the typical main positions in the Queen 's gambit ensues , and is given in Diagram 39 . Two continuations must now be considered . White can either develop his KB at Kt2 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or he can place the KB on one of the available squares between B1 and R6 . In the first instance , the KP need not be played at all , and the QB  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #B #Q #K #B #Kt #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 Kt Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R B Q K B R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 39 retains the option of developing at Kt5 , B4 , and even K3 . In the second , where the K must make room for the KB , White must decide at once between B-B4 or Kt5 , and only B4 can be seriously considered on account of 6 . B-Kt5 B-K2 7 . BxB KtxB which only furthers Black 's development . White would only be justified in this course if he could now win a pawn with 8 . PxP , but Black would win it back and have the superior game after 8 . ... P-Q5 9 . Kt-K4 Castles followed by B-B4 and Q-R4ch . The correct move in this variation is consequently 6 . B-B4 , and a possible continuation would be : Kt-KB3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or B-QKt5 or B-Q3 . With this we will close the discussion of the variations initiated by 2 . P-QB4 , P-K3 , and study the reply 2 . ... P-QB3 . The first question which arises in our mind is : Which file will Black be able to utilise for his Rooks ? An attempt to free the King 's file through P-K4 is conceivable . But White can prevent this by simply playing Kt-KB3 . Two other possibilities present themselves : after playing P-K3 , Kt-B3 and QKt-Q2 , Black could steer into a line similar to the Queen 's gambit accepted with PxP and P-QB4 , or he could keep the centre closed with P-KB4 and Kt-B3 , with the intention of playing Kt-K5 and using the KB file for activating his Rook via KB3 . Diagram 40 gives the position reached after : 3 . Kt-KB3 P-K3 4 . P-K3 Kt-KB4 5 .

But this opening has practically disappeared from modern tournament games , simply because the QB can not easily be brought into play .

Once the position in Diagram 41 has been reached , Black 's resources against the dangerous onslaught of the White forces are scanty . Yet he can retaliate , not by making the simplest and most obvious developing moves , as mentioned before , but in the following way : If White plays 5 . P-QKt3 before castling , Black exchanges pawns and checks with the Queen . Now White has the disagreeable choice between B-Q2 and P-B3 . The former must be bad , being contrary to the plan of development as intended by P-QKt3 . The latter blocks the very diagonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can open up the diagonal by playing P-QB4 after castling , nor would it really imply the loss of a move to have played the BP twice , since Black must move his Queen again from R4 , where she has no future . But in any case there remains the disadvantage that White was forced to play the BP , whilst before he had the option of withholding its advance until a more opportune moment . Another possible subtlety in Black 's sequence of developing moves would be to withhold the advance of his KP until White has played P-QKt3 , and then to play the QB to Kt5 . For , as I have already remarked , the objection to developing Black 's Queen 's Bishop lies in White 's threat to attack Black 's QKtP with Q-Kt3 . That possibility disappears after P-QKt3 . Before bringing the discussion of the Queen 's Pawn opening to a close , I may remark that in tournaments it has become usual for White not to play P-QB4 at once , but to play Kt-KB3 as a preliminary , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . P-QB4 , P-K4 . If White plays 3 . PxKP , Black 's reply is P-Q5 , and the obvious move 4 . P-K3 fails on account of the following pretty combination : B  --  Kt5ch ; 5 . B  --  Q2 , PxP ; 6 . BxB , PxPch ; 7 . K-K2 , PxKtch ! ! ; 8 . RxKt , B-Kt5ch , etc . Instead of 4 . P-K3 , White should play P-KKt3 and develop his KB at Kt2 . Black could now try to regain his pawn with Kt-K2-Kt3 , but he can also sacrifice a pawn by P-KB3 , with a view to rapid development . It now only remains for us to discover whether Black has any other answer to P-Q4 which would necessitate close analysis on White 's part . Here must be mentioned : 1 . ... Kt-KB3 , 1 . ... P-QB4 , and 1 . ... P-KB4 . The former move prepares P-Q3 , followed by P-K4 . In this opening there is no reason why White should play P-QB4 , as there is no prospect of opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has relinquished the square Q4 and made K4 the basis of operations . It will be more advisable to prevent Black from playing P-K4 as far as this can be achieved in conformity with a logical development , e.g. 1 . P-Q4 , Kt-KB3 ; 2 . Kt-KB3 . Not 2 . Kt-QB3 , because Black could then lead into the Queen 's gambit by playing P-Q4 and P-QB4 , after which White has the disadvantage of not being able to open the QB file . 2 . ... P-Q3 ; 3 . B-B4 , QKt-Q2 ; 4 . P-K3 . Now Black can only enforce P-K4 after P-B3 and QB2 . Meanwhile White mobilises all his pieces , whilst Black 's QB remains blocked and the Kt must remain at Q2 to cover the KP . If , on the other hand , Black exchanges pawns in order to free the Knight , there is no Black centre left . With regard to the second irregular reply to 1 . P-Q4 , namely , 1 . ... P-QB4 , two ways are open to White . One is to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P-K3 , on which Black can play P-Q4 . The second is to play 2 . P-Q5 . Black will then develop his King 's side with P-KKt3 and B-Kt2 . The Bishop is well posted here , and can frequently take up an attacking position at K4 or Q5 . ( See Game No. 45 , Rubinstein v. Spielmann . ) If White plays 2 . PxP , we have after 2 . ... P-K3 a Queen 's gambit accepted by White , and , as pointed out before , this line of play is not commendable . The last of the three irregular answers mentioned above : 1 . ... P-KB4 leads to two entirely different plans , according to the second move chosen by White . White can confine himself to a simple development such as : Kt-KB3 , B-Kt5 , P-K3 , QKt-Q2 ( Kt-B3 would only be good if preceded by P-B4 , because Black would again lead into a Queen 's gambit with P-Q4 and P-QB4 ) . The other possibility is the following : in view of the fact that 1 . ... P-KB4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent attack by giving up his King 's Pawn ( P-K4 ) and thus accelerate his own development . The play might be as follows : 2 . ... PxP ; 3 . Kt-QB3 , Kt-KB3 ; 4 . B-KKt5 , P-B3 ( P-Q4 ? 5 . BxKt followed by Q-R5ch ) ; 5 . P-B3 . If Black takes the pawn he lays himself open to an attack hard to meet . It seems best to play 5 . ... P-K6 , which calls back the White QB and leaves White 's BP as a hindrance to the development of the KKt. @# IRREGULAR OPENINGS @# Many openings in which neither P-K4 nor P-Q4 is the first move lead to well-known positions by a simple transposition of moves . For instance , a Queen 's gambit may well have the following opening moves : 1 . P-QB4 , Kt-KB3 ; 2 . Kt-KB3 , P-K3 ; 3 . Kt-B3 , P-B4 ; 4 . P-K3 , P-Q4 ; 5 . P-Q4 , or a French defence these : 1 . Kt-QB3 , P-Q4 ; 2 . P-Q4 , Kt-KB3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are , of course , systems of opening which deviate absolutely from those which have been proved sound and are in general use , and it is those openings that puzzle the beginner most of all . He says : What is the good of learning correct openings , if my opponent plays incorrectly and wins all the same ? This line of thought is wrong from its inception . The student is not supposed to " learn " openings by heart , but to UNDERSTAND how the general principles of Chess Strategy are applied to any opening . Such knowledge can never be obtained from a tabulated analysis , but can only be arrived at by the application of common sense . If a player succeeds in winning in spite of an inferior opening , it only proves that subsequently he has played a stronger game than his opponent , who , after playing the opening according to the book , did not know how to proceed further . And herein lies the weakness , and not in the absence of knowledge of the analysis of openings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hold his own in the opening , as soon as he has grasped the real meaning of those principles which I can not repeat often enough , viz. : 1st , quick development of pieces and avoidance of lost moves ; 2nd , the maintenance of a pawn centre , hampering the development of the opposing forces , and the avoidance of pawn moves that do not contribute to the development of pieces . How to conduct the middle game and end-game is not entirely a matter of deduction from such general rules . In order to play the end-game correctly , one must know certain things and positions which arise from and may be said to be peculiar to the purely arbitrary rules of chess . The same applies to the middle game , as in most cases it must be played with a view to the end-game which ensues , unless there be a chance of mating the opponent before . The student should have , therefore , a knowledge of the end-game before he can hope to be able to conduct the middle game efficiently . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . @# CHAPTER V THE END-GAME @# JUST as it is difficult to state the exact point at which an opening ends , so is it equally difficult to say where the end-game may be said to commence . One of the main characteristics of end-games is the active part taken by the King . Clearly the King can not venture out into the field of operations until there has been an exchange of the majority of the pieces , so that there can be no danger of his being mated . As soon as a player has attained some advantage in material which ensures the victory in the end-game , he will try to bring about the end-game by exchanging pieces , for there the lines on which to push home his advantage are clearly set out . It is first necessary to know what surplus of forces is the minimum required in order to force a mate . The positions in which the mate can be forced may be shown by a few typical examples . But I shall lay stress mainly on one point . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought about by exchanges is won or not ; in other words , whether it can be reduced to one of the typical positions referred to above . It is obvious that the end-game is the particular demesne of pawn strategy . Nearly always one or more pawns survive the exchange of pieces , and the knowledge of the end-game will be invaluable for gauging the consequences of pawn moves in the course of the middle game . The latter represents probably the most difficult aspect of the strategy of chess . In order to enable beginners to grasp the following chapters , I must again point out a few elementary considerations . Simple end-games , that is , end-games without pawns , are comparatively easy to understand . Let us first consider the case of a King denuded of all his troops . In order to force the mate it is necessary to obtain command of four squares , namely , those four squares which he controls after he has been driven into a corner . Supposing the Black King has been driven to QR1 , the White King can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , QR2 and QKt2 . Therefore it is necessary for White still to have such forces as can command two more squares of different colour , namely , QR1 and QKt1 . As can readily be seen , it will be essential to have at least the Queen or a Rook or two Bishops , or a Knight and Bishop , or two Knights . Footnote : How the King can be driven into a corner will be shown subsequently . We shall see that in the latter case it is impossible to drive the King into a corner without bringing about a stalemate . The mates by a Queen or Rook are so simple that I only give an example of each for the sake of completeness . Position 1 .  --  White : K at QR1 , Q-KR1 Black : K at K4 1 . K-Kt2 , K-Q5 ; 2 . K-Kt3 , K-K4 ; 3 . K-B4 , K-Q3 ; 4 . Q-K4 , K-Q2 ; 5 . K-B5 , K-B1 ; 6 . K-B6 , K-Kt1 ; 7 . Q-QR4 , or Kt4ch , or K7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  White : K at QKt3 , RKR2 Black : K at K4 1 .

A mating position in the corner which the Bishop does not command would have to be of the type set out in Diagram 42 . Here the Bishop plays on White squares , and the Knight in order to checkmate must move on to a White square ; in other words , he must come from a Black one . Therefore , when the Bishop checked on the previous move and drove the King away , the King had the option of two black squares , and had no need to go into the corner one . He is only mated in consequence of a wrong move .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 K #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 42 As stated above , however , it is possible in all cases to mate in the corner square which is of the same colour as the Bishop .

Having decided as to the smallest amount of material advantage with which it is possible to force a mate , we will now turn our attention to simple game endings ( still without pawns ) . To judge such endings correctly , it will only be necessary to find out whether it is possible to obtain the minimum advantage mentioned . It is sufficient to discuss cases in which a piece on the one side plays against a stronger one on the other , because in endings where several pieces are left on either side , fortuitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be impossible to characterise and classify positions of that kind , by giving typical illustrations . Besides , they are reduced sooner or later by exchanges to such end-games as have been treated already , or are going to be shown now . The Queen wins against any other piece ; the Rook alone may give trouble .

Q-R6 leads to nothing , as R-B2ch follows , and after 2 . K-Kt6 Black forces a stalemate with R-B3ch . It is necessary for White to gain a move in this position ; in other words , White must try to transfer to the other side the onus of having to move . If then the Rook moves away from the King , it gets lost after a few checks , or if Black 's King plays to B1 , the Rook is equally lost through Q-R6 . White plays therefore : 1 . Q-K5ch , K-R1 ; 2 . Q-R1ch , K-Kt1 ; 3 . Q-R5 , and wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Q-K5ch , K-R2 ; 5 . Q-K3ch , K-R1 ; 6 . Q-K8ch , and so on . The Rook can win against a minor piece in exceptional cases only . In endings of ROOK AGAINST BISHOP the weaker King must take refuge in a corner square of different colour from that of his Bishop .

The best course will be first to study how to turn a material superiority in pawns to decisive advantage , after which we shall note particular positions , in which a win is possible with an equality or even an inferiority in pawns . The ending of KING AND PAWN AGAINST KING is one of the simplest albeit one of the most important of elementary cases . The stronger side will evidently try to queen the pawn . But generally this is not possible if the adverse King has command of the queening square . One important condition , though , must be complied with : the weaker King must move into " opposition , " and " opposition " is one of the characteristic and deciding factors in most pawn endings . It is absolutely necessary for the learner to understand fully the meaning of the term " opposition , " and its value in elementary cases This knowledge is of far reaching influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 .

White has moved last , it is Black 's turn to move ; it is said in this case that " White has the opposition .

This is the critical moment , namely , when the pawn reaches the sixth rank . If now Black plays K-K1 he is lost , for White playing K-K6 has the opposition . After 4 . ... K-Q1 , 5 .

K-Q6 , he is stalemated , or else wins the pawn if White plays differently on his sixth move . The King draws against King and pawn if he commands the queening square , and if he can retain the opposition on the first rank as soon as the pawn moves into his sixth . It is of the utmost importance that the pawn should be at his sixth ; if the pawn is still further back , the opposition on the first rank is of no avail . Diagram 51 will serve as an example .

It might be more clear to put it in this way : with P-B6 White wins the opposition , in that he brings about a position with Black to move . Therefore the game is won for White . Since the opposition on the outside rank is of no avail , when the pawn has not yet played to his sixth square , the weaker side must try to keep away the opposing King from the sixth rank until the pawn has reached that rank .

By simply enumerating the moves necessary for either player to queen his pawn  --  SEPARATELY for White and Black  --  we can see the result of our intended manoeuvres , however far ahead we have to extend our calculations . 1 .

White needs ten moves in order to queen on the King 's side , namely , five to capture the Black King 's side pawns ( K-K4 , B5 , Kt6 , R6 , Kt5 ) , one to free the way for his pawn , and four moves with the pawn .

He requires six moves to capture the White Queen 's side pawns , one to make room for his pawn at B3 , and after three moves the pawn only gets to B6 . White then wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block the way of his own pawn , thus gaining time for his King to approach . As we shall see later on ( p. 97 ) , if the pawn had already reached B7 , whilst under protection by his K , the game would be drawn . It is necessary to make it a rule to examine positions in which each side has a passed pawn , by counting the moves in the way first shown . It is just because end-games can be calculated to a nicety , there being no moves of which the consequences can not be foreseen , that we note in contemporary master play a tendency to simplify the middle-game by exchanging pieces , as soon as there is an infinitesimal advantage in the pawn position ( compare the game Charousek-Heinrichsen , p. 108 ) .

Whoever has the move wins by assuming the opposition . The opposing King must then give the way free to one of the pawns . The state of affairs in Diagram 61 is similar to that in Diagram 60 .

" In Diagram 62 , White with the move wins by 1 . K-K2 , thus assuming " distant opposition " ( squares of the same colour ! ! ) . If Black now enters his second rank , White immediately plays into opposition on his third rank , e.g. 1 . ... K-Q2 ; 2 . K-Q3 , and still maintains it by 3 . K-K3 if Black plays a waiting move such as 2 . ... K-K2 . Now Black has no further waiting moves , as White threatens to capture one of the pawns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , as White then assumes the direct opposition , and wins as in Diagram 60 . Black must allow White access to one side or the other . He could not have remained on the first rank at the outset either , for after 1 . ... K-Q1 , White advances through a square , to which Black can not assume the opposition , namely , 2 . K-B3 . If now Black wishes to answer the threat of K-B 4-Kt5 and plays K-K2 , White answers 3 . K-K3 as before . 2 . K-K3 or KQ3 would be wrong , as Black would then succeed in assuming the opposition at K2 or Q2 , and would be able to maintain it . White would be unable to circumvent this or to attack the pawns.  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 62 In this position , too , there is ample scope for the study of the opposition .

In eleven moves Black captures the opposing QBP and queens his own . We see here how the King 's position can be counterbalanced by the weakness of a pawn , and lead to a draw . If the White QBP was not isolated but standing , for instance , at QKt2 , Black would be lost , as calculation easily shows . The strength or weakness of a pawn position , which , as we saw , had so deciding an influence in the end-game position just treated , is one of the most important factors in a game of chess , and should have full consideration in the middle game . A pawn , when isolated , is naturally weaker than when it is or can be protected by another . It may easily lead to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King or a piece is reduced by having to protect the pawn ( compare End-game , p. 102 ) . It is frequently and erroneously thought that DOUBLED pawns as such are a weakness . Doubled pawns are weak when ISOLATED , for they can not support each other . But if doubled pawns can be supported by a pawn on the next file they need not by any means be at a disadvantage against three united single pawns on the opposite side . For instance , in Diagram 64 , if Black had a pawn at QKt3 instead of R2 , White would have no winning chances . He could not attack the pawns , nor would any kind of manoeuvres force a passed pawn through .

The proper formation for the Black pawns would be at B3 , Kt2 , R3 , after which White can not force a pawn through by playing P-B4 and P-Kt5 , as Black can refrain from making any exchange . Black could not afford to leave the pawns where they are , because even if there were no White pawn at B2 , White would , by playing P-Kt5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . P-Kt6 , BPxP ; 2 . P-R6 , and P-B6 , etc. ; or 1 . ... RPxP ; 2 . P-B6 , with P-R6 , etc . In a game Ed . Lasker-Moll ( Berlin championship , 1904 ) , from which the position is taken , Black played P-R3 in order to obtain the formation mentioned above , and White resigned after 2 . P-B4 ? P-B3 , P-Kt5 , K-Q5 . There was , however , a pretty win after Black 's P-R3 , namely : 2 . P-B6 , PxP ; 3 . P-B4 , K-Q5 ; 4 . P-Kt5 , BPxP ; 5 . PxP , K-K4 ; 6 . PxP , K-B6 ; 7 . K-B2 and Black is lost , because his own pawn obstructs the square B2 , and the King must release the square Kt2 , after which the White pawn queens . This winning combination , however , is only an interesting exception to the rule that positions of this kind are generally won by the side which possesses the passed pawn . In this particular case Black could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B3 Kt2 R3 for his pawns earlier , before the White pawns could advance so far . In the position of Diagram 66 Black could still have won by playing P-B3 . After 2 . P-R6 , PxP ; 3 .

Whoever has the move wins by moving into distant opposition . White , therefore , should play K-K5 K-Q5 would lose , as Black would play K-Kt5 , protecting his pawn and attacking the White pawn , the protection of which White has to give up next move . In the same way Black with the move can not play K-Kt5 because White wins the pawn with K-Q5 . After 1 . K-K5 Black can not avoid the loss of the game , e.g. K-R3 ; 2 . K-Q5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Black with the move wins similarly with K-R5 . We have still to consider end-games in which a draw results in spite of a majority of pawns , or where a win can only be achieved by the sacrifice of an extra pawn .

P-B4ch ! and after 2 . PxPch , K-B3 followed by KxP ensure the draw . We come now to those end-games in which pieces as well as pawns are left on the board . As it is my aim to give typical examples , I shall confine myself to positions where there is only one piece besides the King . Most end-games with several pieces can be reduced to that . In nearly all end-games with pieces the King 's manoeuvres used in pawn endings are of no avail , as far as opposition is concerned , as the advantage of opposition means that the opponent is forced to move his King , and as long as there are pieces on the board , such " forced move " positions are infrequent . However , the strength of the pawn position is of the same importance as in pawn endings , just as the command of as many squares as possible is essential for the King . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . A good example is found in Diagram 70 , a position from a game Post-Leonhardt ( Berlin Jubilee Tournament , 1907 ) .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #K #B #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 P #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P K P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 B P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2  --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --  - 1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 70 Black 's pawn position is weaker , because the White pawns , being on Black squares , can not be attacked by the Bishop , whilst Black has two isolated pawns on White squares . Furthermore the Black Bishop has less mobility than the White one , and finally the Black King is tied to his Q3 , to prevent White 's entry at B5 or K5 . These drawbacks decide the issue . 1 . ... B-R2 ; 2 . P-R4 , B-Kt3 ; 3 . B-B2 , P-R4 . ( After B-R2 White would command the square at Kt6 through P-R5 ) ; 4 . B-Q3 , B-R2 ; 5 . B-B1 , and Black resigns , for White threatens to establish his Bishop at B3 , where the pawns at Q5 and R5 are both attacked , whilst the Black Bishop is at once forced to occupy the only square from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square must be abandoned in the next move , Black loses a pawn and the game . 5 . ... B-Kt1 ; 6 . B-K2 , B-B2 ; 7 . B-B3 , and wins , or 5 . ... B-Kt3 ; 6 . B-Kt2 , B-B2 ; 7 . B-B3 , and wins . A corresponding instance of KNIGHT V. BISHOP is the end-game Blackburne-Schlechter ( p. 102 ) . It is difficult to gauge the relative value of Bishop and Knight in the end-game . The Knight has the advantage of access to all squares ; against that the Bishop is able to fight at long range , and offers opportunities of gaining moves in certain positions where there is a " forced move " ( compare p. 90 ) . As already stated , two Bishops are superior to two Knights because the limitation of the colour of squares ceases . A Rook generally wins against a Bishop or a Knight , sometimes even against a majority of one or two pawns , provided , of course , that there are still pawns on the Rook 's side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following position ( Diagram 71 ) , from a game Moll-Post , shows how to proceed in such cases . Here White can force a win in the following way : 1 . RxP , P-Kt6 ; 2 . R-R6 , PxP ; 3 . RxP , K-B2 ; 4 . R-B2 , B-Kt5 ; 5 . R-B4 , B-R4 ; 6 . P-B4 ! The Black pawn position must first be torn up , if it is to be attacked successfully . Now Black 's defeat is inevitable , whether the pawn is taken or not . The sequel would be 6 . ... PxP ; 7 . RxP , after which the Rook goes to KR5 and the Rook 's pawn must fall , or : 6 . ... K-Kt3 ; 7 . PxP , PxP ; 8 . R-B6ch , K-Kt2 ; 9 . R-B5 , and the Bishop 's pawn is lost , unless Black gives up his passed pawn . In this case Black loses also : 9 . R-B5 , B-Q1 ; 10 . KxP , K-Kt3 ; 11 . K-Q3 , B-B3 ; 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 14 . R-R6 , K-B2 ; 15 . K-B5 , B-Q1 ; 16 . R-KKt6 , followed by RxP , etc . The Queen against a minor piece wins so easily that it is not necessary to give an example .

He can only attack the pawn from Kt7 or Kt8 , both of which are inaccessible as the Black King gets to Kt1 . It is a stalemate position .

In the position given , White could only win by keeping his passed pawn , and indeed it is possible to win by gaining a move with the Bishop . In the diagram it is White 's move . Black with the move could not play K-B2 because K-Q6 would follow . The Knight would have to move , allowing the pawn to queen . Therefore White must try to bring about the same position with Black to move . He can do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . B-Kt3 , K-B2 ( now 2 . K-Q6 would be bad on account of Kt-Q5 , 3 . P-B7 , Kt-Kt5ch , and KtxP ) ; 2 . B-R2 , K-K2 ; 3 . B-K5 . Now White 's plan has succeeded ; the same position has occurred , and it is Black 's move . As mentioned before , the King must not move , but Knight 's moves are of no avail . If 3 . ... Kt-Kt4 ; 4 . B-B6ch , the Knight is lost , or alternatively the pawn queens . On 3 . ... Kt-B1 , B-Q6ch decides , and on 3 . ... Kt-Q1 ; 4 . B-B6ch , K-K1 ; 5 . BxKt would follow . On this occasion I should like to point out that it is impossible to gain a move with a Knight , as a square which is accessible to him in an odd number of moves can not be reached by him in an even number . A simple instance is Diagram 74.  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #K K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 Kt P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 74 White loses , having the move . 1 .

BISHOP , of which we have already had an example in Diagram 70 , an extra pawn wins in most cases if the Bishops are of the same colour . It is generally possible to force an exchange of Bishops and obtain one of the well-known pawn endings . On the other hand an ending with Bishops of different colour leads mostly to a draw , frequently even against a majority of two pawns . The position in Diagram 75 is a draw , because it is impossible for the White King to get round his Kt pawn to drive off the Bishop .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 6 #B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P #K P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 75 With two passed pawns distant from each other , a win can generally be forced , as in the following position ( Diagram 76 ) .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 76 The King moves up to the pawn , the progress of which is barred by the Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice of the Bishop .

When the pawns are united , one should observe this rule : if they are attacked , they should , if possible , move to squares of the colour of the opposing Bishop . Therefore in the position set out in Diagram 77 White should not play P-B5 , but P-K5 . After 1 . P-B5 there is no possible chance for White to assume the command of the Black squares , and in order to advance the pawns it is necessary  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #B #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 77 to force access to both White and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these lines : 1 .

White can only get through with the King 's Pawn , as P-B7 is unavailing on the grounds set out above . But in order to play P-K7 , the square K7 must first be covered a second time , so that the Bishop can not be given up for the two pawns . Therefore : 8 . K-Q5 , B-R6 ( B-B6 ; P-K7ch ) ; 9 . K-B6 , K-K1 ; 10 . K-B7ch , K-B1 ; 11 . K-Q7 , and wins . In end-games with one Knight on each side , an extra pawn usually decides the game much in the same way as in end-games with Bishops of the same colour ; frequently even with equal pawns , the possession of a passed pawn is sufficient , as it keeps either the King or the Knight busy , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pawns . An instructive example is the end-game Ed . Lasker-Rotlevi on p. 100 . End-games with Rook against Rook are the most frequent , as well as the most difficult . Here the possession of an extra pawn is seldom sufficient for a win , unless the stronger side has also an advantage in the greater mobility of the Rook . Diagram 78 is typical of such cases , frequent in practice , in  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 R #P #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4  --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 K P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 78 which the greater mobility is the deciding factor . Although White has one pawn more , he can only win by reducing the mobility of the Black Rook through the following manoeuvre : 1 . R-B2 , R-Q2 ; 2 . R-R2 , R-R2 . Now the Black Rook has only one move left , whilst the White Rook has the freedom of the Rook 's file . For instance , the Rook can be posted at R5 and prevent the Black King from attacking White 's King 's side pawns , whilst the White King makes for the R at R7 and effects its capture . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstruct the way to the Queen 's side , White penetrates into the Black pawn position . Black can not maintain the opposition because the White Rook has spare moves , the Black Rook none . e.g. 3 . K-B3 , K-Kt3 ; 4 . R-R5 , K-B3 ; 5 . K-K4 , K-K3 ; 6 . R-R4 , P-Kt3 ; 7 . R-R5 , K-Q3 ; 8 . K-Q4 , K-B3 ; 9 . K-K5 , and wins the pawns . Having the move , Black would draw the game by : 1 . ... R-Q7ch ; 2 . K-R3 , R-R7 . By placing his Rook behind the passed pawn he condemns the opposing Rook to inactivity , whilst his own is free to move on the Rook 's file . If now the White King comes up , he will in the end force the sacrifice of the Black Rook for the pawn , but meanwhile the Black King captures the White pawns , and with passed pawns on the King 's side might get winning chances . When there is only one pawn left in endings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the King can command the queening square . Diagram 79 shows a position favourable to the stronger side , and which can mostly be obtained in this end-game . But here , too , Black forces a draw with a pretty manoeuvre : 1 . ... R-B2 ; 2 . R-KKt2 , R-Q2ch ; 3 . PXR , and Black is stalemate .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 P K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 79 The chances of a draw are even greater in endings of Q against Q , as the King on the stronger side can seldom evade perpetual check . For the sake of completeness I will show a few cases in which Q or R can not win against an advanced pawn . In Diagram 80 White can still draw , for in five moves the pawn reaches Kt7 , supported by the King at R7 , and in that time Black can not come up with his King , so that he must give up the Rook for the pawn . Two passed pawns win , even when the King is away from them , if they have reached their sixth square .

The following illustrates the three principal cases : A. Position  --  White : K at QKt8 , P at QR7 Black : K at QR8 , Q at QB3 Black must stop the pawn and plays Q-Kt3ch . White answers with K-R sq and is stalemate unless White lets the Kt 's file free again . This end-game can only be won if the stronger King can assume the opposition in two moves .

Black has an extra pawn on the Queen 's side . But as it is doubled , the material superiority is of no account . A perceptible advantage , however , lies in the fact that White can not bring about a " forced move " position , as Black has the move P-QB4 in reserve . White has also an infinitesimal weakness on the King 's side , the Rook 's pawn having advanced two squares and being therefore an easy mark . This disadvantage soon becomes apparent . 1 .

K-R2 K-B3 If Black were to play P-R5 at once , White would reply with 8 . K-R3 , and after PxP , 9 . KxP . Black would have to give up the spare move P-B4 , to gain the square at B5 for his King . The game then would be drawn after 10 . K-Kt2 ! K-B5 , 11 . K-B2 , because White maintains the opposition , and Black can not get through at K6 or Kt6 . Black therefore manoeuvres his King first in such a way that the square at his B4 is only reached when the White King is at Kt3. 8 . K-Kt2 K-Kt3 9 .

K-B2 K-B5 The White King can not move to Kt2 now , because in that case Black would move the King to the White QBP and queen in seven moves , and White , after seven moves , would only have the KB pawn at B7. 13 .

K-K3 P-B4 and wins , for White can not hold the KBP now , but must capture the KtP in exchange for it , after which the Black King reaches the Queen 's side two moves ahead , e.g. : 15 .

But he can not maintain it after Black 's K-R6 because the square at Q3 for distant opposition is not accessible . After 16 . K-Q2 , K-R7 ! ; 17 . K-K3 , K-Kt6 ; 18 . K-K2 , K-Kt7 ; 19 .

For this reason Kt-Q 2 , for instance , could not be played instead of the move in the text , because 3 . Kt-K5 would follow . Black now can not exchange , of course , otherwise the position would resolve itself to an easy end game win similar to the one in Diagram 56 . There would be nothing left but Kt-Kt1 to oppose the threat of Kt-B6ch , and this would get the Knight entirely out of play , so that White could queen the passed pawn easily after 4 . K-Kt6. 3 .

White would take up a position on the Knight 's file with the King , and push on the Rook 's pawn . The isolated pawns are then an easy prey .

We must throughout maintain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be forced on us by exchanges . On the other hand , as soon as we have gained an advantage sufficient to secure the victory in the end-game , we must ourselves , by the exchange of pieces , try to reduce the position to one of the typical elementary cases which we have discussed . Now it will invariably be found that beginners are unwilling to make these essential exchanges . This is explained by the attraction which combinations involving the action of many pieces have for them . They assume that exchanges , particularly of the Queens , make the games dull . Such ideas only prove that the beginner has not grasped the nature of chess , the essence of which is stern logic and uncompromising conclusions , and this demands the shortest and clearest way leading to a mate . To the strong player , able to play logically , logic will always be inseparable from beauty in chess . To play logically means to subordinate all combinations to a leading plan of campaign , but there is difficulty in finding the latter . An unsound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can of course be of no value . All the same it is better than no plan at all . And in time one gains by experience , and develops a sort of instinct for rejecting from the large number of possible operations all those which , properly countered , can not bring any advantage . Beside practical play , which is essential in order to gain this instinct , a methodical theoretical instruction is of inestimable value , and accelerates the development of the student 's mind . Now the instruction I wish to give in the THEORY of chess will not take the form of an ANALYSIS , brought up right into the middle game , of the various openings , tested and found correct in master play . Such collections erroneously bear the title of " Theory of the Openings , " and are , besides , quite useless at this stage , since they only embody the results of ANALYSIS . It is first necessary to ascertain a few leading principles , which can be taught in a most simple manner , by the exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of long-winded analysis . The student will no longer need to discover time-worn maxims in the light of his own weary experience , and on the other hand , these principles will help him to understand analysis , and to keep clearly before his mind 's eye the common and principal lines of play , of which he might easily lose sight in the labyrinth of suggested variations . I propose to show the application of such principles to master play , and this will give us a further opportunity of deeper study , both of the rules set out in the first part for conducting the opening correctly , and of the end-game principles , which should be well considered . I have made the pawn skeleton with its attendant grouping of pieces the main consideration in the study of the opening ; now in the investigation of the problems of the middle game , I will start from the TRANSFORMATION which the pawn skeleton has to undergo in the course of further operations . In my opinion this is the best starting-point for the choice of effective manoeuvres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolve a practical scheme we must have under consideration the following important points : How do we know if an attack is likely to succeed ? In other words : On what point should I concentrate the attack ? It should be clear to all that it is of no possible use to direct an attack on anything that can move away . Yet beginners frequently infringe this obvious rule , and I have often witnessed manoeuvres such as these ( Diagram 90 ) :  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #B #Q #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #P #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #Kt #P #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #B #P  --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --  - 4 B P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 Kt P Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R B Q R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 90 1 .

Meanwhile Black will have played P-QR3 , to make a loophole for his B at R2 , and what is the result ? The Black Bishop is as effectual at R2 as at B4 , but White has advanced his pawns , and weakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , White has used up five moves to achieve his aim , whilst Black only needed three . Therefore Black has gained two moves , which he can use for the development of his pieces . Diagram 91 illustrates another mistake frequently made in the choice of an objective , and one which can utterly spoil the whole game , even in its earliest stage .

The latter prevents the Bishop from occupying a desirable square at his QB4 , and also makes the liberating move P-Q4 impossible . Therefore it would seem desirable to drive the Queen away . But this should only be done if it is not attended by some further disadvantage . Now the average player is not particularly fastidious in his methods . The Queen irritates him , therefore the Queen must be repelled one way or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Queen selects another good square , for instance at K3 or QR4 , but Black has not improved matters , for he still can play neither B-B4 nor P-Q4 . On the other hand , irredeemable harm has been done , inasmuch as the Black QP now remains " backward . " The attack on the Queen by P-QB4 must consequently be rejected . Sallies such as these , in which short-lived attacks are made by pawns upon pieces , are always of doubtful value . They must unquestionably be avoided if they break up the pawn skeleton , which is formed in the opening , and confine the mobility of the pieces . Also with regard to manoeuvres of PIECES , intended solely to drive away an opposing piece , it is obviously essential that the attacking pieces in effecting their purpose should not be made to stray too far afield , lest they become out of play . I shall delay dealing with the features underlying good forms of attack , both by pieces and pawns , until I have treated of the choice of an objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that the subject of an attack should be incapable of evasion . Should it , in the course of attack , be desired to prevent a PIECE from being moved , that can only be effected by means of a " pin . " A PAWN , however , can be held in place either by occupying the square immediately in front of it , or by controlling the latter with more forces than the opponent can bring to bear upon it .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #Q #R #B #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P P B  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P Q P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 92 The last two diagrams exemplify this . If in Diagram 91 Black makes the mistake of playing P-QB4 as suggested , the backward QP becomes a welcome objective for White 's attack . White can keep that pawn back by playing P-Q B4 as soon as it threatens to advance , after which he would develop quietly , double his Rooks , and bring the Q and QB to bear in a concentrated attack on Q6 . A position not unlike that in Diagram 92 will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times as it is attacked , but in which White can bring up his KP to the attack , as the QP can not move away , whilst Black has no further defensive move at his disposal . Play against a backward pawn nearly always develops on these lines , and is even easier when there is no defending B of the same colour as the pawn . ( See p. 40 , and Game No. 26 . ) Such manoeuvres , in the course of which pieces are pinned and attacked , are illustrated in Diagram 90 . The most obvious move , which initiates an attack and at the same time completes the development of the minor pieces , is B-Kt5 . Attacks by means of such devices are so frequent and varied that it will be necessary to treat them at some length , which I now propose to do . I should also add that , with regard to Diagram 90 , the student will derive lasting benefit from a thorough study of the position , and will thus improve his power to judge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagonals , doubled pawns , etc . After B-KKt5 , the threat is to attack the Knight a second and third time with Kt-Q5 , and Q-B3 , after moving the KKt away . As Black 's KKt is only supported twice , and there is no chance of bringing up more forces for its defence , Black must undertake something to provide against the threatened onslaught . The most natural plan is to develop the QB at K3 , from where it can be exchanged for the Knight should Kt-Q5 be played . The doubled pawn , which White could force by exchanging the Bishops , is in no way detrimental to Black 's game . On the contrary , the opening of the file for the Rook , with the attendant chance of playing P-Q4 supported by the doubled pawn , gives Black the advantage . The doubled pawn which Black obtains after 2 . Kt-Q5 , BxKt ; 3 . PxB ( or 3 . BxB ) , Kt-K2 ; 4 . BxKt , would also be of no help to White . The apparent weakness created in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the KtP does not assist White in this case , because the pieces which could take advantage of such a weakness , the QB and the Kt at Q5 , have been exchanged . There only remains the KKt and the Q for an immediate attack , whilst the Black Rook will soon get into effective action on the open Knight 's file , e.g. 5 . Q-Q2 , K-R1 ; 6 . Q-R6 , Kt-Kt3 ; 7 . Kt-R4 , KtxKt ; 8 . QxKt , Q-K2 , followed by the doubling of the Rooks on the Kt file . Considerations of a similar nature would tend to show that 1 . B-Kt5 , Kt-K2 ; 2 . BxKt , PxB is in favour of Black . The White QB , which is so effective in taking advantage of weaknesses at Black 's KB3 and R3 , has been exchanged . The Queen 's Knight is not available for attack on the KBP , as it would be exchanged or else driven off in time by P-B3 . Compared with the position considered above , which occurs after 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the further advantage of maintaining his QB , which makes it possible to push the weak KBP on to his fourth , and either exchange it or push it still further to B5 , a useful and secure position . Matters would be different were Black to allow his King 's wing to be broken up without getting rid of White 's dangerous pieces by exchanges . Let us consider what happens , if Black takes no measures against Kt-Q5 , but only prevents White 's ultimate Q-B3 by pinning the Knight with B-KKt5 . White gains a decisive advantage by bringing his Queen into play before Black is able to secure himself against the threatened combined attack of Q and B , or alternately Q and Kt by K-R1 , R-Kt1-Kt3 . I will give two examples of how the whole game now centres on the attack and defence of the points weakened by the disappearance of the KtP , and how White pushes home his advantage in the one instance with the help of the B , in the other by the co-operation of the Kt. @# I. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 3 . Q-Q2 , BxKt ? ; 4 . BxKt , PxB ; 5 . Q-R6 , and there is no reply to the threat of KtxPch and QxP mate , except through the sacrifice of the Q. Forcing the exchange of Knights is of no avail , for after 5 . ... Kt-K7ch ; 6 . K-R1 , BxPch ; 7 . KxB , Kt-B5ch ; 8 . KtxKt , PxKt ; 9 . K-R1 , White occupies the Kt file first and wins easily : 9 . ... K-R1 ; 10 . R-KKt1 , R-KKt1 ; 11 . RxR , QxR ; 12 . R-KKt1 followed by mate or loss of the Queen . II . 3 . Q-Q2 , P-B3 ; 4 . KtxKtch , PxKt ; 5 . B-R4 ! BxKt ; 6 . Q-R6 , Kt-K7ch ; 7 . K-R1 , BxPch ; 8 . KxB , Kt-B5ch ; 9 . K-R1 , Kt-Kt3 . Now Black has succeeded in interrupting the White Queen 's action on the BP . But it has taken many moves , with the sole result that Black 's Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , occupy the positions they took up in the opening . The Black Knight , moreover , is only supported by the RP until Black manages to block the White Bishop 's diagonal by P-Q4 . Meanwhile White has gained a big start , and is ready to occupy the open file with his Rooks . The sequel might be : 10 . P-Q4 ! , BxP ( if PxP ; 11 . P-K5 ! ! , QPxP ; 12 . R-KKt1 , etc. ) ; 11 . P-B3 , B-Kt3 ; 12 . QR-Q1 , K-R1 ; 13 . R-KKt1 , Q-K2 ; 14 . R-Q3 , R-KKt1 ; 15 . R-R3 , R-Kt2 ( KtxB ; 16 . QxRPch ! ! ) ; 16 . R-B3 , followed by BxP ( B6 ) . Taking it all in all , we see from the foregoing that the pinning of the Black Knight can only be injurious to Black if he does not take timely measures to provide against White 's Kt-Q5 , which threatens to concentrate more forces for the attack on KB6 than Black is able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced frequent trouble through their inadequate defence of this kind of attack , try to avoid their recurrence by making such pinning moves impossible from the first and playing P-R3 on whichever side the pin is threatened . Apart from the loss of time , on which I remarked at length when discussing the opening , such pawn moves have various other drawbacks . With every pawn move it should be considered whether the squares protected by the pawn before it has moved may not need the support of that pawn at a later stage . This is particularly the case with regard to squares in front of the castled King . If one of those pawns pushes on , the squares which have lost its protection frequently offer an opening for a direct attack by the enemy 's pieces on the King . A second consideration is the fact that the advancing pawn itself becomes a target for an assault in which the opponent , moving up a pawn on the next file , brings his Rooks into play , or in which he sacrifices a piece for the advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King of the protection he sought to obtain in castling . The following examples will contribute much to the understanding of this most important subject , the grasp of which will mean a great step forward for the student . The position in Diagram 93 is from a game v. Scheve-Teichmann ( Berlin , 1907 ) . White played 1 . P-R3 in order to avoid the pinning of his Knight through B-Kt5 . The move is not unjustified , as the Knight is required for the support of the square at Q4 . The pawn move , however , has the drawbacks enumerated above , and White must think of keeping a sufficiency of pieces for the fight on the King 's wing , in order to prevent Black from utilising the weakness thus created for a combined assault by superior forces .  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #B #K #Kt #R  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #Kt #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5 P #P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 B P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 P Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R Kt B Q R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 93 In this case White does not take precautionary measures , and succumbs in a surprisingly short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With this move White opens the diagonal for Black 's KB for no apparent reason . 2 . ...

In cases where both sides have already castled on the same wing , and the opponent has weakened his position by pushing on one of the pawns of that wing , it is seldom advisable to start an attack with the advance of one of the pawns in front of the King , as the latter 's position would be weakened . An attack of this kind is only justified if there is a prospect of concentrating with all speed a superior force before the opponent has time for a counter attack .

The prospects are that White will be able to bring home his attack , before Black has a chance of forcing exchanges and of bringing about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably turn to his advantage . The play ( E. Cohn-Ed . Lasker match , Berlin , 1909 ) is instructive , and shows how the attack should be conducted in such positions . 1 . Kt-Kt3 , B-Kt2 ; 2 . K-R2 , P-B3 ; 3 . R-KKt1 , Kt-Q2 ; 4 . Kt-R4 , K-B2 . The concentration of the White pieces has become alarming , and threatens to be continued by Q-Q2 , R-Kt2 . QR-KKt1 , and Kt-B5 . So the Black King decides on flight , but he finds no peace on the Q side either , because there his advanced pawns soon allow White to make a breach in the Black position . 5 . Kt-Kt2 , K-K2 ; 6 . Q-K2 , Kt-Kt3 ; 7 . KR-KB1 , B-B1 . It is Black 's intention to play P-B4 as soon as practicable , and to make an attempt at a counter demonstration on the King 's side , 8 . P-K B4 , K-Q1 ? ( Black should have kept to his original intention and played P-B4 ) ; 9 . PxP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P-QR4 ; B-Kt2 ; 12 . PxP , PxP ; 13 . RxR , BxR . Now White has achieved what he set out to do . He has opened up avenues of attack on the Queen 's side , and is ready to utilise the weakness of Black 's QBP by playing P-Kt4 , on which Black must submit to opening the file for the White KR or the diagonal for the White QB . In either case White brings vastly superior forces to bear on the Black King 's position , and Black should lose . In this game Black escaped only through a mistake on the part of his opponent . In the foregoing positions it was seen how fatal weaknesses can be , which are produced by the premature advance of the pawns in front of the King , on whom the opposing pieces can force their attack . When the pawns concerned are on the opposite wing to their King , the disadvantages of a premature advance are felt in a different way . The weakness concerns the pawns themselves and not the forces behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end-game , particularly of Rook end-games .

In the one case the chain of Black pawns is broken by the absence of K Kt P , in the other of the Q Kt P. The absence of the KKt pawn can lead to serious consequences in the middle game , because of the weakness of Black 's KB3 and KR3 ( compare Diagram 90 ) ; it can , however , hardly become awkward in the end-game , as the pawns on the B and R files are within the protecting reach of their King . @#  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 8 #R #Q #R #K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 7 #P #P #B #B #P #P #P  --   --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --   --   --   --   --  - 6 #P #P #Kt  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 5  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 4 Kt P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 3 Kt Q  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 2 P P P P P P  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - 1 R B R K  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  - A B C D E F G H Diag. 98 On the other hand , the absence of the Q Kt P is of no consequence for the middle game . There is nothing behind it which could invite an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak for the end-game , as they are quite out of reach of the King ( compare Game No. 19 ) . I do not wish to imply that Black should have avoided the exchange at his QB3 at all cost ; such an exchange has always the compensating advantage of opening a file for the Rooks , which advantage often means a favourable middle game , as will be readily understood . Further , it is often possible to get rid of the weak QRP by pushing it on , and eventually compelling the exchange of the opposing Kt P , an exchange which can usually be enforced if the Rooks have occupied the open Kt file . The pawn itself is often useful at B 3 , in that it can support the advance of P-Q 4 in the centre , should it be desired , or it can , by pushing on , be brought to exercise further pressure on the opposing Kt P.

LAZARD-ED . LASKER ( PARIS , 1914 ) Here the pawn positions on both sides are broken , and the player that occupies the open files first , gets a decisive advantage . In this case it is Black 's move . We can conclude at once that White has played the opening badly . He must have lost two moves , for he has still to capture the BP and then , being White , it should be his move . This disadvantage , small as it may seem , with which White has emerged from the opening , is sufficient to bring him into the greatest difficulties . Black , of course , does not defend the pawn by B-Kt2 or B-Q2 , as this would practically reduce the B to a P and , moreover , White , by R-Kt1 or Q1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of that , Black utilises the two moves , which he has , as it were , as a gift in an otherwise equalised position , to bring both Rooks on the Kt file . This policy allows Black to occupy the seventh or eighth rank at will , and to attack the White pawns from the flank or rear , according to circumstances . This menace hampers the radius of action of the White pieces , as they must always be ready for the defence of the threatened pawns , and this gives Black by far the superior game . The play was continued as follows : 1 . ... R-Kt1 ; 2 . BxP , R-Kt7 ; 3 . B-K4 , B-K3 ; 4 . P-QR3 , KR-Kt1 . The Knight 's file is now definitely in Black 's hands . White could occupy the Queen 's file , but the Black B at K3 , which prevents the entry of the Rooks at Q7 , makes the operation aimless . Therefore White is condemned to inactivity . On the contrary , Black 's line of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve something if White 's QBP can be deprived of its support . To do this Black has only to play P-QB4-B5 and P-KB4 . This , of course , weakens Black 's KB , and the White Rooks might obtain an entry on the K file . Therefore Black will effect a timely exchange of one of his Rooks , after which his King alone will hold the K file . These considerations make the following moves clear : 5 . KR-K1 , P-QB4 ; 6 . P-KR3 , a further awkward necessity in positions of this kind . Before the Rook can venture out , a loophole must be provided for the King . 6 . ... P-B5 ; 7 . R-K3 , R-Kt8ch ; 8 . RxR , RxRch ; 9 .

B-Q1 , B-Q4 ; 22 . R-K2 , R-R8 ; 23 . R-Q2 , R-R6 ; 24 . R-QB2 , RxRP . Now at last Black has obtained material gain , which was made possible by his command of the open Kt file . To convert it into a win by queening the extra pawn is only a matter of time . We have now seen how the possession of open files reacts on the mobility of the opposing forces , forever increasing their difficulties until the positional advantage is converted into material gain . We shall meet with cases later on in which the greater mobility of minor pieces achieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of the main general principles which I introduced at the outset . Let us now recapitulate the chief points touched upon in the course of our deliberations : 1 . Generally speaking , attacks should only be directed to objects which can not be moved away . 2 . If in particular cases the attack is aimed at driving off an opposing piece from an especially favourable post that attack is unwise , if it involves the weakening the pawn position , or if pieces have to take up inferior positions in order to effect their purpose . 3 . Pawn moves always create weaknesses , either by leaving other unsupported pawns behind , or by giving opposing pieces access to squares formerly guarded by them , and this more specially so in front of the castled King . 4 . Attacks which depend on pawn moves are only justified if overwhelming forces can be accumulated in support , as the advanced pawns might become the object of a counter attack . 5 . As pawn moves have very generally some drawbacks , the middle game is the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first consideration of sound play in the middle game is to make only such moves as do not reduce the mobility of the pieces . As illustrative of such manoeuvres I shall now give examples from actual master play . In my annotations of these games I have tried to keep before the student 's mind constantly the main ideas underlying the different combinations which spring from general strategical principles . I thus avoid burdening his memory with a mass of detail , and bring into prominence the basic principle of each line of play , thereby developing his capacity for conducting a middle game , even after an unusual opening . I have fixed mainly upon such games as are illustrative of the openings treated in the first part of this book . In most cases the first moves will , therefore , not need any special remarks . The end-games , being typical examples , will only need reference to the chapters in which they have been respectively dealt with . @# PART II ILLUSTRATIVE GAMES FROM MASTER TOURNAMENTS @# GAME No. 1 White : Tartakower .

PxP On principle this exchange can not be commended , as the opening of the Queen 's file increases the Black Queen 's mobility . White derives no benefit from the KB file so long as the Black Bishop makes castling impossible . White intends to play P-B3 and P-Q4 , but the manoeuvre is doubtful , and the whole opening includes an inordinately large number of pawn moves . In the present game Black exposes the failings inherent to this system unequivocally. 4 . ... PxP 5 . P-B3 Kt-QB3 Black can not put off White 's P-Q4 by B-KKt5 , for White can give a check with the Queen and unpin the Knight . 6 . P-QKt4 The object of this move is not clear , as P-Kt5 does not win a pawn ( Kt-R4 ; 8 . KtxP ; 9 . Q-R5ch ) . It does not promote development either , and only compromises the QBP and QKtP. 6 . ... B-Kt3 7 . B-Kt5 Kt-B3 This is aimed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural support by the QKt .

KtxKt , QxQch ; 13 . KtxQ , PxKt . Now it is not easy to find a reasonable plan for White , as Black threatens to cramp White 's game with B-Q3 and P-B5 . It is therefore necessary for White to take measures against that by playing R-B4 and B-B4 . If Black still plays B-Q3 , B-B4 follows , with the intention of exchanging and of provoking Black 's P-B4 , which leaves the QP " backward . " 8 . ... Q-KR4 9 . KtxKt B-K2 10 . B-Kt5 B-K3 11 .

A White Knight settles down at his Q6 , which is no longer guarded by the Black QBP , and paralyses the whole of Black 's game . Another factor in White 's superiority of position is the possession of the King 's file . The Black Rook can not move until the King gets a loophole by a pawn move . As we have seen , such a pawn move often affords an entry to the opposing pieces . 20 .

If after 8 . ... QKt-R4 ; 9 . B-B2 , P-B4 White plays : 10 . P-Q4 , his intention is to move his pawn further to Q5 as soon as Black has castled , and then to attack on the King 's wing with QKt-Q2-B1-K3 , P-KKt4 and Kt-B5 . For this reason Black should force White to disclose whether he intends to exchange his QP or to advance it to Q5 . In the latter case Black can refrain from castling altogether and counter-attack on the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 11 . P-KR3 , B-Q2 ; 12 . QKt-Q2 , R-QB1 ; if now : 13 .

PxP , then Black need no longer fear an attack on the King 's side after he has castled , as his Rooks will have a favourable opportunity for operating on the open Queen 's file . However , there is still the disadvantage for Black of having advanced Queen 's side pawns , which are liable to attack ( P-QR4 ) . The game takes a different course when Black exchanges the pawns in the centre . The continuation would then be : 11 . ... Kt-B3 ; 12 . Q Kt-Q2 , B-Q2 ; 13 . Kt-B1 , PxP ; 14 . PxP , PxP ; 15 .

In any case the Black Knight 's pawn is weak for the end-game . If , as in the present game . Black can play P-Kt5 , P-R4 is useless and even doubtful , as the Rook 's pawn itself may become weak in the end-game. 12 . ... B-Kt2 This causes the loss of the game . In the Ruy Lopez the Bishop is nearly always needed on the diagonal QB1-KR6 , to prevent a Knight from settling at White 's KB5 , which otherwise can not be repelled except by P-KKt3 , a most undesirable consummation . The proper continuation would have been P-Kt5 , B-K3 , Q-B2 and P-Q4 , capturing the Queen 's file .

Black has the better development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a pawn secured in the centre , Black has a Knight there which will soon be driven away . White 's Q4 , the basis of his centre , is entirely in his hands , while Black 's Q4 is exposed to a steady pressure by the White pieces . Finally Black 's Q Kt is unfavorably placed , obstructing as it does the QBP and preventing it from falling into line with its fellows . In Petrograd , 1909 , Lasker tried the following new defence : Kt-B4 followed by B-Kt5 , giving up the moves gained before in order to relieve the pressure on the Black QP and to exchange the same ultimately at Q5 . The various possibilities of the position have been discussed in connection with Diag. 22 . It may be added that after 10 . ... Castles ; QKt-Q2 is surely a better move than the usual Kt-Q4 , as the Queen 's side should be developed before undertaking an attack ( 11 . ... Q-Q2 ? ; 12 . KtxB , followed by RxKt ) . For a long time it was thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables White to make the pawn at QB7 " backward " by B-K3 . For Black must first play P-KR3 to guard his Kt against the threat of P-B3 and P-KR4 . However , a sensational innovation which refutes the Kt 's move was introduced in Breslau in 1912 . It is the following sacrifice : 10 . ... Castles ; 11 . Kt-Q4 , KtxKP ! ; 12 . P-B3 , B-Q3 ! ! ; 13 . PxKt , B-Kt5 ! ! ; 14 . Q-Q2 , Q-R5 with an overpowering attack . 10 . ... Kt-B4 11 . B-B2 B-Kt5 12 . Q Kt-Q2 Castles 13 . Kt-Kt3 Kt-K5 Here Lasker played Kt-K3 against Janowski ( Paris , 1912 ) , but it proved to be inferior , because 14 . Q-Q3 disorganises Black 's King 's side forcibly . The move in the text is not really a pawn sacrifice . After 14 . BxKt , PxB ; 15 . QxQ , QRxQ ; 16 . KKt-Q4 , KtxKt ; 17 . KtxKt , R-Q4 , White can not play 18 .

This loses the QBP , and weakens the QP . Black might have tried BxKt ; 17 . QxB , B-Q3 . It would then have been possible to support the QP by P-B3 after moving the Kt away . If Black was anxious to preserve his two Bishops he would even have risked P-Kt3 . After 17 . B-R6 , R-B2 , the Bishop could have been driven away again by the KKt from Kt1 or Kt5 . The open file offered some compensation and chances of counter attack . 17 . BxP Q-Q2 Not QxB because of QxPch. 18 . Kt-K5 KtxKt 19 . BxKt B-R5 RxP is bad because of 20 . RxKt , B-KB4 ; 21 .

Black has a Rook and two pawns for two minor pieces , a slight advantage for the end-game , but as yet there is no thought of an end-game . White , in possession of two Bishops , with an open Queen 's file on which the Black King stands , has good attacking chances , and most masters would think the position favourable for White . 14 . ...

With two Bishops , White would then have winning chances . A subtle idea underlies White 's move of P-KKt4 . He wishes to take advantage of the fact that Black has exchanged the KB by playing P-Kt5 , thus holding all the four pawns on the King 's side . But Black finds a surprising reply , which seems to refute White 's plan . Capablanca played against Ed . Lasker ( New York , 1915 ) , 17 . P-KKt4 , P-KKt3 ; 18 . K-Kt3 , P-KR4 ; 19 .

A draw would then be practically certain , with the Bishops of opposite colours . Black probably thought White would not risk weakening his KP by P-B5 .

It shuts in the Bishop , and allows B-B4 , exchanging the Black QB . 12 . ... P-QKt3 The diagonal QR1-KR8 is the only one in which the Bishop has any prospects of action .

It had been abandoned because White , by playing R-K1 , P-Q4 , and eventually B-B1 and B-R3 , forces the exchange of Black 's centre pawn , and obtains an advantage , on well-known grounds .

Kt-Kt5 The intention is to strengthen the centre by P-QB3 . Though it takes a number of moves to bring the Knight into play again , yet most of the tournament games in this variation have been won by White , mostly through a King 's side attack on the lines set out in the notes to Game No. 22 . Investigations by Alapin tend to show that this is due to the fact that Black in all cases devoted his attention to Queen 's side operations ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have utilised White 's backward development , by himself starting a counter attack on the King 's side . He can then either aim at the White centre at once with P-KB3 , or else play P-KB4 and prepare the advance of the KKtP by Kt-B3-Q1-B2 . These various lines of play are still under discussion . Simple development is probably preferable to the move in the text , e.g. 7 . B-Q3 , Castles ; 8 . P-B4 , P-QB4 ; 9 . Kt-B3. 7 . ... K-Q1 There can be no advantage in forfeiting the option of castling unless there be no other way of getting the King into safety and of bringing the Rooks into concerted action . It is obvious that otherwise the free development of pieces is hindered , and the King is in appreciable danger , for it is easier to open files in the centre than on the wings where the pawns have not advanced yet . Therefore Kt-Kt3 is the only move worth considering . 8 . P-QB3 P-KB3 9 . PxP With the Black King remaining in the centre , White has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K5 .
