At that time Mr. Keene was Just coming out of the anaesthetic , and Drs . James P. Tuttle and St. Clair Smith , who performed the operation , were still in attendance .

For the last three years . ever since the collapse , in January , 1910. of the Columbus &; Hocking pool , of which Mr. Keene was manager , he has been in ill health and has spent much of his time abroad . For six months after the collapse of the brokerage firms of T. M. Fiske &; Co. , Lathrop , Haskins &; Co. , and Roberts , Hall &; Criss , all of whom went down with the Hocking manipulations , Mr. Keene spent most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climate seemed to be doing him much good and that he was on his way to recovery from a malady that ! had long afflicted him . His favorite motto , " When I enter a race I never figure on getting left at the post , " was-much quoted during the bankruptcy proceedings of the brokerage houses involved in the pool crash . The motto , which was said to explain his management of the pool , was quoted in eon ' nection with charges that lie sold the Pool out while the selling was at its best . These charges were never fully substantiated in court , as Mr. Keene settled with creditors for $400,000 and did not take the stand . Operation in London in 1011 . After leaving Italy Mr. Keene went to London , where in the Summer of 1911 he was forced to undergo an operation . At that time his condition was reported to he serious , and many doubts were expressed whether he ever would be able to return to this country . He rallied , however , and in October returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his apartments at the Waldorf-Astoria . A nurse was kept constant13 ' in attendance , and while reports that he was seriously ill were steadily denied he was seldcm able to move about unassisted . To add to his physical ailments Mr. Keene underwent a severe shock a short time ago when his valet , Frank Fissler , who had been with him for many years , committed suicide . Mr. Keene 's illness became so serious on Monday that he was removed at the instance of Foxhall Keene to Miss Alston 's private hospital . The removal was made against ins own wish , as he ridiculed the assertions of the doctors that he was in a critical condition . Him Escape from Burning Hotel . The last time Mr. Keene figured conspicuously in the news was when he Participated as a guest of the Hotel Carlton in London in a sensational escape during the fire which destroyed the hotel in 1011 . With other well-known Americans he fled from the hotel wrapped in a blanket and suffered as a consequence a severe shock to his nerves . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance in the Street as a " lamb " waiting for Jay Gould 's shearing until his final direc ' tion of the Columbus , n Hocking pool in 1910 . During that time he made and lost several fortunes that ran well up into the millions . When his genius as a pool manager first gained general recognition many brokers and investors were willing to follow his leadership . But most of them learned to their sorrow that when Mr. Keene ' managed a pool he usually came out a winner , while those who were associated with him often came out as losers . He was the last of a generation of men who manipulated stocks as a fierce game to be played as a sporting proposition , and without any quarter whatever to others engaged in it . Born in London in MS. , Mr. Keene came to this country with his parents in 1852 and settled in California . His father tried gold mining , but gave it up after deciding he had reached the gold fields too late to make a real strike in the worked-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as the main dependence of the family in a. period of want . He went to work as a tender of horses at Fort Reading , and it was there that his love for horses , which , next to his love for speculation , was his chief passion , first gained possession of him . Failed in Prospecting Venture . He saved his wages , and after his father had established himself d 's a Shasta County merchant , the son invested all his savings in a mule and a prospector 's outfit . He lost his entire investment , but the older miners who laughed at him recalled years afterward that even in this first - mining adventure young Keene demonstrated that he had a habit of " coming back . " He went to work again , saved another grub stake , and with the proceeds he bought horses and mules which he put to work on the Overland trail . With the income from this source he started out to prospect again on a more stable basis . This time he did n't have to quit when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to rush into any district where a. heavy strike was reported . He became interested in a Shasta . County newspaper , but when the news came that the Comstock lode had been discovered in Nevada he was among the // J. R. KEENE DIES AFTER OPERATION // first to rush to the new camp on the eastern slope of the Sierras . His first clean-up brought him 510,000 in cash , and he was then graduated permanently into the class of investing capitalists . He took his easily won money to San Francisco , where he planned at first to build a career for himself as a lawyer . But the Stock Exchange interested him more than law books . He became a dealer in stocks , and in a short time had lost all the wealth he had brought over the mountains from Nevada . But he learned something about stock deals while he was losing , and soon he was back at the curb , this time on a " shoestring furnished by Senator Felton . He won for a time . and Senator Felton bought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he allowed him to use on credit . He became at once a bull before the public and a bear in private operations , of which the public was not so well aware . With each turning of a favorite stock from its high point Keene began to reap a harvest from orders placed weeks before the break . The Old Gray Fox . The shrewdness which he displayed in escaping from the crash in which many of the favorite mining ' stocks were overwhelmed brought him the title of the " Old Gray Fox of the Stock Exchange . " He rose rapidly in the esteem of other stock manipulators and soon became one of California 's most conspicuous rich men and President of the Stock Exchange . He specialized in Comstock Lode and in Bonanza stocks , and from these two sources alone was reputed to have harvested $3,000,000 from stock purchasers . And when the crash came at the end of the days of extravagant speculation it was said . that he ? gathered up another $31/99,000 , while7he watched the Bank tit California sink ' into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip he undertook after the Columbus Hocking operation was suggested to him as about the right thing following the collapse of the Bank of California . Mr. Keene came East with the intention of going right through New York and continuing to Liverpool . But he heard stories about Jay Gould . The legend in Wall Street is 4o the effect that when some one pointed out Jay Gould to him he remarked that he had a few millions with him and would stop awhile to take toe " Wizard 's " scalp . Whatever the facts ere as to the motive , Keene forsook his European voyage and settled down with a fund of $0,041,000 to lay siege to Gould 's financial power . He , handled a commitment of 10,011 ) shares of ! New York Central and smashed the stock . for a. profit of $250,000 . This was a stock chiefly owned by Gould 's traditional enemies . the Vanderbilts , and the new  --  omer 's fling at it pleased Gould , or outward- ; 1Y seemed to please him . Gould made overtures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock of the Western Union Telegra.ph Company . in this venture - Keene came out as a " shorn lamb , " much to the amusement of Gould 's friends . They told how he had come 03 Wall Street to get the " Wizard 's " scalp and had himself been scalped . Nobody knew just how much ' Keene lost , but it was enough to make him start a bitter fight against Gould . At the feud 's height Major .1 . R. Selover , a personal follower of Keene , picked Gould up and dropped him down an areaway in New Street . back of a building standing on the site where the Knickerbocker Trust Company now is . By 1SSO ' Keene had built up his personal - fortune through the orc , anization of a number of pools to about 510,000,000 . Then he conceived an idea of cornering the wheat market , and , like many another speculator who has dreamed such a dream , he paid heavily for his attempt . Jay Gould did not forget the humiliation of his descent into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Keene was planning his corner on the market , and at the time Keene most needed a steady control Gould stepped in with heavy selling operations . lie smashed Keene 's corner and at the same time took away most of his accumulated wealth . in 1.1 ' 44 Keene failed and was forced to retire from active stock market operations . But of course he would not restrain his fever to speculate , and although Gould and Russell Sage kept after . hire , he picked up a little money here and there until in the early his he was again a figure to lie reckoned with in Wall Street . He formed a pool in the stock of the National Cordage Company , and ran its stock up to $140 a share front a nominal quotation . When the break came keene was about the only member of the pool who did not suffer . He kept right on with his manipulations , and was soon in an alliance with the Havemeyers and bulled sugar for three years with much profit to himself . In 1901 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was selected by J. P. Morgan to place , its stock among investors . He was busily engaged at this task when E. 1-1 , Harriman commenced to purchase both preferred and common Northern Pacific stock . Harriman bought Northern Pacific with none to suspect him until suddenly the firm of J. P. Morgan &; Co. found that a majority of the railroad 's stock was In Harriman 's possession . The first result , as everybody . lEnows , was a sudden order to James R. Keene to purchase 125,000 shares of Northern R. g. - cific . And the second result was May.9 , 1901 . Keene emerged from the great day of the Northern Pacific corner wealthier than he had been iii years , but Steel common was suffering somewhat from-lack of attention . He was able to rally ' it slightly , and while most stock brokers looked on with admiration , Harriman was making a close study of the man he was all but to crush a few years later .

Keene struck the stone wall Harriman had prepared for him and suffered severely from the collision . The Stock Exchange house of Talbot J. Taylor . his son-in-law , went out of business . and it was rumored that Keene was hard up and out of Wall Street . That was in 1903 . In 1905 Henry H. Rogers employed Keene to take charge of an upward movement in Amalgamated Copper . He carried the stock to PO and retired with the assurance to Mr. Rogers that the stock could not be forced up higher . But Rogers employed another manager and forced it up to lam This was the last large operation in which Keene fissured until he came to the su ? fnee of the Columbus 6 : : tioeltin ; manipuir7ions as manager et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except Keene . in all of his years of devotion to the turf probably nothing . stood out so Prominently as his ownership of Sysonby , whose skeleton now adorns a special pedestal in the Museum of Natural H W Pry .
