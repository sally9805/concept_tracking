txt The strike of the drivers in the Street Cleaning Department spread yesterday from the night and day shifts of drivers until it included also practically all of the sweepers in the department . Commissioner Edwards devoted most of his attention to distributing the force of strikebreakers already on duty and preparing to use the 1,000 he expects to have this morning . He sent to various stables cooking stoves and cots , and bales of straw to be used in " bedding them down . " Few strike-breakers were sent out for duty yesterday , and these encountered , wherever they went , mobs of men and boys keenly in sympathy with the strikers . There were scores of small riots throughout the day which turned a grist of prisoners , mostly strikers , into the Police Courts , and there was one serious riot in which Ferdinand Bublltz , a strikebreaker , received with full force a brick chimney which had been wrenched loose from the top of a tenement house and dropped from the roof upon his head . The bricks fractured the strikebreaker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the J. Flood Wright Xiospital . Mrs. Mary Bublitz of 44 Sixteenth Street , Brooklyn , went to J.

Two negroes seen running away from the tenement from which the bricks were thrown were taken into custody , and a representative from the District Attorney 's office was sent to make an investi-gation : In Manhattan yesterday a few loads of refuse were taken away from the vicinity lof 120th Street and Broadway , and a few loads gathered on the lower east side . As the garbage has remained along the curbing , mostly in uncovered cans , since noon on Wednesday , it has become the source of many complaints . In apartment houses complications have arisen , for janitors are at a loss to know what to do with their accumulation of ashes and garbage . Many janitors overturned the garbage cans in the streets and refilled them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furnace rooms they piled ashes in the streets and in the areaways ' and in rear lots where such were available . In Brooklyn 125 men who remained at work and 250 strikebreakers took out 125 ash carts . The usual supply of carts is 600 and while those in service helped materially they did not cover more than onefourth of the borough . There was little molestation of the workers . In the other boroughs little garbage was collected . Health Commissioner Lederle has no intention of interfering in the situation . He believes Commissioner Edwards is doing all he can and ought to be let alone to solve the situation in his own way . Talk of Extending the Strike . The question of how far the strike is likely to spread was discussed both at strike headquarters , in West Forty-ninth Street , and in the City Hall . Mayor Gaynor denied there was any strike , declaring that there was only the task in hand of filling the places of " some mean and arrogant men " who had quit their city work , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to demonstrate what his strikebreakers can do . He urged that patience be shown with slow removal of ashes for a few days , but expressed his confidence in his ability to break the strike by Monday . He admitted that the department was badly crippled , and that practically no progress - was made yesterday toward bettering conditions . Of the 5,200 strikebreakers ordered only 200 were supplied , and many of these refused to work after one of their number had been killed . At strike headquarters the question was considered of whether to call for a general strike of all drivers in the city out of sympathy for the Street Department drivers . The decision to call out the street sweepers was made immediately after a statement by Mayor Gaynor reached strike headquarters . In this statement the Mayor declared that the " city would knuckle down to nobody . " The statement was read to delegates from the twenty-five Street Department barns in Manhattan , the Bronx , and Brooklyn , and to delegates from the sweepers , who had come in to tender what assistance seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Mayor 's statement , asked for the privilege of joining the strike . They said they would have every sweeper off the streets by this morning , and succeeded in getting several hundred men to abandon their brooms before quitting time yesterday . These augmented a force of 600 sweepers who had struck without waiting for orders on the grounds that they would not sweep up refuse for " scab drivers " to haul away . The Mayor 's Statement . In his statement which roused the ire of the strike leaders Mayor Gaynor said : The cib ? officials are not trying to " break " any strike . The drivers of the ash and garbage wagons have quit their Jobs and their places are being filled . They are not to be taken back . The Commissioner could not take them back if he wanted to . He can employ such men only from the Civil Service list . When men in city departments quit they are struck from the Payroll and their employment with the city la at an end . Toeir places have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ever can be employed by the city again unless they undergo Civil Service examinations and get on the Civil Service lists again That the Civil Service Board would ever permit them to get on the list again is Inconceivable . None of them will get back . The labor leaders who came to see me demanded that the City of New York cease to remove garbage and mines at night . I told them the day removal caused gereral complaint throughout the city of ashes flying in the faces and eyes and on the clothes of people and of the snug ' of the garbage : that we therefore ? changed to night removal , as is the method in many or most cities here and , abroad . Then they said that the city should have two men to each cart instead of one , and that the men should be paid more . They said the job was too lonely for one man in the dark Winter nights . They also said the job was too cold at night , although the work ought to keep any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be discontinued . I also reminded them that the case was not like employment by a private individual , that the Commissioner could only employ the number of men provided for in the budget , that he could not spend money which had not been appropriated for him , that the men were in public employment , and that the cans are made , of a size for one man to handle , not two . I also pointed out to them that the men worked only eight hours a day , and were paid much the highest wages I paid anywhere for such service . It was all useless . These men are bent on making the officials and the people of this city knuckle down to them . The householders of this city will bear any inconvenience before they will allow that . It is the meanest and most arrogant piece of business ever known . The city is paying these men wages far higher than they get elsewhere , and we also had a pension bill passed for them last Winter . And yet they turn around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to nobody , but will treat everybody justly . Plan to Cripple the City . Strike Organizer Ashton , after calling out the sweepers , appealed to the Central Federated Union for assistance . He said ' lie would appeal to the union at its secret meeting last night , for a boycott order I against all public bundings , especially the City Hall , forbidding union drivers to I deliver coal to it . He said he would urge that every possible act of reprisal be set In motion against the Mayor until his advisers should succeed in showing him that lie was taking a course . much ' ' more unwise than to announce that here ' after garbage removal will be forbidden between the hours of 10 P. M. and 0 A. and that all drivers should report for day shifts only . In response to a suggestion offered by C. De Witt Clark , a lawyer of 100 Broadway Mr. Ashton said that the strikers I would circulate petitions to-day asking Mayor Gaynor to recede from his stand . Mr. De Witt gave it as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : At Mr. Ashton 's suggestion a committee ' was appointed to wait upon the Board of ' Estimate with a petition asking the hoard to take action on the ground that a vast amount of money Is involved in the plan to use strikebreakers at $5 a day , working three men to a wagon , whereas regular drivers work singly , and that it is unfair to the taxpayers to force them to pay this large extra sum . Another committee was appointed to visit the Board of Health to see if Commissioner Lederle can not be induced to take action on account of the city 's health . For to-night a general mass meeting is scheduled of drivers in department and other stores to take a vote on the question of going out because of their own grievance and out of sympathy for the street cleaners . Mr. Ashton said he expected these drivers to vote to go out , and possibly precipitate a general strike of drivers throughout the city . Commissioner Edwards denied that the strikebreakers were getting $5 a day . He said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Many of the strikebreakers demanded money last night , declaring they would quit if it was not furnished . They were told that pay day is next Wednesday and that nothing would be doing until then . " Some of the more insistent had several dollars advanced to them . That the city is determined to do without their services was impressed upon the strikers when they sent some of their number to Stable C , where strikebreakers are being employed , to seek employment . In each case the appliacnt was told he had forfeited his job and would never be taken back . The strike leaders hoped to place enough of their men to keep in touch with the progress of the strikebreaking movement . One Killed , Many Hurt in Riots ..
