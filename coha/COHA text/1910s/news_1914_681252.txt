txt The Controller of the Currency has asked the banks an elaborate series of questions for the sake of getting information for the use of the Federal Reserve system . Pending the replies of the banks the best information on this line of thought is to he found in THE ANNALIST 'S analysis of the accounts of five leading banks of this city . It was already known that ninetenths of the business of the country was done by checks . This proportion grows with the proportions of the business done . Of the deposits in these five leading banks not even 1 per cent . is in cash It is new knowledge that 29 per cent . of the checks deposited are on the banks which paY them . That is to say , the biggest bank business is done by a mere offsetting of book entries , no currency being used . Two-thirds of the business of these banks was done in the same way , through the Clearing House . Not less surprising and important is the extent to which out-oftown banks transact their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The business of these banks averaged but a little less than $100,000,000 daily for ten days , or something short of a billion . Of that total the items of exchange received for settlement otherwise than through the Clearing House were even smaller than the amount of cash received on deposit , being only $6,420,657 of inland exchange . Only one bank reported any checks drawn for exchange on interior institutions . Substantially the entire demand for inland exchange was for exchange at New York by the interior and not for exchange elsewhere by New York . No checks were received for payment otherwise than through the Clearing House . The service done to bankers by the collection of these facts is only inferior to the service proposed by the Controller of the Currency . They go to the heart of one of the critical points of the Federal Reserve system. , One of the unsettled things is how far it will set up its own clearing system , and dispense with the clearing system analyzed by T rS ANNALIST . It has seemed to some that the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more useful to those using its facilities , for which there has been no substitute . It was necessarily efficient , for Inefficiency would be intolerable . But there were features of clearing familiar abroad , and even In some cities of the ' - United States , which were neglected by the New York Clearing House . What is to be its attitude toward the clearing functions of the Federal Reserve system , which for the first time proposes an alternative ? Will it enter and possess the field , completing its monopoly ? Or will It allow the establishment of a second system of clearing , either for metropolttan or national checks ? It is needless to argue for the completeness and efficiency of the clearing system . It is equally plain that both the Federal Reserve and the New York Clearing House systems have their deficiencies . Either might use the other . The present system has the larger capacity for inclusion of all banking elements . Competition between them would be uneconomic because unnecessary . It is none too soon for the subject to be under consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be useful this crop season . As to the possibility of the interior dispensing with the banking facilities of New York , whatever the decision on this point , ive leave the interior to draw its own conclusions on the facts now available to it .
