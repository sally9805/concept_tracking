txt United States District Judge Hand pronounced Martin J. Condon , President of the American Snuff Company , a bankrupt Yesterday . Condon was the associate of William J. Cummins , Joseph B. Reichmann , and Charles A. Moore , in the Carnegie Trust Company and other corporations . He was a Director in the Carnegie Trust Company , which collapsed , and his affairs became involved following the closing of the Carnegie Trust Company . For more than sixteen months Condon , reinforced by some of his judgment creditors , has been fighting the attempt to throw him into bankruptcy . Judgments of $120,000 were taken against him , most of which were mule Ilene on . his real estate The creditors who desired to put him into bankruptcy succeeded when they proved that he had been paying 3600 as a Monthly allowance to his grown-up son , and 31,000 a month to his wife for household expenses . Condon asserted that both payments were for the support of his family , and so were exempt under the bankruptcy law . He pleaded that he should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accustomed , since it had grown necessary to him . Judge Hand &pond'; of this contention thus : " A man must consent to live in niggardly fashion if he leaves his debts unpaid , and the hardship which it involves is one of the . considerations he must weigh when he incurs debts . There are few greater scandals in the law than for a man to live handsomely while his creditors get nothing . If he would discharge his debts , let him go through bankruptcy ; that Is what the law allows , but to continue to withhold from existing creditors enough to live in a way which to nineteen . out of twenty men seems not only great comfort but incredible luxury is intolerable . in a community which professes at least not to recognize social classes . " Hven if Condon had actually used in living what ho withdrew , I should therefore be , in the absencf , of controlling authority , unwilling to agree that the sum of 31.600 was necessary for the use of his family for tho ensuing month  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due , out of which he might again . reserve what was necessary . " Condon contended that the continuance of his son 's allowance was a family necessity . Judge Hand said on this point : " Quite clearly an adult son , though incapable of self-support , has no right to his Parents ' support . Such duties as exist are defiled at present in Section 914 of the " Penal Code . These duties only require . a , parent to support an adult child ' in the way which the Overseers of the Poor may require , and that obviously has no application to an allowance of the size which Condon was , making to his son . However , it does not , of course necessarily follow that an adult son may not be a member of the ' family ' because the father owed him no legal duty of support . It is not necessary hi this case to decide more than when neither duty nor communal living exist there Is no family within the meaning of the New York law . Certainly It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held off indefinitely while he supports adult children who have left his roof and are supporting separate households . " Judge Hand also made a searching analysis of Condon 's atontention that the $1,000 a month allowance to Mrs. Condon was for necessities , observing : " It is quite apparent that it , In fact , exceeded the necessities of the family , because part of It she gave away in charitable uses and more than half she very honestly turned . back to the receiver . Surely a debtor may not put generosity to the Church ahead of his obligations to his creditors , nor may he give away a round sum to make sure that there may be enough for liberal living meanwhile . Furthermore , and this applies as well to the payment to the son , when a man is in debt he may not provide an allowance to himself of 02,000 a year and to his son of $5,000 , In case of allowances out of spendthrift trusts , the rule has undoubtedly been liberal , giving the debtor what he was used to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the debtor 's own . Although a third person when he bequeaths an'income to another person may Prevent that person 's creditors from taking any part of what Is necessary to support him as he has been used to live . yet out of his own estate he may not keep back the same amount . " Condon protested that he had made the payments objected to in the honest belief and on the advice of counsel that he ' had a right to make them , and pleaded that ; since they were consequently hot fraudulent , they could not be construed as acts of bankruptcy . " On this point Judge Hand held : " The size of the two transfers is quite ample to allow them to serve as acts of bankruptcy . " Parsons , Closson represented the petitioning creditors .
