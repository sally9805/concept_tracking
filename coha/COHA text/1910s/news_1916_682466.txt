txt Now that the question . " Are we going to have war with America ? " has been disposed of with a negative answer , " When will the war end ? " is again the question one most frequently bears from all sorts of Germans . The peace paragraphs In ht German answer to the United States gave a fresh impetus to popular speculation regarding the possible peace terms and how and when the war might end . There is undeniably a widespread feeling that the preservation of peace with America is a harbinger of a coming world peace , and President Wilson 's qualifications for the rale of mediator are being more and more debated here , indicating a growing Interest in the peace theme Since the Chancellor has spoken out , Germans consider it no disgrace r or sign of weakness to talk peace , particularly in view of the continued strength of the military position . One now finds a very general con- , viction that there will not be a third Winter campaign . A favorite and widely held opinion is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even believing that late Summer will bring peace . England the Obstacle . To the German mind England is now the one stumbling block in the path to peace , and nobody here believes that England will ever consider the possibility of talking peace until it bas employed its " new million " armies in one last great general offensive . Not until this greatest offensive has been tried and failed will the peace thought take root in England , most Germans believe , unless America will step forward as a mediator and address herself par ' ticularly to England . A political personage , discussing President Wilson recently , said to TEn NEw Yong Tn.tre correspondent : " The desire for peace is so strong among the masses of all the warring countries that , were President Wilson to break the present baneful spell by offering his services as mediator , no Government , not even that of England , would dare risk defying public qpinion at home and tr. , . moral condemnation of the whole world by answering ' no . ' " A Washington dispatch to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to the warring powers his willingness to mediate has aroused the utmost interest here , particularly as it comes on the heels of an unconfirmed report that Colonel House is soon coming to Europe again . The Morgen Pest says : " It would be a mistake to extract any hopes that this frightful world war may soon be ended from these intimations that President Wilson may perhaps renew his attempts at mediation , which heretofore hay , e been tried and have failed . Such attempts at mediation , though made in good faith and backed by power and influence , are in general doomed to failure so long as the idea has not dawned upon all the nations concerned that nothing more is to be achieved by a continuation of this bloody struggle . When once this thought has taken root among our enemies , then only may one calculate on the success of an attempt at mediation . " Resentlow Aroused . That the idea of mediation by President Wilson has met with a sympathetic reception , however , not only among the masses of Socialists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other things , by a sharp polemic against America as a possible mediator by Count von Recent ' low . " If there is any power unsuited for the role of mediator it Is the United States . " he writes , " for a prerequisite ' to mediation is at least a very consider able degree of nonpartisanship , It would only be valid if the German Empire , its Government and its people had now made the thought and desire for Reece the motif of its actions and of what it is ceasing to do . " Unfortunately , it seems to have become the fashion in Germany to keep silent in the face of these foreign assertions and assumptions . This we consider a grave error , for silence seems to imply consent . " We are aware that the German people want peace only on a basis of victory , but not a moral success in - the . shape of ' an honorable peace ' in which , " iv-Mild be mediated into a bargain Y-the transatlantic Anglo-Saxon power hich has no interest whatever in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has tll now openly maintained the standint that the will to victory exists in rtnany and the determination to held ut till victory is achieved  --  not the acptance of a mediation which would rely mean the bringing about of an in which the weight of the sited states would be thrown , not nig silently , as now , but openly , into e scales a our enemies . This would ; reality mean for Germany the dia- 1 trical opposite of victory . I " Foreign press comment shows that enemies , as well as some neutrals , convinced that the German Ernire is at the end of its strength : that desires only peace , and would under efficient pressure from all sides In e near future , accept whatever peace ur enemies and the United States lit wish to force on the German ErnEFrre and its people .
