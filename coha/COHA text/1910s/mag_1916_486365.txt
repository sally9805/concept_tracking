Many and diverse elements enter into the popular acclaim with which Mr. Wilson has been received on his travels . One factor , however , is constant . It is testified to in countless ways in countless places . Friend and foe alike bear witness to it . Whatever the cries that greet Mr. Wilson , one cry is never absent . He is hailed as " the peace President . " In varying phrases , but with a fervor almost religious in all of them , he is thanked and praised for having kept the country out of war . If proof were lacking of the pervasive na  --  ture of this sentiment , it would be supplied by the attitude of the Republicans in pres  --  ence of it . That it has surprised and dis  --  quieted them stands confessed in their tac  --  tics . At one time they seek to ridicule the assertion that Wilson " has kept us out of war . " At another they minimize it and quibble about it . They deny that he has kept us out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Haiti , in Santo Domingo , in Nicaragua . Fatuously , they start a series of articles headed " Wilson 's Wars . " All this is fatuous because it does not touch the hem of the garment of the feeling which the Re- ? publicans are endeavoring to counteract . It is the great war , the immense reaction against what Is going on in Europe , which alone is in the mind of the people when they thank God that the President has kept us out of war . The rest is but as the small dust in the balance . And when driven to it , the Republican leaders admit this . They do so when they confess to fright at the way in which the passion of the country for peace is helping Wilson , and when , as a last re  --  sort , their candidate protests that he would have kept us out of war more surely than Wilson has done it . That many are both puzzled and disgusted by this display of anti-war sentiment , need not be said . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptom of national de  --  generacy . Our physical and moral fibre has decayed , they say . And of the West , where the feeling runs deepest and has its most striking manifestations , they are almost inclined to think that it has ceased to be truly American . That sordid , fat , contented West ! Is this resentful attitude a sign of breadth or narrowness ? May not those maintaining it merely show that they have lost the abil  --  ity to interpret their own country ? Ours is a large nation . Vast populations are spread over extended territories . It is quite possi ? ble that we in the East , or those yonder on the Pacific Coast , are cherishing our own convictions , or prejudices , so ardently that we cannot. enter sympathetically into the po  --  litical emotions of those who dwell where has the perspective and the detachment to see what id going on more clearly than a native . Lord Bryce knows the United States as few men can ; and in an article contribut  --  ed by him recently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point under consideration . His aim is to explain to Eng  --  lishmen why America , despite a great pre  --  ponderance of sympathy for the cause of the Allies , has refrained from going to war in their behalf . And here are his striking words : It is further to be remembered that there is in. the United States a much more general horror of war , especially among religious people , than exists anywhere else in the world . They are intensely national , proud beyond measure of their flag , and prompt to resent anything like an insult to it . But their ideals are peaceful rather than military . War seems to them a wanton thing , because they have not had the misfortune  --  the pain  --  ful experience  --  to live near formidable and possibly aggressive neighbors . There are , of course , in so vast a population , plenty of adventurous and even bellicose spirits , as everywhere in the world , and if the United States were to join the present war hun  --  dreds of thousands of men would offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they hold to be the cause of freedom . It is nevertheless true that the proportion of Quiet , steady-going , and church  --  going men and women who support peace societies and hate the very name of war , is far larger in America than in any other country . Does not this help to explain the enthusi  --  asm of so many God-fearing Americans  --  our bourgeois , if you please  --  for Woodrow Wilson ? And in the light of what we have quoted from Lord Bryce , may it not be true that the President has understood and repre  --  sented the real desires and aspirations of the majority of his fellow-countrymen bet  --  ter than any of his opponents ? Lord Bryce is entirely accurate in putting his finger upon the religious zeal for American pacific ideals . There has been something almost of revival glow in the cries of " God bless you ! " which have come from workers on the soil and in the shop , and wives and mothers with tears in their eyes , as President Wilson pass  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Any man who stops to think knows that such outbursts of sentiment well from the deep  --  est springs of American character . And if Mr. Wilson has succeeded at once in satisfy  --  ing the sense of American national honor , and in responding to the intense American love of peace , he has earned the plaudits showered upon him in his campaign jour much needs to be forgiven . The Nation neither regrets nor withdraws the criticisms which it has passed upon him . He has been , in many ways , politically unstable . He has been mentally inconsistent . He has done some things to shock the moral sense . But in the supreme testing of the past two years he has met , we believe , the supreme wish of the American people . He has striven to uphold the national dignity and honor . He has striven for peace . MR . HUGHES AND DIVIDED ALLEGIANCE . No sensible man needed Mr. Hughes 's de  --  nial that he had ever made a " promise " to the O'Leary-Teuto-Celt Committee or had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He may have been indiscreet in con  --  senting to talk with them , not in the pres  --  ence of witnesses , though a Presidential can  --  didate has to see many queer fish . Mr. Hughes may not have made it as clear as he should to disloyal Americans that he has no sympathy with their aims or plots . But that anything like a bargain was struck between him and them it is ridiculous to suppose . That they swayed him in his atti  --  tude or influenced him in any of his public utterances no one outside of a lunatic asy  --  lum  --  or a party committee  --  could imagine . At the same time , the publication of the charges , with promise of more to come on the same subject , drives us back to one of the great mysteries of Mr. Hughes 's cam  --  paign . Why has he never done what was so confidently expected of him and so posi  --  tively predicted  --  set his heel upon the plan to carry an American election by votes based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acceptance he used words plainly looking that way . " Whether native or naturalized , " he said , " of whatever race or creed , we have but one country , and we do not intend to tolerate any division of allegiance . " But not a syllable so explicit or strong has since escaped Mr. Hughes in public . He has contented him  --  self with what has now become his weari  --  some formula that he stands firmly for the protection of all American rights . Yet he must be perfectly aware that this neither meets the just hopes of his friends nor goes to the heart of the real question . On it the country looked to him for some moving ut  --  terance , but has got only a cold form of words . The explanation of his course in this mat  --  ter has been hinted at by Mr. Hughes . Vari  --  ous newspaper correspondents have had it from him , though he has never , so far as we know , made it public in a plain state  --  ment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected President . As President he would have to conduct our relations with Ger  --  many . But in that work he would be great  --  ly embarrassed if , as a Presidential candi  --  date , he had used language about the Ger  --  man Government which gave it deep of  --  fence . That is the reason why he does not speak about the sinking of the Lusitania as a brutal and lawless massacre . He has to be guarded now in order not to be hampered later . Mr. Hughes may have in mind such an instance of indiscretion on the part of a man out of office as was once seen in Glad-stone 's career . In the course of his Mid  --  lothian campaign on the Bulgarian massa  --  cres and the whole question of the Near Mast , he allowed himself to characterize the course of Austria in a way which aroused bitter resentment in Vienna . But presently ' Mr. Gladstone became Prime Minister , and found that his Austrian offence still rankled . Thereupon , in order to restore good feeling , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " words , and to explain that they had been uttered when he was in a position of " ' greater freedom but of less responsibil  --  ity . " The principle is perfectly sound . A Presi  --  dent  --  or a possible President  --  should not rashly embroil himself with a foreign Gov  --  ernment . And so far as Mr. Hughes has been acting simply with this idea in his mind , small blame can attach to him . But is he not to be blamed for not seeing  --  or not act  --  ing as if he saw  --  that what he is confronted with is not at all a question of delicate for  --  eign complications , but first and foremost a ilomestic question reaching deep into our po  --  litical life ? Nobody wants Mr. Hughes to insult Germany . Nobody asks him to speak ill of the Kaiser or his Government . But his view has been urgently sought , his in ? Ilignation has been invoked , concerning a group of American citizens who are scheming to elect a President as a triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hughes began by saying that he - would not tolerate . It has since been flaunt  --  ing itself in the face of the nation , and not one whisper of rebuke for it has come from Charles E. Hughes . The spirit of it has again and again been displayed . No person is ignorant of what it means . It was un  --  blushingly avowed not long ago by one Ger  --  man-American who speaks for many , in these words : " We must defeat the President who is now in power and Who insulted us ; and then after four years defeat the newly elected candidate should he insult us in like man  --  ner . " He added : " German blows have more than once restored sound reasoning in the minds of fanatic ? politicians in this country . " About this there can be no possible mis  --  take . It is sheer alienism . It is a foreign conspiracy hatched on American soil . With our international relations it has nothing to do directly . But it is a burning domestic issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety . Yet the can  --  didate who has had so much to say about " firmness " and never yielding to force , has kept absolutely silent about it ! We still have no fulfilment of the assurance that the first thing Hughes would do would be so to smash the Hyphen that it would never dare to show its head again in American politics . " PROSPERITY " AND THE CAMPAIGN . From the beginning of this Presidential campaign it was evident that the Republi  --  can party would be handicapped by the great prosperity of the country . The tactical ad  --  vantage possessed under such circumstances by the party in power has always been rec  --  ognized in advance , and usually proved in the result . Other and larger political con  --  siderations might supersede it , but they could never wholly remove it . Mr. Hughes has met this " prosperity is  --  sue " in two ways  --  by arguing that existing conditions are temporary , precarious , and unsound , and by reverting to the lack of prosperity before the war began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first point , he has set forth in his Missouri speech  --  es and elsewhere that " we are under the unhealthy stimulus of the European war " ; that " our present prosperity is built on sand " ; that when the war is over , our man  --  ufacturers will have to compete with pro  --  duction " more skilful , more intelligent , bet  --  ter organized in every one of the foreign nations now at war than it has ever been before . " As to his second point , Mr. Hughes argued in his speech of acceptance that , " un  --  der the new tariff prior to outbreak of the war , " " production had decreased , business was languishing , new enterprises were notundertaken . " In New York city , " over 300 , ? 000 were out of work . " Labor commission  --  ers were everywhere busy with plans of re  --  lief . Needless to say , the conclusions drawn by Mr. Hughes and other Republican speak  --  ers are , first , that the conditions described as prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Democratic tariff , and sec  --  ondly , that equally deplorable conditions will prevail when the war is over , unless the Republican party reconstructs the tariff on its own familiar lines . Always , however , the natural purpose stands out of persuad  --  ing the voter that he has no right to give the party in power any credit for the con  --  ditions of to-day . As a matter of pure logic , we shall not quarrel with the last position . We greatly doubt the political influence of the argument  --  ment ; but nevertheless , whether with or without a European war , we are inclined to think that the assumption of good times as somehow the personal achievement of the Party in power is no more convincing in the present case than it was , say , at the time when the Republican party itself ap  --  propriated the credit for the prosperity of 1900 . Prosperity is caused by other influ  --  ences than occupants of the White House and majorities in Congress . But the same thing is true of adversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , as to conditions before and after the war , need a little closer examination . That industrial depression did prevail during a series of months before the war began , is an undoubted fact . It is also true that the Underwood tariff was enacted in October , 1913 . Such major and minor pre  --  mises are sufficient for stump speakers ; but serious inquirers will ask if anything else than tariff legislation existed as a possible influence . The review of 1913 by the Finan  --  cial Chronicle contained a summary of such influences . It comprised " material reduc  --  tion in the agricultural yield , " due to " one of the worst droughts in the country 's his  --  tory " ; the " unexpected prolongation of the war in Southeastern Europe , " through which " a crisis in the relations of the great Powers seemed imminent " ; large gold ex  --  ports , caused " more by European necessi  --  ties than by the current rates of exchange " ; consequent deficit in bank reserves , and high money rates ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in floating new securities , either by railways or by municipalities . Evidently , 1913 was an unlucky year for the United States , and it was quite as unfa  --  vorable in Europe , whose financial markets in fact were even more depressed than our own . The question may reasonably be ask  --  ed , therefore , whether the Wilson Adminis  --  tration and the Tariff law were the cause , as Mr. Hughes pretty clearly intimates , of the whole unpleasant situation . The sober his  --  torical investigator would dismiss the sup  --  position as absurd . We know to-day , as we only vaguely and occasionally apprehended at the time , that the primary influence un  --  der which financial confidence and business activity were replaced by a period of - hesi  --  tancy and profound depression , was the im  --  pending calamity of the general European war . The argument that ( unless the Republi  --  can party is returned to power ) the Ameri  --  can prosperity of to-day will be replaced by another season of adversity , is a different question in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on conjecture and not on ascertained facts . Nobody denies the existence of much that is accidental , ephemeral , and perhaps precarious , in par  --  ticular phases of our war-time prosperity . The problem what will be the economic con  --  ditions created in Europe and America by the ending of the war , is exceedingly ob  --  scure . But when a campaign orator to tell us exactly what is bound to be the nature of that situation , the most that can be said is that he either knows more than the most experienced financiers and econo  --  mists , or else is merely pretending that he does . STAGE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS . In the choice of a profession there are two things which the fledgling must keep in mind . In the first place , he must have a natural aptitude for the work he selects . In the second place , he must remember that high success in every profession has fre  --  quently been won by sheer perseverance in the face of apparently insurmountable han  --  dicaps . How the first proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sume to say . But there is the fact . No book of advice on choosing a profession is com  --  plete without the double-headed argument . Would you go in for aviation ? You must obviously have perfect health , exceptional nervous and muscular coordination , physical courage , and the ability to think fast . Yet it is a fact that John Smith , who holds the record for altitude in a monoplane , is a semi-invalid with very poor eyesight and a wood  --  en leg . Would you be an orator ? Then you must have voice and presence . Only , remem  --  ber that Robespierre had a thin , dry voice , and Alexander H. Stephens was a dwarf . Would you be an actor ? " The one essential and indispensable thing , " says Mr. Belasco in his foreword to Arthur Hornblow 's " Training for the Stage " ( Lippincott ) , " is not to enter upon the career because you want to do so , but because you are fitted to do so . " And Mr. Hornblow himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greater value to the actor than the posses  --  sion of a good voice and the knowledge how to use it . Would you have the proof ? Here it is . A phonetically spelled version of Henry Irving 's delivery of Shylock 's speech to Antonio would read as follows : Wa thane , ett no eperes Ah ! um ! yo ned ' elp Ough ! Ough ! Gaw to thane ! Ha ! urn ! Yo , com'n say Ah ! Shilok , um ! ouch ! we wode hey moanies One well-known offender against What a dismal Mrs. Fiske have notorious . It is with the stage as with every other career . First , go to the vocational training expert to be examined for natural ability , and then , if you insist on being an actor , lose the prescription . It is the same with the profits which it offers . If the call of the blood will not be denied , you can think of the stars who draw larger salaries than President Wilson and own a much larger number of automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool calculation , the prospect is not so dazzling . The average leading man in a Broadway production receives $250 a week for perhaps thirty-five weeks in the year . The leading juvenile , engaged at $150 a week , will net a little over $5,000 for the same length of season , or less than $4,000 for a season of twenty-five weeks , which is the fairer average . With the actor 's personality and ability , thinks Mr. Hornblow , he could probably command more in almost any other profession . But this again is the pessi  --  mism , or optimism , which makes any other profession but one 's own the most desirable to the average practitioner . The drain on the actor 's income is heavy . Expensive tastes are forced upon him when he is at work , and are hard to throw off when he is idle . In 1915 , the writer estimates , there were 40,000 persons in the United States engaged in the " show " business . In that year the applications for relief to the : Ac  --  tors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . One in four asking for char  --  ity ! It is probably a higher casualty-rate than any other occupation can show . What is the reason for this sad state of affairs ? Mr. Seymour Hicks has given it in " Twenty-four Years of an Actor 's Life . " It is at the same time a reason and a rejoin  --  der : Is the stage the only profession which is appalling for its failures ? Are not all profes  --  sions equally so for the failures that are nec  --  essarily in them ? No ; for the morass to which that will-o ' - the- wisp , the footlights , leads on its victims is one , perhaps , which has no eaual . Men may throw aside the sword for the barrister 's wig , the literary career for that of the mining expert , the position of a Younger son at home for the Church militant abroad . But once let a man hear a round of applause for an individual effort , let him have stood for one short hour in the full glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him-give up the calling which he thinks has been his since the hour of his birth A hard life , but the life ! The run on the Actors ' Fund may be heavy , the rank and file of the profession may find it necessary to affiliate with the American Federation of Labor , but there is compensation . M'as-ti vu is the French slang of an actor ? " Have  --  you-seen-me ? " In that phrase is the lure and the reward of an arduous profession . Foreign Correspondence THE VENAL PRESS IN ATHENS ? THE IN CIDENT AT THE FRENCH LEGATION . By JOHN A. RHYMERS . ATHENS , ' September 12 . Those who think only of the Greek lan  --  guage as a vehicle for noble thought would soon be wearied and disgusted by the use to which the modern written language is put by the servile and the sycophant among the writers in the Athenian press of to-day . And where so much falsity of sentiment is ex  --  pressed , it implies an absence of all real humor . For the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mock heroic . The ordinary newspaper Greek in the ' writ  --  ten language has a character of unreality and indefiniteness , it is stilted where it means to be dignified , and lacks in conciseness . The meaning of a whole column in most of the papers could often be given in a paragraph . There is a great deal of husk to a very little kernel and that kernel often not worth the effort to reach it . In strong contrast is the native poetry of the hills and the countryside in the spoken language , where richness of thought and conciseness of diction seem in  --  separable . Many distichs contain the meaning of a whole poem in two lines of great beauty and strength in thought and feeling , ' composed by unknown poets , often incapable of reading with any degree of ease the written newspaper Greek .
