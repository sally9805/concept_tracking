Depew in the Senate are as good as they were twenty-four hours ago , when his election was looked upon as a foregone conclusion at the Capitol . Friends of Charles F. Murphy , who has been the mainstay of Mr. Sheehan in his fight , are quietly letting it be understood , however , that the former Lieutenant Governor 's name may not go before the Democratic caucus at all . Alton B. Parker , D Cady Herrick , Justice James W. Gerard , and Daniel F. Cahalan , according to information emanating from the Murphy headquarters , are now being considered as the Senatorial timber from which will be chosen a candidate with whom to defeat Edward M.

Cram Statement Shocks Murphy . No member of the Murphy party would admit to-night that the Crean statement Is responsible for the sudden change in the situation . Several friends of Mr. Murphy to-day declared that Mr. Cram wielded no influence in Tammany Hall  --  in Met , was exceedingly unpopular with the organization . It was evident , however , , that the report of the statement , which reached here just as Mr. Murphy was preparing to sit down with Mr. Cohalan and Mr. Sheehan at luncheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Murphy was making his way across the lobby of the Ten Eyck toward the dining room when a reporter approached him with a copy of a news bulletin which was first to reach Albany . " Have you heard of the statement made by your friend . Mr. Cram , in New York ? " asked the reporter . " No , what 's that ? " asked the Tammany leader . " Give it to me , let me see it , " he added , reaching out for the typewritten sheet in the reporter 's hand . Mr. Murphy glanced at the brief dispatch . " You do n't mind if I take it for a moment ; I will bring it right back , " he said . After receiving permission he made his way to the table where Mr. Sheehan and Mr. Cohalan were . seated . The heads of the Tammany chieftain and the other two at the table were very close together while the dispatch was being scanned . After a while Mr. Murphy returned to the reporter with the dispatch .

When asked for a statement he said : " Nothing , now ; perhaps when I have I read all that Mr. Cram has said , I may have some statement to make . " The fall report appeared in an Albany evening paper , a copy of which was sent to Mr. Murphy 's room . Mr. Murphy did not appear in response to a request for an interview , but sent Secretary Smith down to the lobby to tell the correspondents that he would have no statement to ' make . Mr. Sheehan was asked when he left the dining room with Mr. Murphy whatl effect he thought the Cram statement would have on his prospects . He only shook his head and hurried to his roan .

Immediately after the Murphy-CohalanSheehan luncheon , the long distance telephone wires became very busy . Mr. Murphy and his lieutenants , as well as Mr. Sheehan , were in communication with New York for the better part of the afternoon and evening . Toward night several New York legislators usually classed with the Old Guard began to arrive at the Capital and went into conference with Mr. Murphy . The Tammany leaner to-night is pulling every wire to avert a situation which readily may lead to a split in the Democratic Party . if Mr. Murphy insists on forcing a man of the type he would prefer on the legislators as candidate for the United States Senate . It was admitted even in the Murphy camp that the friends of Edward M. Shepard had played their cards with all the shrewdness of seasoned politicians , and that they were in a position where they might prevent the election of a man of Mr. Murphy 's choice , even if they could not bring about the election of Edward M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning on the same train that carried Gov .

Like the Governor , he had been invited to attend the dinner tonight at thetLotos Club , but it was stated at the Shepard headquarters that more serious business was responsible for Mr. Osbome 's trip to New York . It could readily be inferred that the open declaration of Mr. Cram for Mr. Shepard had something to do with it , for the intentions of Mr. Murphy 's former confidante to come out in denunciation of Mr. Sheehan have been known among the Shepard boomers for several days . Mr. Osborne is expected back to-morrow . - . ; The men conducting Mr. Shepard 's campaign at the Capitol to-night are ding their efforts toward getting edges from a score of Democratic memof the Legislature either to stay out Of- the caucus on Monday night or else enter with the distinct understanding that they shall not be bound by any action which would be out of accord with the wishes of their constituents . The leaders in the Shepard campaign have been conducting a postcard canvass in some counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with the strong Shepard sentiment that exists among the rank and file of the party .

Dix surely believed Mr. Sheehan would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken at noon Lti Wednesday , and the Sheehanites declare that it would not be common sense to believe that Mrs. Sheehan would be invited to assist at a social function on that day if there was the slightest doubt as to her husband 's triumph on that day .
