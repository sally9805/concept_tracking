txt The change in the attitude of President WILSON toward the Mexican problem is not encouraging . The promise of a message on the subject to Congress at this Lime , to he delayed three or four days , indicates a desire to get an expression of public opinion , to shift , in some measure , the burden of responsibility which hitherto he has insisted upon bearing without help . The intimation that the forthcoming message will suggest a " show of force " by the United States in Mexico is , we hope , made without authority . Already the international situation is so involved that only wisdom and prudence in every succeeding action of our Go+ernment can ' avert trouble . A " show of force " in the sister republic at this time would have perilous results . HUERTA 'S followers would then have the support of Zapatistas , Carranzistas , Vasquistas , of the Church Party , and the remnant of the Cientificos against any outside interference . The President 's action in sending a personal envoy on a secret mission to Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned , because of the common belief that the President 's information regarding the Mexican situation was more complete and sounder than the people 's ; in short , that he knew what he was doing . Somewhat disturbing reports as to the plans of the mission have been ignored . But it seems that fhe reports were well founded . Mr. LIND has made proposals to the Mexican Executive which ha ve been rejected . and the negotiations are possibly at an end . It is obvious that in the present critical situation no proposal which could be thus rejected should have been made . The mission is a failure , and our relations with Mexico are more delicate than ever . In the circumstances a full report of the conditions in Mexico , as Mr. LIND sees them , seems to be called for . He is believed to be a man of clear vision and practical common sense . If his report should indicate that the Government of Gen. HUERTA is strongly supported , that his control of affairs is reasonably firm , the duty of our Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rectified . Pride should not influence President WILSON longer to withhold recognition . The acknowledgment of his error would be more manly than to persist in a wrong course . If , on the other hand , Mr. Limn could show that HUERTA 'S power is waning , that fact should be made known to the American public . Inevitably the promised message to Congress recalls Mr. 's message before the outbreak of the Spanish war , just as Mr. EnIn 's visit to Mexico is a reminder of the visit to Cuba of Senator REDFIELD PnocTOR ? of Vermont , whose report on his return was so enlightening to the Senate and the people . The two cases , however , are not otherwise similar . No humane reason could justify our interference in Mexico as matters now stand , yet our present course is tending toward more or less interference , if not positive intervention . Whatever the President 's intention may have been , and we have no doubt that he was assured that his efforts as a ,        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
