txt Berlin 's somewhat too spontaneous celebration of the capture of Riga , giving evidence of an " accelerated " rejoicing , confirms the belief we have already expressed that the German advance on Russia 's lines in that quarter was undertaken with a view rather to political effect than to distinct military advantage . Possibly the Germans might have taken Riga long ago , but they were much occupied on other fronts . The moment came when they knew that the Russians would abandon the city and its defenses without much resistance , and they walked in . Many of the Russian troops , still groveling in that extreme of degradation to ? which they have been brought by influences emanating from the Council of Workmen 's and Soldiers ' Delegates , left their posts and ran like sheep . Yet military writers of authority gravely Present the taking of Rigs. to the German people an a great military triumph , a victory won by desperate fighting , so that , accepting their version of the battle , it would be fairly comparable to CADOENA 'S triumphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ? and are making use of the capture of Riga to put heart into the sore-beset people of the Empire in order that their souls may be sustained through another Winter of want and suffering . An incident over which Germany so rejoices ought to have the correlative effect of covering the Russians with shame . Russkoye Slovo , the Russian newspaper published in this city , laments the fall of Riga , Russia 's " window on Europe , " which autocrac fro the time of PETER the Great hadistriv-1 en to keep open and make broader , but democracy has Closed it , has given it over into the hands of the Kaiser . It was one of Russia 's important Baltic ports . It has been lost , and as Germany advances Russians will Confront the probability that the Baltic will hecoine " inland waters of the German Empire . " . Sorrowful reproaches of that nature addressed to the authors ol the present disorganization In Russia ought to have some effect . They put the revolution . above the war , the class struggle for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , above the defeat of Germany , but revolution which gives up territory to a terrible enemy of the country , which sacrifices one position after another until the very capital of the nation is threatened with capture , must appear to all sane Russians as revolution carried much too far . The disorders in Russia have been explained by the theory that the Russians are intoxicated with the new wine of freedom . Nothing of the kind . Their brains have been benumbed , their hearts half paralyzed , . their spirit destroyed by the old poison of socialism in its extreme form of internationalism , which is the death of all patriotism . Mr. ROOT has told us that the heart of Russia is sound . We may hope so , we may believe it , for the great mass of the peasants , in whom Mr. MILT ; xoFE still expresses such confidence , have not been very deeply affected by the preaching of the wild extremists of Petrograd . With the Boisheviki they appear to have little sympathy . Some great shock , like the capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to their senses and to their feet .
