txt Forty-seven policemen from among fifty approached are ready to lend a helping hand , and even a helping dime or two , to a poor fellow who is down on his luck . These are n't guesswork statistics . They were obtained by Commissioner of Charities Kingsbury , who sent out a special agent disguised as a beggar to tell policemen a hard-luck tale This was done with the consent of Police Commissioner Woods , and both Commissioners were much gratified to have it proved that the policemen were batting an average of 040 per cent . in the Golden Rule league . Stuart Rice played the role of the Panhandler . He is a private investi- , , gator for the Department of Charities . In his work he traveled all over the city , and only three of the policemen whom he approached gave him the cold shoulder . The rest helped him by suggesting where he could apply for food and shelter , and several tried to get him a job . Rice kept a record of his encounter with each policeman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . Of the fifty men he approached forty-four knew of the Municipal Lodging House and gave him directions . Three gave him other practical suggestions for getting help . The wielders of the nightstick were not surly about the business either , says Rice . In fact , the good-natured policemen overwhelmed him with kindness . Two of them took his plight so much to heart that they were determined to find jobs for him . " For a time I was afraid they would have me chained to somebody 's woodpile and my investigation would come to an ignominious end , " admitted Rice . " One job was with a bill posting concern . I thought I was doomed to start out with a paste bucket and brush . I looked at my blue-coated Good Samaritan and resolved to stick to the bucket if they handed it to me . After fifteen minutes ' work with those tools the bucket would have been sticking to me . I would have had paste all over me . But the boss decided to put me to work the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I keep a weather eye open for that cop . If he finds me running around loose I 'm sure he 'll take me back to that paste bucket shop and tie me to the job he took so much trouble to find for me . " Another patrolman on duty at Broadway and Forty-seventh Street took pity on Rice and escorted him to the engine room of Churchill's. where he arranged for his employment as a helper . At the same time he prevailed on the waiters in the lobster palace to slip some food to the poor down-and-out , and they came back with a meal that would have cost him several dollars upstairs . He tried to look his thanks , but that would n't do . His benefactors , including the policemen , stood by to watch him gormandize , so he had to stuff himself to the bursting point and give signs of glee . Few of the policemen sent him on his way without an offer of carfare or a dime for coffee and rolls . One man standing on fixed post dug into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry that this is all I 've got on me , Mac , " he said . " but you sneak around the corner and get yourself some coffee and rolls and bring me back the change . " This draws attention to another side of the New York policeman . He has proved himself a keen judge of character . The men Rice approached recognized him for an honest man , and they wanted to help put him on his feet . Besides suggesting the Municipal Lodging House , two policemen spoke of the Department of Charities as a source of relief , three told him of . the Municipal Employment Bureau , one directed him to the wood yard , and one to the Salvation Army , and six sent him to precinct station houses to get the advice of the lieutenant in charge . The report Rice made satisfied the Commissioners that New York policemen are pretty well versed in the means of relief which the city affords unfortunates ? a help to those who need it and a hindrance to crime . Commissioner Kingsbury was particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his counterfeit panhandler to the recently established Municipal Free Employment Bureau . 29 Lafayette Street Only three of them made this suggestion .
