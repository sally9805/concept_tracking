ONE fact concerning the woman-suffrage movement is plain to all who have watched that movement : that is , the superficial and inadequate manner in which the matter has been discussed on both sides . The suffragists , in their spoken and published utterances , reveal that , while they propose a stupendous governmental change , they have little knowledge of the fundamentals of government , the evolution of representation , the history of politics , or the genesis , scope , and meaning of suffrage . In their treatment of the subject , they hopelessly confuse political , philanthropic , socialistic , and economic questions ; nor do they seem able to discriminate between objects of national and those of state or municipal regulation . They have shown no grasp of the principles of government ; few suffragists , perhaps , could explain , offhand , why the House of Representatives has a Committee on Foreign Affairs , and the Senate has a Committee on Foreign Relations . Yet such things are among the alphabet of representative government , and to attempt enormous governmental changes without knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differential calculus without knowing the ground-rules of arithmetic . The objectors to woman suffrage have not always given logical or practical reasons against it . They feel an instinctive dislike to the overturning of the social order which woman suffrage would work , but they have reasoned little more than a person reasons who runs indoors from a hailstorm . The inconveniences of remaining exposed to a hailstorm are so plain that few persons work the matter out logically ; they act on instinct , which , unlike reason , makes no mistakes . Still , if an effort were made forcibly to expose persons to hailstorms , a dozen conclusive reasons might be found why they should go indoors . Mr. William Dean Howells says that he has heard many appeals against woman suffrage , but that he has never heard any reasons against it ; yet there are compelling reasons against it . They have not been much in evidence , because the debate has been chiefly in the hands of women whose knowledge of governmental principles is meagre . Both sides ? whether for or against ? have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could walk up to the polling-booth and deposit a ballot in the box . It is at this point , however , that the revolution would begin . It is true that limited suffrage prevails in twenty-two states , and full suffrage in four , ? Colorado , Idaho , Wyoming , and Utah , ? and still there is no general revolution . But it must be remembered that in the states where there is limited suffrage , women have shown a general indifference to exercising suffrage , while the experiment in the four crude and sparsely settled states in which there is full suffrage affords no adequate test for full suffrage in great centres of civilization , and in vast and crowded communities , with immense and diversified interests . Wyoming is a state of cowboys and cattle-ranges . Idaho is dominated to a great degree by the Mormon Church , which has ever been the good friend of woman suffrage , and the most powerful advocate it has yet had . In Utah , the women-voters , under the lead of Mormonism , have voted steadily in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , in defiance of the law , by the votes of women . In Colorado , the most civilized of all the suffrage states , the suffrage experiment has not been entirely successful , as will be shown further on . The near view of suffrage does not seem to help it . During the last fourteen years , California , South Dakota , Washington , and Oregon have all defeated suffrage amendments to their constitutions. 11 There are two basic principles opposed to woman suffrage . A basic principle works with the merciless mechanism of a natural law , like gravitation , and is indeed a natural law . It may be violated for a time , just as a stick may be thrust in the cogs of a machine , but the machine will not work until the stick is removed , and is sure to be damaged by the performance . True , it is not only the suffragists who have defied a basic principle : it is within the memory of living men that the government of the United States , through some of its ablest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eonstis tutional government , of common sense as well as common justice , by placing the ballot in the hands of recently emancipated slaves who could neither read nor write , and were without property . By the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution , in five states of the Union , all power and property were handed over to the combined vice and illiteracy of those states . By the Fifteenth Amendment , a coach and horses were driven through the Constitution of the United States by an attempt to compel the granting of the same civil rights to the recently emancipated slaves only a few generations removed from cannibalism , as to the highest type of the Caucasian race with a thousand years of civilization behind it . If civilization could be destroyed by legislative enactment , it would have been destroyed in the five Southern states which were thus delivered over to anarchy . But civilization can not be destroyed by legislative enactment . It may be grievously injured , and frightful disorders and lasting wrong may follow ; but the basic and natural law will always , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization will maintain itself at all costs . The reason against the enfranchisement of women bears no relation whatever to the reason for the practical disfranchisement of the Negro which now prevails throughout the Southern states . It may rather be compared to the disfranchisement of all the citizens of that district which has the highest percentage of literacy of any district in the country , and the highest percentage of individual wealth , and in which THE LADIES ' BATTLE th , , g , , vernment disburses three hundred and seventy-two millions of dollars a year in wages . This is the District of Columbia , containing a population of : 4 , ; ? g03 souls . No citizen of the District has a vote . The experiment of ing these citizens votes had been full% tried , when , less than forty years two of the greatest jurists of the age . f he late Senator Thurman of Ohio , and former Senator Edmunds of Vermont , carried through , without division of ' Katy , a scheme of disfranchising citizen in the most intelligent municipality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One was to pre cm the Negroes from voting , and the of her was the belief that it was better t here should be no political repre , en tat ix esat the seat of Federal government except Federal representatives . In t his case , as from the beginning of representative government , the ballot was recognized , not as a right , but as a ! nix doge , which could be withheld from intelligent qualified persons , as well as from the unqualified . As Senator Elihu Root , one of the greatest living jurists , has tersely put it , " But if there is any one thing settled , it is that voting is not a natural right , but simply a means of government . " Ili The two basic reasons against woman suffrage are as follows : First , no electorate has ever existed , nr pier can exist , which can not execute its own laws . Second , no voter has ever claimed , or ever can claim , maintenance from another voter . In the suffrage states these basic laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these propositions , a voter must have two qualifications . First , he must , except in occasional individual instances , bephysically able to make his way to the polls , against opposition if necessary ; and , second , he must be able to carry out by force the effect of his ballot . Law consists of a series of Thou-shaltnots , but government does not result until an armed man stands ready to execute the law . Force converts law into government . In civilized countries there are three methods of converting law into government ? fine or compensation , imprisonment , and death . For all of these , physical force is necessary . To create an electorate unable to use physical force , is not , as the suffragists seem to think , merely doubling the present electorate . It means pulling out the underpinning , which is force , from every form of government the world has yet known . Besides the two essential qualifications of a voter , there are many other desirable ones . Education is desirable , but not essential . The possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way to the polls or to execute laws created under female suffrage . The spectacle of one half the electorate unable to execute a single law it has made , or even to deposit its ballots without the assistance of the other half , is a proposition so fantastic that it is difficult to attack it seriously . The trouble would begin with the mere attempt of women to deposit their ballots . A dozen ruffians at a single polling-place could prevent a hundred women from depositing a single ballot . There can be no doubt that this means would be used by the rougher elements , and that the polls would become scenes of preordained disorder and riot . In addition to this rowdyism , respectable women would have to face the class that is not respectable , a thing appalling to modest women . The respectable women might invoke the law , but they could not enforce it . They would be dependent upon that moiety of men who might be willing to assist them . The constabulary has always proved totally inadequate to maintain order at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is in the American nation a fixed hostility to the employment of troops at polling-places . It is a fact , probably unknown to the suffragists , that every administration which has ever passed a force bill , or even made a serious endeavor to do so , has lost the House of Representatives at the next election . This has given rise to the axiom that an electorate which can not protect itself is not worth protecting , and the country is better off without it than with it . This principle has worked unerringly since the foundation of the Republic , and is in itself the natural protection of the ballot . Supposing the ballots of women , however , to have been deposited by the indulgence of men , women will surely he called upon to legislate for men upon subjects of which no woman has ever had , or ever can have , any practical experience . True , men now legislate for women . But there is no trade , profession , or handicraft , of which women have a monopoly , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pointed out that women could not , with justice , ask to legislate upon matters of war and peace , as no woman can do military duty ; but this point may be extended much further . No woman can have any practical knowledge of shipping and navigation , of the work of trainmen on railways , of mining , or of many other subjects of the highest importance . Their legislation , therefore , would not probably be intelligent , and the laws they devised for the benefit of sailors , trainmen , miners , etc. , might be highly objectionable to the very persons they sought to benefit . If obedience should be re fused to these laws , who is to enforce them ? The men ? Is it likely they will ; And if the effort should be made , why stupendous disorders would occur ! The entire execution of the law would he in the hands of men , backed up by an irresponsible electorate which could not lift a finger to apprehend or punish a criminal . Great questions would arise concern . ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , not One of whom would be called upon to share the hardships of a military life , might decree that a hundred thousand soldiers would be sufficient in a case where the men from whom these soldiers would be recruited would say that two hundred thousand were needed . By providing only half that number , those men might be sent to their destruction . Would they go ? And if they refused , who is to make them go ? Where would be the justice in allowing women a voice , and an utterly irresponsible ballot , on this subject ? In municipal affairs , the men might decide that a city needed for its protection a police force of fifteen hundred men ; the women , not one of whom would be called upon to risk her life as a policeman risks his , might conclude that a thousand men would be enough , and those thousand men would have to face odds with which it would require fifteen hundred men to deal ; and awful disasters might result . But suppose the police refuse to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ? A considerable proportion of men are unable to do military or constabulary. duty . To acid to this irresponsible percentage among men the whole feminine electorate , would be to reduce the responsible electorate to a minimum . In a recent magazine article , Mrs. Clarence Mackey , a leading suffragist , advances with much gravity the proposition that influence such as women now possess , without responsibility , is a very had thing . She proposes to substitute the authority of the ballot in place of influence , but still without responsibility . If influence without responsibility is dangerous , authority without responsibility must be a thousand times more dangerous . It is , in fact , the most dangerous thing on earth . The logic of the suffragists is not always equal to that of Aristotle . IV The second basic principle against woman sulTrage ? that one voter can not claim maintenance from another oter ? would deprive married women of any claim for support from their husbands ; and in all questions concerning women , wives and mothers must be considered first . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a man acquires a vote he gives up all claim to maintenance except upon public charity . On attaining his majority , a man loses all claim to maintenance , not even his own father being called upon to maintain him for another day . t he case of daughters , the unwritten law , which is always much more strictly obeyed than the written law , has decreed that the father , if able , shall maintain his adult daughters as long as they remain unmarried . The exceptions to this law only prove the rule . hider the present dispensation , the status between husbands and wives is , practically , that the husband has the ? ote and the wife has the property . In lieu sta. vote , the law has given the wife enormous property privileges which , of course , are totally inconsistent with the possession of a vote . The law of property between husband and wife may be broadly stated as follows : The wife on her marriage does not become responsible for any debts owed by her husband before marriage ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every debt owed by the wife before marriage . The wife is the sole possessor of her own estate ; the husband is not , and never has been , the sole possessor of his own estate unless there is a pre-nuptial contract . He can not alienate his wife 's dower , either in his lifetime or by his will . A husband 's courtesy-right in his wife 's estate by no means corresponds in value with the wife 's dower-right in his estate . A wife is not liable for her husband 's debts ; a husband may not excuse himself from paying his wife 's debts , even on the ground that they were contracted without his knowledge , or even against his prohibition. / The law compels him to pay those debts of his wife which are reckoned justifiable and in proportion to the husband 's income and station in life . A married woman is entitled to her own earnings ; a married man is not , and never was , entitled to his own earnings . The law compels him out of them to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman seeking divorce from her husband can compel him to pay her counsel fees , and to give her alimony if she be the innocent party , even if he marry again , and this alimony continues until the former wife 's death or remarriage . She can also cornpel her former husband to provide for the support of the minor children . A husband seeking divorce from his wife can not force her to pay his counsel fees or secure alimony from her , or , if she be guilty , force her to support the minor children , although the wife may be wealthy and the husband may be penniless . It may be said in passing that this over-indulgence on the part of men toward women in divorce laws is to a great degree responsible for the divorce evil . In most states , the laws concerning the property privileges of women seem to be embodied sentimentalism ; and in some , the husband appears to have no rights which the wife is bound to respect . In Georgia , a recent legislature proposed to add to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , that it should be a felony in the State of Georgia for a man to ' defame ' a woman . These delightful Knights of La Mancha omitted to define what constitutes defaming a woman . One fact is admitted , however , by every person familiar with the rudiments of the common law ? that all property privileges must be resigned at once by every woman who acquires a vote . This must be done as a matter not only of justice , but of necessity , for no voter can claim maintenance from another voter who may cast a vote which may not only impair , but even destroy , the power of the first voter to support the second voter . The wife , for example , may be a free-trader , and the husband a protectionist . The wife may , by her single vote , cause tariff changes that would enormously impair the husband 's power of supporting her . This impairment may be done in a more direct manner by the wife of an official . She may by her vote reduce his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely , thereby leaving him without an income . To say that wives would always vote for their husbands ' financial interests is to accuse women of absolute and complete corruption . So it will be seen that , following an unbroken precedent which is founded upon a basic principle , a wife , on acquiring a vote , would have to give up all claim to maintenance upon any one whomsoever , except upon public charity ; or she may be compelled , as in Utah , to support her husband . But how can a woman , the mother of minor children , do without main tenance from her husband ? It is the law of nature , as well as of custom that the man should be the bread : winner of the family ; and he is , ninety-nine times out of a hundred . The few instances to the contrary only prose the rule . How many mothers with young children are capable of self-sup. port ? If , however , she becomes a voter she must take her place with all the voters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where would the rights of the children come in : who would be responsible for the support of minors ? In the attempt to adjust the pro . perty rights between a husband and wife , both of whom are voters , and the minor children , chaos must result . It is a problem never before presented upon a considerable scale , and is practically incapable of adjustment ; that is to say , the litigation which would result would swamp ten times as many courts as exist in the United States today . It would present unknown cernplications in the transfer of property . in the making of contracts , in the carrying on of business , in every transaction in which a married man or a married woman was a party . It would be necessary to wipe out most of the common law , ' the world 's most copious fountain of human jurisprudence . ' No lawyer or financier living would undertake to prophesy the result , except stupendous loss to women and a cataclysmal confusion and destruction of values . At this point comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might be imagined that the very first thing to be settled is : ' How does the acquisition of a Note affect the property privilege of women ? ' Until the suffragists are prepared to answer this question satisfactorily , it is difficult to see how they can ask votes for women . Now , so far as their printed utterances go , not one - . Untie word on this vital and stupendous point has been spoken by any suffratzist . At their annual meetings , this uhjeet has never been mentioned . .1 , . ; a matter of fact , women in the sulfraLte states have their property privileges very much curtailed , and Igt%1 t an liable for the support of their husband , in certain contingencies ? a thing unknown in states without woman suffrage . Whet her these facts and questions are kept in the background for fear Irnt , if they are brought forward , the whole suffrage body may be stampeded , or whether the suffragists them- , ekes do not know that the inevitable con , equences of acquiring a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fated . Judging , however , from this indifference to basic principles , the . iffragists do not know that they will 10 , i ? any property privileges by becomhim. voters . The suffragists , however , have adopted as a principle a strange fallacy , ? not found in any system of government on this planet , ? that the payment of taxes entitles the taxpayer to vote . The phrase ' Taxation without representation is tyranny ' has been wholly misunderstood by them . It is indeed a misleading phrase , especially fo persons unfamiliar with governmental principles . But it was never meant or taken in the sense that the payment of taxes carried with it a vote . It did not refer to individuals at all , or to an enlargement of the electorate . There is not the smallest evidence to nhow that the colonies ever sought or desired parliamentary representation , and the subject was never mentioned except to be dismissed . As Sydney George Fisher says , in his Struggles for . horrican Independence , ' It is to be understood that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They declared it to beimpossible . . .. They always insisted that representation was impossible . ' The phrase , as originally used , referred to what were really international relations . The suffragists think it meant that nobody should pay taxes who had not a vote . This notion would have made the founders of the Republic smile ? for , as a justice of the Supreme Court once calmly reminded an indiscreet advocate , It may be assumed that the Supreme Court of the United States knows something . ' It knows there is no essential relation between taxation and representation . It knows that , if this principle proclaimed by the suffragists were adopted , the public income would stop . It must be remembered that taxation , in its inception , meant protection ; that is to say , property-owners paid in order to have their properly protected . In any event , a woman 's property as well as a man 's must be protected by a man . If her rights are infringed , she has the same redress that men have ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandate into effect , because no woman can carry any law into effect . The property is taxed , and not the individual . Nobody has proposed that the property of minors should be exempt from taxation . In the District of Columbia with its 343,005 inhabitants , no man has a vote , but no man has had the assurance so far to ask exemption from taxation . The entire Army and Navy of the United States , including the officers , the best educated body of men in the country , are practically disfranchised through difficulty in establishing domicile , and for other reasons . Yet army and navy men are required to pay taxes just as much as civilians . The idea that taxation carries with it a vote is peculiarly ludicrous when employed by suffragists from the South . There is probably not one of them to be found who advocates restoring the franchise to the two million Negro voters , increased by two more millions of ignorant Negro women-voters ; but the Southern suffragists have not so far proposed to exempt the ten million Negroes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taxed who has not a vote , then these ten million Negroes should be exempt from taxation ; also all lunatics , minors , and criminals ; all army and navy officers and men ; all the inhabitants of the Territories and of the District of Columbia . The twelve hundred thousand foreigners who are added annually to our population would also be exempt from taxation for at least five years ? the shortest time , under our present naturalization laws , in which an alien may become . a voter . But this would only be the beginning of the exemption . Citizenship can not be forced upon any man , and immigrants might choose to remain aliens , and no doubt would , in order to escape taxation . Sad to say , great numbers of American citizens would cross the Canadian border and become loyal subjects of King George , and exchange their citizenship for exemption from taxes . If Mr. Carnegie , Mr. Rockefeller , and Air . Pierpont Morgan should choose to become aliens , they would be exempt from taxation . Vast foreign corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain aliens and pay no taxes . There are a few states where an alien can not hold real estate , but there are many other forms of property which are taxed , and in most of the states a foreigner may own anything he can pay for , and he is taxed from the moment he acquires it . To differentiate between voluntary and involuntary aliens would be to call the whole population of the United States into court . The proposition that taxation with out representation is an injustice would no doubt be enthusiastically supported by every scoundrel among men in the United States of America . If a man by reason of crime were deprived of his vote , or by not having the educational qualifications which are usually required , he would also be exempt from taxation . In fact , if taxation without representation be adopted as a prin ciple of government , nobody need pay taxes who does not want to , and the number of persons who really want to pay taxes is , unfortunately , small . v There can be no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last few years . Besides what has been done in America , Australia and Finland have adopted full suffrage for women ; and Sweden , Denmark , and New Zealand have limited suffrage in various forms . It is alleged that full suffrage in Australia and Finland has not worked well , but the experiment is too recent to be very valuable . And it must be remembered that no women have the property privileges of American women . In England , it would he unjust to confound the section of law-abiding and dignified , if mistaken , suffragists with the shrieking and savage mobs that make one shudder at the thought of intrusting them with the vote . It brings to mind the stern words of the late Queen Victoria , the first sovereign on earth who ever understood , maintained , and observed a constitution , and who in the sixty-four years of her reign had more governmental experience , more practical knowledge of politics than any woman who ever lived , ? ' The Queen is most anxious to enlist everyone who can speak or write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Rights " with all its attendant horrors . ' THE LADIES ' BATTLE This illustrious lady was celebrated for knowing what she was talking about . The present Liberal Government has shown a singular vacillation concerning the frenzied English women who rioted for suffrage . Less than a vear ago the London police were using doh whips upon them . Now , the non-par t i san committee appointed by Prime Minister Asquith has reported a bill giving the franchise to women-householders in their own right , and those occupying at their own expense domiciles of a certain value . The bill has already passed its second reading , and may possibly be adopted at the present session of Parliament . With the example of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States before us , there is no reason to suppose that the British Parliament may not do something equally irrational . As in that case , Parliament may yield to the clamors of a frantic mob ; but when a legislature does that , it always has to pay a fearful price . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minority for a majority . For it must not be forgotten , that according to the suffragists ' own showing , woman suffragists are in a minority in every one of the twenty-six states in which they have full or limited suffrage , except in Utah . In that still polygamous state , woman suffragists have a majority . VI It must be said , however , of American suffragists in the past , that their course has generally been one of dignity and decorum . A few painful absurdities have been committed , like Miss Anthony 's Woman 's Bible , which was an effort to edit the Bible so that it might become a suffragist document . This attitude of dignity on the part ofthe suffragists has been recently disturbed by that strange psychic law which makes violence contagious . The shocking conduct of a paft of the English suffragists has not been without its evil effect on American suffragists . At the forty-second annual meeting of the Woman Suffrage Association , in Washington in April , 1910 , the suffragists carried on a street campaign which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motors , would represent pathetically their miserable situation without the ballot , and make passionate appeals for a vote to men who themselves had no votes . The official proceedings and speeches showed a lamentable want of legal and governmental knowledge . One lady announced , ' We will make at noise until we get a vote . ' This singular sentiment was applauded , in apparent forgetfulness that the only creature who gets what it wants by making a noise is a baby . Another delegate publicly advocated race-suicide , giving the perfectly logical reason that women could not attend properly to public affairs and look after their families as well . On the day when their petition was presented in the Senate , the galleries were crowded with suffragists , who became so noisy that the presiding officer , Senator Kean of New Jersey , was obliged to announce that if the disorder did not cease the galleries would be cleared . The most shocking impropriety of all was the public insult to President Taft when he was their invited guest . The President yielded to strong pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address to the suffragists assembled at the Arlington Hotel . The President spoke with courtesy and dignity , but on his making some guarded reference to the dangers attending the extension of the franchise , the suffragists proceeded to make history by hooting and hissing the President of the United States . This has never before occurred in the history of the country . No matter how hostile a crowd might be , or of what low elements it might consist , the President of the United States has always been treated with respect . A number of the suffragists , realizing their frightful blunder , sent a letter of apology to the President . The action , however , was not unanimous . At no time during the meeting was there any discussion , or even allusion to any changes which might result in the property privileges of women in the event of acquiring a vote . Many strange ideas of government , however , were presented . A brilliant and prominent advocate of woman suffrage gave the following as its chief objects : ? Woman suffragists stand for sanitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in the United States . ' A very slight analysis of this formula will show many fallacies . First , is the universal fallacy on the part of the suffragists that all women will vote alike , and will vote right . Second : neither sanitation nor education can be the first or even the most important object of government . Good laws well administered , a pure and competent judiciary , internal order , national defense , and many other things , must take precedence of sanitation and education . Neither sanitation nor popular education was known to the founders of the Republic ; yet these founders added more to the forces of civilization than any group of sanitarians or educators that ever lived . Third : neither sanitation nor education is a national affair , but both are the business of states and municipalities . Fourth : sanitation and education are already well attended to by men , and as large a share of the public income is devoted to them as the people will bear . Fifth : the proposition that one-half the electorate of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working women in the United States is a bald proposition to create a privileged class . This is a thing abhorrent to republican institutions , and is the line of demarkation between republics and monarchies . There is not , and never can be , a line on any statute book in the United States , regulating work and wages between private individuals . Any proposition to that effect is socialism run mad . There is a socialistic association , highly favored by suffragists , to bring about that no shop-girl shall work for less than four dollars a week . It is only just to the well-meaning but ill-informed women who have gone into this movement , to say that their unfamiliarity with governmental problems is the reason that such a grotesque association exists . The innocent , blunders of equally well-meaning and ill-informed suffragists in New York City have involved them in violations of law , and several of their leaders were indicted in June , 1910 , for boycotting and conspiracy . Suffrage is neither a philanthropic scheme nor an economic measure , but a registering machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the suffrage would enable a woman to get the same pay for the same work as a man . What they probably mean by this is , that a woman working the same number of hours at the sante employment as a man , should receive the same pay . But it has been tested , and needs no test , that the work of women for the same time at the same employment as men is not so good in quality or quantity , and for obvious reasons . A woman can not stand physical effort and nervous strain as a man can ; nine hundred and ninety-nine ss o- men ( nit of every thousand go into ? ( ( ris with the fixed intention of aband , tin , it at the first possible moment ; a woman at the period of her greatest energy is liable at any moment to make a contract of marriage , which vitiates other contracts ; and women are less amenable to discipline than men . Suffrage would not increase the physical strength of women ; it would not 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good opport unity to escape from it ; it would not prevent them from marrying if they wished to ; and it would not make them any more amenable to discipline . Suffrage will not enlarge the scope of women 's employments . It kill not enable them to climb telegraph poles , or to construct battleships , or to build sky-scrapers . It will have no effect upon either their work or their wages , work and wages being entirely controlled by the law of supply and demand . VII As to the actual working of woman suffrage , one community alone ? Colorado ? affords a full and fair test , after more than thirty years of suffrage , under conditions more nearly resembling these in older civilizations . In t hat time , charges that the Colorado electorate , as well as those of the other three suffrage states , was peculiarly corrupt , have been brought forward alongside of the counter-claim by the suffragists that Colorado led in reform the great procession of states . In 1904 came the celebrated contested election case of Bonynge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing the city of Denver . This ease was investigated during the second session of the Fifty-eighth Congress ( II . R. report , No. 2705 ) . The methods prevailing in the Colorado electorate were there fully and officially set forth . In this case , the certificateof election had been given to Mr. Shafroth , but it was contested by Mr. Bonynge , and the ballot-boxes were brought to Washington and opened in the House of Representatives . The ballot-boxes disclosed a state of corruption comparable only with the worst days of reconstruction in the South . Out of a total of nearly nine thousand ballots cast , six thousand were fraudulent . In this orgy of fraud and forgery , the women-voters held their own gallantly . It was found that bogus ballots had been placed in the boxes , and in many cases that six or eight or ten of these bogus ballots were folded together in such a way that they could not have been voted separately or legally . The handwriting experts testified that all these bogus ballots had been filled in by four persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had numbered hundreds of these bogus ballots , and had them placed in the ballot-boxes . On page 23 of the report , it will be noted that the polling-list contained 422 names , and was in the handwriting of a woman clerk of the poll . On page 24 it was shown that this woman voted three times , and she also wrote in the party designation for many of the ballots . On the same page it is shown that another woman signed the certificate in two places purporting to have been signed by two other clerks . Certificates in a poll-book , purporting to be signed by each of the judges , were found to be in the handwriting of a woman , a clerk of the poll . On page 5 it is stated that although the names of seventy-five women appear on a poll-list , the committee found but two ballots on which the party name at the top appears to be in the handwriting of women . This gives a slight idea of the corrupt methods prevailing among the women-voters of Colorado . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before been clone in the history of a contested election case in the Congress of the United States . He rose and formally resigned the seat which had been given him upon the prima facie evidence of the certificate of election . Colorado has but three congressional districts , and in the First District is the city of Denver . Therefore , the state of affairs prevailing in the First Congressional District may be reasonably taken as representing one-third of the electorate of Colorado , and that the wealthiest and most enlightened third . No wonder that Judge Moses Hallett , for twenty-seven years United States District Judge for Colorado , and previously Chief Justice of Colorado as a Territory , said in an interview in the Denver Republican , on April 6 , 1902 : ? There is a growing tendency on the part of most of the better and more intelligent of the female voters of Colorado to cease exercising the ballot . If it were to be done over again , the people of Colorado would defeat woman suffrage by an overwhelming majority . ' As to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not indicated by the following Associated Press dispatch , dated Denver , May 17 , 1910 : ' That Denver has gone " wet , " seems assured by the returns received up to eight o'clock to-night . Betting on a " wet " majority is two to one , with very little " dry " money in sight . ' The final ' wet ' majority was two to one . This comes from the oldest and most civilized centre of woman suffrage . From Utah , the only state in which woman suffragists have a majority , came on the 10th of June , 1910 , the following Associated Press dispatch from one of the principals in a proposed prize fight , which had been prohibited in California by Governor Gillett : ' Salt Lake City can handle the fight , and it can be put on July 4th ' ? prizefighting not being illegal in Utah . The introduction of the woman-suffrage question into politics in the last two or three years has already made difficulties . Alen , being the arbiters ; have naturally and wisely kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been mainly carried on by women , who must , of course , settle it among themselves , for it has been shown that men are willing to grant the ballot to we . men as soon as it is proved that a majority of women want it ? and often long before this is proved . Whenever it has come to a test of numbers and political management between the suffragists and the anti-suffragists , the latter have secured an easy and overwhelming victory . In 1894 , a strong effort was made by the suffragists in New York State to have the Constitutional Convention of that year adopt a woman-suffrage amendment . The opposition was not aroused until the amendment appeared to be certain of a majority of votes , Then a rapid campaign was organized , a delegation of women went to Albany , and by masterly tactics they succeeded in having an amendment tacked on to the bill , making voting compulsory . In a few weeks the anti-suffragists defeated the result of twenty-five years of effort on the part of the suffragists . In Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called Referendum of 1895 . The Massachusetts Legislature passed a bill , submitting to the men-voters , and to the women-voters entitled to vote for school committees , the question whether municipal suffrage should be granted to women . The suffragists sought to avoid the test and appealed to the governor to veto the bill after it had passed . Both sides went actively into the campaign . The anti-suf- friutists , with great intelligence , decided to remain away from the polls , while exerting all their influence against the proposed measure . The votes of the Men and the women were kept separate . The result was a majority of 100,000 men opposed to the bill . Out of an estimated number of 575,000 women of voting age , only 22,204 voted in fa% or of the bill . In 47 towns , not one woman 's vote was recorded in favor of it , anal in 138 towns the suffragists secured in each 15 votes or less ; 864 votes were cast against it . This illustrates a fact very important for legislators to recognize ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the National Woman Suffrage convention in April , 1910 , a petition bearing the names of four hundred thousand women asking for suffrage was presented to the Congress of the United States . When it is recalled that there are about twenty million women of voting age in this country who have not asked for a change , it will be seen that the commotion made by the suffragists bears a very small relation to their numbers . The idea of forcing suffrage , with all its attendant complications , and the sacrifice of property privileges , and changing the whole status of forty-five million women and girls and girl-children at the bidding of four hundred thousand , is in itself a monstrous pro-posit ion . If the suffragists believe that suffrage would be advantageous to women , they are justified in urging women to ask for it . But to demand of men that the status of ninety-five per cent of the women of the country be wholly changed at the solicitation of five per cent , certainly shows an admirable hardihood . IX The suffragists have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted , no woman need vote who did not wish to vote . This is equivalent to saying that if a sixteenth amendment , authorizing polygamy , were adopted , no one need practice polygamy who did not wish to do so . Nevertheless , it would change the status of every woman in the United States . Opposition to suffrage does not mean that women should not study public affairs , and take an intelligent interest in them . If women would read the proceedings in Congress and inform themselves upon state and national affairs , it would broaden their minds immensely , and there would be fewer suffragists . It would also add to their charms , because they could take a sympathetic interest in those public questions in which most men are more or less engaged . It was this ability to meet men on their own ground that gave the women of the French salons their power . Those glorious French women enchanted by their grace , their sweetness , and their exquisite femininity , and they ruled by virtue of their intellect and their profound knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , exercise equal power . The suffragists are quite correct in asserting that there are certain public questions in which women have a larger stake , and have probably a better knowledge , than men . One of these questions is divorce and remarriage . It is not overstating the fact to say that divorces in the United States , by their numbers and by the methods through which they are procured , have reached the point of a national leprosy . Perhaps the most important contributing cause has been the extraordinary indulgence shown to women by the divorce laws , which unfortunately make divorce cheap and easy , and force the husband to pay for it . There is always a demand for a uniform divorce law throughout the country , but the diffi- deleted material able connection between suffrage and di ores . If suffrage gives any encourao:entent to divorce , that is enough to condemn it in the eyes of all political economists , all sociologists , all publicists , and all who love honor and decorum . I a ? . k pardon for introducing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may help to disprove the fallacy that it is he woman who works that would profit by the ballot . I was but little pa.t my twenty-first birthday when , on the strength of having earned about , eN en hundred dollars by my pen , I ra , hly assumed the support , by literature , of my family . The rashness , ignorance , and presumption of this can only be excused by the retired life I had led in the library of an old Virginia country-house , and in a community where conditions more nearly reseml ) led the eighteenth than the nineteenth century . That I succeeded was due to tireless effort , unbroken health , a 1111 ni ber of fortunate circumstances , and alto% e all , what I am neither afraid nor ashamed to say , the kindness of the L ; ood God . In the course of time , I became , through literature alone , a householder , a property-owner , a taxpayer , and the regular employer of five persons . My experience , therefore , has been more varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the interests both of the woman who works and the property-owner , the taxpayer , and the employer . I can say with posilk earns that there never was a moment when the possession of a vote would not have been a hindrance and IL burden to me . I had no claim on any nun what ever to help me fight my way to the polls ; after I had voted I could not enforce my vote . I should have become involved in controversies which might have impaired my earning capacity ; and there would have been the temptation , ever present to the weaker individual , of voting to please my employers . From this I was happily exempt . These considerations , great in any woman 's case , would have been enormously increased in the case of a wife and the mother of a family , with all the sacrifice of property privileges and confusion of political and family relations which would have resulted . I admit that I should peculiarly dislike being divorced by a husband for non-support , as the six ladies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot for me which I have mentioned , exist for men . They can fight their way to the polls , and enforce their votes ; the controversies , which are so disastrous and undignified for women , are by no means so among men . In short , men have certain natural qualifications as voters which women have not , and never can acquire , and are perfectly adapted to working the great registering machine called suffrage . In conclusion , it is my earnest hope and belief that the sound good sense of American women will defend them from suffrage , and protect their property privileges , their right to maintenance from their husbands , and their personal dignity . And if the women of this country will unite upon any true reform , such as the abolition of divorce , I believe their power to be so great that they can carry through measures which thinking men desire , but can not effect without the assistance of women . I believe that the most important factors in the state are the wives and mothers who make of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe woman suffrage to be an unmixed evil .
