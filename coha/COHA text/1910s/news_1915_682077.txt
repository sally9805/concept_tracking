Whether the Government will accept Fay 's offer to turn State 's evidence will be determined after his talk with District Attorney Marshall . if Mr. Marshall accepts Fay as a witness , it is considered certain that Walter Scholz , who le in the Tombs in default of bail and is Fay 's brother-in-law , also will offer to testify for the prosecution . No One to be Shielded . Chief Flynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They came back , so it was generally understood , with authorization to go ahead and get at the bottom of the alien conspiracies in this country , and to dig deeply , regardless of whom they hit . Flynn had not been back many hours before he appeared at . the Tombs . It was said that Fay had sent for him . Fay was taken into the room reserved for lawyers consulting their:clients , and for more than an hour ? remained with the Secret Service ? Chief . What Fay told him and whether his disclosures involved the men " higher up " could not be ascertained . Chief Flynn refused to discuss the case from any angle , and when efforts were made to get a note to Fay in the Tombs the Warden informed reporters that the orders were to take no notes to the prisoner . It is now understood that the investigation of Fay 's story by agents of the Secret Service in Europe was completed several days ago , and that they traced his career for the last sixteen years , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teens , gifted with an unusual knowledge of mechanics . This investigation is said to have proved.that Fay 's story of having conferred with a high official of the German Secret Ser : - vice before coming to this country was true , and that he did receive funds from that official before embarking under the name of " J. J. Kearling " on the Rotterdam at Rotterdam . Verified Fay 's Story . Other details of the story told by Fay immediately following his arrest are said to have been checked up in Europe and to have been found to be generally true . Fay is the man 's right name ; he did fight in the German Army , and he was in Brussels on the day on which he says he met the German Secret Service official there . In his statement at the time of his arrest Fay said he had been promoted to a Lieutenancy in the army , and that as such he received a furlough to visit the Uniled States . The Secret Service official in Brussels , he added , gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what he was to do in this country. - The German Secret Service agent , according to Fay , showed him a letter written by Dr. Herbert Kienzle , another of the indicted men , to his tKienzle 's father , which gave the names of various ships engaged in the munition trade out of New York , and specified certain railroads which were transporting ammunition for the Allies to New ' York and ' other American ports . The New York Central and the New York , New Haven &; Hartford were two of the roads named . The letter also mentioned several firms engaged in munition work . The Secret Service official , Fay said , told him to memorize the names and to use the information to identify himself when he arrived in New York . As soon as he landed in New York , Fay continued , he sought out Dr. Kienzle and proved his trustworthiness by Quoting from the letter he had seen in Brussels . Later , he said , he called on Captain Boy-Ed , Naval Attache , and Captain von Papen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , but he added that both of those men told him that he must not in any circumstances tamper with ships In New York Harbor . Fay declared he received also - letters to certain other men , some of them prominent , and all of pronounced German sympathies . Whether he disclosed the names yesterday afternoon Chief Flynn refused to tell . Chief Flynn Reticent The Chief , always reticent , was especially uncommunicative yesterday following his talk with Fay . Re did not deny that Fay bad agreed to be a afternoon and asited if he had anything to say in reply to Dr. Goricar . " Let them prove it : the Secret Service does not make plots . " he said , referring to the German and Austro-Hungarian Secret Services . Captain Boy-Ed and Captain von Papen were not to be seen at the German Club . in Fifty-ninth Street , near Sixth Avenue , which is their home when in New York . Goricar 's Charges Dented . witness for the Government , but beyond that tacit admission he refused to discuss the case . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were concerned about their own fate , rumors about what one or both would tell regarding the activities of alien and other conspirators in this country cropped up on all sides . Some of these rumors were to the effect that the disclosures would lead straight to diplomatic and consular representa- I tives of at fewest two of the European belligerents , and that two or more prominent German-Americans might be called on to explain to District Attor- i ney Marshall . The American Secret Service agents in Europe now are said to have checited up most , if not all , of Fay 's original story , with details of his life for the last sixteen years , and practically all the intricacies of the alleged plot which brought ' him to this country under an assumed name end posing as a Scotchman . Fay knows that the Government is in possession of all these facts , and , realizing that his case is hopeless , is believed to have decided to throw himself on the mercy of the Government Prosecutor . It was said yesterday that since his arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically cast aside and left to drift alone by the men who formerly backed him and who he had been led to believe would stand by him no matter what happened . For three weeks be has tried in vain to get ball . He had to ask United States Commissioner Houghton , before whom he was arraigned , to appoint a lawyer to look after his interests . Patrick J. of 28 Park Row was appointed . Mr , could not be rouna yesterday . Two More May Be Indicted . Fay is expected to devote several hours to the telling of his story before District Attorney Marshall and Chief Flynn today . It was rumored last night that at fewest two additional indictments in the conspiracy case might be forthcoming as a result of his new disclosures . One of the men involved is of some prominence . In addition to the wide investigation into the munition ship conspiracy , the Secret Service is trying to verify the statements of Dr. Joseph Goricar , tile former member of the Austro-Hungarian Consular Service , who has stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central powers number at fewest 3,000 , that those countries scattered minions of dollars indiscriminately in the United States , and that Captain BoyEd and Captain von Papen , acting directly with Consul Genera ! von Nuber , the Austro-Hungarian Consul General in New York , are the directing heads of the spy system . These three men , he said . had " full and complete knowledge " of every move made by every spy of the central powers in America . Consul General von Nuber was found at the Metropolitan Club yesterday In another part of Dr. Goricar 's statement , printed yesterday , he told of a visit that Marcus Braun of this city paid to the Austro-Hungarian Consulate General in Berlin shortly after the war began . He said Braun told him that he had been in England and had come to tell the Austrian officials what he had seen there , and that arrangements had been made to have Braun 's pro-German paper , called Fair Play , subsidized by Count von Bernstorff. the German Ambassador , when he ( Braun ) returned to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goricar , " that Braun got a considerable amount of money from the Austro-Hungarian authorities as well as from the German Ambassador . " Braun yesterday branded as " a lie out of the whole cloth " all the statements made by Dr. Goricar . He said he had met Dr. Goricar at the Consulate General oft , Austria-Hungary in Berlin , but denied That he had told his accuser he had made observations in England of value to the Teutonic powers or that he had Intimated in any way that his paper was to be subsidized by Count von Bernstorff . Neither the German nor the Austro-Hungarian Governments , he added , ever had given him a cent of money . Braun said he went to Germany and Austria-Hungary to take money to relatives of citizens of those countries resident in this country , who had no other way of getting the money to their families . He said he took about $100,000 . " Instead of getting money as this man says I did , " said Braun , " I had to borrow $100 from Ambassador Gerard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities now being investigated is the report that several hundred women are connected with the spy system in this country .
