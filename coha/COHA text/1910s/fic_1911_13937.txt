SCENE .  --  Living room in JUSTIN RAWSON 'S Long Island Country house . Late summer after breakfast of a sunny day . The apartment is handsomely and choicely furnished , with a suggestion in everything of dignity and family pride . A very wide porch door opens upon a broad veranda , center , and beyond the veranda is seen an Italian garden and a glimpse of sand dunes and ocean . Hollyhocks look in at the low window , wide open , Left . Between the window and the porch door is a staircase , and close to the staircase a door admitting to domestic offices . Right , another door connecting with the library ; a private telephone on the wall near this door When the curtain rises ANTHONY and NINA are having an intimate little chat , ANTHONY half sitting on the edge of the table Right , and NINA leaning as enticingly as she knows how on the handle of a carpet-sweeper . ANTHONY is a good-looking , polished fellow of twenty-seven , but perhaps you would not trust him . Just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ear . She listens with sparkling eyes , roguishly NINA standing away with a shriek of laughter . Oh , Mr. Anthony ! Are n't you an article ! ANTHONY demurelyWhy , what have I said now ? p. 3 NINA with gigglesOh , you imp ! Feigns to slap him I never knew the beat of you for reeling off nonsense . ANTHONY You know very well every word I 've said is solemn truth ! Stepping towards her NINA gailyYou expect me to believe that ?  --  ANTHONY feigning jealousyOh , you 'd believe it quick enough if Mr. Geoffrey said it . NINA archlyHe ai n't that kind . Mr. Geoffrey 's rather slow about some things . Very different from you . ANTHONY aware of his own charmsNow ! Now ! NINA Well , it may be a break for me to say so , seein ' as he 's your own brother , Mr. Anthony ; but I never could stomach what you might call the farmer type ! Even when they 're dressed up , seems like you can always smell the barn on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the two , begins a minute inspection of the corners of the apartment . NINA resumes a pretense of work but continuesGive me cowboys on the stage ; but do n't let ' em get too close to me in real life ! p. 4 ANTHONY patronizinglyLost something , Kitson ? KITSON who is a highly self-respecting family retainer , with a mournful mannerNo , sir . Resumes inspection ANTHONY You seem very busy . Might I inquire what you 're doing ? KITSON sadlyMy duty , sir . NINA pertlyMr . Kitson always goes the rounds like that every morning , to see I do n't leave out anything . KITSON bristlingAnd good enough reason for it , I may say ! NINA Yes , indeed ! Do n't know how you 'd earn your wages if it was n't for that . Puts carpet-sweeper off Right KITSON draws himself up for a tremendous rejoinder , but recollects himself in the presence of ANTHONY , saying only in a sad voice KITSON There was a time when housemaids was taught to know their place . ANTHONY laughingThere was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so  --  when you were rather less of a meddlesome old nuisance than you are now . p. 5 KITSON You would not speak so to me , sir , in the presence of Mr. Rawson . ANTHONY Which reminds me , have you seen my father around anywhere ? KITSON I saw him going towards the stables , sir , just now . ANTHONY Looking for Geoffrey  --  of course ! There may be need of me out there ! Confidentially to NINASee you later ? Exit by porch KITSON with authorityWhat 's that he said to you , Nina ? NINA What 's what he said to me ? KITSON  --  Under his breath . NINA What 'll you give me if I tell you ? KITSON commandinglyI asked you a question . NINA confidentiallyHe said : " Do n't tell Kitson . " KITSON with swelling indignationYou think you 're very fine and clever , do n't you , young lady ? You think you can put on all the smart airs you like , do n't you ? And why ? Why ? Just because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 NINA irritatedWhen anybody makes a fool of me , I 'll run straight and tell you , Kitson ! KITSON No need ! I 've got two eyes in my head . I 've seen you half a dozen times together in the last three days , whispering and laughing ; and I tell you now , I do n't want to see it again . NINA Well , do n't look ! KITSON You 'd ought to be ashamed of yourself , and him engaged to be married , and his young lady here in this very house ! NINA Well , that 's not my lookout , is it ? I did n't bring Miss de Salle here , did I ; nor her family neither , did I ? And if Mr. Anthony stops now and again to exchange a word with me , in a friendly way , I for one ca n't see no harm in it . KITSON solemnlyYou look out for that man . JUSTIN 'S voice , very angry is heard outside NINA My goodness ! Dashes up to porch door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' it for fair this time !  --  Me for the woods ! Exits hastily JUSTIN speaking off stageNo ! No ! You 're wrong  --  I say you 're entirely wrong .  --  It is you who choose to take my words as referring to the whole question of your attitude toward Anthony . I had no wish to bring that matter up at the present time . Enter JUSTIN and GEOFFREY . ANTHONY is seen followingFor once , I hoped that you would consent to listen to me quietly and reasonably without flying into a passion . p. 7 GEOFFREY not ruffledAm I really in a passion , Dad ? Enter ANTHONY who stands by deferentially JUSTIN Without flying into a passion , I said , or assuming this air of outraged virtue which exasperates me to the last degree . He storms up and down the room while GEOFFREY , more puzzled than disturbed , watches him , arms folded JUSTIN RAWSON is an American gentleman of somewhat advanced middleage ; dignity and consciousness of race are bespoken in his every movement . GEOFFREY , his younger son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all at ease amid these repressive surroundings . His attire suggests the stock-raiser ANTHONY stepping up with anxious countenanceFather , do n't take it so much to heart . I am sure Geoffrey meant nothing by it ! JUSTIN to ANTHONYNo . Nothing at all ! Nothing more than he always means by his jealous , suspicious , unbrotherly behavior toward you . ANTHONY makes a deprecatory gestureYou are with us for a week 's stay , only . I insist that Geoffrey , who has nothing to do  --  GEOFFREY makes gesture of protest  --  who has nothing , I say , to do , shall exert himself toward making your visit pleasurable . p. 8 ANTHONY But , with a few exceptions , Geoffrey has been uniformly considerate , indeed  --  JUSTIN cutting him offI do not think the less of you , Anthony , for your readiness to defend him . But you are too generous . Be so kind as to leave us . ANTHONY But , Father !  --  I really  --  He is dismissed with a gesture , and exits to the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of having heard nothing JUSTIN in controlled voiceKitson ! KITSON Yes , sir . JUSTIN You may go . KITSON Yes , sir . Exits Left JUSTIN And now , sir  --  now you may tell me why you are always making occasions to slight your brother . Is it because he 's three years your senior ? Is it because he has devoted himself assiduously to his business and is already making a name for himself ; while you have been a rolling stone , now here , now in the West , agriculturist , cowboy , sheep raiser , gentleman-farmer  --  anything and everything except a steady , industrious , conservative citizen !  --  Look at Anthony ! His good habits , his manners , his respect  --  I might say , reverence  --  for his elders ! Do they not make you blush for shame ? A pauseSo for once you have nothing to say for yourself ? p. 9 GEOFFREY mildlyNo , nothing  --  except that for the life of me I ca n't see what I 've done to make you so angry . JUSTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet with outraged manner GEOFFREY You suggested that I go for a ride with Miss de Salle . I said I had rather not . That was all . JUSTIN It does not occur to you that you have any obligations either toward your brother or our English guests . GEOFFREY I should think it was Anthony 's place to go with her . JUSTIN You are perfectly well aware that Anthony does n't know how to ride . GEOFFREY I 'd be glad to teach him . JUSTIN You are the animal-man in this family . Anthony 's career has occupied his attention while you have been riding your precious bronchos in New Mexico . GEOFFREY vehementlyYes , and God knows I 'd be there now if you had n't asked me to come home . Do you think I wanted to leave the ranch ? His face glows with longing and memoryOh ! That 's real ! JUSTIN I wished you to come back and live like a civilized member of society . p. 10 GEOFFREY It 's no use . JUSTIN You are certainly right , so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GEOFFREY earnestlyI give you my word , Dad , I did not mean to be discourteous . He is embarrassed JUSTIN peremptorilyYour reason , then , for refusing to ride with Miss de Salle ! She loves riding . GEOFFREY much embarrassedI was busy . JUSTIN with an outburstBusy ! With your pigs , I presume . Does it mean nothing to you that Anthony has chosen for his wife  --  Enter by porch , MISS RAWSON , hastily MISS RAWSON Justin ! Justin ! Indicating gardenMrs . Leavitt ! MISS RAWSON , an elderly lady of distinguished demeanor , is the image of caste-pride JUSTIN impatientlyMrs . Leavitt ! Mrs. Leavitt 's in New York . MISS RAWSON She came back last night .  --  Please , Brother  --  p. 11 JUSTIN I beg your pardon . To GEOFFREYBe so good as to come into the study . Exit GEOFFREY , RightThis matter 's not settled yet . No ! Not by any means . Exit JUSTIN , Right . MISS RAWSON goes up to meet MRS . LEAVITT , a young woman of charming , rather effusive manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice to have you back again ! Was it very dreadful in the city ? MRS . LEAVITT with a gesture of stiflingAbsolutely indescribable ! Oh , it is heavenly to be home again ! MISS RAWSON pressing bellI was so anxious to have you return before the departure of our delightful guests . They are to stay until next week . MRS . LEAVITT I am wild to meet the future Mrs. Anthony . MISS RAWSON You will love her . To NINA who has enteredNina , please tell our guests that Mrs. Leavitt is here . Exit NINA by stairsYes , and her family too ! Mrs. de Salle , a dignified woman , silent , keeping much to herself , yet not without a certain originality  --  some would call it eccentricity ;  --  and Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh , the older daughter , who quite answers to my ideal of an English lady ,  --  a little formal , a little  --  p. 12 MRS . LEAVITT Formal ! Rising in dismayOh , dear ! What will she think of me for calling so informally ! A gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privately  --  Miss Rawson , I ran away from home . MISS RAWSON Ran away ? MRS . LEAVITT gailyYes . A fugitive . I was having cold chills . MISS RAWSON What do you mean ? MRS . LEAVITT in lowered voiceYou know we are planning a simple little memorial at Woodlawn for Mr. Leavitt 's mother ; and this morning by the first train  --  Oh , quite without being asked to come , I assure you ,  --  who should turn up but this strange creature ; Swallow , his name is ,  --  representing some tombstone firm in Hoboken , New Jersey !  --  He appeared before the gates of Willowfields at nine A.M. and evidently intends staying until the crack of doom . JUSTIN heard off RightWrong ! Wrong ! Radically , essentially , totally wrong ! MRS . LEAVITT startledGoodness , what 's that ? MISS RAWSON trying to explainIt 's only Justin . He does not always find  --  Geoffrey  --  p. 13 MRS . LEAVITT consolinglyYes , I know so well ! Many things must be hard for both of you ! Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Anthony is doing so very well . MISS RAWSON Anthony is a Rawson !  --  Well , Nina ! To NINA who has re-entered by stairs NINA Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh presents her compliments , Madam , and says they will be down directly . Exit MRS . LEAVITT Bumpstead-Leigh ! what a fascinating name  --  it seems to mean so much ! And I understand the Reverend Algernon Bumpstead-Leigh is one of those British younger sons who has entered the Church and is directly in line for Bishop 's orders and the House of Lords . I read all about it last night in the Evening Chronicle . MISS RAWSON horrifiedThe Evening Chronicle ! MRS . LEAVITT Yes , did n't you know ? There was fully half a column on the society page . MISS RAWSON Oh , no ! It is too horrible ! Must our personal affairs be hawked and peddled about the streets ? The thought makes me ill ! MRS . LEAVITT disconcertedOh , but you must n't let it trouble you so , dear Miss Rawson . There was nothing more than a hint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 14 MISS RAWSON It is n't that ; oh , it is n't that ! No , it 's the idea of having our family connected in any way , shape , or manner with the vulgar , sensational press of the present day . MRS . LEAVITT Yes , yes , I understand . MISS RAWSON We must not let a word of this wretched affair get to the de Salles . They are even more conservative than we . Why , until they knew absolutely the origin and standing of Anthony 's family , they would not think of ratifying the engagement . It was for that reason they consented to cross the ocean with him . MRS . LEAVITT Oh , I see . And of course , they are satisfied . MISS RAWSON Yes . They are satisfied . So are we . Everything about them pleases me . The Rectory occupied by the Bumpstead-Leighs in Trumpington-on-Swell is restored from an old monastery of the early Tudor period . From attic to cellar it is filled with old oak panelling , ancient plate , ancestral portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salles ? MISS RAWSON The de Salles are American . MRS . LEAVITT American ! MISS RAWSON Yes , in origin ; that is one cause for my being especially drawn to them ; yet the name is Norman-French  --  that means something . p. 15 MRS . LEAVITT What a fascinating blend ! MISS RAWSON Yes , the girls were born in this country  --  Washington , I think  --  but they have always lived on the other side ; educated at the most exclusive pensions ; speaking several languages ; combining , one might say , a moral heritage which is truly American with the charm and culture of the older civilization . MRS . LEAVITT How well you put it , Miss Rawson ! MISS RAWSON If I do , it is only because I feel so deeply what it all means in this day and age . The typical American young woman of to-day , with her manners that are anything but manners , her bold forward speech , her smartness , her slang ,  --  downright illiteracy , that is what I call it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the earth ! Checking her own vehemenceOh , I know I am quite out of date ; the world has changed  --  I do not say gone forward  --  since I was a girl ; but there are a few things I insist upon , and I shall continue to insist upon them as long as I can insist upon anything . Family heads the list ! MRS . LEAVITT Then no wonder you welcome the de Salles . MISS RAWSON And for more than one reason . Anthony was truly impressed by the home life of the Bumpstead-Leighs . The devotion of Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh to her husband is very beautiful . And , of course , though I do not care to insist upon the point , it does mean something to us , that in Trumpington-on-Swell Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh is the acknowledged social leader . So now you can understand why we welcome the de Salles and regard the union as one I may say peculiarly happy and suitable . In the course of this last speech MRS . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH has descended the stairs as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ladies , until the suitable moment should come for interrupting their conversation . She concludes that the moment has now come and descends the remaining stairs with cordial , vivid , yet slightly patronizing eagerness . MRS . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH ADELAIDE is an exceedingly British lady still in her early thirties . She is handsome , polished , radiant , electrical , mental ; and there is a born domination , a concealed aggressiveness in her demeanor which suggests that it would not be desirable nor perhaps quite safe to antagonize her . You recognize her instantly as a leader , a commander . Gracious , affable always , you sense the iron underneath p. 16 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH in her most voluble British mannerOh , I do love your American way of paying calls in the morning . It is so deliciously informal , so en famille !  --  or perhaps , I err in thinking so ? Surely it is not the usual , the prescribed hour .  --  Yet why not ? Why should not one devote these brightest and choicest moments of the day to social intercourse . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . LEAVITT with a warmth which yet does not lack condescensionWith Mrs. Leavitt , I am sure , I need not insist upon a formal introduction . I have heard so many charming things of you from your amiable husband , Mr. Leavitt . I am truly charmed to make your acquaintance . MRS . LEAVITT overwhelmedPerfectly  --  delighted ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH to MISS RAWSONI am so very , very sorry to precede Mamma and Violet . I only consented to come down upon their express promise to follow directly . MISS RAWSON to MRS . LEAVITTViolet was off for a long tramp , all by herself , before breakfast . To ADELAIDEI do hope that she was not over-fatigued . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Oh , no  --  not at all , and so very kind of you to think of it . Violet is like all our English girls , in her love for the free , outdoor life . But your morning sun over here  --  I do n't know I am sure how to account for it  --  seems to radiate a peculiarly burning , exhausting heat .  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ANTHONY has just entered from porch . He hastily scrutinizes the group and seems dissatisfied p. 17 ANTHONY How do you do , Mrs. Leavitt ! Coming to her MRS . LEAVITT My dear Anthony ! How well you are looking ! Taking his hand **25;2647;TOOLONG ! Sincere congratulations ! We are so awfully glad ! ANTHONY to MRS . LEAVITT rather absentlyThank you , thank you . To ADELAIDEBut where is Violet ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH She will be down in a minute . ANTHONY with feigned indifferenceOf course she knows that Mrs. Leavitt is here ? MRS . DE SALLE has entered by stairs BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH brightlyMamma comes next !  --  the order is climactic . ANTHONY repeating this time to MRS . DE SALLEViolet has been told of course that Mrs. Leavitt is here ? MRS . DE SALLE embarrassedOh , yes , a dozen times ! I 'm sure she 'll come down right away . The grand manner sits somehow rather grotesquely on MRS . DE SALLE and like her clothes , which are irreproachably elegant , seems not altogether to be hers by original right . Underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unceasing anxiety , an apprehension of well , I do n't know quite what , but something p. 18 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with vivid emphasis as if to prevent the possibility of MRS . DE SALLE saying morePerhaps she was a trifle over-tired by her tramp . Though there is not the slightest cause for apprehension . MRS . DE SALLE Oh , not the slightest cause for apprehension . And we can not fail to notice how eagerly she seizes every opportunity to echo the perfectly safe pronouncements of her daughter MISS RAWSON risingMrs. de Salle , permit me to introduce Mrs. Leavitt . MRS . DE SALLE with a shadow of ADELAIDE 'S mannerVery charmed . MRS . LEAVITT Delighted !  --  How interesting that your daughter should be devoted to walking . Is she a great nature-lover ? MRS . DE SALLE Oh no ! She has always been perfectly healthy . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH seating herself with a compellingly gracious airI do not know what it can precisely be about our young English girls .  --  Though almost invariably enjoying the best of health , they seem to lack a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your girls of America . p. 19 MISS RAWSON Indeed ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Your American girls constantly strike me with wonder ; they are so lithe , so muscular , with their great splendid hands , and feet , divinely intended , one might say , without a shadow of irreverence , for struggle with your more elemental conditions over here . MRS . DE SALLE approvinglyYes . Elemental ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH I seem to be watching a parade of magnificent animals ! Am I correctly informed , Anthony , that in certain of your institutions of learning for young women , the students meet regularly in football contests with antagonists of the opposite sex ? ANTHONY I question it . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH a me donne les frissons !  --  yet why ? Only because , in imagination , I seem to see our girls so engaged . And the thought comes ; has not the American young woman inherited many of the best traits of the Indian women  --  what was the scientific term for them ? Papooses ?  --  that preceded her ? MISS RAWSON horrified but impressedOf course , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , surely not ! And yet family , here in America , impresses us English as being such an odd , tangled sort of affair ! p. 20 MISS RAWSON who finds her own sentiments echoedNo doubt ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH I mean to say  --  One never knows to whom one may be related ! As Lady Fitzhugh was remarking to me one day  --  Anthony , you will recall Lady Fitzhugh ?  --  ANTHONY Yes , of course ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH One of the most charming creatures in the world  --  and a Granville !  --  " Dearest Adelaide , " she exclaimed , in that odd , emphatic manner of hers , " do all American women marry their fathers ' chauffeurs , and all American men their mothers ' cook ? " MISS RAWSON Dear , dear ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH " By no means always , " I replied . " Sometimes they remarry them , "  --  intending , by that little emendation , to allude to the shocking frequency of divorce in this country . MISS RAWSON It is shocking ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Lady Fitzhugh , I may add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , with the utmost kindness and amiability , of a sermon my husband had delivered the previous Sunday upon the sanctity of the marriage bond . MISS RAWSON A good subject ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH " I am proud , " said she , " that our dear Algernon takes so sound a view of this solemn institution ! When he is appointed Bishop of Highchester , we shall expect some notable utterances on these pressing social questions . " From the study is heard the voice of JUSTIN p. 21 JUSTIN No ! No ! Not a word ! ANTHONY Oh , I hope Father is not being severe with Geoffrey . MISS RAWSON Your Father is the soul of Justice ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH He is indeed ! Mr. Rawson has quite the English sense of equity . So different in that respect from our popular idea of the Yankee . MRS . DE SALLE Yes , so different . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH When I return to Staffordshire , I promise you I shall do my best to correct those false and libellous misconceptions . You can have no idea what strange beings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes ! MRS . LEAVITT Oh , I suppose not . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH I recall very well how our friend , Lord Clitheroe , asked me one day : " Is it true that the accepted Yankee method of execution is by the lynch ? " I hastened to assure him that , though I had not visited the States since my girlhood , such I knew to be not the case . " The law , " I said , " is held in the highest respect in the older parts of the country , near the Coast . " I shall be able to speak even more emphatically after my return , for I may truly say , I have seen no lawlessness , no bloodshed , no violence of any sort whatever during my present visit here . p. 22 ANTHONY We are fortunate in having such a devoted champion . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Ah , you are too kind . England is the home of my adoption , but I can never forget what I owe to America . MRS . DE SALLE echoinglyNo ! never ! Telephone rings MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Goes to ' phone MISS RAWSON To the DE SALLESThe private wire brings friends even closer . MRS . LEAVITT at ' phoneYes ? Is that you , Stephen ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH to MRS . DE SALLEDear Mamma , I do believe we must have one between the Rectory and Lady Fitzhugh 's . It would be such a convenience . MRS . LEAVITT at ' phoneVery well , I 'll come over at once . Returning to MISS RAWSONI 'm so sorry , but my advice is wanted at home ; so I shall have to put off meeting Miss de Salle until another time , after all . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH She will be inconsolable . MRS . DE SALLE echoingYes  --  inconsolable ! p. 23 MISS RAWSON accompanying MRS . LEAVITT to porchMy dear , could n't you and Stephen come over to lunch ? We 'll have it on the porch . There is such a lovely picnic flavor in the air today . ANTHONY joining themLet me second the invitation ! MRS . LEAVITT Why , yes , it would be sweet . We 'll be delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by porch MISS RAWSON as they goThen we shall look for you about one . Their voices are heard outside as they leave the porch . MRS . DE SALLE is following them vaguely with somewhat the air of a Guilty Thing and as if hoping to avoid being left alone with her brilliant daughter . But she has not reached the porch door before she is halted dead in her tracks by a peremptory command from ADELAIDE BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH MA ! MRS . DE SALLE turning as if expecting a whippingYes , Della ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Where you going ? MRS . DE SALLE Nowhere . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Come here ! MRS . DE SALLE comesWhat the dickens has got into Violet ? Her voice is scarcely recognizable in its raw ; almost strident American homespun p. 24 MRS . DE SALLE wringing her handsOh , I 'm sure I have n't an idea ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Whatever it is , it 's got to be knocked out , and no delay ! If Ollie do n't attend to business , she 'll mull everything ! MRS . DE SALLE weakly protestingOh I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you backin ' her up ? MRS . DE SALLE collapsingDella , I do n't know what I 'm a-doin ' . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Humph ! The usual situation ! If you 'd once learned to know what you were doing , you would n't have played so beautifully into the hands of that cat-eyed peddlar of slanders , Lady Fitzhugh ! MRS . DE SALLE aghastLady Fitzhugh ! I never told a thing to Lady Fitzhugh ! I did n't , I did n't ! Sits helpless BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH To be sure ! Of course not ! But for all that , Lady Fitzhugh managed very neatly to worm out of you that we came from Missionary Loop , Indiana , and that Dad made every cent he had out of patent medicine . MRS . DE SALLE on her feetI never !  --  I never said a word about the Sayles 's Favorite Stomach Elixir , or the Sissapoola Indian Herb remedies ! Nothing in the world would make me open my mouth ! p. 25 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH curtlyRats , Ma !

He 's insulted , distressed  --  all that a faithful husband should be  --  but  --  he calls on me to deny everything . " Cable reply "  --  that 's the postscript . p. 26 MRS .

" Half of what that gassy old windbag of a Fitzhugh says is sure to be lies , anyhow . MRS . DE SALLE cheeringlyBut now , I reckon this match of Ollie 's ' ll stop her mouth . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Yes ! Yes ! Bitterly " This match of Ollie 's ! " That comes well from you just at the moment when you 're doing your best to smash it . MRS . DE SALLE Me ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Look here !

BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Sh !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have Violet here in five minutes . Understand ? Do n't be a jellyfish !  --  There ! MRS . DE SALLE exits helplessly by the stairs . ADELAIDE turns quickly and goes with a manner of comprehending sympathy to ANTHONY , once more the irreproachable , unapproachable MRS . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH , and holding out her hands to him she exclaims : My dear boy !  --  Something is wrong ! p. 27 ANTHONY sullenlyThere 's something I do n't understand . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Tell me , frankly , candidly , as brother to sister  --  there has been no  --  no difference ? ANTHONY Not a shadow . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Might it not be merely the effect of excitement  --  the fag , the novelty of everything ? ANTHONY Is that a reason for avoiding me ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Of course not  --  and yet  --  ANTHONY Let me tell you !  --  Since I first observed the change in her , I have been more attentive than usual , and yet she is unresponsive ,  --  cold ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH It is only a phase ,  --  a mere transient little phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of her love you are sure .  --  You must be patient ! ANTHONY with dignityI have been patient ! She knows that Mrs. Leavitt wished to meet her and she refused to come down . It was an affront . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Tell her frankly what you think ! Perhaps you will discover the trouble  --  and if not , let me try . But be very tender with her !  --  At this moment , VIOLET DE SALLE enters by the stairs . She is a sweet , straight-forward girl of eighteen , naturally candid and sincere . Her manner is unaffected and cultivated . She hesitates ; then comes reluctantly toward ADELAIDE p. 28 VIOLET You wished to see me , Adelaide ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH sweetlyYes ,  --  that is , no , not now . There was something I wished to ask you , but it can wait . Glancing at her watch  --  For I promised Geoffrey to visit his kennels . I am a bit late Going VIOLET uneasilyOh , may n't I come with you ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with gentle authorityOh , no , Violet dear ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . You must remain quietly indoors until after lunch . Her eyes smile gently upon her sister ; but if you look you may see one hand kindly placed on VIOLET 'S shoulder suddenly stiffen as it imparts a vigorous push to the unwilling girl . And with this , she exits , to porch ANTHONY after a moment 's silent regard of the girl , who does not return his gazeViolet , do you know that you have caused me a great deal of pain ? VIOLET with timid concernOh , have I , Anthony ? I 'm so sorry . It has n't been intentional . Indeed it has n't . ANTHONY sharpeningDo you mean to say that your failure to appear just now was unintentional . p. 29 VIOLET simplyYes , truly , I meant to come . ANTHONY Then why did n't you ? VIOLET faintlyI do n't know .  --  I  --  I seemed to want to be alone . ANTHONY with ironyYou seem to want to be alone often of late . What about this solitary expedition over the dunes before breakfast ? VIOLET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VIOLET frightenedOh  --  no ! ANTHONY putting his arm about her endearingly , shows her to the sofa where they sitCome ! I 've got you all to myself at last . We must talk ! Sit down . Violet , you are not like yourself . Tell me , are you hiding something ? Have you been naughty ? Eh ? Have you ? Have you ? He insists wheedlingly and ends by kissing her in rather a lavish manner VIOLET freeing herself with a little cryOh ! ANTHONY Why , what 's wrong ? VIOLET faintlyI thought I heard someone . p. 30 ANTHONY Well , what of it ? Need we be ashamed ? Is n't our love noble , divinely ordained ? Moments like these , when I speak to you as to my second self , are the summmits of life ; delectable mountains from which , hand in hand , we look into new , untraveled lands , behold transporting visions of beauty and truth ! It would be quite proper and natural , of course , for VIOLET to be swept away by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she only replies , rather feebly VIOLET What a vocabulary you have , Anthony . ANTHONY fondlyOnly when you inspire me , darling ! Without you I am mute . You are like some rare , precious wine . When I put you to my lips , a new joy , an inspiration , a feeling of exuberant vitality sweeps over me . The World does not know me , Violet ! It thinks me sedate , cold , passionless ,  --  clever too , perhaps ,  --  VIOLET faintlyOh , yes , very clever , Anthony ; everyone speaks of that . ANTHONY People say , " There is a man with a future ; a man who will make his mark some day ! " But , of my true self , beloved , what does the world know ? Nothing !  --  That is for you !  --  Warming to herNone but you has ever stirred those slumbering fires  --  p. 31 VIOLET jumping nervously upOh , there is Adelaide ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH entering gailyHave you Americans that droll old saying about a bad penny always turning up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see the dogs , Della ? Oh , are n't they the sweetest dears ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH No , I did n't see the dogs . Geoffrey met a man who wanted to buy a pig .  --  Really , Anthony , your brother is by way of being quite a farmer , is not he ! ANTHONY with veiled contemptThe pigs are the most recent addition to his stock , I believe . VIOLET Oh , they are heavenly pigs , Della ! There 's one old mother who took a prize at the County Fair , and she has seven of the darlingest little pink babies . Geoffrey let me pick one up . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH horrifiedViolet ! VIOLET Why not ? It has the cutest little face ,  --  exactly like a little wee baby .  --  Geoffrey promised I should take it back to Trumpington-on-Swell . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH burying her faceOh ! Oh ! p. 32 ANTHONY jealouslyStrange , I have heard nothing of all these expeditions to the kennels and the pig pens . VIOLET innocentlyI did n't suppose you 'd care to come , Anthony . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandlyOh , not at all  --  not at all . VIOLET goes thoughtfully to the window , Left , and stands there looking out BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Since Chantecler , barnyards have come quite into good odour , I believe .  --  Oh , Anthony , I had all but forgotten ! Mr. Leavitt was inquiring for you ,  --  some little business matter , he said . I promised to tell you . He is in the library , I think . ANTHONY goingWith your permission , Violet ? VIOLET makes no rejoinder BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH apart to ANTHONY , as he passes herDid you get any clue ? ANTHONY shakes his headLeave it to me . Exit ANTHONY . For a moment , ADELAIDE silently watches her sister , then with decision she abruptly challenges her , and her manner is once more that of the ambitious but untutored daughter of IndianaOllie , you 've kicked up enough how-do-do in the last forty-eight hours to smash everything ! I guess you 'd better give me some explanations , young lady ! p. 33 VIOLET mildlyI do n't know what you mean . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take me for a blind bat ? VIOLET innocentlyI have n't intended to offend him . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH unspeakably contemptuousAnd pray , is that your recipe for holding on to a man ! If any girl but my own sister said such a fool thing , I 'd consign her to the psychopathic ward and be done with it . What have you been toted around Europe for all these years , if not to learn how to play the game ? You 've hooked a fish  --  I grant you , though the credit 's more mine than yours ! But he ai n't in the frying pan yet , by a long sight , an ' do n't you forget it ! VIOLET hurtDella , please . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH throwing arms about her with affectionate mannerThere , there , dear ! I may be too blunt ; but after all , it 's only because I 'm thinking of what 's best for you . Come , let 's talk it over quietly !  --  Ollie , I want you to trust me . Is that wantin ' too much ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I hardly knew ye any more . Perhaps you think I do n't care , but I do ,  --  Violet , I do care . p. 34 VIOLET yielding to sudden sobs , while she leans her head on ADELAIDE 'S bosomOh , Della , I 'm so unhappy ! I wish I were dead ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with shrewd smile of triumph  --  as she tenderly pats herTell your old sister all about it . VIOLET I used to think it did n't matter ; but now  --  just these last few days ,  --  oh , it 's been making me feel so ashamed and humiliated to be deceiving everybody like this . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Deceiving everybody ?  --  PauseWhy , what do you mean , Violet ? VIOLET with accusing eyesYou know what I mean ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Indeed I do not !  --  Whom have you been deceiving ? VIOLET Anthony , Geoffrey , Miss Rawson !  --  everybody ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH hardening a littleYe have ! What have you been deceivin ' ' em about ? VIOLET withdrawing into herselfIt 's no use !  --  I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH seemingly deeply woundedOh , Violet ! What have I done to get treated like this ? p. 35 VIOLET softening again I did n't mean it that way . It 's only  --  you know as well as I do , that if these people knew all about us , and who we were , they would n't have us here for anything in the world . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Now look me straight in the eye !  --  Do you honestly think yourself their inferior ? VIOLET thoughtfullyNo  --  but that 's not the point . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH bitinglyThe point is : You think we ought to tell them all about Sayles 's Favorite Stomach Elixir , and the Sissapoola Indian Herb Remedies ! VIOLET shudderingI do n't think I could , even if I thought I ought to . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH remorselesslyYou 'd like them to know how , on every bottle , was emblazoned the picture of our lamented sire  --  thus !  --  Raising one hand , as if in blessing , and assuming a grotesquely benignant countenanceover the words : " Old Jim Sayles , the Sufferer 's Friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to have lived  --  only to have lived with that till I was twenty years old , without forcing me now to rake up the hideous recollections ! How they used to guy me about it , even in Missionary Loop ! Imitating a native of her native town " Wa'l , wa'l ! So you be old Jim Sayles 's gal ! Say , I hear tell as how up to your hum , they gives ye Stomach Elixir on yer pancakes . "  --  Are we accountable for what our Dad happened to be and what he happened to do ? Is that our fault ? Are we branded ? Thank God , no ! That 's done with ! We 've paid the price ! For everything we 've gained , we 've paid the price ! p. 36 VIOLET with conviction but very simplyNot honestly ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH urgently , with equal convictionYes , honestly ! Did n't the most expensive heraldic bureau in New York say we had a perfect right to the name de Salle ? Did n't they say it could be proved definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named that ?  --  Well , there 's no criminality so far , is there ! And then we went to Washington without a friend in the world . Mother rented the house on Lafayette Circle , and you and I attended the swellest day school in the city . How I worked to lay on a little culture and style and savoir faire for those two awful years ! You were a youngster . You escaped all that !  --  VIOLET with ironic emphasisOh , I remember ! It was n't until the second year that any of the girls at Miss Westleigh 's would be seen with me . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Very likely not ! But before we quit Washington , mother had a visiting list with thirty-four bona fide names on it  --  two senator 's wives , and the wife of the Secretary of the French Embassy . That 's something ! And through Madame Epervier we got a little foothold in Paris ; and then on , and on , one step after another ! I 've worked like a horse for everybody !  --  Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to know , if it was n't for me ? Eh ? Answer me that , will you . VIOLET is silentVery likely the wife of Missionary Loop 's most popular grocer . And every night about bedtime , while he 'd be sittin ' in front of the base burner in his stockin ' feet , you 'd be havin ' a nice piece o ' apple pie together ! Perhaps you 'd be Secretary of the Missionary Loop Culture Club ! That would be something to live for , would n't it ! p. 37 VIOLET distressedOh , Della ! How can you ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Well , I 'm merely reminding you of where you might have been if I had n't put my shoulder to the wheel and set to work to do something , and to get somewhere . Ten years at hard labor , that was the sentence I imposed on myself ; and now I ask you to look about you and say if I ca n't show results ! How about Ma ? Have n't I made her over into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth shut ?  --  Have n't I made a match for myself that a thousand American girls with family trees and five times our money would sell their souls for ? Now have n't I ? VIOLET admiring perforceYou have done handsomely , Dell . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH And I have n't left one single stone unturned to do as well for you ! What could you ask for better than Anthony Rawson ? My land , girl , if you think all this has been child 's play , you 're mistaken  --  very much mistaken ! And who have I done it for ? Myself ? VIOLET simplyDella , I do honestly feel grateful to you , even when I do n't seem to show it . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH indulgentlyThere , there ! Say nothing more about it . And now I hope that affair is settled once and for all  --  Eh ?  --  PauseWell ? p. 38 VIOLET There 's something else .  --  Something a great deal more important . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH crisplyI thought so !  --  Now , we 're getting at it !  --  With dry emphasisYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  how could you guess ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH I 'm a crystal-gazer , dear . VIOLET simplyI do n't know whether I ever really loved him . I used to think I did  --  at least enough  --  but now  --  Oh , I ca n't bear to have him come near me ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH curtlyIn other words , he 's not what you took him for ! VIOLET timidlyVery likely , I 'm wrong about it . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH matter-of-factNo , you 're right about it ! VIOLET crushedOh , it 's too dreadful ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with positive , clear pronouncementNo it 's not !  --  You 've simply found out the truth ; and it 's bound to be hard  --  for a week or two ! He is n't what you thought him . Not one man in a dozen is what a nice woman would like to think him . He 's selfish , he 's greedy , he 's egotistical ; and the more he fiddle-diddles about the beauty and sacredness of love , the more you 'd better look out for him ! p. 39 VIOLET with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with buoyant convictionOh , I decided quite a long time ago  --  just as you are going to decide  --  that there 's something  --  very  --  well  --  worth  --  living for  --  after all ! Measuring each word VIOLET Yes ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH To strike  --  the best bargain  --  with the world  --  you can ! Now listen to me while I tell you something . Do you remember Pete Swallow , of Missionary Loop ? Yes , she actually pronounces it : Swallah VIOLET Was he the man who used to show me the pictures of tombstones with urns and weeping willows on top ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH I was engaged to Pete . Without the slightest hesitation or sentiment , even with a perception of the humor of the storyI thought I loved him  --  loved him in the approved , turtle-dove way  --  your way . Well , Pete Swallow taught me a whole lot of things . He was a good teacher , and when I 'd studied under him long enough , I decided I could strike a better bargain elsewhere .  --  I did ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't misunderstand me ! I know Algernon 's stupid ; I know he 's petty and narrowminded and egotistical ; but he 's exactly the kind of a husband I happen to want , so I 'm satisfied ! Now here 's your bargain  --  not a mark-down , department-store affair , either . But a Prize ! A blue-ribboner ! And it 's your business to take it and to keep a hold of it . VIOLET on verge of collapseOh , Della , I ca n't . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH " Ca n't " : must ! SofteningWhat you need , my dear , is just a little scrap o ' common sense ! You 're asking for better bread than wheat makes ; and you wo n't get it in this world . You want the moon to be always full ; you want , " Hertz und Schmertz " all the time . Well , that 's not real life ! That 's story-books . RisingTurtle doves never get anywhere . They always roost on the ridge-pole . That do n't suit me ; and it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that ! So put these silly notions out of your little head , like the sensible girl you are , and play up ! That 's the word for the woman who intends to make a success of life . Play up ! Life 's not such a bad game after all !  --  Now look at me , and tell me you 're going to do the right thing . p. 41 VIOLET faintly and without convictionI 'll try . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Good ! That 's the way I like to hear you speak ! Now I must run upstairs and dash off a line for tomorrow 's boat ; and when I come down , I shall expect to find you out in the garden , with the others , playing up !  --  Ta-ta ! Exit VIOLET remains seated in pensive silence GEOFFREY entering from porch and not perceiving her the first instantOh , I did n't know you were in here . He is going out again as if preferring not to talk with her , then haltsGreat Scott ! You look awfully down . Is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? VIOLET Everything . GEOFFREY sittingSame here ! VIOLET inquiringlyYes ? SympatheticallyOh , I 'm sorry ! GEOFFREY You know , I 've about decided I 'm kind  --  of a sort  --  of a misfit. p. 42 VIOLET I know I 'm one . GEOFFREY I 'm thinking about making a move . VIOLET Oh , are you ?  --  So  --  so am I. GEOFFREY I think it would be a lot better for everybody concerned if I cut out and hit the trail for New Mexico . VIOLET with involuntary eagernessIt must be lovely on a ranch ! GEOFFREY with enthusiasmYou'r right !  --  it 's great ! It 's so blamed real !  --  Checking himselfNot that that means anything to you ! VIOLET with involuntary exclamationOh , but it does !  --  more than you think ! A silence which becomes dangerously full of meaning . Finally as if rousing herself from enthrallment VIOLET tries to resume casual blithe mannerDo n't  --  do n't you think it would be nice outside  --  with the others ? GEOFFREY adopting her mood , with an effortCorking ! Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ANTHONY ANTHONY with veiled innuendoOh , you were just going ? p. 43 VIOLET with cordial mannerYes , out to the pergola.  --  Good-morning , Mr. Leavitt ! LEAVITT Good-morning !  --  Hello , Jeff ! GEOFFREY Hello ! VIOLET Wo n't you come along , too ? ANTHONY Mr. Leavitt and I were just discussing a little business matter . VIOLET to GEOFFREYCome on then , we 're dismissed ! Laughing rather nervously , she exits with GEOFFREY ANTHONY goes up to porch and watches GEOFFREY and VIOLET as they disappear LEAVITT puzzled and a little irritatedWell , it may not interest you , Anthony ; but there 's the story ! Take it for what it 's worth . ANTHONY I could n't believe a word of it . It is preposterous , absurd , utterly impossible . Returns to LEAVITT and they sit LEAVITT I agree with you . A mere coincidence , of course ; yet certainly a strange one . ANTHONY He was sure the name was de Salle ? LEAVITT Yes , quite positive . It was when my wife mentioned to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , that this Swallow spoke up so suddenly : " De Salle , de Salle  --  look here , where does this de Salle come from ? Washington , D. C. ? " I said I believed the de Salles had once lived there . NINA has entered Left , with a large vase of flowers ; but when she observes the men in confidential talk , she sets the vase on the piano and busies herself arranging the flowers , while eaves-dropping p. 44 ANTHONY thoughtfullyI see  --  and then he went on to tell you about this Sayles family ? LEAVITT No  --  not right away . Not until we were alone . Then he began talking about this Della Sayles to whom he had been engaged . It was after the death of the father  --  the patent medicine man  --  that the family moved away , and beyond the one fact that they went to Washington under the name of de Salle , he was perfectly ignorant . ANTHONY He did not know the younger sister 's name ? LEAVITT searching his memoryHe said they always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure I have heard it . SternlyOh ! But it is incredible ! It can not be true ! LEAVITT Of course ! But as a friend I thought it my duty to tell you . ANTHONY absentlyThank you ! Thank you ! I suspect we owe it to ourselves  --  and to the de Salles  --  to investigate this story . LEAVITT You will go to Mrs. de Salle ? ANTHONY thoughtfullyNo  --  that would be unpleasant ,  --  unpleasant in either event . p. 45 LEAVITT What is your plan ? ANTHONY A simple one : bring Swallow here . LEAVITT Here ! ANTHONY Confront him with the de Salles . LEAVITT But how would you explain things ? ANTHONY Leave that to me . Mrs. Leavitt does not know of this ? LEAVITT Not a word . ANTHONY Good . I will manage it so that no suspicions will be aroused . Yes , that 's it . Bring Swallow over here to lunch . LEAVITT At one ? But he goes by the 1 : 17 . ANTHONY So much the better  --  we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will tell the story . NINA withdrawsBut do not misunderstand me , Leavitt  --  Rather sternlyI entertain no suspicions whatever . They go upI simply feel that in view of what you have told me  --  we owe it  --  to our guests  --  to put the story to the proof . LEAVITT with guarded agreementI see . ANTHONY Thank you for coming to me in this way . I appreciate it . p. 46 LEAVITT I knew you would understand my motive . At doorWell I will have your man for you . Goodbye ! ANTHONY Au revoir ! and thank you again ! LEAVITT exits . ANTHONY stands an instant in the doorway , thinking with rather a crafty expression . NINA enters Left , with another vase of flowersWhat 's your hurry , my dear ? NINA halting coquettishlyI 'm fixing the flowers , Mr. Anthony  --  Are n't they pretty ? ANTHONY coming closeYes , but not half so pretty as the face behind them . NINA turning archly awayOh , Mr. Anthony , you 're kidding again . ANTHONY Why so coy ? You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catches her and kisses her NINA squealing softlyOw ! ANTHONY releasing her . Do n't you know it 's very wrong to make a row when a gentleman pays you a compliment ? You should always keep as quiet as a mouse . Now , once more ! NINA feigning to protect herself with vase of flowersNo , sir ! p. 47 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH upstairsVery well , mamma ! I 'll not forget ! NINA startled but concealing her fear of having been discovered by a very professional mannerYes , they are pretty , are n't they ? Miss Rawson picked them herself this morning , and she has such elegant taste in flowers . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH entering . SweetlyNina , has the post come ? NINA No madam , not yet ! ANTHONY has turned in some confusion . NINA goes Right BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH to NINAOh , thank you  --  Exit NINAI do not wonder you stop to admire the gladiolus , Anthony . She is all smiles and unsuspicionAnd Nina does so well with them ! ANTHONY Does n't she ! But I came to see if you were not ready to join us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skimmed the London cables . Home politics are in such a mess . The poor dear Lords seem to be hanging by a hair ! ANTHONY escapingWell , do n't let their tribulations keep you indoors too long . Exit p. 48 As ANTHONY disappears from view , ADELAIDE strides peremptorily to door Right , and calls in a low crisp metallic voice BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Nina ! NINA re-entering nervouslyYes , madam ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH incisivelyDo n't lie  --  it 's no use ! He kissed you . NINA confoundedOh  --  ma'am ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH How often has he done it ? NINA Oh  --  ma'am ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH That 's all  --  thank you so much  --  Turning away and sitting , as if intent on a newspaper NINA blubberingOh , ma'am ! And that is all she can say BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH indulgently  --  after a long pauseWhy should I wish you to be discharged ? You 've done nothing wrong , at least , not that I know of . NINA vehementlyOh , no , ma'am ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH And if a fascinating gentleman insists upon kissing a pretty little housemaid now and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you ? p. 49 NINA Indeed , madam , it would be very hard to say . A long pause BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH finding banknote in her bagNow , there 's something for telling the truth . No one who tells the truth need be afraid of me . Pause while she seems to read paperAfter this , I may count upon you to run straight to me with any little thing you believe I ought to know . PausePerhaps there is some little thing I ought to know now ? NINA with hesitating eagernessOh , ma'am , I think  --  perhaps you ought to know about a little thing that happened here a few minutes ago . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH kindlyThat is for you to decide , Nina . Nothing could be further from me than a desire to pry into matters that do not concern me . NINA In a way , ma'am , it does concern you . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH definitelyThen it 's quite right I should know all about it ! NINA looking about shylyMr . Leavitt was here , ma'am  --  BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH encouraginglyYes ? p. 50 NINA  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a Mr. Swallow . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH concealing her consternation by a terrible fit of coughingSwallow ? Swallow ! ! Dear me , what an odd name !  --  But how could that possibly concern me , Nina ? NINA confidentiallyThere ! I was sure it could n't . And so was Mr. Anthony ! At least , first he was ; and then he was n't ; and then he was again ; and anyway so as to make sure he told Mr. Leavitt to bring Mr. Swallow to luncheon to-day . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH after another fit of coughing , perfectly self-possessed , very graciousOh , yes , I see ! How very thoughtful of him ! MRS . DE SALLE entering by stairsAdelaide , has n't the mail come yet ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH The post , mamma ? No , not yet . MRS . DE SALLE Oh , I do hope there 's word from Marie about my hats . Going Right , she espies VIOLET who has just entered on porch and goes out to her BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with a dismissing gesture to NINAYou have shown a very commendable spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pleasureOh , I 'm sure , madam , It 's a very great privilege .

They come down anxious , apprehensive BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH You 'll find out soon enough . There 's a great big double-barrelled shock coming . Are you ready ? MRS . DE SALLE Oh , Della , do n't frighten me so ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Sit down !  --  Violet ! you sit there ! There is a long pregnant pause . MRS . DE SALLE almost crouches with fear . ADELAIDE 'S eyes glitter . She crosses her arms like a general and gazes directly out toward the audience unafraid , resolute , and announcesPete Swallow is comin ' here to lunch ! MRS . DE SALLE gulping with terrorPete ! Oh , my God ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Get a grip on yourself , ma , and listen ! Pete 's over to the Leavitts ' for some reason or other , and he 's told Leavitt about Missionary Loop ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the proof . p. 52 MRS . DE SALLE Della , we 're lost .

All right !  --  But how about you ! You was engaged to Pete ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with smiling , metallic self-assuranceYes . Ten years ago ! Do you think I have n't changed since then ?

Watch me ! if I ca n't knock him galley-west with my lorgnette and my English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SALLE Oh , Della , what courage !

Now , trot along ! MRS . DE SALLE turning before exitI do n't see why it need to be for all day . Could n't it pass off after a while ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Yes , of course  --  tell her that . Tell her you never know , but sometimes they do pass off ; and when the creature goes , I 'll get word to you and have you let out ! That is  --  if we win ! MRS . DE SALLE hands desperately claspedGod help us ! Exits BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH collecting her various belongings , with a hard undaunted smile " God help us ! " indeed ! Breaks into buoyant laughterWell , why not ? We help ourselves ! Is going by stairs@@ SCENE .  --  Same as ACT I. One hour later . MISS RAWSON is standing just outside porch door , scrutinizing the luncheon table , which is supposed to stand on porch off Right , and speaking to KITSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that will do very well . KITSON appearingThank you , madam . MISS RAWSON There will be only eight of us after all . KITSON Only eight , madam ? MISS RAWSON Mrs. de Salle will not be down . KITSON Very good , madam . MISS RAWSON to herself , with sympathetic recollectionDear me , how very ill she seemed ! Sits with impatient airYou spoke to Mr. Geoffrey ? KITSON Yes , madam , I told him you desired to see him . GEOFFREY entering from porch , brisklyYou wanted me , Aunt Abigail ? MISS RAWSON Yes ! Decidedly ! I hear that you are not expecting to favor us with your presence at lunch ! p. 59 GEOFFREY at a loss for an explanationI  --  why  --  Kicking the rug with his toeWhat 's the use ? You know that 's not my style of thing . MISS RAWSON with severityDo n't urge that as an excuse . It 's high time you adopted the style . Your absence would be a slight to the Leavitts as well as to Anthony and the de Salles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything , Aunt Abigail ! We do n't go in much for piddy-widdy in New Mexico . MISS RAWSON We will put all that aside . RisingI insist that you be present whether you like it or not ! All the more because of your ill-timed outbreak this morning . Scrutinizing him with disapprovalMake yourself presentable ! With a gesture she refuses to listen to himAnd do not oblige me to send for you when the time comes . Exit with stateliness into study As GEOFFREY starts to leave the room VIOLET enters from stairs VIOLET quivering with anxietyGeoffrey ! Geoffrey ! Can I speak to you ? p. 60 GEOFFREY startledWhy , of course ! VIOLET hurrying to him I 've something  --  terribly important  --  to ask you ! GEOFFREY Me ! VIOLET Yes . There is n't anybody else . GEOFFREY fraternallyWhy , Violet , what is it ? VIOLET I  --  I  --  Losing her courageOh , I do n't know that I 'd better , after all . GEOFFREY encouraginglyAre you afraid of me ? VIOLET shylyWell  --  listen ! And she takes the plunge excitedlySuppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , without really knowing how mean and wrong it was , and suppose finally some  --  er  --  something made her see it all in a different way . Do n't you think  --  With an incoherent outburstOh , Geoffrey ,  --  sometimes it 's just awfully hard to know what 's right , is n't it ? I do n't know what to do , because it is n't just myself , you see . And oh , if I do what I think I ought to , it 'll make everybody so unhappy ! Pathetic in her helplessness p. 61 GEOFFREY earnestlyBut you really think you ought to do it ? VIOLET gaining confidenceI do ! I really do ! Yes , my mind 's made up . I 'm going to tell the truth , even if I have to hate myself forever and ever . It 'll be better than this , anyway . Oh , please tell me I have the courage ! GEOFFREY taking her hands firmlyIf it 's something you really ought to do , I know you have the courage ! VIOLET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairsPerhaps , when I 've done this thing , you 'll never speak to me again . GEOFFREY Ca n't I help you , Violet ? VIOLET from the stairsYou have helped me ! When the time comes , I know I can do it . Exits , GEOFFREY looks after her an instant with frank adoration , then turns as ANTHONY enters from porch ANTHONY with an innuendoOh , you 're here ! I was looking for you . GEOFFREY matter-of-factWell , that 's unusual business . p. 62 ANTHONY Failing to find you at the pig-pen , I tried several less likely spots :  --  the kennels , the cabbage patch , and so on ,  --  this last of all . GEOFFREY Well , what can I do for you ? ANTHONY with irritationYou can listen to me for about one minute . You 're paying decidedly too much attention to Violet , and I do n't like it . She may , for all I know ; but that 's not the point . GEOFFREY quietlyThe point is  --  ? ANTHONY brutally directThe point is : she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands off ! GEOFFREY with self-controlWhat do you imply by that ? ANTHONY cuttinglyDo you wish me to specify ? GEOFFREY facing him directlyYes , specify ! ANTHONY with a look at the stairsI 'll specify some other time . It 's enough just now for you to understand me ! GEOFFREY Understand you ! ANTHONY Yes , I say : understand me ! Very clearly and bitingly , to GEOFFREY who is now at the doorDo you  --  understand me ? p. 63 GEOFFREY giving him a look of unspeakable contemptOh , yes  --  yes  --  I understand you ! Exit to study ANTHONY is unpleasantly startled ; but recovers himself , with a shrug of cynical amusement , and after an instant 's delay , touches bell for servant NINA entering promptlyOh , you rang , Mr. Anthony ? ANTHONY with a cautioning gestureCome here ! NINA comes , a little backwardlyDo n't be afraid . I 'm not going to eat you . NINA I know  --  but  --  ANTHONY reassuringlyThat 's all right . One scare a day is enough for my nerves , too . Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect anything ? NINA outrageously reassuringOh , no , Mr. Anthony , not a thing ! ANTHONY a little insistent , a little wheedlingNot a thing ? Are you sure ? NINA eyes innocently wideOh , sure ! Enter KITSON from Right , crosses Left , with a tray . He passes the two without seeming to observe p. 64 ANTHONY Did n't she speak to you ? NINA Yes , Mr. Anthony , but not about that . ANTHONY Good ! Coming closerNina , you 're a very clever little girl , and  --  At this moment he becomes aware of KITSON 'S presence and immediately alters his tone and manner to one of severest censure  --  and I hope that I shall not have to speak to you again about it . I do not want any such thing to happen again ! By this time KITSON has gone out , Left , and ANTHONY now tweaks her ear laughinglyYou little imp , you , what makes you so irresistible , anyway ! NINA archlyOh , I 'm sure , Mr. Anthony ! ANTHONY Listen , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is tempted to kiss her , but an impulse of caution holds himWe must find a place some time where there 's not so much coming and going  --  eh ? Chucks her chin and exits NINA has just turned to go when KITSON re-enters Left with silver coffee service KITSON not putting down his burdenWell , I see you 're at it again ! p. 65 NINA with an indifferent shrugHumph ! KITSON sagaciouslySmear your-self with honey ; you 'll hear the flies buzz . NINA attempting vainly to pass him Oh !  --  what talk ! KITSON You 're a proud little baggage , ai n't ye ! You 're a-going to have your fun , ai n't ye ! It would n't mean nothing to you , I suppose , would it , if I was to tell you  --  halting himself , with a significant shake of the head  --  what I could tell you , an ' I would , about Mr. Anthony ! NINA What could you tell me : I got to know that first . KITSON Tell ye ? Hst ! Very darklyDid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his toneNo , I never heard about poor Mamie Tanner . What about her ? KITSON with melodramatic impressivenessWhat about her ?  --  Well , that 's something I do n't intend to tell to a living soul , young lady , so long as I 'm in Mr. Rawson 's service . Go down on your two knees to me if you like . My lips are sealed . You 'll get nothing . p. 66 NINA Pooh ! I ca n't see why you should be so terrible close about it . KITSON Ye ca n't , eh ? NINA her curiosity at last arousedGo on ! Tell ! KITSON drawing himself upThere is such a thing as family , young lady ; though you may not happen to have heard of it . I 've been five and twenty years in the service of Mr. Rawson . And he looks it NINA Do you mean to tell me even Mr. Rawson do n't know ? KITSON sepulchrallyIf Mr. Rawson was once to find out  --  Oh !  --  Oh ! But as I 've many a time said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  Let ' em bring on their king 's horses . Let ' em bring on their king 's men . They 'll not pry a word out o ' me . NINA taking a new tackOh , pshaw ! You 're just putting on airs to scare me . KITSON superior to all temptationVery well . Very well . Have it just as you like . But you ca n't say I have n't done my duty by you . Now go and fix up the sandwiches !  --  And , remember , you 're warned . Exits to porch NINA goes out Left , with a piqued expression as MISS RAWSON is seen on the porch . She stops a moment to scrutinize the luncheon table p. 67 MISS RAWSON Yes , that is very good .  --  Have Nina put some flowers there  --  indicating  --  a vase of cosmos , I should think  --  or single asters . MRS . LEAVITT who is seen to join her outside on the porch and now enters the room in her companyMy dear Miss Rawson , really ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrageous that Stephen should have insisted on bringing him over  --  I did my best  --  A group consisting of LEAVITT , ANTHONY and SWALLOW now appears on the porch . PETER SWALLOW , the central figure , conspicuous for the pseudo-Broadway cut of his clothes , faces towards the view , and to judge by his oratorical gestures is ceaselessly talking MISS RAWSON consolingly to MRS . LEAVITTThere , there ! Not another word , my dear ! Anthony has explained everything . He was sure we would find him entertaining . MRS . LEAVITT At all events , the agony will soon be over . He takes the one-seventeen . MISS RAWSON But I ordered lunch for one o'clock . MRS . LEAVITT Good ! Do n't sit down till he 's gone . KITSON is taking SWALLOW 'S hat and stick p. 68 JUSTIN entering from studyMrs . Leavitt ! How do you do ! Shaking handsThis time you are going to see our English Violet . MRS . LEAVITT I can hardly wait . Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh has simply taken me by storm . Oh , how happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAWSON Our guests have arrived , you see , Justin . Indicating the porch MRS . LEAVITT pointing to SWALLOW with comic desperationThat centerpiece  --  that monument-like affair  --  that 's  --  that 's  --  Oh , Miss Rawson , do take me somewhere ! MISS RAWSON laughingly takes her under her wing and the two are about to exit , Right , when SWALLOW turning , perceives MISS RAWSON , and intercepts with exuberant cordiality . PETER SWALLOW is a joint product of the unsophisticated Middle West and sophisticated East . The heartiness and simplicity of his behavior combine strangely with his egregious selfesteem and his uncontrollable pleasure in hearing himself talk . He thinks his clothes quite the last word in the matter of style ,  --  and so indeed they are SWALLOW beaming upon MISS RAWSONAnd this , if I be not mistaken , is the old Auntie ! Your years rest lightly upon you , madam  --  as lightly as the snow upon a new-made grave ! p. 69 MISS RAWSON You flatter me !  --  Come , Lottie ! The ladies escape SWALLOW standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordsNice old lady !  --  As I was sayin ' , gentlemen , a callin ' like mine gives a man a very pretty eye for landscapey effects . Take a nice artistic tombstun now  --  say one of these monuments o ' the Cleopatry 's Needle type :  --  she got to be placed in a certain particular way to give the very handsomest impression . You ca n't set ' er in a hole in the ground , it 's like she was a-hollerin ' out for some commandin ' eminence  --  Pauses and wheels round toward ocean view , while his hand seems to be picking out a suitable site LEAVITT ready to introduce himExcuse me , Mr. Swallow , but I should like  --  SWALLOW utterly ignoring the other 's effortThere ! Say like that'ere sandhill , over yonder ,  --  supposin ' all this country to be one mighty cemetery , with the eternal sea , Old Ocean , with his thunders , beyond !  --  that 's the site for your needle !  --  An ' put some simple , elegant mottah on her base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  You catch the eye at once ; and similarly you create a dignified , noble and solemn effect ,  --  in short , a 9-inch effect ! p. 70 LEAVITT more insistentlyMr . Swallow , I want to make you  --  SWALLOW quite obliviousOr take the two words , I sleep  --  that 's an especially chaste , very modern sentiment that 's goin ' the rounds in certain sections where we do business . But , on the other hand  --  LEAVITT desperatelyExcuse me , Mr. Swallow , but I want you to meet Mr. Rawson . JUSTIN shaking hands with SWALLOWHow do you do , sir ! SWALLOW setting by his cigar , with a lingering look of regret and fully entering the apartmentIt 's a privilege , sir , to shake hands with so notorious and honorable a bulwark of American finance ! Your name , sir , is a synonym for a sound and conservative commercial policy , not only in Hoboken , where we have the honor of doing the largest monument business in the State of New Jersey , but equally throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the population-center of this great land of ours . To be known and favorably known , in Indiana , is therefore equivalent to being known everywhere !  --  JUSTIN Indeed ! ANTHONY with amusementThere 's logic for you ! p. 71 SWALLOW " Hark to the voice of Indiana , " whisper the Sister States . " It is the voice of the people ; and the voice of the people  --  Vox populi , Vox Dei  --  is the voice of God . " JUSTIN with veiled ironyYou overwhelm me , sir ! SWALLOW Thank you ; thank you , sir . You honor me too much in saying so . Yet yours , Sir , is in all truth an enviable lot . Fame , wealth , position , honors  --  all are yours ! From a pinnacle of self-satisfied serenity you may look down upon the puny struggles of your fellow men . This beautiful and luxurious villa , sir , is in itself , an emblem and monument to your success . This handsome young financeer , your son , is , as I well see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANTHONY to LEAVITTThere you have me . SWALLOW Nor need I ask whether the stalwart fellow I met yonder on the garden walk is also a scion of the House of Rawson :  --  No ! for I saw the father in the son 's eyes ! ANTHONY to LEAVITTGood for Geoffrey ! SWALLOW Congratulations , sir , upon the two of them :  --  a brace of Romans ! Again shakes hands vehemently p. 72 JUSTIN Thank you . SWALLOW to ANTHONYI make bold to postulate that your brother is your companion and rival in mounting the high ladder of plutocratic attainment . ANTHONY Geoffrey 's interests are along quite different lines . Lately he has taken up farming . SWALLOW delighted to find a new theme for his eloquenceA farmer ! Well , God prosper the farmer , say I , and say it with all my heart and soul . Why , Agriculture , sir , is the very bone and sinew of this great Commonwealth of ours . " Stay by the farm , young man " is my counsel to the restless , citybedazzled youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I have known it to the innermost , worm-infested core  --  ANTHONY How interesting ! SWALLOW And it ai n't what it 's cracked up to be , my young friend ; no sir , not by a long sight ! Temptations spawn and fester in them busy marts of traffic :  --  ANTHONY Quite true . SWALLOW Vice stalks abroad , attired in the spangled witcheries of Delilah.  --  ANTHONY Yes , yes . SWALLOW infatuated with his own volubilityBut in the country , far from the maddening crowd  --  ah , there one may breathe God 's own pure air , drink water , water , from the old oaken bucket that hangs in the well , and , in short , live as they was intended to live , by an all-wise , all-powerful Creator ! Stops , quite out of breath p. 73 JUSTIN I am surprised , sir , you did not take up oratory as a vocation . SWALLOW Oratory ! Ha ! say , we 're all like that in Indiana . We imbibe it with our mother 's milk . The state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south ; and from Orient east to sunset west . It was this little oratorical gift of mine  --  my silver tongue , as friends are wont to speak of it  --  that first pointed the way to my success in the tombstone business . JUSTIN Indeed ! SWALLOW My Indiana birthright it is that 's landed me where I am ; and I 'm grateful , and deeply grateful , to the Mother State that brought me forth . JUSTIN You ought to be . SWALLOW remembering his errandBut say  --  where are the petticoats ? ANTHONY coollyMrs . Bumpstead-Leigh and Miss de Salle will be down directly . Turns to LEAVITT SWALLOW to JUSTINAnd the old girl ? JUSTIN chillinglyMrs. de Salle is ill . I fear you will not have the chance to see her . SWALLOW to JUSTINLook a-here . She did n't know I was a-comin ' , did she ? p. 74 JUSTIN By some oversight , I neglected to inform her . SWALLOW That 's very cleverly said , sir ; but I mean it quite contrariwise , and no offense taken or given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winkMr . Swallow tells me he has the greatest curiosity to meet Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh , never having talked to a lady bearing a hyphenated name . SWALLOW True it is , though I might add that I recently had the privilege of fillin ' a order for a hyphenated tombstun ,  --  four names , in all  --  thirty-six letters , includin ' the hyphen , which counts exactly like a letter ; and all to go on one line . ANTHONY One line ! Amused LEAVITT Quite a problem ! SWALLOW Not for me ! I recommended one o ' these here broad stuns  --  broad and low . ANTHONY Oh , yes ! SWALLOW A block o ' pink Rhode Island granite , polished so you could count your teeth in it , and on top , a sort of sofa-pilluh in white marble , with a very chaste fringe and tassuls at the corners . The whole effect was stylish , and up-to-date ,  --  p. 75 ANTHONY It sounds so ! SWALLOW And the name , " Gwendolyn Frederika Threadingwell , hyphen , Smith " showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customary " In Memory of " above it . JUSTIN I can easily understand that . SWALLOW I may declare without boastin ' that our company pays more attention to the artistic features of its mortuary memorials than any other throughout the length and breadth of this country ; and in case any of you in this house should ever be under the sad necessity  --  as Mr. Leavitt here is at the present moment  --  of considerin ' a suitable monument , even so modest a monument as a slab of granite so gray  --  as the hymn well says , gray being the cheapest variety  --  I take pleasure in leavin ' a few o ' my professional cards . Is about to hand one to LEAVITT but recollects himself Oh , you 've got one ! Passes cards to ANTHONY and JUSTINAll inquiries receive the promptest attention . Our representatives are pleased to make calls even when there is no immediate prospect of doin ' any business  --  just to size up the field , as you might say . JUSTIN That 's certainly enterprise . SWALLOW Enterprise ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . You never know when a good thing may drop your way . Suddenly recalling his errandBut , say Leavitt  --  what time does my train go ? Consulting watch p. 76 LEAVITT One-seventeen , Mr. Swallow . SWALLOW Ahem ! Say it do n't look like I was goin ' to have time to eat with the folks , does it ? JUSTIN But I think there 's a dining car on the train , Mr. Swallow . SWALLOW Diner ? Cough up a dollar for fancy victuals that ai n't worth thirty cents ? Not for Swallow ! JUSTIN curtlyI will have Kitson bring you a bite . SWALLOW beamingThat will suit me to a T , thank you very kindly  --  if it would n't be much bother . JUSTIN impatientlyOh , no , no ! Not at all . Exits to porch SWALLOW perfectly at ease as he seats himself with crossed legs and relights his cigarTalk about your Easterners bein ' stiff ! I never could see it . Wherever I go throughout the length and breadth of this great country of ours , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look for what you expect and that 's what you 'll see .

To ANTHONYSay ca n't you hurry up your bunch of English swells ? I came here to look ' em over , and I do n't intend to get left . p. 77 ANTHONY Do n't worry . There 's plenty of time yet . SWALLOW with patronizing heartinessSo you reckoned you was going to marry a dee Salle , did you , young man ? And he laughs at the comedy of it ANTHONY cautioninglyDo n't speak so loud ! SWALLOW nave as a schoolboyWhy , ai n't the rest going to get let in on the joke ? ANTHONY Not until I know for certain there is a joke . I must see with my own eyes . SWALLOW You 'll see fast enough ! Just wait till she finds out who 's here . If I ca n't knock her galley-west with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete Swallow . ANTHONY You certainly show no lack of confidence . SWALLOW Why should I ? I 'd like to know . You 've heard the whole story , yourself  --  do n't it fit ? Ai n't it a perfect dove-tail ? Do n't it make her out to be the prettiest , smartest bunch of lies that ever come down the pike ?  --  Oh , and it ai n't as if she was n't capable of it , neither , no , sir !  --  the little monkey  --  the pert little monkey ! Becomes lost in reminiscent dreams p. 78 ANTHONY You have n't told us how this Della Sayles looked . SWALLOW as in a trance of memoryAi n't I ? Fourteen hands high she was  --  just up to my shoulder . Neat , trim , handsome , with the smartest little foot and ankle a girl ever showed ; and a waist ,  --  well , sir it was a waist ; and when I say a waist , well  --  there 's nothing more to be said . " Della , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , as she was a-settin ' here , Indicating his lapof a late evenin ' in front o ' the old baseburner ,  --  " Della , you little puss , where 'd you ever get a waist like that ? Your ma ai n't got one . Your Dad 's a regular rhinoceros . But you  --  well , the wasp and the butterfly are your only rivals in the waist line , my dear . " And she 'd laugh , and laugh , and like as not box my ears in play , and so it would go , night after night !  --  Oh happy days ! Happy days ! Dreams with pensive smile ANTHONY But her features , you have n't spoken of them . What were they like ? SWALLOW still in his tranceA flower garden , sir , a flower garden . The rose vying with the lily  --  and her eyes  --  blue as forget-me-nots . ANTHONY half to himselfMrs . Bumpstead-Leigh has blue eyes . p. 79 SWALLOW Forget-me-nots ! Roused from tranceForget-me-nots ! Well , by gosh , she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go-by , and gave it good and hard . At first I was deeply embittered ; life was a howling wilderness of despair . Oh , but one gets over them things .  --  For a few weeks , young man , your loss will seem a big thing to you , very like ; but then you 'll begin to look about you again , and remember there 's other fish in the sea . It 's that thought lightens the tragedy . ANTHONY It 's not my case we 're discussing , if you please . SWALLOW Ahem ! A little wee bit sensitive , ai n't ye ! Well , I do n't blame ye , young feller . I was myself . I 'd wince . I 'd chew my lip . I 'd flare up against my best friend ! Oh , but if I had n't been love-blind , I might have known all along what was booked to happen . She was an odd kid  --  Della Sayles  --  restless , finicky , with more ideers in her head than does a woman any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen Burnhart , but once out in Indianapolis I ran up against that Guinea headliner , Dooze  --  Elinora Dooze : you heard of her , of course ? She was playing Adrienne Vancouver the night I saw her . Pooh ! Pooh ! You call that acting ? Why , my little Della could put the kibosh all over her , and never let on she was acting at all ! That was just the trouble , ye never could tell ! Enter KITSON with tray of eatables for SWALLOWWell , I reckon her game 's called on her this time . It 's her finish . As he now looks over the tray criticallyThanks.  --  Say , waiter , ai n't you got any English mustard in the house ? p. 80 KITSON Yes , sir . SWALLOW Well , bring me some mustard and a cup of coffee and some loaf sugar . KITSON much insultedAnything else , sir ?

BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH examining this stranger with a certain air of startled offenceI beg your pardon . Bewildered , to ANTHONYWhy , Anthony dear  --  what is this ? I had not been informed . ANTHONY wincing in spite of himself , but then , with steady incisivenessPermit me , Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh , to introduce Mr. Swallow  --  Mr. Peter Swallow , of Indiana . p. 81 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH distantlyPleased , I 'm sure . She turns to VIOLET as if considering the advisability of withdrawalViolet , dear , I fear we have come down too soon . SWALLOW Not at all , not at all , madam . I have only a few minutes to stay , and I was particularly anxious to get in a few words with you . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Words with me ? And again she seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and certainly somewhat offended ANTHONY anxious to account acceptably for the intruding presenceMr .

BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH still distantlyI see . Oh , charmed , I 'm sure . Turns ignoringly away , and joins LEAVITT on the other side of the room ANTHONY continuing the introductions watchfullyMiss de Salle ; Mr. Swallow . VIOLET cordially and with some manner I am so pleased to meet another of Mr. Rawson 's friends . But where are the rest , Anthony ?  --  Have they deserted you ? p. 82 SWALLOW No matter about the rest , Miss . It was you and your sister I wanted to see .  --  The rest can go ding ! VIOLET puzzledDear , dear ! Is that a compliment , Mr. Swallow ? SWALLOW Take it whatever way you like , young lady . I know what I mean by it , and that 's enough for now . VIOLET Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Adelaide about it ! Joins LEAVITT and ADELAIDE and converses SWALLOW returning to his meal , speaks apart to ANTHONY SWALLOW profoundly intriguedWell , I take the count ! ANTHONY rather brusquelyYou went wide of the mark . That 's clear ! SWALLOW stoutlyThe young one stumps me .

VIOLET It 's really too bad , Mr. Swallow , you ca n't stay to lunch . You would love it ! And then , too , we shall have seen so very little of each other before you must go ! SWALLOW Quite true , quite true , young lady . But it 's the same way all through this life of ours . We go and come like autumn leaves before the blast ; here to-day , to-morrow whither ? Perhaps  --  as my callin ' so frequently reminds me  --  perhaps under the sod. p. 84 VIOLET navelyAh , what a beautiful sentiment !

SWALLOW sittingI am said to be pretty slick at turning an epitaph , but along other lines I have deserted the Muse since the age of twenty-five years .  --  Yet , now that we are speakin ' of Po'try , Madam , my thoughts are carried backward to those more youthful days and to faces that were nigh in the long ago ; and I am strangely reminded by your countenance of one who was very dear to me when I was still , as the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame unknown . p. 85 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH sympathetic ,  --  with a wink of immense amusement at LEAVITTFancy ! I am sorry if I have awakened painful memories of one gone before ! SWALLOW " Gone before ! " That 's just what she ai n't  --  leastways not to my knowledge . The go-by is what she gave me . That was in Missionary Loop , Indiana , where I resided until my twenty-seventh year . Was you ever there , might I ask ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with a blank lookWashington was our home , Mr. Sparrow  --  SWALLOW Swallow , if you please , ma'am . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH utterly ignoring the correctionWashington was our home in the old days . I have traveled very little in this country ; but my present visit teaches me how much I have missed by not knowing it better . Is this Missionary Loo an interesting town ? I do not remember to have met the name in Baedecker . VIOLET with great interestI suppose Missionary Loo was one of your early settlers who carried the Gospel to the Indians . SWALLOW risingLoop , Miss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Loop .  --  Make a note of it ! p. 86 SWALLOW Sister 's got it . The town is chiefly famous , ladies , because it was the home of old Jim Sayles , proprietor of Sayles 's Sissapoola Indian Herb Remedies , which are known and used up and down the length and breadth of this country .  --  BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Indian Herb Remedies ! Fancy ! VIOLET How very romantic ! SWALLOW Well , I do n't know what mottah is graved on Old Jim 's headstone in Missionary Loop ; but I can tell you what it ought to ' a been :  --  H  --  O  --  A  --  X. BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH in doubtH  --  O  --  A  --  X  --  hoax ? Have I the word aright ?  --  Oh ! I begin to understand !  --  Violet , my dear , did you notice the very interesting Americanism Mr. Swallow has just given us  --  H  --  O  --  A  --  X  --  ? I have heard of it before ; a corruption I believe , of our English Hocus Pocus . So this Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not warranted by facts . Dear me ! How very dreadful ! SWALLOW Yes . Was n't it ! and here 's another for you , madam . Old Jim had two daughters . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Two daughters ! Fancy ! And did they have Indian names also ? p. 87 SWALLOW Well , the name of the oldest , ma'am was Della , and to me she plighted her troth . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH sympatheticallyAh , and it is she , then , who is the painful memory , Mr. Shallow ? SWALLOW balked for a moment by her new mis-nomenclature but too resolute to be diverted from the scentYes  --  and may I venture to ask you , madam , one question outright and flat-foot ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH immensely entertainedFlat-foot ?  --  Oh , why , certainly ! Flat-foot ! SWALLOW And you promise to answer it in the same way ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH You mean flat-feet ? SWALLOW I do . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH exchanging an amused look with LEAVITTVery well . I am at your disposition . SWALLOW with direct challengeWhat was your father 's business ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH blanklyBusiness  --  Business  --  Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business , lady ? p. 88 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Why , no !  --  not in the legitimate , accepted sense of the word . Oh , it would be quite improper to refer to papa 's activities as business ,  --  I mean , of course , except in a very special understanding of the term . SWALLOW Well , what was he then ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH filially tenderDear papa was a philanthropist . SWALLOW A what ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH His life was dedicated to Humanity . His name is blessed to-day in a thousand homes . I find it hard to speak to a stranger of poor dear papa : but you see you had my promise in advance . And the subject is evidently closed henceforth SWALLOW recovering himself with a great effort after this momentary knockoutWe was speaking , you remember , about this here Sayles family ; and I was about to remark that after the death of Old Jim , and the moving away of the family from Missionary Loop , it got noised about that they had changed their name to de Salle and was residing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , Madam . p. 89 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Dear me ! How very odd ! If such were the case , I am at a loss to understand why we should never have known of it ,  --  the name , as you see , being identical with ours . Violet , dear , did you ever hear of any other de Salles in Washington ? VIOLET Never . But probably these people Mr. Swallow tells of had no social standing . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Oh , of course ! I understand that perfectly . Yet I wonder the letters never went wrong .  --  Ah , but now a thought comes ! Did not the family of whom you speak , Mr. Wallow , spell the prefix with the Capital D ? SWALLOW baffledI du n no anything about that . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH giving instruction with authorityThe name de Salle is spelled in a number of ways , though our branch of the family has invariably employed the small D  --  comme en franais , n'est-ce pas ?  --  le petit signe de la noblesse !  --  But I remember even to have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she seems to search her memoryAnnales d'une famille ancienne de la Nourmandie , par Geoffroi  --  yes , par Geoffroi !  --  as a single word thus  --  Capital D , E , small S , A , double L , E ,  --  curious was n't it !  --  in which case it would afford an interesting analogy , would it not , with the Scotch MacDonald , which , as you of course know , is capable of at least three variants . p. 90 SWALLOW flabbergastedA three bagger ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH to LEAVITT , immensely amusedA what ?  --  Oh , how delicious ! SWALLOW recovering again , and supplying by loudness what he has lost in confidenceWell , as I said , the young lady to whom I was betrothed was named Della , and it seems to me that you are the exact and identical image of her ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH seeming slightly offendedIndeed , sir ! VIOLET merrilyI do believe Mr. Swallow is hinting , Adelaide , that you would be a welcome substitute ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH reprovinglyViolet , dear , you know how I dislike to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure Mr. Swallow could have no idea whatever of exceeding the bounds of the strictest propriety in my presence . SWALLOW with violent convictionNever again , Pete ! Never again ! Rising BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH as if startledNever again ? What does he mean ? Have I made some terrible faux pas ? Have I been gauche ? p. 91 SWALLOW Oh , that 's all right , madam . It ai n't often that Pete Swallow puts his foot into the wrong puddle . I will say that for myself ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with concern to LEAVITTOh , but I do n't understand . The poor fellow seems quite disordered . LEAVITT No cause for concern , dear Lady ! It 's likely nothing but indigestion . GEOFFREY entering hastily from porchExcuse me , Mr. Swallow , but it 's getting very near your train time . You 'll have to hurry ! LEAVITT to ADELAIDEPardon me ! He starts quickly for the porchI told my man to have the machine here in good season . Has he come yet ? GEOFFREY Yes , he 's at the gate .

KITSON helps him into automobile coat VIOLET rising quickly and starting to leave the room ; but she pauses for one eager tremulous word with GEOFFREYNobody 'll ever forgive me , but I 'm going to do it ! I 'm going to do it ! Exit , followed after an instant by GEOFFREY p. 92 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH But surely you are not going without a word of good-bye , Mr. Swallow ? SWALLOW coming to her for his valedictoryOne word , lady , and that 's all . Time and tide wait for no man ! and in the end Death cuts down all ! The moral is : get busy !

VIOLET without interestYou think so ? p. 101 KITSON No doubt it were very wrong of you to be deceiving everybody as you did , leading ' em to think you had blue blood in your veins when you have none ; still , and at the same time , had they but seen it as I do , they would have esteemed it a very rare privilege to have extended their hospitality to the offspring of Old Jim Sayles , the Sufferer 's Friend .  --  He comes to her , scrutinizes her countenance intently  --  And now I observe ye close to , Miss , I can trace the resemblance quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottles of the Elixir ?

You know I 'm not half good enough for you .  --  I 'm not  --  truly , truly , I 'm not ! GEOFFREY Oh , Violet ! What nonsense ! It 's me that 's not half good enough for you . VIOLET No , it 's not ! It 's me . GEOFFREY No , it 's me . VIOLET It is n't . Hush  --  listen dear , I was just going to say something quite important . GEOFFREY Well . VIOLET Oh , yes , well , this is what it was  --  do n't you think it 's a perfectly awful situation ,  --  in a way ? GEOFFREY No doubt about it at all . Wo n't the family raise  --  Hooray ? But say , will you come out to New Mexico ? p. 114 VIOLET The ranch ? I 'm dying to !  --  But oh , Della @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're free . That 's what you said . VIOLET Yes , Geoffrey and so I am . Only I do n't know whether Adelaide quite realizes it . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH entering by stairs with a flash of controlled indignationViolet , I understand that you wish to have me speak to you here , rather than in the privacy of our apartment . Well , so be it . VIOLET vividly , breathlesslyI thought you ought to know  --  that Geoffrey has asked me to marry him , and I have said " Yes " ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH staggeredWhat ! To GEOFFREYIs this the Truth ! GEOFFREY vigorouslyYou bet it 's the truth ! We 're going to be married just as soon as we can get the license . The two youngsters face her defiantly , expecting a terrific rejoinder ; but instead there is a gasping pause , and then ADELAIDE breaks out with a perfect gale of laughter , incapable of restraining herself . VIOLET and GEOFFREY are finally caught up into this spasm of hilarity , though perfectly bewildered p. 115 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Ha , ha , ha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha !  --  Why !  --  Oh , ho ! Sitting , still shaken with cosmic mirth VIOLET much perplexedAdelaide  --  What 's the matter ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH gradually becoming coherentOh , nothing , nothing  --  why , but my dear little sister ! Why ,  --  why  --  did you never breathe a word of this before ? VIOLET Because I only knew it three minutes ago . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with sudden misgivingIt 's absolutely settled . GEOFFREY Settled !  --  Well I should say Yes ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH coming between them with the gentle benignance of a fairy god-motherWhy , I 'm very , very glad ! How blind I must have been not to see earlier that you two were divinely meant for each other ! Both so direct , so true-hearted , so  --  so  --  I mean to say  --  so idealistic ! But does anyone know of this ? GEOFFREY No , you see  --  we  --  we sort of wanted to tell you first . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH My dear Geoffrey ! You have my very heartiest good wishes ! You take from me the dearest little sister in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell you what she has been to me in the past ; but I give her to you ,  --  And she joins their hands  --  knowing that you , and you only , can make her truly happy ! But  --  but I suppose the others must be told at once . p. 116 VIOLET with some reluctanceI suppose they must . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH My dear children , if you are willing to leave the responsibility in my hands . I shall be glad to explain to  --  Anthony . I think  --  yes , I think I can promise that he will change his attitude . GEOFFREY incredulousWell , I ca n't say it sounds very easy . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH I know it ; but in any event let me try . To VIOLETTrust me , dear . If I have errred in the past ,  --  and who has not erred , some time ?  --  it has not been through any lack of devotion to your welfare . Now that I see things in a clearer light , I want to do my best to rectify them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pal we 're looking for just now . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Well , you two go off for a little ramble together . Go and see the pigs . You wo n't object to that , surely , Violet ,  --  not if this affair is only five minutes old ! And she gently but firmly impels them toward the porch VIOLET goingCome on ! At doorBut how about the train ? p. 117 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Do n't worry . GEOFFREY Say , you know , I 'm beginning to believe in miracles . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Faith for you , brother .  --  Works for me . GEOFFREY and VIOLET exit . ADELAIDE turns to KITSON who enters LeftKitson , is there a newspaper reporter calling for me ? KITSON No , ma'am . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH I wired for one . Let me know when he arrives . KITSON Yes , ma'am , and if I might presume to speak a word , Madam ,  --  He hesitates to continue , waiting for a sign of encouragement from her ; but she is self-absorbed . After a silence he clears his throat and proceedsI thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , that for my part , I consider it a very rare privilege to have laid eyes on the Offspring of Old Jim Sayles , tho Sufferer 's Friend ! Again he waits for a responseAnd I may add , madam , that in my opinion you are the very image of your lamented Pa . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH boredThanks . KITSON And that is why I thought it might be what they call a little crumb of comfort to you if I was to remark that , for my part , I 've good reason to think it 's you gets the best of the deal , in the long run . p. 118 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH hardly interested , slightly irritatedI have n't the slightest idea what you mean by that , my good man , not the slightest . KITSON approaching her with mysterious confidential manner I suppose you think it 's a great prize you lost , when you lost Mr. Anthony . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with a beginning of interestYou mean to say you know something detrimental to Mr. Anthony ? KITSON If ever a whited sepulchre walked on two legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! KITSON I can not , madam . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH You must ! Quickly ! She rises KITSON These lips are sealed . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH advancing upon himKitson ! The daughter of Old Jim Sayles commands you to unseal them ! She takes the attitude of a prophetess KITSON retreating from her . Deeply shakenEh ! What 's that , madam ? p. 119 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Speak and speak quickly ! The weight and authority of a thousand bottles of Elixir are in her voice KITSON Er  --  er  --  er  --  BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Do not keep me waiting ! KITSON stuttering with aweHer name , madam , was Mamie Tanner  --  BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH noting the name to herselfMamie Tanner . KITSON And she lived over yonder , two miles from here , at a little place called Herring Grove . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Herring Cove . Yes ! yes !  --  she was in service here ? Be quick ! KITSON his mind beginning to go to pieces under her electrical dominationWell , no , not exactly as you might say in service , but every now and again , as the occasion might require , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewing or  --  At this instant ADELAIDE becomes aware of the approach of ANTHONY who is now visible on porch , and very suavely and graciously she observes BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Thank you , Kitson , for a most appetizing lunch . You know the art of tempting an indifferent palate . p. 120 KITSON perceiving , with consternation , the cause of her changed mannerEh , eh , that 's all right , madam , I 'm sure . Exits with tray ANTHONY loftilyMy aunt requests me to give you this time-table , fearing that you might not know the exact hour at which the train leaves . It leaves , you will observe , at 3:55 . He indicates the figure in the folder BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH charminglySo very kind of Miss Rawson to think of it ! Everything is provided for our comfort ! ANTHONY And if there is nothing else ,  --  I will return at once to the family . And he starts to do so BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH sweetlyJust one word ! I thought you might be interested to learn of Violet 's engagement to your brother . ANTHONY recoilingWhat ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe it ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH As you choose . ANTHONY furiouslyNo ! We are done with the whole pack of you ! Imposters ! Parvenues ! p. 121 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH smilinglyAnd the rest ! I dimly recall the list ! ANTHONY Ten times the list would fall short of the truth ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH blandlyI will multiply it by ten , mentally , and let it go at that ! ANTHONY Then you see how fortunate you are to get away with a whole skin . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH I thought you had skinned us quite effectually , just now . ANTHONY Well then  --  skin for skin ! Going BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH stops him with a glitterSo be it ! Wait ! One little moment ,  --  if you please ! ANTHONY impatientlyWhat else ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH sweetlyWell , suppose  --  just suppose I say  --  a purely hypothetical case  --  of course  --  but suppose I should happen to possess certain facts  --  oh , very slight , trivial facts , of course  --  ANTHONY loftilyAre you threatening me ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Oh , my dear young man , you go too fast ! p. 122 ANTHONY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  invites the microscope ? ANTHONY sternlyWhat do you mean by that ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH almost toyinglyThere are no flaws in the perfect crystal of your character ? Not even a flyspeck ? ANTHONY Insinuations !  --  Give us facts ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH crisplyWhat about Nina ? ANTHONY Nina ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH bluntlyYes , Nina ! Would you like it reported that this very morning , while the young lady to whom you were engaged was out of the house , you were hugging and kissing the house-maid ? ANTHONY I deny it  --  flatly ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH musinglyI see  --  even though Nina might corroborate me in every detail . ANTHONY Witness of a servant ! Oh , even in America servants may be bribed ! Completely self-possessedSo that is your artillery , Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh ! Well , I very much fear you will have to fire again ! p. 123 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Very well , since you invite the fire you shall have it . I was hoping it might not be necessary , because I do hate blood . ANTHONY halting  --  but attempting to seem confidentWhat is it ?

BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Oh , why carry this wretched story further ? With impassioned mannerIs there in all the world a more contemptible figure than that of the man who sits in the ancestral pew on the Sabbath Day , smug , pious as a Pharisee , and on Monday , when no one is looking , takes advantage of the ignorance and weakness of poor innocent young girls ! DenouncinglyYes , it is of you I am speaking , of you , the pride of your father , the apple of your Aunt Abigail 's eye  --  hypocrite ! Scoundrel ! Betrayer of poor Mamie Tanner ! Her emotions are now permitted to overcome her . She chokes and quivers p. 124 ANTHONY trying to hold his own , but scarcely able to speak for confusionMamie Tanner  --  she knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men !

BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH dropping into a chair , fanning herself with the time-tableMy goodness , if you 'd only said that five minutes ago , you 'd have saved me a lot of hard work ! On a hot day , too ! Well , the terms are very simple . Succinctly as a general naming terms of capitulationFirst , you will persuade your father and aunt to accept the present situation . Second , you will secure an urgent invitation for us to stay out our visit here . Third , you will have business in town that will take you off the field of operations by the afternoon express  --  She shows him the time-table with precise care  --  which , " you will observe " leaves at 3:55. p. 125 ANTHONY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am certain to fail . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH You fail ! You , the idol !  --  never ! Wag your head ,  --  that settles it ! ANTHONY You do not know them . They are adamant . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH There is the telephone . Suppose you ask them to come over . ANTHONY It 's outrageous . I shall do nothing of the sort ! But in spite of his words he goes to the telephoneThis is nothing less than blackmail ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH The happiness of one I love is at stake . ANTHONY at ' phoneMrs . Leavitt ? This is Anthony . Would you be so kind as to ask my father and Aunt Abigail to come over for a few minutes ? Yes , thank you very much . I 'll explain everything later . Hangs up receiver BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH to KITSON who has just entered from study with card trayFor me , Kitson ? KITSON For you , madam . Presenting cardThe gentleman from the newspaper . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Ah , yes , the Evening Chronicle .  --  Ask him to wait . Exit KITSON p. 126 ANTHONY What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't understand you . ANTHONY What do you mean by having a newspaper man in this house ? BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH My dear Anthony , you think too harshly of newspaper men . Some of them are perfectly respectable persons . ANTHONY You are planning something against us : that 's the long and short of it . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Dear Brother , you have nothing to fear so long as you do precisely what I direct . And now I think you 'd better go and meet your ancestors !  --  Prepare their minds as gently and tactfully as you can . And I shall be waiting here . Exit ANTHONY ADELAIDE is about to seat herself at table Right for writing when NINA enters Left NINA Madam ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Well , Nina ? NINA eagerly , mysteriouslyI could n't tell you very well while Mrs. de Salle was around upstairs . It 's something private . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH delaying her writing to listenSomething private , my girl ? p. 127 NINA Yes , madam , I thought perhaps it was something I 'd ought to tell you . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must ask you to make haste . NINA Thank you , madam . After the way you treated me this morning , I 'm certainly glad if I can return the favor .

NINA Not anything so very much in a way ; only I was pretty sure it would lead on to something , you know , if anybody could follow it up . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Yes , yes , I understand perfectly . Go on  --  go on  --  Nina ! NINA It was about Mr. Anthony ! BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Mr. Anthony  --  more about Mr. Anthony ?  --  and what about Mr. Anthony  --  this time ? NINA Well , Mr. Kitson was telling me there was this girl named Mamie Tanner , or something like that . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Mamie Tanner . Yes , to be sure , and what about Mamie Tanner ? NINA Well , that 's just it , ma'am . p. 128 BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Yes , yes . That 's just it . Tell me , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell any more . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH with sudden change of mannerYou mean to say that 's all you know ? NINA That 's all I could get out of Mr. Kitson .

BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH You mean to tell me then that all you know is there was a girl named Mamie Tanner ? NINA crestfallenYes , Madam . Oh , but I 'm quite positive it must have been something very  --  very  --  disreputable . BUMPSTEAD-LEIGH Disreputable ! Oh ! Her manner suddenly becomes tender and reproachfulMy good girl , if you think that under any circumstances whatever I could have the least wish to listen to scandal , you have made a very grave blunder indeed ! I make it a rule always to believe the best of everybody . NINA But I thought , ma'am , you kind of suggested to me this morning I was to tell you things . And after what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patienceIf I have been made to suffer unjustly , Nina , I try to bear it uncomplainingly , with patience and fortitude .

What , I ask , is the one great , superb , inspiring thing in your vaunted American idea ? Lincoln was born in a little poor log cabin . Would you , for that reason , have turned him from your doors ? Secretly punches ANTHONY into action ANTHONY Yes , yes  --  her argument is sound . It deserves attention .
