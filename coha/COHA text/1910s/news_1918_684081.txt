txt The British press condemns the munitions workers ' proposed strike against the plan of standardizing wages , which , it also- is announced , is to be established throughout the United States on the first of next month . In ordinary times it is no reproach that labor in any country seeks the highest wages to be obtained anywhere . In war times it is different with both labor and capital . Everybody denounces profiteering by capital , and all sorts of restrictions are imposed , with general approval . Taxes discriminate against excessive profits , and materials are rationed so that capital finds its activities restricted . There have been some protests that capital was being too hardly treated for the public interest , but there has been scant attention even to them . Now it is time to consider labor profiteering , which can be made plain by the British example . England has been generous in its treatment of labor . Wages in England have risen faster than the cost of living , and food has been cheapened by subsidizing its import and distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax money in reducing the price of bread alone . Now British labor demands more , not from employers but from the Government  --  that is , from the general citizenship . Also the demand is not made through patriotic trade unions , but through strikes with a distinct Bolshevist flavor . The cable reports that the syndicalists are active , thinking that their opportunity has arrived to nationalize industry under cover of the war . There is more of politics than of economics In that proposal . Re , , ardless of what May be thought of the proposal intrinsically , it is apparent that it is not pressed on its merits when it is brought forward during the country 's embarrassment by a foreign war , and to hinder the execution of a proposal adopted without thought of discrimination against labor , and with sole thought of the common welfare . The Government wishes to enforce the payment of a standard wage , reached by negotiation . For that purpose it has put what is called an embargo on labor . That is to say , labor is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had anywhere . Some trades had overbid others , and there has been alternately a surplus and a deficiency of laborers . The dispute has nothing to do with overworking or underpaying labor . The grievance alleged is that Government has no right to limit the employment of labor in any shop or trade , and has nothing to do with the payment of wages above the standard . The strikers complain that the proposal is about the same as industrial conscription , and against that all labor in international organizations is set in opposition . The situation is so serious that the Ministry on Sunday night issued a formal statement : The Ministry can not carry on the supply of munitions to the troops without the embargo in cases where its need has been shown and without reasonable power to distribute skilled labor according to vital war needs . The threatened strike , it had been pointed out , " was not an ordinary " trade dispute , but an attempt to " overthrow the policy of the State at a time of national danger . " Perhaps more strikers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Ea gland . In ten industrial centres In two States 31,000 workers on war work are idle . Perhaps the worst single strike in principle , if not in numbers involved , is in the electric Industry at Lynn , where the men stopped without the presentation of grievance : . Whatever the grievance , strike in that manner is not to be condoned . In the shoe trade a wa bonus of 20 per cent . was reporte yesterday to all but the strikers ; the is to say , . to about three times a many as struck . This inflamed con dition of labor exists before the en forcement of the plan that labor mus be recruited through the Govern ment , with certain exceptions , ama establishments being perhaps th chief . The interpretation of that i that labor shall not seek more that the standard wage , and that employ ers shall be restricted in paying mor than the standard . Thus labor is ex periencing what capital long ago dis covered  --  that the fixing of a pre scribed rate of payment amounts t1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same figures whether the enactment be in one fern or the other . Labor has long sought the estab lishment of a standard wage withou the fixing of a standard return fee the wage . Now labor makes a griev ance of the fact that it is held as e maximum to the standard which ii sought . The War Labor Policies Board announced yesterday that it h seeking to establish for the nation the same standards that have been sot it specific trades by labor bargains , but solely as a war measure . Trades wil not be allowed to compete with one another for workmen , and nonwal businesses will not be allowed to overbid employers on war work Wage bargains hereafter are to be tripartite , alike in England and the United States . No longer will labor bargain alternately with employers and with Government . Government takes both workers and employer into the original conference , and will enforce the agreement thus reached . The question recurs in this country as in England  --  will labor abide by its bargains ?      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
