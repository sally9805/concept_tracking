txt Acting Secretary ROOSEVELT is taking the sensible course of declining for the present to accept resignations ? of officers of the navy , hoping that Congress will revise upward the pay table , which was adopted in 1908 , when the cost of living was half what it is today . With the added money junior officers were able , to support their families without running into debt . But that was before the war . It should be obvious to cynical authorities on the army and navy pay schedule who think officers are well enough off because they receive certain commutations and allowances , and sometimes have the benefit of wholesale prices , that when- Congress fixed the compensation of the officers eleven years ago it hewed to the line , that is to say , it authorized no more pay than was adequate to the needs of the service . Therefore , the compensation received in this day of high and soaring prices , which officers must pay to support their families decently  --  and most of them are married ? must be far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is one of a very large class  --  makes this statement : I am to be reduced this month from a . Lieutenant Colonel to Captain . My pay will be $108 less per month . I pay $75 for the lower part of a duplex house , and in this town am glad to get it at that price , or for any price . The place is unusually congested with people . About the only way to get a house Is to build or buy . My commutation when reduced will amount to $48 per month . Must I leave my home and go to rooming after twenty years ' service in the army because my pay is not equal to my station in life ? And this , too , after over six years under field conditions , on the border ( Mexican ) and in France , with all my property packed and crated in the garrison I last left , because I change atation so fast it is impossible to have It with me . Can not something be done for our relief ? Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it . bard ? to make both ends meet when they must support families and educate their children in this era of expansion . The filing of more resignations in the past year than the department had received in the previous thirty yearsis proof enough that they have a real grievance . The burden falls heavily upon juniors , the grade of Lieutenant Commander and below . The Secretary of the Navy can refuse to accept resignations , but only by retaining officers who have lost interest in the service . Morale declines inevitably , and today it may be said of the navy , as of the army , that esprit de corps has diminished and men do not take as much pride in their tasks as of old , when they did not have to worry about the comfort of those dependent Upon them . It should be plain that officers who can look forward to retired pay at the end of a definite period would not be trying to get out of the army and navy if civil life did not offer them the " square deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many , pf them to abandon the careers in which they have taken so much pride . It was the fashion but a short time since to call ' officers of the army and navy heroes for the brilliant services they had rendered in the war . The word will have a false ring if their just claims to better pay are to be disregarded .
