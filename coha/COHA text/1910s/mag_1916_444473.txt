THEY seem as a long garden at evening , these earliest years . The stalks of hollyhocks are silhouetted vaguely , and the outlines of rose-bushes blotched . The flowers have no color ? only a deepening of the shadows here and there . But the air is filled with a sweet essence . It is the piquancy of old wonders . Why do men sow in the spring , and not at any other time of year ? In winter it is so much colder , and they will need warm new clothes . How could the stork carry the awkward long-limbed calf which came to the Guernsey cow ? Did the widow who cast into the treasury all that she had , even her living , have to go to the poorhouse afterwards ? How can your guardian angel fold her wings about the head of your bed , when it is pushed against the wall ? The minister was coming to dinner . Grandmother Crosby sent for me , so Olga put on my second-best dress and we drove over to the house in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her cheeks always made me think of the sewn which formed on my glass of VOL. 117-N0. 6hot milk . They were slick and white , with tiny lacy wrinkles . She wore a black dress with a high starched collar . Once I had been upstairs in her room on the fourth floor . My locket came unfastened , and when I picked it up my nails were filled with fine grit , and several long black hairs were wound about the chain . She shook me quite roughly when she saw them , and snatched the necklace out of my hand . The minister was stout and short of breath . He darted his eyes round suddenly , and , when he thought no one was watching , jerked his forefinger to one nostril , and sniffed shrilly through the other . If somebody looked at him unexpectedly , he grew quite red , and made a queer , chuckling noise in his throat , trying to imitate the shrill sound . During dinner he sat in grandpa 's place at the foot of the table . Grandmother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody paid any attention to me , and so I sat in my high chair , whispering softly , There were Adam and Eve , and Cain and Abel , and Abel got killed . ? Dr. Gordon , ' I asked abruptly , ' who did Cain marry ? ' The minister set his cup down with a sharp little dick , and , looking at grandmother , ran his fingers quickly through his hair . ' There are some pages missing from that particular portion of Genesis , ' he said . I did not like him , and was glad when Olga came to take me home . Going away to heaven was different from going away to New York . People left their watches and their long fur coats and their Bibles at home . These were given to others . You were silly if you cried and protested as you saw the things being carried off by their new owners . He to whom they belonged was not coming back to ask for them . He would not use them again . One day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lake . ' That is where poor grandfather is , ' she said . When we came home , I was crying . Mother told me that grandfather had gone to heaven . She sent me upstairs , and then she called Olga quite sharply . I did not hear what they talked about , but Olga shook me when she returned . Then she cried all day . Several mornings later we were going down to grandma 's . When mother opened the front door , a man was passing with newspapers under his arm . He was shouting loudly . Mother jerked me back and closed the door again until he had passed by . Before we reached Grandmother Crosby 's we had to push our way through a crowd of people . The street was filled with carriages . Some had men standing on the rims of the wheels . They craned their necks , and then stooped down and whispered to those beside them . Mother held me tightly by the shoulder . She had on a long black veil . As we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl over her head snatched at mother 's dress . She had a wilted pink flower in her hand . Her face was wet and dirty . For him , ma'am , on his grave . Act , Gott I ' she said . Mother took it , and we went on , into the house . Once when we were out , Olga bought me a sugar bun . She told me not to tell mother . I had eaten away the brown rim to the frosting when a little boy asked me for a penny . I gave him my bun . He did not eat the sugar part slowly , as I should have done . He crammed it all in at once . It made a big bump on his throat when he swallowed it . ' But he wo n't taste the sweet , ' I said to Olga . ' He is very hungry , ' she replied . Then she asked him some questions and took him home with us to have coffee down in the kitchen . After that , I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to come back to earth and be hungry like the little boy . He would return and live in a big house , and have lots to eat , as I did . I decided that Aunt Ethel 's baby must be grandpa . The stork brought him just after grandpa went away . Grandmother told me that grandpa was not always rich . He worked very hard when he was young , and so he would not have to be hungry when he came back . I made Olga walk with me beside the baby 's carriage , because I wanted to see if he looked like grandpa . Once auntie brought him to the house , and they left me alone for a few minutes , playing beside him on the floor . ' Oh , grandpa , quickly ! ' I said . ' Talk to me now ; they have all gone away . ' The baby stared and slowly blew a bubble on his lips . I held his shoulders so tightly that he finally began to cry . Then Aunt Ethel came back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She always bathed me herself before she put me to bed . The bathtub was ery long and deep . Grandmother stood on the step which ran beside it , with a big towel pinned about her . She held my neck tightly between her thumb and second finger , scrubbing me with her other hand . I slipped and fell from one side to the other , splashing the water high over the edges , so that , when she finally lifted me to the floor , the towel and her dress were drenched . There , ' she would say , that is hardly better than a sponging-off . You wo n't sit still while I give you a real bath . ' I used to go to sleep wondering how she would give me a real bath . For a long time I did not go over to see grandmother . Then , finally , Olga took me to her house again . Going upstairs and through the hall she made me walk very gently . Grandmother was lying in bed looking toward the door . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' she said . ' She has never seen me lying down . ' She put out her hand on the blanket with the palm turned up . When I ran over and hid my face in it , she moved her fingers slowly once or twice across my cheek . Stupid child , ' she murmured ; but her voice sounded pleased , and she told me to climb up on the bed beside her . Everything you did your guardian angel wrote down in a little golden notebook which she wore around her neck . If you had a great many good deeds , perhaps you would not have to be quite so hungry afterwards , even if you had been happy and had had enough to eat before you died . Maybe , too , you could give away some of your kind acts to people who had only a few . // I loved Miss Agatha . She was pretty , and her dresses were soft , with colors like a soap-bubble . But Olga said 1 hey dripped the blood of the poor . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always tried not to touch them . The summer I met Miss Agatha we were staying at the sea-shore . There were hundreds of butterflies lying on the beach , which , falling into the water , had been washed up by the waves . I used to carry them carefully to the warm dry sand . All morning I would do this . Please , God , ' I said , when Olga called me to go home , tell Miss Agatha 's angel that these good deeds are for her ! ' While we were at the shore , mother let me stay up for a dance at the hotel . I sat in the ballroom between Olga and a young lady whom I did not know . She was talking very quickly to her partner , and laughing , with her head on one side . Presently I went out . I took my rabbit from its cage in the garden and ran down into the ravine . When Olga came , I was lying on the ground in my lace dress , with the rabbit pressed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . They tell lies in there , ' I said at last ; they do n't mean what they say . ' Then I began to cry loudly . Olga laughed , and carried me upstairs to bed . There came a time when Olga was always crying . She would lift me over into her bed early in the morning and , pulling my hair back , hold my head away from her on the pillow . Then she would look at me , and sigh and sigh . One afternoon mother took me to the circus . When we came back , I ran to tell Olga of the baby camel that I had seen . I could not find her . Her watchcase and the picture of her daughter were missing from the bureau . She never came back . That evening mother gave me my supper . Afterwards a strange lady in a long black coat came to see us . Mother put my hand into hers . This is your new governess , dear ; you must call her Pralein , ' I repeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess , Miss Schmidt , you had better put Marian to bed now . ' I turned and buried my face in mother 's gown , wailing loudly . Fraulein had a black mole on one cheek . Generally two stiff hairs were growing out of its centre . When I kissed her good-night , they pricked my lips , so that I tried to walk up to her from the other side . It might make her feel badly to see me avoid them . She kept a little pair of tweezers in the back of her bureau drawer with which she used to pull the hairs out . On Sunday afternoons , a young man came and called for her . Sometimes we met him in the park while we were walking . He always laughed a great deal . ' How is the little Miss to-day ? ' he would say , putting his hand on my shoulder . His handkerchief smelled of carnations . Before we reached home , Ffaulein would make me promise not to tell mother that she had seen him . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . I played by the pond with Jack , the little boy who lived next door . We pretended that the Spanish ships were coming . We were the Americans , and threw handfuls of mud into the water . A swan was passing , and some of my mud struck his white wing . When the battle was over I felt sorry for the swan because I had spoiled his clean feathers . Jack and I hunted a long time . We thought we could splash water at him and wash the mud off . But he had paddled away . My feet were very wet when we came home from the pond . That night I had an ear-ache . I called mother because it was Praulein 's evening out . Next morning FrUulein would not speak tome . She pushed me away when I tried to kiss her . ' Go and tell your mother , ' she said , that you were only pretending last night ? your ear did not really ache . Then I will love you again . ' All day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told mother as she had bade . Then Frindein smiled and talked again . But I had told a lie and was very unhappy . After she had gone , I cried myself to sleep . When I think of that night , I always remember the swan that swam away with the mud on his wing . Jack was younger than I. If we played soldier , I was the captain . If we played train , I was the engine . I was the queen when we played fairies . Almost always he did as I told him . When he refused , we fought , rolling over and over on the grass . He was smaller , so that I beat him easily . One day he said he would not be coal-ear any longer . He told me I was only a girl . Then I struck him on the cheek . Suddenly I was lying flat on my back . ? Now get up , ' Jack ordered . ' I am the engine . ' I looked at him for a moment . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that I was dead and ran into the house screaming . When Frdulein came out , she jerked me to my feet and shook me . Jack was still crying . We played train again , and he let me be the engine . After a while , Jack and I grew tired of playing engine and coal-car . He said that it was babyish . We decided to raise chickens . He took the tin cracker-box out of the pantry and I brought some candle-stubs . Jack 's cook gave us an egg . We wrapped it in cotton and put it in one end of the tin box . Then we put two of the candles at the other end . The next morning , the cotton was burned and the candles had gone out , but the egg felt heavier , so we kept lighted stubs in the box all day . At night the egg was very heavy . Jack said it must contain a rooster , but I wanted a hen because then we could get more eggs and hatch lots of chickens . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we broke the shell . The egg was cooked hard and there was no chicken . Jack loved toads . He used to build little fences of matches and poke his captives with a switch until they jumped over them . One day , he tossed one high above his head and tried to catch it . The toad turned a summersault , and its four legs waved in the air until it resembled a huge spider . It fell to the ground and lay perfectly still on its back , with the two front paws folded . They looked like a baby 's hands . I began to cry and ran into the house . Pretty soon I heard Jack tiptoeing upstairs . He tried the knob , but my door was locked . ' Marian , ' he called , only see what I have brought ! ' Then I twisted the key slowly . Jack canto in with a pop-corn bag in his hand . He carried it carefully to the bureau , and tipped it upside down . The toad hopped out , and squatted among my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frdulein gave me lessons for two years , and after that I went to school . When I came home from my walk in the afternoon , I would run upstairs to a corner of the attic and read . I liked books with big words and long sentences . I read the New Testament , and after that the Talmud , parts of the Koran , and Blackstone 's Commentaries . I liked the latter best . I used to learn its sentences by heart and say them over and over at night before I went to sleep . Once we went on a Sunday-school picnic to a deserted farmhouse . I climbed in through the window and found a copy of Robinson 's Elementary Law . It was torn and yellow . I sat down on the floor behind the old wood-box . I did not hear them calling me outside . Finally one of the boys saw me through the window . I was walking up and down when they came in , repealing , ' Incorporeal real property embraces all those permanent rights which concern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or result in the enjoyment of corporeal property . ' After a while I began to read novels too . I stole candle-ends from the pantry and hid them under my mattress . When Fraulein left me , I stuck them to the closet floor , where she could not see the light , and lay on my stomach with my face close to the book . Sometimes I acted out the characters . My favorite was a girl who kept a dance-hall in a western town . When her patrons grew familiar she boxed their ears . I used my long , brown school coat for the patrons . When I read this story , we were living in a hotel . Fraulein used to let me sit downstairs for a while after supper , to listen to the music . A little boy with red hair always sat with me . One evening I asked him if my cheek was chapped . My face was very close to his . I waited breathlessly . ' Yes , ' he said , right there , ' and touched me gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boxed his ear . ' Keep your dirty hands off ! ' Fraulein jerked me upstairs and washed my mouth out with soap . Helen Ware sat behind me in school . She was a Catholic , and when she came to spend the night with me she always knelt , for a long time , at the foot of the bed , saying her prayers on a string of gold beads . Then we would talk together until almost morning . One night I sat up suddenly . Helen , ' I whispered , ' who , would you rather be , Effie or Cleopatra ? ' Effie was the maid who helped us to take off our wraps at school . She was small and very white . Her hair was thin , and the rims of her eyes were pink . She always wore a brown woolen dress , with a little gold cross hanging round her neck on a worn brown ribbon . All morning she would sit by the hall window , stitching white linen altar-covers for the church . By the dim light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surprised eyes , looking at me from the pillow . ' Why , Effie , of course ! ' she answered . ' She is a good , pious girl . Cleopatra was a very bad woman . ' ' Well , ' I said , lying down again with a flounce , I 'd rather be Cleopatra . ' Marian ! ' Helen gasped fearfully . After this , there was a silence for several moments . Then she put both hands on my shoulders . Marian , dear , ' she whispered , do n't talk that way , because you know you do n't mean it , and it sounds very wicked . ' No , ' I repeated stubbornly , ' I would rather be Cleopatra . ' Helen crawled out of bed slowly , and began to say her beads again . I fell asleep before she had finished . But presently , she shook me gently and wakened me . Marian , ' she said , ' would you still rather be Cleopatra ? ' ' Of course , ' I answered her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , and then I slept once more . In about half an hour , she woke me again . Helen , ' I said , solemnly this time , I would rather be Cleopatra , and have people love me , and fight great battles over me , and go to hell afterwards , than be Effie , and wear brown dresses , and sew for the church , and sit on a cloud playing a gold harp when I died ! ' She began to cry , with soft , slow little sobs , so that I put my arms around her when she had wiggled back under the covers . We did not speak again , and presently she fell asleep , her breathing broken now and then by a little jerk . I used to think that if I tiptoed to the door of father 's study , and jumped in suddenly , I might catch the bronze mask of Voltaire with his eyes open . I tried many times , but always I looked up again on the same smooth , gleaming surfaces of downcast lids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organ . On the mantel stood a marble bust of Voltaire , and an etched portrait hung over the door . His works , and those of others about him , almost filled one of the bookcases which lined the room , reaching from floor to ceiling . I had my first lessons in French , learning to pronounce their names . La Bible enfin expliqufe , ' I would say , carefully pronouncing each syllable as it was spelled . Then father would laugh , and make me say the words again as he told me . One afternoon , Miss Ellen came up to the study to talk to father . I sat on my little stool beside them , cutting out paper dolls . Miss Ellen was tired and gray . She lived across the river where the streets were always muddy and lined on either side with garbage-cans . The little children playing ' seek and find ' used to crouch down in the bottom of them to hide . She and father were talking about a new kindergarten . Suddenly she bent down and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying , yet she laughed . ' Oh , honey , ' she said , ' when you grow up , if you go into settlement work , do n't get lean and eager as I am . ' The words made me wonder , but the tones were like warm , soft arms which held me close . Father got up , and walked to the window . I can understand your studying and reading , Ellen , but why in the name of reason must you go over and live in that place ? ' He spoke quickly and his eyes were very bright as he waved his arm about the book-lined room . ' Is n't your love for all of these big enough to fill your life ? ' Miss Ellen closed her eyes slowly , and smiled , and shook her head . Before she went away that afternoon , she asked father to play . We sat together on the green plush sofa , listening , and she held my hand . Father had on his felt slippers and an old corduroy smoking-jacket . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn . Mother had given it to him years before . While he played , he swayed back and forth . He never watched the keys , but fixed his eyes , which were very wide and blue , on the mask of Voltaire above the organ . He played continuously , running one theme into another . Sometimes it was his own music , and he would hesitate for a moment , searching for the proper harmony , and striking the notes softly and tentatively . Then , when the right one was found , he would smile gently , and nod his head . ' So , ' he would whisper to himself . Sometimes , if the strain pleased him particularly , he repeated it several times , insistently . Afterwards I could never hum the things which father played . They made me think of colors . Sometimes the not es were soft , dull colors , shading one into another . Then again they were brilliant , and sharply divided , like patches in a crazy quilt . They made pictures . But when I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake his head . He could not speak them . To-day the music was gay . ' See now , I will play away your hungry babies and sad-eyed women , ' he said to Miss Ellen . I knew not how or why , but suddenly hot tears were rolling down my cheeks , and I buried my face in Miss Ellen 's lap . Her fingers stroked my hair as she bent over me . ' You are like him , ' she whispered , very like him , ? but , darling , through your whole life remember this ? it means responsibility . ' Across the years that have gone , those notes come back ? dancing , rollicking still , to fall on the heart 's ear in the plaintive minor of that afternoon . Again they bring tears , and again I hear Miss Ellen 's whisper , but I know now why I cry . II I called aloud in the forest , and the shout came back . Then I searched long , to find who answered me ? but the sound had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamps at evening . It led me hither and yon , but I came nowhere . It was only the ghost of a light . I saw an apple hanging in the depths of a pool . I stooped to pick it , and laved my hands in the water . The apple had no form . This is dream-life . First there was Margaret . She wore hoopskirts , curls , and a cameo brooch . Her face was like Miss Agatha 's , and she had a voice that seemed to cuddle you , like Miss Ellen 's . Frfiulein always put a chair for her at the foot of the table during my supper-time . I used to knock when I went into the dressing-room before breakfast , because Margaret was getting dressed there . At night she would sit beside my bed , while I told her of everything that I had done during the day . Sometimes she would stroke my hair and laugh , and sometimes she became very angry . Once , on Fraulein 's day out , Jack and I took five cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket . We went around the corner to the drug-store for a soda . It was the first time we had ever had one . When the man asked us what flavor we wanted , I looked anxiously at Jack , who kicked his toe against the counter , and took the other nickel from his pocket . Then he smiled suddenly , holding it out to the man . ' We 'll take the best you ' ve got , ' he said . The man laughed , and gave us chocolate , with two big spoonfuls of ice cream . That night I told Margaret . The following afternoon I was going to a birthday party . She said I must stay home in bed . For a long time I begged her to forgive me , but she only shook her head . Then I became very angry , and stamped my foot . ' You 're nothing but a pretend ! ' I said to her . Go to the party , ' she answered quietly , but I shall leave you , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fraulein lay out my lace dress and pink sash . Then she came over and started to unfasten the rags in my hair . I turned away abruptly . ' I 'm not going . ' Hm , ' she replied , take care , or I 'll not curl your hair , and you will really have to stay at home . ' I 'm going to , anyway , ' I said . Fraulein stared at me . ' Well , where do you expect to go ? ' she scoffed . " To bed , ' I answered shortly . When at last she had dressed me in my nightgown , with my hair braided , and had gone away muttering to herself , I crawled under the covers , and hid my tears in the pillow . ' There was a Punch-and-Judy show , and a grab-bag , and ? ' Then Margaret came to sit beside me . I buried my head under the sheet , but at last I turned over and took her hand , and , holding it , fell asleep . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of stones . A missionary had brought them from the Jordan . Once , when father was away , I took one out . It was clear and purple , with a smooth surface , across which straggled a faint blue vein . I held it in the palm of my hand , while shivers of awe ran up and down my back . Perhaps Jesus had trod upon it as he waded out into the river ! It would have wonderful powers to heal sickness and work miracles , like the bones or pieces of wood we read about in hooks . When I went upstairs I took the stone with me . All afternoon I sewed tiny bags to carry it , on a chain around my neck . I made a pink satin one from a bit of ribbon that mother had given me ; another of white leather from an old kid glove ; and a third of chamois , with blue cross-stitching , for rainy days . While I sewed , I decided that I must have precious ointment or lotion in which to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until I pricked my finger and a tiny spot of blood appeared . Then I sprang up , and ran downstairs to ask the cook for a knife . I had had a sign from heaven . When I came up again , I closed the door carefully . Then I shut my eyes , and pressed the blade down on my finger . It was very dull . I tried once more , sawing it slowly hack and forth . My knees trembled , and there was a little beaded rim of perspiration above my upper lip . At last the knife went through the skin . A drop of blood spurted out , and trickled along my finger , to drip from its tip into the clean , THE GIRL : AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY ns empty medicine bottle which I had ready . I squeezed the cut until the whole glass bottom was covered with blood . Then I filled the bottle half full of water . Every evening I washed my stone in the pale brown lotion . At school , we thought of it as something very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink bag they always held it fearfully in the centre of their palms . I let Eleanor , my best friend , wear it during spelling class , but I kept it for geography and Latin . One summer , at the seashore , Jack and I pretended we were knights . He was Launcelot , and I was Galahad . Mother gave us each a tin helmet and breastplate , and father made us oak swords with leather guards . We decided to keep watch over our armor all night . After Frdulein had turned down the lights , I climbed out of bed and propped my sword against the wall , with the other arms beside it . Then I knelt before them . The clock ticked on and on , and finally cuckooed nine times . Outside , beyond the hotel porch , the waves rolled back and forth along the shore . The shade flapped against the window , and in the hall I could hear Fraulein conning French verbs . My knees became very stiff , and I swayed slightly . Then everything grew suddenly still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transom had gone , and it was very quiet , save for the clock and the waves . I lay on the floor , with my arms around the helmet . Picking it up , I clambered drowsily into bed , and tucked the covers about the smooth , cold tin . One day , on the beach , another little girl asked to play with us . She said she would be Sir Percival . ' Then you must be honorable and fearless , ' we told her . Presently she jumped out to a rock , about which the waves swept in shallow , gray currents . ' I vow by the Holy Grail that I shall stay here for three minutes , ' she called . I held my breath while Jack took out his little silver watch . One minute gone ? ' he said at last . Than a big wave came , and splashed upon the rock . Sir Percival turned and sprang for the shore . Jack and I looked at each other , wide-eyed with dismay . I think we expected her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nothing happened . Then we picked up our swords and walked away . We never spoke to her again . One afternoon we were having a tournament in the casino . Jack 's sword slipped and struck Billy Fargo on the head . Billy sat in the middle of the ballroom floor , with his face turned away from us . There was a splash of blood on his sleeve . We did not dare speak to him or touch him , for fear that he would cry . Knights never cried . Presently somebody looked in at the casino door . We forgot all about Billy , and stared at the newcomer . It was the great actor from New York , who had ridden down to spend the day with my uncle . He still wore khaki riding breeches and an English army coat . His hair was heavy and black , and he had dark gray eyes . There was a twinkle in them just now , and his lips wore a little twisted smile as he came over to Billy . We parted silently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gathered Billy into his arms , to fling him over his shoulder like a meal-bag , and strode out of the door . From the window we watched him go down the terrace to the bay , and aboard my uncle 's sail-boat . Faintly there reached us from across the gardens the jerky squeaking of the pulley , as he and Billy lifted the mainsail . After that , I thought of what had happened in the casino many times . I called him Jim ? I did not know why . One night I was lying in bed making up pictures . There was a log shack on the edge of a muddy , straggling river . Beyond were low sand-hills , purple and yellow in the sunset . I knew this , because I had seen it all from a train window two years before . A grindstone stood beside the stoop , with a tin washbasin hanging on the nail above it . There was a bench against the house wall , made of a split log . A man in khahi riding breeches was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered about his feet . He had heavy black hair and gray eyes . Men in my pictures always looked like Jim now . Before him was a boy . Suddenly I jumped out of bed , and stood shivering in my nightgown in the middle of the room , turning an imaginary hat round and round in my hands . Please , boss , ' I said , ' I want a job . ' Jim looked up slowly . ' Who are you ? ' he asked . I told him Karpeles . ' Then he smiled his queer little twisted smile . ' That ' s quite a name for a small boy . ' I tried hard not to jump up and down in my excitement . He really thought that I was a boy . It was my grandfather 's name , ' I muttered , apologetically . Well , Karpeles , ' Jim asked , ' what can you do ? ' There was silence for a moment , then , ' Please , please take me , boss , ' I begged , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary too . ' And so I went to live with Jim , and dream-life became very full . When we came back to the city , I told Jack about the boss . He said he wanted to work for him too . We pre- tended that Grandmother Crosby 's stable was the barn and outbuildings of the ranch . There was a trap-door in the floor which led to the potato cellar , We fastened a rope to an iron ring above , and lowered it into the hole . Then , through the long fall afternoons , we climbed up and down , up and down , bearing imaginary bags on our shoulders . We were loading the wagons to go into Maverick with the season 's sugar-beet crop . When finally the cellar was emptied , we ran back and forth in the yard , lashing the air with long black whips . Here was the corral . We were breaking in Jim 's ponies . The shack had only one room . There was a big fireplace at the end , with shelves on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre stood a crooked table . A double bed with log posts was in the corner against the wall . It was covered with red woolen blankets and a buffalo skin . Jim and I slept here . When the nights were very cold , I used to double the comforter and put it all on one side of the bed . I took my school coat from the closet , and laid it over myself . It made Frdulein very angry when she came in next morning . She told me that they locked crazy people in iron cells . One night there was a blizzard . Jim did not come home . After Fraulein had gone out , I put a candle-stub in the window . The clock cuckooed eleven and then twelve . Still he had not come . At last I heard his horse in the snow outside . He was very cold . All night he tossed back and forth muttering . I sat in an arm-chair beside the bed . When Frfiulein came at seven to close the windows , I had fallen asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I crawled into bed without speaking to her , and put my arms around Jim . He was much better , and said he would not die . Then I laughed . ' He 's all right now , ' I told Frdulein . ' I do n't care what you do to me . ' She turned away . ' Disgusting , indecent child ! ' she said . But I was very happy then , and the words held no wonder . One Saturday , Eleanor and her twin sister Lucy came for luncheon . Afterwards we sat upstairs in my playroom and made bags for the purple stone . The twins were fourteen and I was only thirteen , so that I felt very proud that Eleanor was my best friend . We had been sewing quietly for several minutes . Presently Lucy turned to her sister . ' Is n't it nice that Mrs. Fargo is going to have a baby ? ' she said . Eleanor scowled and raised her eyes suddenly . They met mine , and she dropped them again to her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sewing ; she took careful , prim little stitches . ' Do n't be an idiot , Eleanor , ' she remarked . My piece of satin lay in my lap . ' Lucy , ' I said , after a while , and it seemed as if I were listening to somebody else speak . ' Why do you think that the stork is going to bring Mrs. Fargo a new baby ? ' Lucy smiled . ' Really , you do not believe that silly stuff any longer ? ' ' Shut up , Lucy , ' said Eleanor suddenly . Her sister shrugged her shoulders . Then she looked at me deliberately . ' I know that Mrs. Fargo is going to have a baby , ' she said , because she has let out all of her dresses . She only wears loose ones now . ' The cuckoo clock ticked comfortably on . Beneath , in the street , a hurdy-gurdy suddenly began its pulsating , metallic jargon . The lame houseman was thumping unrhythmically up the back stairs . Finally I folded my sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Lucy 's chair , I slipped my arms about her neck , and laid my cheek against hers . I want you to tell me everything now , ' I begged . There was a long silence . Eleanor did not look up again . All right , ' said Lucy at last , and I sat down before her . Well , ' she began , and then stopped . Her face was very pink , and she turned away her head . ' I can not talk if you stare at me so , ' she said crossly . After that , I kept my eyes fixed on a figure in the carpet , and she went on , monotonously , with many pauses . That night seemed very long . Once I screamed , and sobbed Jim 's name . FrUulein came running in . She switched on the light , and stood blinking , in her pink flannel nightgown . I had a bad dream , ' I told her , and hid my face in the pillow . She came over and tucked my covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said , and patted me roughly on the shoulder . ' Now close your eyes like a good girl , and go to sleep . ' When she left , the room seemed emptier than ever . At last I got up , and tiptoed down stairs to the guest-room . There were two beds there . I curled up on the lace counterpane and fell asleep . When I woke up , the sun was shining . My head was on the other pillow , and my arms were stretched out across the other bed .
