This is not a dictionary in the sense of a lexicon , but is rather an abbreviated compendium of medicine . As the author . states , it occupies a position " somewhere between that of a technical dictionary of medicine and one intended merely for the domestic treatment of commoner ailments , " and it is hoped that " district nurses , teachers , clergymen , and professional men generally , ship-captains , colonists , business men , and others " may find the volume useful . To aid in this use of the book the preface is followed by a page printed in red , which gives the titles to be examined in case of accidents , drowning , poisoning , and so- forth . An examination of some of these titles shows a very satisfactory treatment . Thus , " bandages " are treated in ten pages , with seventeen illustrations ; , under " bites , " those of the dog , serpents , spiders , and smaller insects are described , and the treatment is briefly outlined . In none of the articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the author states in his preface , diagnosis is a highly technical matter which lies entirely in the province of the medical man . It is difficult , however , in view of this statement , to understand why four of the thirteen full-page colored plates should be devoted to the reproduction of the rash of chicken-pox , German measles , measles , and scarlet fever , respectively . These pictures can have only one object  --  to aid in diagnosis without the help of a physician . This is a dangerous thing under any circumstances , but most unfortunate in the group of contagious diseases here represented , because of the attendant neglect , in the absence of a physician , of isolation and quarantine , so important in preventing their spread . Any factor which tends to discourage that exact diagnosis upon which depends rational treatment and , in the case of the infectious diseases , the prevention of disease , is to be condemned . It is doubtful , therefore , no matter what benefits may accrue to the smaller group represented by " ship-captains " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the encouragement which the book offers to " home " diagnosis and treatment . Certain it is that it would be better for " district nurses , teachers , clergymen , and professional men generally " to depend upon a physician than upon the brief descriptions of treatment offered in this dictionary . As a lexicon the work is disappointing in its treatment of modern scientific medicine . A cursory survey shows no mention of the words Anaphylaxis , Metabolism , Purins , Chromosome , Lipoid , Hook-worm disease . Adrenalin is given , but nothing is said about its physiologic action ; the few paragraphs on Immunity might have been written twenty years ago ; and the treatment of Vaccines , other than that for smallpox , is most fragmentary . It is evident that the book is not intended for physicians ; it is of no value , because incomplete , to the general student who wishes an exact definition of a medical word or a description of a medical procedure , and , in that it encourages the treatment of the sick without trained medical aid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for the " ship-captain " and the " dwellers in remote districts , " they can procure in two volumes modern scientific treatises on medicine and surgery which together total less of weight and bulk than the volume under discussion . In the opening article of the Geographical Journal for October , Capt F. M. Bailey describes his exploration on the Tsangpo or Upper Brahmaputra , the least known and most inaccessible region in the world . He succeeded in unravelling a problem which has troubled geographers for more than fifty years by proving that the tremendous waterfall by which , according to the lamas , the Tsangpo breaks through the Himalayas is non-existent . Another interesting problem , whether there are one or two continents at the South Pole , is discussed by Griffith Taylor , senior geologist to Capt Scott 's expedition Among other results of his reseal ches is the conviction that " between 2,000 and 3,000 feet represents the thickness of the ice-cap " that covers the land .
