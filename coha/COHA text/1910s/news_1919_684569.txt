txt We trust that Mr. BURLESON:8 days May be long in the land , but we are ' ready to write the epitaph of  --  the Postmaster General . For a model we should take Joitssox 's on GOLDSMITH and reverse it . That is to say , GoreMarrs touched nothing which he did not adorn . With the Postmaster General it is quite otherwise . Except , of course , the department 's surplus . His profits grew with the cost of operation , and might have sufficed perhaps to pay at least the interest on the national debt , if his plans had not been thwarted by labor troubles . His policy was that postal employes might present grievances to him personally . But his sympathies were with his employee only individually , and they regarded the privilege as derisory . Collectively they were as unknown to biro as they were to the private employers who recognize unions of their . Own selection only , and who decline relations with other unions . The wire Services were talcen over in the face of labor troubles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of resistance to Government . The strike having ripened , nevertheless , the wire services are turned over to the gentlemen who formerly operated them for private interest , and who now face the difficulties of the strike as Government officials . There Is the Commercial Telegraphers ' Union , which has ordered the strike . And there is the Western Union Employes ' Association . The company nays there are 710 members of the belligerent union , and that if they strike they never will be re-employed . The ' union says there are 3,000 Strikers in ten Southern States , where the company says there are only 300 members . The membership of the ' Western Union Employes ' Association 1$ uncertain . The status of the companies is as uncertain . as the status of the strike or the strikers . The order of the Postmaster General was so generally misunderstood that he issued an interpretation of It , and the interpretation of the interpretation by the Senators of the committee who are looking into the trouble is that the Postmaster General wished to transfer the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other responsibilities in connection with the taking over of the wire services . He seems to have surrendered the burden of operation while retaining control of the companies themselves until Congress shall pass legislation making complete surrender of the properties to their owners safe . He had increased rates by $30,000,000 and wages by $34,000 , - , 000. and there was necessity for the rates to be continued by a protective statute until the $4,000,000 had been absorbed " by economies . " The department 's deficit on operation was put at $1,000.000 . The figures do not match , but they are not ours . How long would be necessary to recoup the deficit of either sum seems to depend on the result of the strike , and that is anybody 's guess . The result of the quarrel may be serious , yet worth while if it settles the definition of a union , under the policy of protecting collective bargainfog . Employers have a right to be protected alrainet collective bargaining with a multiplicity of unions . Employ &; claim a right to select the union they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn between unions which must be recognized and unions which May be ignored or fought without antagonizing the official policy of the War Labor Board arid of several depertraints of Government , to say no-tbInf of the Federation of Labor in ssreement with them ?
