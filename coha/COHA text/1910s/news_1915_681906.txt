txt Charles Becker has obtained another postponement of his execution , this time for two days . Warden Osborne of Sing Sing set along the date from Wednesday to Friday at the suggestion of Justice John Ford of the Supreme Court , before whom arguments were made yesterday for a new trial , on the ground of newly discovered evidence . After the arguments of W. Bourke Cockran , Becker 's lawyer , and District Attorney Perkins were finished yesterday afternoon and the affidavits filed by both sides were in his hands for reView , Justice Ford telephoned to Sing Sing and arranged for the postponement , so that he might have more time In which to consider the application for a new trial . Justice Ford mill decide the case on the affidavits and arguments alone , without calling witnesses , as Mr. Cockran suggested . " I do n't see that , so far as we have gone . the testimony of Becker is necessary , " the Justice said . " The affidavits I propose to take at their face value . I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . if , in view of the shortness of time , I need further time , I will communicate with both sides . " The suggestion to ask Warden Osborne to postpone the carrying out of the death sentence was made by District Attorney Perkins . Mr. Cochran suggested that he ask the Governor for forty-eight hours ' delay , but District Attorney Perkins pointed out that that was not necessary , inasmuch as the execution had been set indefinitely for the week beginning July i.i6 . Coekran Attacks Gov . Whitman . In his three-hour argument Mr. Cockran attacked Governor Whitman . lie charged him with suppressing evidence ? the Sullivan story  --  which , Mr. Cockran said , would have changed the verdict of the jury . " An outrage on the administration of justice . " Becker 's chief counsel styled the alleged failure of Mr. Whitman as District Attorney to bring out all the facts . Then he accused Governor Whitman of causing to be published from Albany last Saturday statements concerning the interview with Joseph Murphy , in which erroneous impressions of Murphy 's talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's argument was based almost entirely on legal points . His conversational manner was a contrast to Mr. Cockran 's oratorical speech . There was not a single thing in any one of tile affidavits which would come under the head of new evidence , he argued . Even if the District Attorney admitted the truth of the affidavits. he said . they were not Sufficient on which to grant a motion for a new trial . District Attorney Perkins and Assistant District Attorney James A. Delehanty sat one either side of Mr. Taylor , who is the head of the Appeal Bureau . Mr. Perkins 's suggestion that the Warden delay the execution was his only active part in the day 's proceedings . ASSOciated with Mr. Cockran were John B. Johnston , Martin T. Manton . and John F. . Mrs. Becker had a seat in front with a clerk from Mr. Cockran 's office . She was dressed in black , with a white hat , white collar , and white gloves . Did n't Know Whitman 's Father . Mr. Cockran prefaced his argument with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as saying " pounded and pounded and pounded at Vallon , Webber , and Rose , and held them In jail day after day . " Mr. Cochran then attacked " Tack " Rose 's various stories . " Becker did n't make his statement on the stand because Appelbaum went to him and said : ' The Senator is almost , crazy , and wants you not to mention I his name whatever happens . ' Becker ! said : ' You may be perfectly sure that I ! will not mention Sullivan 's name unless . it is mentioned by some one else . ' " We will show that Appelbaum went later to see Becker in the Tombs , and ex-Commissioner of Correction Wright will take the stand and swear that he made out a special permit for Appelbaum to go into the Tombs to see . Becker on a Sunday . when the District Attorney contends there were no visitors allowed . " After the Sullivan story became known Rose made It statement for the newspapers which seemed to me almost incomprehensible at first , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this statement . said that Whitman 's father was a friend of Becker 's . As a matter of fact . Becker never knew Whitman 's father . Rose declared in The statement : ' It was against my advice that Becker ever met Rosenthal , ' although at the first trial he said he brought Becker and Rosenthal together . Rose himself proves the Sullivan episode now . " Rose 's statement that he advised Becker to give up 55.000 to get Rosenthal to go to Paris was made at the same time . Rose said that Becker answered : ' Let him be killed . and let it serve as a warning to squealers . ' Think of that  --  ordering the killing to take place and letting it he known that he was the one who inspired it . Says Rose Stole $5,000 . " The truth Is , Rose had the $6.000 to get rid of Rosenthal , and he gave $1,000 to the gunmen and stole .55,00o . " To have suppressed the Sullivan story was a crime and an outrage on the administration of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring out every fact in connection with a crime . The District Attorney allowed the conviction by suppressing his knowledge of a falsehood . " All the Sullivan story . Mr. Cockran said , was material wh eh he did not have two weeks ago . " We did n't /have Becker 's story then . " he asserted . " It is n't necessary to consider that statement alone , for we have other testimony which bears it out . " Mr. Cockran then referred to the affidavit made by Harford T. Marshall , once Bridgie Webber 's counsel , that Webber told him they were going to " frame " Becker because the District Attorney " wanted " him . This conversation , he said , was not privileged , for " no man can make an attorney part of a crime by announcing his intention to commit it . ' , " Counsel ca n't be employed to facilitate crime , " Mr. Cockran declared . " Webber could say to him , ' I murdered ' Losenthal , ' but he could not say , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " We have submitted a letter from Joseph Murphy a convict in Sing Sing . In this letter Murphy said he was a prisoner in the Tombs while Rose , Webber , and Vallon were there , and that on the Sunday before they were removed from the Tombs he heard one of them say : We must frame Becker . ' Later he heard them say : We have n't a chance in the world unless we frame Becker . They ca n't convict an innocent Man , and we 'll all get out . ' Assails the Governor Again . " The Sunday after he made the statement this man was brought shackled before the Governor , and , according to the publicity bureau which the Governor maintains , the Governor was described as snaking him like a terrier shakes a rat . ' The District Attorney , now seated in the Governor 's chair , is , according to his press agents , pounding and pounding and pounding . ' " In a statement which he made for the District Attorney , Charles Johnson , Deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Governor . Murphy , Johnson said , went to Becker 's cell on June 20 and told him he knew something about Becker 's case . Becker said : Do n't talk to me. if you have anything see my lawyers . ' Yet the statement in the press was made to let the people believe that Becker and Murphy trafficked together . " There was n't a single witness who testified for the prosecution who was n't bribed  --  bribed by promise of immunity or by money . James Marshall , the negro witness , got po a week , his board in a hotel and frequent visits to the theatres for several weeks . Charles Plitt , Jr. , got the same thing . With reference to the Harlem conference , a chauffeur made an affidavit in which he said he had never dropped Rose and Becker there at alL At the time of the second trial , this man , a shady character , was found to be in the employ of the District Attorney 's office , as an automobile detective or something . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technicality . If these things had been presented to the Jury he never would have been convicted . If he goes to his death , it will be because justice is enmeshed in snares . " Court Interrupts Prosecutor . Mr. Cockran finished his argument half an hour after the afternoon session Started . Mr. Taylor handed up his affidavits and brief and began to present the District Attorney 's case . While he was speaking be turned frequently to confer with District Attorney Perkins and Mr. Delehanty . Mr. Taylor declared at the outset that the Supreme Court has no inherent power to grant a new trial , according to a decision of the Court of Appeals . " The only power is that expressly given under Section 465 of the Penal Law , Rule 7 , which provides for a retrial on the ground of newly discovered evidence , " he said . " There are almost no limits of power of the Supreme Court to reopen its own judgment , " Justice Ford interrupted to remark . " Evidence which is introduced as new must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been in possession of the applicant 's attorneys at the time of the trial and must not be introduced simply to impeach the credibility of a witness . There are half a dozen affidavits here that simply impeach . Antong them are those of Murphy . the convict , Harford T. Marshall , Ex-Sheriff Ginty of Danbury , and Louis Harris . The point that the informers framed UP the case is not a new one , for it was brought into the trial by Jack Sullivan . There is no reason why this statement of Becker 's should have been published , except in an attempt to stir up the sympathy of the public . It is simply an unhappy brooding over his fate . The mass of the statement contains nothing but hearsay , innuendo . Whether Becker 's reasons for not taking the stand were good , bad , or indifferent , the fact remains that he did n't . Mr. Manton , in his closing argument at the trial . said that Becker did n't take the stand because he did n't consider it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the stand was because he could n't Stand the gaff . " Rosenthal 's Trunks Not Packed . The District Attorney , in answer to the affidavits submitted by Mr. Cockran , offered affidavits from Jack Rose , Mrs. Rosenthal Bridgie Webber , DeputY Johnson , ohnson , Assistant District Attorney James Smith , and ex-Assistant District Attorney Frank Moss . " The testimony given by me at the trials is true and I hereby reaffirm and reiterate the same , " Jack Rose said in his affidavit . He denied he had ever told ex-Sheriff Ginty of Danbury that he had $5,000 to give Rosenthal the night of the murder. , He also denied the assertions of Murphy and Louis Harris that he and Vallon and Webber discussed a " frame-up . " Mrs. Rosenthal in her affidavit said : " I never heard my husband say he was to get $15,000 or $5,000 , or any other sum of money in consideration of his leaving New York . " Mrs. Rosenthal said that on the night of July 15 she did not pack her husband 's trunks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The last word I had from my husband regarding his movements for the next day was that he and I were to go down to the District Attorney 's office on the following morning , " she said . Webber also reaffirmed his testimony and denied charges of a " frame-up . ' Air . Smith made an affidavit that Kauffman had several interviews with him , but never told him what he said in his affidavit . Frank Moss made an affidavit to the same effect .
