IT is no paradox to say that we have never had an army in these United 2 States of ours . We haVe had a United States Army ? that is , troops , a collection of regiments of distinguished record , regiments in which any other country would have taken pride . We have had certain staff departments , of admirable personnel , of proved worth in many relations ; but it is nevertheless true that we have never had an army as that word is understood now , and has been understood . for many years by everybody , including ourselves . An army is an organism , a whole composed of many parts accurately adjusted to one another for specific ends . Obviously , therefore , an army means numbers , the very thing that our army has always lacked . Nor do we necessarily mean by numbers the swollen effectives of the great European armies , but simply numbers sufficiently great to form the units whose relation to one another makes up the organism . From shortly after the close of the Civil War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was limited to twenty-five thousand men , barely more than enough to furnish , as far as mere numbers go , a modern division at war strength , and manifestly a number far too small on which to rest any organization worthy of the name . Reasons , naturally , are at hand For this state of affairs , inherited by us from our British ancestors . We have never believed as a nation that war , real war , could ever be any concern of ours , and have therefore never felt the necessity of putting our military house in order . Moreover , the sentiment of the country has always been , and still is , fundamentally pacific . This sentiment is nut incompatible with sound preparation , but its influence , in a country al'VOL . CXXXV. ? No. 810. - 112most wholly devoted to the arts of peace , has been to blind the country to its possible international responsibilities . The Civil War had misled us as a nation . We needed no army because we could always get volunteers . We had nothing to fear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nations to the south were worse off than we ( which is saying a great deal ! ) , and as for those beyond the seas , why , there were the seas themselves protecting us on both flanks . And yet , in spite of all these dreams and reasons , we find ourselves in this year of grace engaged in war with the most powerful military nation known to history , and finding the seas as such no obstacle to our coining into contact with it ! And now we need an army , are getting it , and are at last resolved that it shall be a real one in every sense of the word . Its constitution will be apparent from a brief review of the work any army is required to do , and of the units suggested by experience as best fitted for the purpose in hand . Classically , every army comprises the three great arms ? infantry , cavalry , and artillery . These three , applying what used to be called the " tactics of the three arms , " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry finds the enemy , the artillery shatters , or tries to shatter , him by its fire , and the infantry completes the effect by its own fire , followed if necessary by assault . Should the enemy give way , the cavalry takes up the pursuit , assisted by the artillery , while the infantry consolidates the positions won and prepares for further advance . But men and horses must he fed , hence the supply-trains ; ammunition must always be at hand , hence the ammunition columns . Roads must be repaired , bridges built , and rivers crossed ; this work is done by the engineers , who also , when the army takes up a position , are charged with the business of intrenching and of fortifying . After combat , the wounded must be cared for , and then sent to the rear , evacuated , by the proper hospital trains to the various hospitals and depots . This is the business of the medical staff . Whether an army advances or sticks perforce to its trenches , it must communicate with its rear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other depots , in which these take their start , and which form the army 's base . Last of all and greatest of all comes the staff , preparing and directing under the control of the commander-in-chief . Evidently the work so briefly indicated above would be impossible without a full application of the principle of division of labor ; and so , like any other work , it calls for units adapted to the ends sought . The first of these is the captain 's command , the company of infantry or of engineers , the battery of artillery , the troop of cavalry . Four companies make a battalion of infantry ; two or more batteries a brigade or group ( called battalion by us ) ; and four troops a squadron . Each of these battalion units is in our service under a major . The next command unit is the regiment , whether of infantry , engineers , cavalry , or artillery , composed of three battalions of infantry ? of a variable number in the engineers , of two or more battalions of artillery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colonel . Two or three regiments ( generally two to-day ) go to make the brigade , whether of infantry , artillery , or cavalry . Passing to higher groupings , two brigades make a division of infantry or of cavalry ( there is no artillery division ) , and two divisions ( infantry or cavalry ) make a corps or army corps. i A brigade with us is commanded by a brigadier-general , a division by a major-general . The higher grades of general officer ? namely , lieutenant-general and general ? are dormant , because they are usually reserved to reward the two or three commanders of successful armies , or , rather , groups of armies during or after war . ' fc so happens that our grade of brigadier-general exists in neither the French nor the British army . A French brigade commander , Any combination of army corps makes an army , technically so called . There is nothing sacred about these numbers , but they represent the results of experience ; in other words , organization has been to a certain extent standardized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which three units , beginning with the battalion , go to make the next higher , but it has not been generally adopted . We have now but to fix the numerical strength of the company in order to arrive at that of all the higher units ; the strength of an army , as defined above , is , of course , arbitrary , because it depends upon the number of corps assembled under one and the same commander . We have , therefore , beginning with the company of 25o men , battalions of 1,000 , regiments of 3,000 , brigades of 6,000 , divisions of 12 , , 000 , and corps of 24,0co infantry . The brigade of infantry is the largest unit composed exclusively of troops of that arm ; the infantry division , however , contains the other arms in addition , such as field artillery , cavalry , engineers , in sufficient number to bring up its strength , in round numbers , to 20,000 . The army corps , therefore , a miniature army in itself , totals about 40,000 men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit . It was by armies composed substan-tially of the elements just mentioned ? field armies assisted by aviation ? that the opening campaigns in 1914 were made . The classic idea held full sway , thiiral de brigade , has the rank of our major-general ; a French division commander , general de division , that of our lieutenant-general . In other words , all our brigadiers are junior to the French brigadier , all our division commanders junior to the French division commander . A French brigadier might indeed conceivably be senior to an American major-general with whom he was serving , or by whose side he was serving . In time of peace , with all our generals at home , this state of affairs perhaps makes no difference , though this is doubtful for reasons into which we shall not here enter . But as we have necessarily been guided by European principles of organization in shaping our i forces for the present emergency , so t would seem proper to give our general officers the same grades as those held by their foreign comrades commanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work , and shouldering the same responsibilities . The difference of grade noted may be embarrassing to our officers , and painful to a proper national pride . The remedy lies with Congress , and not with the War Department . infantry armed with the rifle and bayonet , cavalry waiting for its opportunity , artillery , on one side at least , chiefly of the field type . The airmen had come , however , and were taking a hand , and motor transportation , as had been anticipated , was employed from the first . But these two novelties , to call them such , made no fundamental change in the relation of the three arms nor in the character of the actual conflict . That change was to come when the race to the sea had ended in a dead heat , when the two armies first stood face to face on a flankless line , as they have stood ever since , intrenched . Now trenches are not new in the art of war , nor is the device of adding to their defensive qualities by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed in the Civil War , at Charleston and Richmond , as it was by the Spanish at Santiago in 1898 . But no one had ever dreamed of such an extension of trench work as became the rule in 1914 ; no one had ever seen so wide an application made of barbed wire ; never before had machine-guns played so important and decisive a part . These conditions rapidly affected not so much the principles of organization themselves as the relative importance of the units involved . Thus the corps still exists , hut , robbed as it is of its strategic value by its enforced immobility , it has lost importance ; it is more to the point to reckon in divisions . The division , it would appear , is a better unit for trench conditions . A corps , indeed , may now include all the divisions ( even more than three , the greatest number ever contemplated before 1914 ) that hold a given section of the front . Certain it is that many of the elements that used to weld it into a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . have in part lost their meaning ? they have not lost their value , but they now serve a position rather than a body of men . It is of moment to mark the effect of the new mode of warfare , or , rather , of the extension of an old mode , on the arms themselves . In sieges , and we may regard the western front as an elongated siege , only three arms directly count ? the engineers to mine and trench , the artillery tobreak down the defenses and silence the enemy fire , the infantry to assault enemy trenches and breaches when opened . In respect of the artillery , the change that has taken place is no less than an uprooting of old standards . Whereas in elder days , certain numbers of field-guns to each thousand of infantry ( 5 , 6 , 7 , the number was always on the rise ) were accepted as points of departure , these ratios are now meaningless . Each side simply gets up as many guns as possible . It is said that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every two infantrymen ; in short , the artillery has ceased to be an auxiliary arm and has become the head of the corner . The distinction between siege-guns , mortars , fortress , naval , and sea-coast guns , widely differentiated classes five years ago , is wholly broken down , in that all of these guns , of no matter what caliber and class , are used with the army in the field . Only two classes need be recognized now ? field-guns and heavy guns . The artillery strength of an army now includes the heaviest calibers where recently only field types were taken into account . Almost equally radical has been the change of infantry conditions ; it can be stated in one short sentence . In trench warfare the magazine rifle is almost a thing of the past . Its place has been taken by trench weapons , by trench artillery , by the hand grenade , the rifle grenade ? the grenadier has come into his own again . If rifle fire is needed , the automatic rifle , the machine-gun , worked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can one hundred infantrymen each firing his own piece . Hence bomb-throwers , automatic riflemen , machine-gunners , now form the important elements of infantry units . The individual rifle has not entirely lost its usefulness , but even in open warfare will never again have the importance it had before August 4 , 1914 . As compared with the artillery , infantry changes evidently bear more on armament than on organization , but that infantry organization will ultimately be affected , too , there can be no doubt . The cavalry has apparently disappeared from the conflict ; the horse and the trench simply do not fit . It were a grave error , however , to assume that this great arm is done for . If open warfare is ever resumed , the cavalry will again have its day in court . but with a i changed armament . It will in all probability be armed with the bayonet , will carry grenades and a greatly increased number of cartridges per man , will employ a larger number of machine-gun sections , . will be equipped with auto-matic rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herein discussed may be regarded as the result , in their respective spheres , of the doctrine held by the German General Staff as to how war should he made . This doctrine imposes a ' certain procedure , materialized , if necessary , by trench work , in which the trenches shall be suitably covered ; in the actual case , by barbed-wire entanglements animated by machine-guns . The extension of these entanglements and the enormous use made of machine-guns constitute , with aviation , the great features of modern warfare . Barbed wire will stop anything ; if a body of i troops , caught in it , can be taken under fire by machine-guns , it ceases to exist . Hence comes , in part , the development of artillery , to breach the entanglements so that infantry may get through . But , as it is worse than useless to expend ammunition without verifying the accuracy of the practice , so this condition has led to an entire department of aviation work , " spotting " for the batteries . And it is pertinent to recollect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss frontier may be regarded , without any exaggeration , as a continuous bat-tery , served by air squadrons told off for artillery work alone . The foregoing sketch , however imperfect , gives some idea of the work our army will be called upon to do , and by so much suggests after a fashion what principles of organization it must follow . It is not the traditional field army that must be formed , that is forming , but one adjusted to the special warfare of the western front . It will be easy enough to pass to the conditions of open warfare should that be possible or necessary . When Mr. Root was Secretary of War he did two notable things for the army . The first of these was to increase its size fourfold . Although this merely added numbers to the existing strength , increased the number of regiments , it was nevertheless a conspicuous achievement . Conspicuous as it was , however , it fell short of his second achievement ; he created a general staff . For the first time in its history the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to labor continuously upon questions of policy and organization affecting not merely its own small self , but the far greater matter of the nation 's military resources and their conversion into available form when needed . With the vicissitudes of Mr. Root 's creation we are not here concerned ; what does concern us is that by 1917 we had a body of doctrine in respect both of our necessities and of the effort the nation should make to meet these necessities . The doctrine had indeed borne fruit before ? the so-called National Defense Act of 1916 provided for a material increase of the army to be made in five yearly increments , and established ways and means of federalizing the National Guard and of giving the general Government better control of this element of the national defense . This act , with the draft enactment approved May 18 , 1917 , constitutes the basis of our present military establishment . Under these two acts , when war broke out , the four remaining increments of the regular army were anticipated , and that branch of the executive brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step the infantry of the regular army was increased from 30 ' regiments to 64 ; the field artillery from 6 to 21 ; the cavalry from 15 to z5 . The coast artillery was practically doubled , and the engineers got 7 regiments where before they had had none . Corresponding additions were made to the various staff corps . The National Guard , over 400 , - 000 men , was taken into the military service of the United States , and the drafting of a third force of soo , 000 enlisted men with necessary officers was authorized and later carried out . The Army of the United States therefore today consists respectively of the Regular Army , the National Guard , and the drafted men , known as the National Army ; three different elements of differ-ent degrees of training , but all organized and officered in the same manner , and , i so far as experience is concerned , all new to the business of war as now conducted.1 Now let us see what organization has been officially adopted . The smallest unit of infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . one first and three second lieutenants , six officers instead of three as heretofore . If the first captain should be killed or wounded . his place is taken by the second , held in reserve for that reason . Each lieutenant commands a platoon . From all accounts , trench combat is what may be called close work , and this kind of work is essentially the affair of sub-units , especially trained for the par- ticular object in view at a given moment . The organization of the company is made to fit the work . Accordingly , each company has . a headquarters ( 2 officers 1 " The regiments , brigades , and divisions of each arm of the above three groups will be numbered in a separate series and the first number of each series will be as indicated in the following table : * This is to provide for the organization of Cavalry divisions . either mounted or dismounted . " The designations of regiments of the National Guard will show in parenthesis their present State designations , as , for example , th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2d Pa. ) , etc . The designations of regiments of the National Army will show in parenthesis the State from which each organization , or the bulk of it , was drawn , as , for example , th Infantry ( W. Va. ) , th Field Artillery- ( Minn . ) . No parenthesis implies Regular Army , an ordinal number and State abbreviation implies National Guard , a simple State abbreviation implies National Army . " G. 0 . 88 , WAR DEPARTMENT , July rr , rg17. and IS men ) , and each of its four platoons includes one headquarters ( 2 officers and men ) ; one section of bombers and rifle grenadiers ( 22 officers and men ) , two sections of riflemen ( 24 officers and men ) , one section of autoritateic riflemen ( 4 guns , t t officers and men ) ? in all , 59 officers and men . The small number of riflemen proper at once attracts the attention ? that is , of men whose principal weapon is the regulation rifle . Bombers throw the hand grenade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grenade connected by a suitable contrivance with the muzzle of the ordinary rifle from which it is then fired . A part of the equipment consists of the so-called " trench knives . " At first sight it seems horrible to use this weapon , and it is horrible , but no more so , really , than to run a man through with a bayonet , which we all accept as a matter of course . But the bayonet , fixed to its rifle , is not so handy a weapon in trenches , in a maee , as the trench knife . The Roman Empire was carved out with a two-foot sword ! Besides , there is the business of " mopping up " a trench , old in the art of siege warfare , but to-day much more thoroughly done . Special weapons are needed in this business , for the necessity of which the Allies are indebted to their Teutonic adversaries . Four companies form a battalion , and the three battalions bring the number up to 3,000 . To these must be added the machine-gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that our infantry regiment is brought up to over 3,700 men , as follows : Two regiments form the brigade and two brigades the division . The division is organized as follows : Two things should be remarked in this organization : the absence of cavalry , for reasons already made plain , and the great increase in the artillery " strength . Since the front lines of opposing trenches lie close to each other , and are so deep that they cover their occupants against any form of small-arm fire , the trench mortar has been devised ( as the grenade has been resurrected ) to launch a projectile that will clear one 's own parapet , rise in the air and fall into the enemy trench . Trench artillery constitutes a class apart . Equally worthy of notice is the number of machine-guns ; of these , each division will have 416 . Each army corps consists normally of one corps headquarters , three infantry divisions , and army-corps troops . The composition of these latter is not announced , but they include artillery , engineers , sanitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally included in the division , and are used by the corps commander as circumstances may demand . Lastly , each army will consist normally of one army headquarters , three or more army corps , and army troops . These army troops are of the same nature and relation as the corps troops already mentioned . Corps and armies have not yet been formed . Each general officer in command of troops has a staff . That of the brigadier is modest ? two aides-de-camp , lieutenants ( personal staff ) , and a brigade adjutant , captain . The brigade has no administrative affections ; these begin with the division . The division staff , therefore , includes the officers , hereafter not to be above the grade of major , in charge of the various departments concerning the welfare and supply of the men . The composition of the division corps and army staffs has not yet been announced by the War Department , but probably will include , besides the Chief of Staff , Adjutant-General , and Inspector-General , officers in charge of quartermaster , artillery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties . These officers in the corps will have the rank of lieutenant-colonel ; in an army , that of colonel . It may not be amiss to give here the insignia of the various grades of officers in our service . Second lieutenants wear no insignia of rank ; they have a " clean " shoulder - strap and many years in which to fill it with the marks of the successive grades . These are : for a first lieutenant , one silver bar and for a captain two silver bars ; for a major , a gold , for a lieutenant-colonel , a silver oak leaf ; for a colonel a silver eagle . Generals wear stars ? a brigadier one , a major-general two , a lieutenant-general three , a full general two and the coat of arms of the United States . These marks are carried on the shoulder-straps . On full dress and over-coat sleeves , grades are indicated h1 an ornamental knot of black braid , beginning with a single braid for a first lieutenant ; each promotion adds a braid through the rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their overcoats and on full dress coat , a band of gold oak leaves , surmounted by one or two stars ( brigadier and major-general ) . In field dress ( coat ) the only marks are those worn on the shoulder , and an olive-drab band around the cuff , the same for all grades ; in the general staff this hand is black . The various branches of the army are distinguished by certain insignia , worn on the collar . Thus the infantry , the cavalry , and the artillery wear crossed rifles , sabers , and cannon , respectively ; the engineers , a silver castle ; the ordnance , a shell and flame ; the quartermaster corps , a sword and key crossed on a wheel ; the medical corps , a cadu-ceus ; the signal corps , crossed flags ; the Adjutant-General 's department , a shield ; the Inspector-General 's department , a sword and fasces crossed on wreath ; the Judge Advocate-General 's department , a sword and pen crossed on a wreath . Chaplains wear a Latin cross . Grades and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a first , $2,000 . Captains , majors , lieutenant-colonels , and colonels draw , respectively , $2,400 , $3,000 , $3,500 , and i $4.000 . This is the initial or base pay ; it is increased na per cent . for every five years of service , up to 40 per i cent. ; this increase is known in the army as a " fogy . " Lieutenant-colonels and colonels , however , stop at $4,5oo and $5,00o respectively . The pay of a briga-dier is $6,000 , that of a major-general $8,000 respectively . Generals get no " fogys . " Officers receive besides quarters , fuel , and light . The pay of enlisted men depends on their grades , ratings , and length of service ; it is too complicated to set out at length here . A private , however , gets a base pay of $15 a month ; a corporal , $zr or $24 ; a sergeant , $30 or $36 ; first sergeants , i $45 ? all with increases for length of i service . In addition , be it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of course are fed . These rates have been materially increased during the present emergency . " Commencing June first , nineteen hundred and seventeen , and continuing until the termination of the emergency , all enlisted men of the Army of the United States in active service whose base pay does not exceed $2.1 per month shall receive an increase of $15 per month ; those whose base pay is $4 i , an increase of $12 per month ; those whose base pay is $30 , $36 , or $40 , an increase of $8 per month , and those whose base pay is $45 or more , an increase of $6 per month . " We now have to take up certain elements necessarily hitherto omitted in considering our armies from the point of view of field service . An army in a country like ours is directly dependent for its existence upon the legislative branch of the Government . Moreover , its ad-ministration , the way it lives , moves , and has its i being ; the degree and prog-ress of its instruction , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the factors of its well-being ? are matters confided to the special attention of certain units . In other words , there must be a War Department . In this department , the President , constitutional commander-in-chief , is directly represented by the Secretary of War , who is with us , normally , a civilian . His assistant is the Chief of Staff , who has under his orders the General Staff . The Adjutant-General has charge of records , of recruiting , and of personnel ; all correspondence intended for the War Department passes through his hands . Orders are issued by the Secretary of War and signed by the Chief of Staff ; they are made " official " by The Adjutant-General . The Inspector-General extends his inquiry into " every branch of military affairs , except when specially limited in army regulations or in orders . " Questions of law fall to the Judge Advocate-General ; of supply , pay , subsistence , and transportation , to the Quartermaster Corps ; of sanitation and Health of troops , to the Medical Corps ; of engineering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armament , to the Ordnance Department ; of aeronautics and communications , to the Signal Corps . All these corps and departments are represented with troop units in peace and in war . To the foregoing must be added the Coast Artillery Corps , which is not a " department " as are the others , but a purely combatant body of men , represented in the War Department by its chief , who is ex-officio a member of the General Staff . This corps is not usually counted as a part of the " mobile " army , meaning by that term troops that can form regiments , brigades , etc. , for field service . Its special duty is the gun and mine defense of our principal harbors . But in view of the fact that all our hard and fast notions in respect of artillery have been completely upset by European experience , it is clear that a wider field invites the Coast Artillery than mere service behind fixed guns in expectation of a naval enemy . It counts and must count as part of our effectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aeronautical branch of the army literally spreads its wings . An army not provided with air-service is beaten before it has fired a single shot . It may not even get up to a point where a shot could be usefully fired . This particular branch of armed energy , intrusted as already said to the Signal Corps , is in process of development . We must have spotting planes , else our artillery fire were vain ; combat planes , else our spotters and photographers may not be able to work ; reconnaissance planes , else the enemy may spring a surprise on us . Aviation has dissipated the " fog of war " ; no longer is a general required to guess what " is on the other side of the hill . " The measure of the importance of aeronautics , of aviation particularly , is furnished by the grant of $640,000,000 to the Signal Corps to develop this department of military activity . This sum is none too great ; no layman can realize the amount of work to be done by us under this head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extended to include the whole army . We have adopted a thoroughly good organization , but with the vast majority of our officers and men new to the business , with equipment and . material as yet lacking , an infinitude of labor lies before us . It is too early as yet to say what effect this new enterprise of ours , a real war against a powerful enemy overseas , will have upon our national destinies . But certainly it is not too early to comment on the fact that we , a peace-loving , anti-military people , have accepted al-most without protest the principle of the draft . It is not right , as a matter of policy , that our armed forces to-day should come from three distinct groups . Once under fire , these will become homogeneous , but homogeneity of origin would have been a valuable asset . If assured of it in the future , many difficulties will disappear ; should our policies make the maintenance of armed forces a necessity , our army will then be a real United States Army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the democratic conception of universal and obligatory service .
