Frank C. Pa 's colored illustrations for " The Pilgrim 's Progress " vary a good deal in excellence The picture , for instance , of Christian Warning Sloth , Simple , and Presumption , is full of character and is pleasant to the eye ; whereas The Destruction of Doubting Castle is in a tint to make the eye wince On the whole , the illustrations will aid in a proper manner the imagination of the young reader Both pilgrimages are given in the text , which is printed , as it should be , in modern spelling and punctuation .

( Doran , $5 net ) Whether for copyright reasons or from critical choice , the quarto volume of " Poems by Christina Rossetti " does not contain all the verse published by her brother in the last complete edition . This is altogether an advantage , for Christina wrote too much and too fluently , and a considerable part of her posthumous verse ought never to have been printed . Mrs Meynell , than whom no one is better qualified for this particular task , contributes an Introduction to the present edition There is , for instance , real insight in these few sentences : Her poetry is , in a word , true poetry as gold leaf is gold ; and sometimes her poems are , as it were , a mere film of poetry .

In " The Convent Threshold " there is , I think , more passion than in any other poem written by a woman . In this respect Christina Rossetti surpasses Elizabeth Barrett Browning , abundant as was the earlier poet , and few and reluctant as are here the words of the later . Of the illustrations , many of them in color , furnished by Florence Harrison , some of them  --  those , for instance , for the " Goblin Market " ? fit the theme very well . But such a picture as that for " Eve " would have shocked the poet and mars the pleasure of the reader .

Mr. Fletcher 's pictures in black and white vary singularly in manner and quality . In some , e. g. , the Porch of St. Mary the Virgin , Oxford , which forms the frontispiece , he has reproduced the mellow effect of age that is characteristic of the Oxford architecture ; others , e. g , the Tower of Magdalen College from the Bridge , are hard and lacking in atmosphere .

Railway Problems in the Light of European Experience : or , Government Regulation vs . Government Operation of Railways . By Carl S. Vrooman . New York : Henry Frowde. $2 net . Government Ownership of Railways , Considered as the Next Great Step in American Progress . By Anthony Van Wagenen . New York ? G. P. Putnam 's Sons . $1.25 net . Railroad Administration By Ray Morris . New York : D. Appleton &; Co. $2 net . Whatever one may think of the views expressed by Mr. Vrooman , one is likely , having taken up his book , to read it to the end . For it is a dispassionate and painstaking account of the experience of - various countries with-the problems of government regulation or ownership , and withal so entertaining that the views expressed appear not merely plausible , but well-nigh convincing . To be sure , . it exploits a thesis . The author is a firm believer in the ultimate nationalization of the railways of the United States . Rather than have this policy come upon us suddenly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case with Italy , we should anticipate the future by devising as efficient a system of regulation as possible . If such a system of control should prove entirely successful , we should have accomplished what no other nation has yet done ; if it should fail , the next step would be government owner opinion , for after a certain point is reached any increase in regulation becomes inelastic , cumbersome , and burdensome to the public and the carriers . Regulation can be-nothing but a phase in the education of the nation . " The railways of the country to-day are being operated under a suspended sentence of nationalization . " With this underlying conviction , Mr. Vrooman aims to demonstrate that government ownership , if brought about in a conservative manner , is not so dangerous as most of us believe . His method of treatment is to take up one problem after another , and show how it has been met in various countries under the differing conditions of government and corporate management . Although he properly rejects as unscientific any attempt to decide the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the method he adopts , which compares government-owned with private railways in the same country , is likewise inconclusive . For in any country in which the policy of government ownership predominates , private railways are at such a disadvantage , and have so little incentive to efficiency , that they can hardly be accepted as fair examples of the results of private initiative . One comparison he does make which appears to have real validity  --  that between the French Northern , a private road , and the Belgium system ; but here he is under some difficulty to sustain his thesis that the government-owned road is , all things considered , the more beneficial to the public . Mr. Vrooman very properly selects our accident record as one of the weak spots in American railway management , yet a study of English statistics makes it evident that reform may be brought about without nationalization . His discussion of the spoils system in relation to government ownership is hardly convincing to an American , for he confines himself to a description of the civil service in Belgium , Switzerland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the thought of injecting a million railway employees into the civil service of the United States . Nor does he dispose satisfactorily of the most potent argument against the European system  --  its lack of elasticity in meeting the requirements Of the shipping community . In spite of occasional lapses into unwarranted denunciation , and in spite of the use at times of statistical data in such manner as to create a false impression , Mr. Vrooman 's presentation of the case is a fair one from his point of view . But his final conclusion puts the whole question beyond the reach of argument , for he insists that , cost what it may in time or money , nationalization is a luxury that no nation can afford to be without  --  which is , of course , a matMr . Van Wagenen 's book is of quite a different stamp . He would have government ownership at once . Four-fifths of the nations of the world have adopted it , and cowardice alone prevents us from following in their footsteps . His book contains much more generalization than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reckless in the use of statistics , and frequently inconsistent in statement . One or two examples will suffice . To demonstrate the growth in railway casualities , he uses the year 1907 , in which 610 passengers were killed . Yet that year was an unusual one , in which the number killed was fourteen per cent higher than the next highest year for which statistics are available , and 75 per cent . above the average for the ten years which he is considering . His statement that in round numbers , the railways kill annually 12,000 persons is quite erroneous , for , although the number killed , including trespassers and all , was 11,839 in the unusual year 1907 , this figure has never been equalled before or since , and the average number killed between 1888 and 1909 was a little less than 8,000 . The case is bad enough without exaggeration When arguing for a reduction in rates , the author calls attention to the fact that rebates have to a great extent been abolished , but in another connection he contends that railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay in rebates . Dividends are paid on " billions of watered stock " by railways whose crude methods are the " sorry misfit of the times , " and this utterly demoralized system of railways is contrasted with the superb management by the Government of our postal system and rural free delivery ! The reason that we entered upon government ? regulation , rather than ownership a quarter of a century ago was because the " men who look after the railway interests in the Congress of the United States " procured the passage of the Interstate Commerce act , and turned public attention away from government ownership . Among those who like this form of attack , the book may receive a welcome , but among thinking men , it will find few sympathetic readers and no converts . Mr. Van Wagenen declares in his preface that he approached the publication of his book with much hesitation , and that he offered his contribution only because no one else had presented this side of the question . After reading it , one wonders whether his excuse was altogether sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that government ownership is a question of principle . The history of the movement demonstrates indisputably that it is merely a question of expediency , and , for the present at least , the people of the United States do not regard railway nationalization as expedient . Mr. Morris 's book on " Railroad Administration " has little to do with problems of regulation , but is rather a consideration of the railway as a working machine . Yet mention of it in this connection is not out of place , for in many ways its clear analysis of railway methods is an answer to the charges so carelessly made by Mr. Van Wagenen . When one follows in detail the extraordinary organization which has been built up to do the work of transportation , the efforts now making to improve the physical conditions of the properties , and the various methods of cost-keeping and of statistical comparison that have been devised to promote efficiency of operation , and then compares the conduct of this industry with that of a government bureau or investigating commission , with its wasteful use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into contact with governmental methods in this country  --  one is amazed to find a writer like Van Wagenen advocating government ownership because of our " crude , disorganized , unscientific system of railways . " A careful reading of Mr. Morris 's chapter on Control through - Statistics , one of the best in the book , should effectually dispose of that indictment . The book is evidently intended as a manual for those who are engaged in railway service or who desire to enter it . It is a weakness of present day railway organization that the rank and fil6 know only the work of their own department , and are almost entirely ignorant of the industry as a whole . This volume should give them the point of view from which they will be able to correlate their duties with those of their fellows in the organization of which they are a part . Largely of a descriptive character , the treatise opens with a chapter on the physical and financial beginnings of a railway , and continues with discussions of railway organization on large and small roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Germany , Italy , and India . In another chapter , that on financial organization , attention is given to the various kinds of securities issued . The author does not believe in the control of capitalization , and maintains that capitalization and rates have no relation to one another . Commissions , he thinks , are not likely to accomplish any permanent useful effects , and the result of endowing them with rate-making power will be to keep rates at a higher level than they would be if unregulated . The only beneficial effect of such bodies is in their function as safety-valves for popular indignation . While we may not agree with this somewhat extreme position , we can endorse the author 's contention that the recent popular uprising against the railways was largely due to railway blundering , and that a more consistent effort to conciliate , rather than antagonize , would do much to remove the source of popular discontent . The volume is supplied with many charts , illustrating various forms of railway organization . CURRENT FICTION . John Winterbourne 's Faintly . By Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's world is inexhaustibly peopled with original characters which defy classification under any ordinary rules . From simple to subtle they range , but perhaps her , forte is the exposition of the subtle in the seeming simple . No person is too insignificant outwardly to take a part in her drama , and the part is always a complex one because every human being is a complicated being . The sweeping of a hearth , the polishing of a table , the caprice of a child , the mood of a woman , are affairs of portent . Events are seldom exciting , yet one reads with almost gasping interest , , breathing an air thick with the weight of small but immensely significant affairs . Her characters often are not in the least like any whom one has met , but they move with an authority no more to be disputed than that of the creatures of mythology . There is , indeed , not a little of the mythological in Miss Brown 's New Englander .

Little happens throughout the story that is not homely , but the way in which it happens gives it profound and universal meaning . No need to sketch the plot . It deals with nothing more thrilling outwardly than domestic incompatibilities and the patenting of an ear-trumpet . But to the inner man it makes fervent appeal with its insight into human relations and its silent plea for right living and for strict attention to one 's " job , " however little time it leaves one for reading Theocritus .

This intellectual unconventionality reappears in her unqualified frankness . But , however strange , she is never unreal . Exalted happiness and unfathomable bitterness find expression in words and actions that are consonant with her direct , elemental nature .

Baron von Ottringel , major of a Prussian artillery regiment , conceives the idea of celebrating by a journey the twenty-fifth anniversary of his marriage . True , his silver-wedding wife has been dead for some years , but the institution has persisted with a negligible twelve months ' forced interruption . Surely the Major was right in his reply to the later wife who questioned its being " their " silver-wedding . He tells the tale himself : " Dear wife , " I retorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mine , and what is mine is also by law yours , and that , therefore , without the least admissible logical doubt , it is yours . " The trip leads the Baron and his wife with a few friends to " caravaning " in England .

Instead of this , it is a protracted , unconscious confession of unbroken caddishness from one properly characterized by a fellow camper as " a very grievous bounder . " He - is insufferable in every direction ; conaPiauously so in all that concerns the differences between his own country and England ; most of all in the relation of any Prussian husband to any wife .

The Court of Lucifer . By Nathan Gallizier . Boston : L. C. Page &; Co . Mr. Gallizier 's picture of the Rome of the Borgias is huge , confused , and hideous . All the notorious crimes of Cesare Borgia , all the licentious excesses and voluptuous festivities of the papal court , all the turbulent political and military activities of sixteenth-century Italy , though resolutely pressed clown and shaken together , still amount to rather more than a fair bookful . The author finds his pretext for this exhibition of horrors in vindicating the character of the maligned Lucrezia , enlarging and wresting to this purpose an authentically recorded incident . In negotiating the fifth marriage of his fair daughter , Pope Alexander VI met with considerable resistance on the part of the prospective bridegroom , Alfonso of Este , whose aversion had been aroused by Lucrezia 's evil reputation and the fate of her former husbands . Only when she reached Castle Bentivoglio , the last stage of her nuptial progress from Rome to Ferrara , did he visit her  --  in disguise ? then seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reluctance seems to have been immediately and permanently dispelled , and his subsequently justified faith in the lady 's innocence established . In the present version Alfonso is represented as coming to Rome in the guise of a Knight Hospitaller ( there is also a tournament reminiscent of Ivanhoe ) to investigate for himself the foundation of Lucrezia 's ill-fame . Through an incredible profusion of nocturnal adventure in grotto , grove . subterranean passage , dungeon , banquet hall , catacombs , deserted convent , and lady 's bow . er , he arrives at an impassioned conviction of Lucrezia 's spotless innocence , and a complete insight into the monstrous machinations of her fell brother , Cesare . The Scourge By Warrington Dawson . New York : Small , Maynard &; Co . A powerfully written story of the South during the Reconstruction period .

Even then he does not try to change except by giving up the fortune his father has left , conditional on his not marrying . With all his lack of breeding he manages to leave a powerful impression , while the slim , well-bred heroine fades into misty lines . The book is well written , with the exception of occasional dialogues between the heroine and the mother , but these are not frequent . The Prodigal Pro Tem . By Frederick Orin Bartlett . Boston : Small , Maynard &; Co . Mr. Bartlett has written a diverting and somewhat original tale , with a fair measure of bright dialogue . The scene is laid in the Catskills and concerns a woman and two men , one of whom is an artist , the other a musician . To save a blind man 's life and reason the artist plays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and the complications that ensue are numerous and humorously related . The author 's characters act like human beings , and , in spite of her sharp tongue , one can not help liking Aunt Philomela and understanding how Eleanor , with her charming manner , proved to be an inspiration both to the artist who longed to paint her , and to the musician who felt that only with her could he write his best songs and symphonies . It is a book one finishes with regret , for it contains nothing disagreeable and much to amuse . A GREAT PUBLISHER . Life and Letters of Alexander Macmil- lan . By Charles L Graves .

They had , of course , being Scots , a remarkable mother . " My mother , " wrote Alexander to Guizot , " was a woman of very devout nature and habits , whose daily life was , as I believe , lived as in the conscious presence of God . She had a very noble , sweet nature , and a certain serenity and sweetness of mind that I have hardly ever met with in any other human being " Amid the drudgery of bringing up a numerous family with scanty means , she found time to read . There is a tradition that a visitor calling on her in her old age found her in bed with her black mutch on her head , reading Cary 's Dante . The excellent father , as is also common in remarkable Scotch families , occupied the humble subsidiary position of St. Joseph . " From her , " wrote Daniel , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's meagre schooling ceased when he was fifteen . From that time , he earned his own living , such as it was , and , in 1843 , when he was twenty-five years old , he formed a partnership with his brother Daniel , and opened the retail book-shop in Cambridge at No. 1 Trinity Street , which presently became famous as a kind of literary centre for the university . Dr. Sebastian Evans , who was an undergraduate of Emmanuel College in the early fifties , gives a picture of Alexander Macmillan 's relations with the students : During my undergraduateship at Emmanuel not a single one of my supposed instructors , from first to last , ever betrayed the faintest indication of any interest in me personally . . . . The men of light and leading in the college were few , and , so far as the ordinary undergraduates were concerned , they neither lighted nor led . . . Most of the students socially belonging to the middle class went up to college as a necessary preliminary to entering holy orders It was among these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having been at once most powerfully and most beneficially exercised . Here was a born teacher and preacher about a dozen years older than themselves , a man of striking and varied gifts , of shrewd insight and large experience , always sympathetically interested in young men at the outset of life who came to him for intellectual guidance and help . . . . For many a year after I had left Cambridge , in listening to a preacher unknown to me , his use of some tell-tale catch-word or turn of thought would identify him to me as having at some time or other come under Macmillan 's influence , and more than once or twice I was afterwards able to verify my inference . . . The gap left open between teachers and taught at Cambridge was filled only by a Scot , not in holy orders and in no way connected with the educational arrangements of the university . The purchase of the Cambridge shop was made possible by a loan of 500 from Afandeacon Hare , made at Hare 's own instance . Daniel Macmillan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1840 , and had written to the author to express his interest . Hare was impressed by his admirer 's intelligence and not only helped to set him up in business , but introduced him to Maurice . When the brothers ventured into publishing a few years later , Maurice became one of their earliest and most valuable authors , valuable not only for the influence of his own books and the reputation they brought the firm , but for his friendly service in introducing other authors , of whom Kingsley was probably the chief . In 1862 , J. R. Green wrote to a friend , " Pray introduce me to Macmillan , if such a thing be possible . Among the Kingsley and Stanley set , Macmillan is the pet publisher of the day . " From this time on , the Macmillan lists and Alexander 's letters reflect more and more the history of Victorian ideas from 1860 to 1390 Among the books of these years bearing the firm 's imprint may be cited Huxley 's " Man 's Place in Nature , " Freeman 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman Empire , " Matthew Arnold 's " Essays in Criticism , " Sir William Thompson 's " Constitution of Matter , " " Ecce Homo , " " John Inglesant , " " Alice in Wonderland , " and the two series , " English Men of Letters , " and " The Golden Treasury . " As a Scot , Macmillan was a theologian . The movement that brought about the Abolition of Religious Tests in 1871 was largely conducted by his friends , and it interested him keenly in all its aspects . The publication of " Essays and Reviews " and the adventures of Bishop Colenso inspire some of his most animated letters . But if theology was his favorite pastime , he had also a profound and active religion , exerting itself in constant acts of kindliness and public spirit . The professional correspondence and decisions of Alexander Macmillan give evidence of a high view of the publisher 's responsibility . His conscience went into his work . He refused certain books , for which there was a fair prospect of profit , because he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not mean that he was unwilling to associate his imprint with books with which he did not agree . He held to his opinions , it is true , with Scotch tenacity , but he was ready to publish a book that traversed them , if he believed it honestly written and of a kind to bring any real contribution to the subject .

Alexander Macmillan died in 1896 , having survived his brother Daniel by thirty-nine years . It appears that of the brothers , Daniel had the larger imagination and the larger ambition ; while he lived he was the leader . But the achievements of the house after his death until 1896 are due to Alexander alone . It is probable that the history of publishing gives no parallel instance of so extended and important a development of a publishing house in the same space of time . It is interesting to note , in view of Macmillan 's great financial success , that his tendency seems always to have been towards books likely to prove of permanent interest , rather than to " books of the season . " English Literature During the Lifetime of Shakespeare . By Felix E. Schelling , New York- Henry Holt &; Co. $2.50 net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drama , " one knows what to expect of him in literary history . By way of equipment : a style frequently overcharged with facts , but never languid , digestion , of the results of recent scholarship , fresh and wide contact with the original material , enthusiasm for his subject , and an enlightened orthodoxy in his judgments By way of method : a rearrangement of the facts of literary , history , so as to emphasize the existence of schools , the character of literary movements , and the development of specific literary kinds . - In a. brief preface Professor Schelling speaks a word in behalf of his method . " Until the history of literature cuts loose , " he says , " from the tyranny of biography , as history at large has long since cut loose , little progress can be made toward the realization of the higher aims of literary study . " He enters , too , a timely protest against the trivial and frivolous search for sources as ends in themselves . And he suggests with rare common-sense certain limits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist as he does by precept and example that the " discoveries " of our solemn investigators are insignificant till they have been related by some mind with a talent for synthesis to the larger issues of literary study , is to let light into a very dark place . Chief among the larger issues , Professor Schelling places the recognition of those forces " by which even the greatest man becomes the product of his age . " This arouses expectation . We look about for the " formula " that explains the Age of Shakespeare  --  indication of the forces of which Spenser and Jonson . and Webster are the perplexingly divergent resultants . But Professor Schelling is not much enticed by the dangerous and difficult task of a fundamental unification . It is not the homogeneity , but the extreme diversity of Elizabethan literature that impresses him . He sees the movment of the times , not in the form of a great wave , but as a succession of little waves , broken up by cross-winds and currents . And the primary effect of his book is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period . The striking merit of his treatment is his ability  --  if we may borrow a phrase from dramatic criticism  --  to handle elaborate characterization within a highly complex plot . Though he constantly subordinates the individual to the type and its tendencies , he does not blur the outlines of the great personalities . He makes Shakespeare dominate the book , and yet exhibits him as the product and the producer of the romantic tradition . He portrays Jonson with equal distinctness at the centre of the classical reaction . He differentiates the vernacular from the new cultivated prose fathered by Lyly , and that , in turn , from the reformed prose of Sidney . He traces the Petrarchian stream of poetry to the point where it is traversed by the subtle imagination of Donne . Everywhere he attempts to see to it that his accumulated masses of detail shall not remain inert , but perform their function in the characterization of their species We may not entirely agree with Professor Schelling as to the " higher aims " of literary study . We may incline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to some conclusion as to what is permanently great , valuable , and beautiful ? " the divine consideration of what may be , and should be " In these sterner offices of criticism , he is occasionally somewhat reluctant and indecisive . He does not , for example , pronounce judgment on the central issue between Jon-son and Shakespeare , between Elizabethan romanticism and neo-classicism . Indeed , such an utterance as this leads one to suspect that he has not clearly defined the issue " Not less eager Dec. 8 , Two in the pursuit of beauty than the Spenserian , the manner of Jonson seeks to realize her perfections by means of constructive excellence , not by entranced passion . " As a matter of fact , it was not merely another means of realizing beauty that Jenson adopted ; - it was another beauty that he sought . Again , Professor Schelling speaks of those laborious failures , " Sejanus " and " Cataline , " as " splendid examples of Jon-son 's power practically to apply his just and reasonable classical theories about tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make the matter plainer to call these two plays striking evidence that Jonson was a modern man , that he had turned his back upon the ideal beauty and terror of Elizabethan romanticism , that he alone , therefore , among dramatists of his rank in the period , was unable to write anything worthy the name of tragedy . The obscurer form of speech , however , is natural enough to one who apprpaches literature from the scientific-historical point of view . And when all is said , the praise to which Professor Schelling aspires he indubitably deserves . He has written the literary history of a great age with open and disinterested mind . He has cut loose from the " tyranny of biography , " and has related his facts to what is at least one of the higher aims of literary study . It is not too much to say that no other book of similar compass presents so fully and organically the complex literary activities of Englishmen from the birth to the death of Shakespeare . The Lady : Studies of Certain Significant Phases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Sturgis &; Walton Co. $2.50 net . Mr. Garrod , in his brilliant little book , " The Religion of All Good Men , " sought , not long since , to prove , with much plausibility , that the gentleman was , a wholly modern institution , that his sole effective religion  --  that of honor  --  was neither Christian , Greek , Roman , nor Hebraic , but Teutonic , in its origin , and that , as a corollary , there is no example of the gentleman in history until he was developed by the social system and ideals of the Middle Ages . In the same way , it may be argued that the lady was likewise an exclusively medieval product , the result of a special sentiment for womanhood that finds no counterpart in ancient societies . Certainly the word " lady " has definite , if somewhat indefinable associations that render insufficient and unsatisfactory Mrs. Putnam/s practical and provisional description of her as merely " the female of the favored social class . " The conception and status of the lady have , obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions of chivalry have never failed to color both , and to make of her something wholly different from any precedent feminine type . Mrs. Putnam herself offers an excellent example of this in her admirable chapter on The Lady of the Slave States , where she compares the woman of the South , in her domestic employments and lack of personal freedom , with the Greek woman of the age of Pericles . The parallel is very close , but the author herself notes the point of departure when she says of the latter : No sentiment had arisen in her day to mask the issue If she was constrained to an exacting profession , no one obscured the fact by calling her a. queen , or with a much stronger connotation of leisure , an angel . In the case of the lady of the plantation we are misled by her husband 's vocabulary , which is that of the twelfth century . It is hard to realize that he could combine the manner and phrases of the minnesinger with the practice of the ancient Athenian . But one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two such alien types as the Greek housewife and the Roman matron , for the sake of the delightful chapters in which Mrs. Putnam portrays their physiognomy , though these are in no wise superior to the subsequent chapters which treat of The Lady Abbess , The Lady of the Castle , The Lady of the Renaissance , The Lady of the Salon , The Lady of the Blue Stockings , and The Lady of the Slave States . In one place , Mrs. Putnam speaks of the lady 's " usually light equipment of learning " as " a positive advantage to her in conversation , " and remarks that " the intellectual irresponsibility which she enjoys by consent , enables her to be paradoxical without losing credit and flippant without giving pain . " Her own play of paradox , epigram , and delicate raillery shows how much these qualities can please and stimulate from the pen of a woman , when learning and intellectual responsibility to facts are patent at every point . She has the imaginative gift of seeing things in their remote relations , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social significance of the staircase that Madame de Rambouillet built at the corner of her house , instead of at the centre according to the custom of her contemporaries , and find in it the seed whence sprang the salon of the eighteenth century . She perceives that the insurgent Germanic lady of the dark ages found her freedom in a cloister , and thus decides that " the lady abbess is in some sort the descendant of the Amazon . " She divines , even if she can not plumb , the law of dress which associates far distant ages of civilization , as in the case of the " farthingale . " Thus , " ladies so different in temperament as Madame de Maintenon anda , deeper some obscure phrase of racial or social psychology . Speaking of the fear in which the Southern gentleman lived , and which made isolation from the intellectual currents of the age his sole safeguard , she says : The planter was forced to build his moral house for defence , as the baron of the twelfth century was forced to build his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements of fortification . The history of the Middle Ages-is largely a history of the growth of walls induced by the improvements in the machinery of assault So is the history of the slaveholding South . As the castellan developed his means of defence from the simple wall and tower to the mathematical complexity of the twelfth-century fortress , so the planter developed his moral position , as the attack became more systematic , and , every addition to his defences meant increased isolation . But one could quote thus from nearly every page of this book , where there i some unexpected turn of phrase or of thought to surprise the reader and to induce reflection . The only quality which one misses is , on the whole , . sentiment . The modern woman , eager for the enfranchisement of her sex from a man-made and a man-governed world , is apt to show impatience to-day with the ideal of the lady which so clearly reflects raasculine ? influences and aspirations , and to dismiss her as a Parasite . A sense of her economic uselessness interferes with Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would not with that of a man writing on the same theme ; and a thoroughly feminine realism dispels much of the romance that , for the male mind , would prolong its enchantments , even in the face of such bare facts as she adduces to prove that the life of the Lady of the Castle was hard and monotonous , and that the refinements of the Renaissance concealed the decay of cleanliness . But so natural and unavoidable a limitation of sympathy scarcely diminishes the ' fascination of-the work , or prevents its being a most charming and graceful contribution to , American literary scholarship . Studies in Spiritism . By Amy E. Tanner . New York : D. Appleton &; Co. $2.50 net . The aim of this book is to analyze thoroughly the evidence for spirit communication and telepathy , test it rigorously and scientifically , and see whether the really substantiated facts are best accounted for on a spiritistic or a naturalistic hypothesis . The book is the outcome of a long and systematic investigation carried on by Dr. G. Stanley Hall and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of the work is written by Miss Tanner , the influence of Dr. Hall is evident , and he concurs in the conclusions arrived at . The Introduction , moreover , and one of the chapters are written by him . It is probably advantageous for the influence of the book that Dr. Hall did not write the whole of it , for his Introduction is colored by a sarcastic tone and an evident animus which would have detracted considerably from the scientific value of the result . In fact , he says of himself : " Indeed , it is an utter psychological impossibility for me to treat this subject seriously . " Fortunately , Miss Tanner is capable of treating her subject seriously . The outcome of ' Dr. Tanner 's investigation is completely to discredit the oft-repeated claim that psychical research has demonstrated the survival of bodily death . She makes thorough work of it . Spirit communication , " physical phenomena , " telepathy , and Professor Hyslop are all weighed in the balance and found wanting . Most of the discussion centres , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of her " controls " are analyzed , and the messages which have come through her are systematically sifted . The results of her earlier sittings are first of all examined for their evidential value . All messages whose content was already known to the sitter Dr. Tanner throws out of consideration , because of the possibility ( much greater than one might at first suppose ) that the sitter unconsciously aided the medium . A long and careful chapter is devoted to the " test cases " ( in which the content of the message was unknown to the sitter ) , and the conclusion reached is as follows : Approximately 110 facts in twenty years have been given which the sitter did not know and which were true . But many of these facts are easily explicable as infer . ences or guesses , or are so vague as to have little or no value , while the few striking coincidences are so few that it does not seem to be stretching tolerance if we frankly leave them unexplained or refer them to inferences or references in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of " cross-correspondencies " is then studied at greater length , and each of the more important cases considered by itself and explained as due to natural causes or to possible unrecorded influences . It must here be admitted that Dr. Tanner leans pretty heavily on the possibility of a faulty record ; and also that , while she evidently tries always to be fair , her presentation of some of the cases makes them appear less striking than they really are . This is particularly true of the famous airg.6s oi ) pavas. cross-correspondence . A comparison of Dr. Tanner 's account with the original as given by Mr. Piddington ( P. S. P. R. , Vol . XXII , pp. 107-172 ) shows that , through lack of space , some rather suggestive details have been omitted ; and , moreover , the naturalistic explanation proposed is at best unconvincing . Dr. Hall and Dr. Tanner had six sittings of their own with Mrs Piper , and these are reported at length . The chief value of this report is the light it throws on the psychical relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gives of their extreme suggestibility and the way they " fish " for cues and act on any hint given by the sitter . Dr. Hall invented several mythical characters , whereupon " Hodgson " swallowed the whole bait , recognized every one suggested whether real or purely fictitious , and reported them all as present in the spirit world . It was largely by this first-hand experience with Mrs. Piper that the investigators were enabled to work out in detail their explanation of the phenomena of mediunaship ; which is , in brief , that the controls are secondary personalities of the medium , bearing much the same relationship to her normal self that " Sally " in Dr. Prince 's case bore to the real Miss Beauchamp The fact that Mrs. Piper 's secondary personalities impersonate departed spirits is to be accounted for by the suggestions tending in that direction given them by the sitters . " The controls themselves have thus been given a spiritistic education for over twenty years in all , so that whatever they were in the beginning , they are now thoroughly dyed-in-the-wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and untrained conscious-messes , tends to believe that any vivid idea is true , does not clearly distinguish between ideas and reality , and so confuses them in his assertions about them " And , in conclusion , Dr. Tanner says : - The entire content of the Piper messages can be referred ( 1 ) to the ordinary laws of the mind as seen in apperception , inference , etc , ( 2 ) to a greatly heightened suggestibility , ( 3 ) to a modicum necessarily unexplained because of imperfect records After finishing spirit communication , Dr Tanner proceeds to sift the evidence for telepathy . And here it must be said her work is less convincing . She proves , indeed , conclusively how weak is much of the so-called evidence for thought-transference ; and her keen analysis of even the best reported cases shows , as a rule , that the conditions were indecisive or the facts themselves uncertain . But a residuum of the evidence much too large to be put down as mere coincidence remains , if we trust the records ; so that recourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reports as we have them  --  the author 's ultimate resource in all cases of uncertainty . There is , no doubt , considerable justification for this course , but it can be over-done . It is rather too easy , and Miss Tanner 's repeated appeal to it when in difficulty constitutes , perhaps , the weakest part of her book and does more than anything else to invalidate her rather sweeping conclusions . For certainly the possibility of telepathy and even of spirit communication has not been disproved by this book . Both are still possible hypotheses , and subjects of such enormous human interest should certainly continue to be investigated  --  in spite of Dr. Tanner 's critique and Dr. Hall 's sarcasm . Still it must be said that this book has shown very plainly that if the spiritistic hypothesis is possible , there is as yet very little reason for thinking it true . And with the highly colored presentations of the results of psychical research which are read with such avidity in our popular magazines , it is high time that some one should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , in fact , who is interested in this question can afford not to read Miss Tanner 's work . And while , perhaps , there is still hope ior the spirit hypothesis , our author has succeeded so well in battering down its supposed demonstration which has taken so many laborious years to build up , that the unlucky spiritualists  --  on both sides of the Great Divide  --  are in the pathetic predicament of having pretty much all their work to do over again .

The human qualities of Mark Twain , " the characteristically American humor , " make this author an educational necessity . The book is judiciously edited .

They are taken from the old French , with modifications where it was thought best . An introduction explains the " Cabinet des Fdes , " as well as the career of Perrault . It also defends Edmund Dulac 's adherence , in his exquisite pictures painted for this edition , to the spirit of an age that fostered the fairy tale in the court as well as in the private salon . The work shows taste throughout , though in its physical proportions it is beyond the grasp of the average buyer . Mrs. E.

This introduction is well worth reading , and , as usual , the book itself is printed in elaborate and pleasing fashion . In this respect it is better than " The Fairy Ring " ( Doubleday ) , under the editorial supervision of Kate Douglas Wig-gin and Nora Archibald Smith , though this particular collection appears to be equally inclusive in its territorial range , embracing " Tom Thumb , " " Jack the Giant-Killer , " " Riquet with the Tuft , " as well as others quite as famous , and perhaps new to the present generations . To offset this , we are glad to mention Miss Sowerby 's book of " Grimm " ( Duffield ) , which is agreeably illustrated by her sister . " Folk Tales Every Child Should Know " ( Doubleday ) belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite haphazard in its choice . This particular volume is edited by Hamilton Wright Mabie , who tells children in a condescending manner the exact value of stories which are made by the people and perpetuated from campfire to camp-fire . The sources are only occasionally given . Antiquarians would be more interested in some of this primitive material than young readers would be " The Scottish Fairy Book " ( Stokes ) , by Elizabeth W. Grierson , is a fit companion for the " Welsh Fairy Book , " published last year . The stories retain the flavor of the country , some of them being dark and gloomy , others delicate in grace and beauty . The cover design might be better , and the red splashed upon every page is dazzling and confusing .

This year 's editions are adequate both in type and illustration The black and white sketches are more successful than the color-pages , because the latter have been detracted from by ridiculous borderS which have no bearing and are not necessary . Every one should welcome Cooper 's " The Last of the Mohicans " ( Holt ) , in an excellent new form , the type being agreeable and the drawings for the chapter headings of striking quality . The illustrative work is by E Boyd Smith , an artist who believes in using faint color to produce atmospheric effect It is to be hoped that the publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Appletons are issuing an abridgment of stories by Scott . This method is not a safe one and is always open to justifiable criticism . Again we repeat what has been said before in these columns ? What is needed is an edition of Scott published in a form similar to the Henty books , with no omissions , but with all prefaces thrown into appendices . The stories should be copiously illustrated , much in the way in which the Holts have published their first volume of Cooper There is no doubt in the minds of many specialists on children 's literature that Wyss 's " The Swiss Family Robinson " ( Dutton ) is more popular than Defoe 's " Robinson Crusoe " ( Houghton ) ; the generous large editions , with clean type , are very desirable , but most of us have read these adventures in thick books with fine type and with line borders around the page The Dutton volume of " The Swiss Family Robinson " has nowhere mentioned the author 's name The artist figures on the cover : Charles Folkard  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate and grotesque . The reprints show thought and feeling on the part of the publishers Dainty in outward form , and assuredly worthy in content , are two old favorites by Juliana Horatio , Ewing , " We and the World " ( Bell ) and " The Brownies and Other Tales " ( Bell ) . The illustrations are spirited , imaginative , and often old-fashioned in touch . This is preferable , we feel , to the literalness and smoothness of the color work by Maria L. Kirk for Lippincott 's estimable holiday editions of juvenile classics Not that Miss Kirk is devoid of ability , but it is inspiration too well governed and mannered . She has illustrated Jean Ingelow 's well-known and ever-popular " Mopsa the Fairy " and Louise de la Rarade 's " Bimbi .

We know this artist 's studies , and , while we like his present examples , we can imagine him dissatisfied with the manner of reproduction ; . the pages are so dark that all feeling is lost in shadow , a mistake we know that was not perpetrated in the originals . Most of the large II . books for children are of the same character as last year ; in fact , they are a continuation . We expect to find " Chatterbox " ( Dana Estes ) , indeed , Christmas would not be Christmas without it . " Caldwell 's Boys and Girls at Home " ( Caldwell ) , consists of a collection of stories and verses from various pens , copiously pictured in lines and over brilliant color .

Here are twelve illustrations , and twenty-four text pictures Distinctive drawings would include Jessie Willcox Smith 's " Five Senses " ( Moffat , Yard ) , with accompanying text . Miss Smith has likewise turned anthologist in a sumptuous volume , entitled " A Child 's Book of Old Verses " ( Duffield ) Not only are the illustrations quaint and poetically childlike , but the selections , largely old-fashioned , are chosen with discrimination ? something which can not be said of most recent compilations of this character .

Book of Ballads " A handsome issue of Winston Stokes 's " The Story of Hiawatha " ( Stokes ) attracts our attention ; Miss Kirk 's color-pages are ambitious and full of feeling , while the author 's retelling is adequately done . But in comparison with the original poem , which forms the appendix to this prose text , such a method becomes almost useless , although Mr. Stokes had in mind . when he first conceived the idea , to bring : readers close- to the mystery of the forest through an interpretative medium We are of the opinion that in the main , Longfellow himself was fairly successful . The familiar faces of Palmer Cox 's " Brownies " ( Century ) peer forth from the covers of an eighth volume .
