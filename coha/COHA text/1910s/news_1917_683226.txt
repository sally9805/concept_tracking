txt Who Are the " Real Socialists " ? Among the news items of today there appeors one which is particularly interesting , namely the resignation of Mr. Spargo from the Socialist Party . It is surprising to me that Mr. Spargo has delayed this action so long , and it is still more surprising that other Socialists of rote , like Messrs . Russell . Walling , and Sinclair , have not as yet made a similar announcement . In connection with this , I would like to mention an experience . As soon as I heard of Mr. Spargo 's action I spoke to several more or less active members of the Socialist Party , asking them to comment on the matter .. The ? essence of such comment was that the above named Socialists " did not count for anything in the party , " that " they were chronic trouble makers , " and " they ' never , were much thought of by the real Socialists . " These opinions amused me very much , . as it expresses the true German , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuss or extenuation for every contingency that may arise . ' I might add that when the news of Liebkneeht 's arrest became known these same gentlemen expressed similar opinions with referente to him , although a year before his arrest they were lauding him to the skies . As a believer in Socialism , I would ask some of the party members who may read this letter , ( if the editor will be good enough to print it. ) to kindly tell me who are the " real Socialists that count for something . " It seems . that they ' are those who are in accord with the barbarian. ' of which the Kaiser is the chief exponent and who uphold Germa.i hypoorisy. ? Those of us who believe in humanity and are willing to fight for it , even though we are Socialists , E1 , -0 common clay and not fit to associate with " real Socialists . " It Mr. Iiillquit and Mr. Lee are the type of " real Socialists , " then I will be happy to be one of the ' majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
