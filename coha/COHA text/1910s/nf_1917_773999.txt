txt // cotton fabrics . The combing is done by the action of combs set in cylinders , over which the lap passes , and by an overhead comb . Sections of the lap are held in position by the jaws of a nipper and combed one-half of the length at a time . When thoroughly combed these lengths are again made into a continuous strand , condensed , and finally delivered as a sliver and coiled in a can . 9 . Doubling and Drawing . The slivers , either from the card or from the comb , are next subjected to a process called doubling and drawing , the purpose of which is to continue paralleling and straightening the fibres , to make even the sliver , and to reduce it in size for spinning . This is accomplished by feeding from four to eight slivers to a machine called a drawing-frame which has a series of drawing-rollers . These rollers , like those of the upright spinningframes , revolve at different speeds , the last set going much faster than the first . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only evened but reduced in size . Drawing may be done once , twice , or three times . From the last drawing-frame the fibre is again delivered as a sliver and coiled in a can . io . Drawing and Twisting. ? From the drawing-frames the sliver goes to the fly-frames , of which there are four . In many cases only three of these frames are used , depending on the quality of yarn desired . The four are called ( a ) the slubber , ( b ) the intermediate , ( c ) the roving , and ( d ) the fine , or jack frames . The fly-frames have drawing-rollers , like those of the drawing-frames , but in addition they have a bobbin-andflyer attachment , as , in these frames , the strand is so reduced in size as to require a twist to give sufficient strength for winding and handling . One thick end or sliver is fed to the first frame , the slubber . It is drawn out by the rollers and twisted and wound on the bobbin by the flyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands of slubbing are united when fed to the different fly-frames which follow . On each a strand still more reduced in size is twisted and wound on a big spool or bobbin . From the last , or // jack , frame it is called a roving , and is sufficiently small and has twist enough to be ready for spinning . ii . Spinning. ? Spinning may be done on either of the two spinning-machines , the worsted mule or the ring spinning-frame ; the latter , for many reasons , is more often used . On these machines the roving is reduced in size by the drawing-rollers and is then given a twist and wound on a bobbin or tube . Two strands of roving may be combined in the spinning . The product from any spinning-machine is a single yarn . 12 . Twisting. ? Many of the single yarns are doubled and combined by more twisting to give strength or to produce special effects in the weaving . Greater strength is more often necessary when the yarns are to be used for warp . The twisting-frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing-rollers. 13 . Weaving. ? For this some preparation of the yarns is necessary . ( a ) The filling-yarns are wound on bobbins which are suitable for the shuttles . Filling-bobbins are always wound a space at a time and not end to end , as the yarn is thus delivered more easily . ( b ) The warp-yarn requires more preparation , as it must be sized before it is wound on the warp-beam . The yarn is transferred from the bobbins to spools which are set up in a rack and the yarn wound from them to several warp-beams . From these warp-beams the yarn passes through a machine called a slasher , in which it goes through a tank of sizing and over a big drum for drying . It is then drawn through a guide and is wound , as the design requires , on one warp-beam ready for the loom . This sizing is to give the yarn sufficient strength for the weaving process ; it is later removed during the finishing processes . Cotton yarns are made into a great variety of materials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very elaborate . These may be made on the plain harness-loom or by special attachments , such as the Dobby and Headmotion , or on the Jacquard . A large number of cotton fabrics have the plain or cotton weave and are given vari-sz Dressmaking - ety by finishing processes or by a combination of yarns of different color , size , or fibre . 14 . Finishing . The final appearance of cotton material depends very much on the finishing processes employed and on the dressings used after the weaving is done . Many materials are alike in weave and the size of the yarn used , yet quite unlike when ready for purchase . For example , long cloth and cambric have the same weave , the plain or cotton ; but while the cambric has a somewhat polished surface the long cloth has a dull one which shows a little fluff or fuzz . This difference is made in the finishing . Many of these finishes are often removed to some extent in the laundry and the appearance of the material decidedly altered . For instance : in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look firm and thick by the use of sizing , which is somewhat like starch . Water will dissolve and remove this and leave the fabric as it originally was ? sleazy and thin . ( i ) Regular Processes . No matter what is desired in the appearance of the finished product , all materials from the loom must be subjected to certain processes . These usually include : ( a ) Inspecting and Marking for Repairs. ? The woven material is drawn over a frame which is placed in a strong light , and its defects are carefully marked . ( b ) Repairing . ? All the defects marked must be repaired ; all broken threads must be joined and any missing ones replaced , otherwise the design in the finished fabric will not be complete . This is especially important in cotton materials , as the weave is seldom entirely concealed by any finish . ( c ) Singeing . This is done to one or both sides of the material to remove the many short fibre-ends which show in the surface . The material is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose fibre-ends are affected . To prevent any burning , however , the material is immediately washed and dried . ( d ) Starching , wet or dry. ? All materials have some starch or sizing added during the finishing . In many cases a loose weave and poor quality of fibre are concealed by sizing , thus necessitating // a larger quantity . ( e ) Spraying. ? This is done by forcing water on the fabric , much as sprinkling is done in laundry work preparatory to ironing . ( f ) Calendering. ? All materials are pressed with heavy rolls . The detail of this process differs somewhat according to the finish required . For example : for ginghams and long cloths , which do not have polished surfaces , cold rollers are used in the calendering , as merely rolling contact is required to give the desired result ; for cambrics , which do have polished surfaces , hot rollers revolving at different rates of speed are used as heat and friction are required to give polish . ( g ) Bleaching , Dyeing , or Printing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to bleach it . If it is to be colored , and the raw stock or yarn was not dyed , it is dyed in the piece . Many materials have a design printed on the surface of the fabric by some of the usual methods rather than woven in . Such fabrics usually require a preliminary bleaching. ( 2 ) Special Processes . Cotton , by special treatment , may be made to look like silk , linen , or wool . ( a ) The general method of giving cotton the appearance of silk is by mercerization ? a process in which the cotton is subjected under tension to a concentrated caustic alkali bath . As a result , the fibre becomes round , full , and rodlike and reflects the light sufficiently to give a lustrous surface . This can be more satisfactorily done to the yarn than to the woven fabric , but it is done to either . ( b ) Many methods are used to make cotton cloth look like linen . None of the methods are permanently successful , because of the marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lustre . Much dressing is usually required , followed by beetling , or some allied process , and pressing . These give the fibre all the lustre and firmness it is possible to secure . ( c ) Various methods are even more frequently employed to give a woolen or worsted effect ; the most common is that of raising a nap on the surface of the fabric by using cylinders with napper clothing . The result gives such materials as outing flannel , flannelette , duckling-fleece , and blankets . // Cotton is the cheapest and the most used of the four important fibres . Because of its cheapness there is no need of adulteration ; but , as has been said , it can be made to look like various other fibres , and in consequence is often used as a substitute . A few years ago cotton was said to supply nine-tenths of the material employed in the manufacture of clothing . That includes , of course , materials which are all cotton and many which are shown on the shop counters as all wool , all silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton fabrics manufactured is discussed under Fabrics . II . Wool Wool and hair are the most important of the animal fibres . They come from sheep and other similar animals , such as the angora goat , the camel , and the alpaca . Both wool and hair are used in manufacture and are subjected to much the same general processes . Chemically , they are the same , but in appearance they differ somewhat . Hair is generally rather stiff , straight , and lustrous . Wool is soft , flexible , clastic , and wavy . Each wool fibre is formed from a series of cells in the skin of the animal . These cells are grouped about each other and are filled with a fluid which evaporates as the cells force their way , in series , through the cuticle into the air . The evaporation of this fluid allows the cell walls to collapse , one on the other , and as they are gelatinous they form a continuous stalk which is the fibre . On the surface of this fibre are scales or serrations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlapping another , as they collapse on reaching the air . These serrations and certain other characteristics , such as its cellular structure , give to the wool the shrinking , felting , or matting quality which is so valuable in manufacture . There are many varieties of wool , depending chiefly on the breed of the sheep . There are also many different grades on any one sheep . As a result , wool fibres differ greatly as to length , strength , fineness , softness , elasticity , // lustre , number of serrations , and waviness . All these qualities can not be combined in any one fibre , but in proper combination they have much to do with the value of the wool . The wool industry as a whole includes two important clothing industries : woolen and worsted , both of which are not usually carried on in the same mill . The different processes necessary in the manufacture of each require different types of machines . Almost from the first the wools intended for the two branches need quite dissimilar treatment . In the sorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is done with a different result in view for each . The dusting and drying , on the contrary , are the same in method and result for both . Beyond the drying the processes differ very much . The difference between a woolen and a worsted yarn is in the mechanical arrangement of the fibres in the finished thread . The fibres in the worsted yarn are straightened and paralleled . All the processes in its manufacture , especially the spinning with its roller drawing , work toward that result . In many cases the beauty of the finished fabric depends on the twisting of the yarn and the clearness of the design and weave , and all the finishing processes applied are to aid in emphasizing that effect . Worsted fabrics include serges , whipcords , albatross , Bedford cord , etc . The fibres of the woolen yarn , on the contrary , are as intermixed and interlaced as possible . The yarn in the spinning is always spindle-drawn , and in general the weave is chosen to give firmness as well as design to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tweed , melton , and heaver. 1 . Preliminary Processes for Worsted and Woolen . ( r ) Shearing. ? Sheep are sheared by hand and by machine . The wool , in the shearing , comes off in a whole sheet , called a fleece . Each fleece is tied up separately , and about forty are packed in a bag together for shipping . Paper twine is very generally used now for the tying , in // place of sisal and jute , from which the fibres are easily rubbed off and intermixed with those of the wool . ( 2 ) Grading . Wool grading is often done by the middleman before the wool is finally sold to a mill for manufacture . The qualities are determined without untying the fleece and depend in general upon the cleanness of the wool , as affecting its shrinkage in the scouring , and the length and diameter , or fineness , of the fibre . Following these two processes , shearing and grading , come those of the mill in which the wool is first prepared for manufacture by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into yarns . The kind of yarn and its quality affect the number and kind of processes necessary . As with cotton , an attempt is made here to show a representative method which includes in their regular order the number and variety of general processes required . ( 3 ) Sorling. ? This is the first process at the mill . Woolsorters are trained to detect the various qualities and can quickly divide a fleece into parts , the number of parts depending entirely on the use to which the wool is finally to be put . A fleece , in general , is divided according to length , fineness , and suitability of fibre . While the various required qualities are being separated , the undesirable parts of the fleece are also determined and assembled for other uses . Some wools , usually those from the Far East , are opened on tables provided with screens and having a downward draft of air which prevents the dirt from rising . 2 . Special Processes for Worsted . ( r ) Blending or Mixing. ? Blending is done to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the various mixtures arc chosen they are spread out on the floor , in the right proportion , layer upon layer . In using , care is taken to secure the complete mixture by taking from the side of the mass rather than from the top . ( 2 ) Dusting . The purpose of the duster is to take out as much as possible of the loose dirt and sand . Dusting is not always considered necessary . If the wool has much sand and dust in it , however , soap is saved in the scouring , // which is to follow , by sending the loose fibres through the ( luster first . Generally , a machine called a cone duster is used . It has a cone-shaped cylinder made of wood or metal arms set with heavy pins , or teeth . The fibre is fed in at the small end of the cylinder , is carried by its revolutions to the big end , and thrown out at the back . There is a screen and fan at the top which takes away some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the fibre is beaten and through which the dirt drops . ( 3 ) Scouring . The scouring or washing is to remove the chemical and mechanical dirt ; that is , the grease , or yolk , a skin secretion , and any sand and loose dirt . These are found in all wools . The scouring must be carefully done or the fibre may be injured . Soap , with carbonate of potash , or carbonate of soda ? depending on the wool ? is generally used and followed by careful rinsing . The wool-washer has ( a ) a self-feed which delivers a. regular amount at regular intervals . The fibre is placed in the hopper of the feed and taken up by a revolving spiked apron . At the back of the apron is a stripper which knocks the surplus wool back into the hopper ; at the front there are revolving drums which strike off all the wool , allowing it to pass over the apron and delivering it to be washed . ( b ) A series of tanks , three or four in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom , or screen ; this keeps the wool away from the dirt which settles to the bottom . In each tank there are rakes or harrows which take up the wool as it enters the tank and carry it slowly forward through the water , cleaning it and preventing felting or matting . Between the tanks are squeeze rolls which act as wringers . They have an immense pressure and remove much of the liquid as the wool is passed forward through them . These rolls are placed over screens , and the liquid runs down into other large tanks and , after settling , is used again . The first two or three tanks through which the wool passes contain some detergent ; the last , pure water for rinsing. // ( 4 ) Drying. ? Drying must follow scouring and may be done in various ways , but , whatever the method , care must be taken to maintain the correct amount of heat and moisture . A drier may be attached to the washer or it may be a separate machine . One type of drier frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a certain temperature by steampipes , an inlet for fresh air , and an outlet for hot , moistureladen air . In this chamber is a travelling wire apron with a fan underneath . The feed delivers the wool in regular amount to the apron , which carries it as a rather thin web forward through the heated chamber and dries it . ( s ) Oiling. ? Wool loses its natural oil in the scouring , and some must be added to make the fibre sufficiently soft and pliable and prevent static electricity , so that it will go through the remaining processes without injury . The oil is applied either by hand or by a simple spraying apparatus attached to some machine . Different oils , but usually olive-oil , are used in different mills . ( 6 ) Carding. ? Preparing. ? After the drying and oiling the fibre is put through a carding-machine or a set of preparers . The choice of the machine used depends on the kind of fibre to be manufactured ; that is , the cards are used for the medium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve inches or fourteen inches , and for mohair and alpaca , for which the cards are not suited . About nine-tenths of all the worsteds are carded . The purpose of both the cards and the preparers is the same . They separate and clean the tangled fibres and deliver them in a continuous strand called a sliver. ( a ) Cards . ? A single or double cylinder card may be used . The double-cylinder card differs from the single only in having two large cylinders rather than one . These are connected by a doffer and an angle-stripper , which pass the fibre from the first to the second cylinder . The fibre is first delivered by an automatic feed to cylinders called licker-ins , which begin the opening and cleaning . On the licker-ins are burr-guards which knock off any burrs left in the wool . The large cylinders with their sets of workers and // strippers do the carding . The second cylinder is provided with a doffer and doffer-comb which removes the carded fibre . The fibre comes in a thin web from the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comb . It is then made into a continuous strand called a sliver by passing through a tube or trumpet and through drawing-off rolls , after which it is coiled in a can or wound on a ball . ( For detail in Carding , see page 50. ) ( b ) Preparers. ? The general result of the set of preparers is the same as that of the card , plus the work of machines called gill-boxes , which must always follow the card . The action and principle of the preparers , however , differ from those of the cards and are like those of the gill-boxes . At the back of the preparers is an apron-feed which delivers the fibres to rollers . These in turn pass the fibres forward to movable bars set with parallel rows of upright pins ? a kind of comb , called fallers . These fallers automatically come up in front of the rollers , receive the fibre , and , moving forward faster than the rolls , comb the wool and then deliver it to two rollers at the front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed than the fallers , and they draw the fibre as it is delivered to them by the fallers and thus assist further in the straightening and drawing . Usually five or seven of these preparers are used in sequence ; from the last two or three the fibre is passed through a hole and condensed into a sliver and coiled in a can . When the sliver leaves the last preparer it goes directly to the comb . ( 7 ) Gilling. ? This process , which is a kind of combing and much resembles the preparing , must follow the card but is not used after the preparers . The work is done in a machine called a gill-box , which has drawing-rollers and fallers like the preparers . It continues the arranging of the fibres for the comb . In this machine doubling and drawing are done as well as the preliminary combing . Several slivers , the number depending on the quality of the product required , are fed to the back rollers of the gill-box . From the rollers the slivers are carried forward by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollers . The fallers are set with pins much finer than those of the preparers . After leaving the front rollers the fibre is made into a sliver and coiled in a can or wound in a ball . For the fine and medium wools , after the double-cylinder card there may be generally two operations of gilling , one machine following the other , before the sliver is ready for the comb . For coarser wools a single-cylinder card and one operation of gilling sometimes precede the comb . ( 8 ) Combing. ? The fibres in the sliver which results from any one series of the preceding processes are fairly well straightened and paralleled , but they are of uneven length . Both long and short are combined in one strand . To remove the short fibres and further straighten the remaining long ones , they are put through a rather complicated machine called a comb . The Noble comb is most frequently used for worsteds , though the work can also be done by a nip comb . For use in the Noble comb the slivers are arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a plate with four holes for the sliver to pass through , two rolls in front of the plate which guide and keep an even tension , and a revolving spindle on which the winding is done . Four ends , or slivers , from the last gilling or preparing operation are passed through the holes and guiderolls and wound side by side into a ball . The spindle is withdrawn from the balls and eighteen of these are placed in the comb . The Noble comb is circular in shape . It has one large circle set with concentric rows of steel pins ; the coarser pins are on the outside rows , the finer on the inside . On each side of the machine are two smaller circles ; these are set inside and practically touch the big circle at one point . These small circles are also set with concentric rows of steel pins , but on these the fine are outside to be next the fine of the large circle and the coarse ones inside . The big circle and the two small circles revolve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact between each small circle // and the big one . At this point of contact the strand of fibre is fed in and pressed down , or dabbed , into the teeth of the big and small circles . As the two circles revolve , the points at which they were in contact separate and the strand of fibre is drawn through the teeth of both circles and combed as they continue separating . The short fibres , called noils , are removed by a knife . These are frequently , though wrongly , included in the list of wool substitutes . Noils are used in the manufacture of woolen fabrics , as they give many short ends which are useful in the teazling and gigging processes to raise the nap . The long fibre is taken from the circles by rolls , carried by travelling leather aprons , and finally delivered , a united strand , through a trumpet or tube which gives it a false twist , to a can in which it is coiled . It is called a sliver. ( 9 ) Spinning Systems. ? From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacture of the // yarn may be followed , according to the kind of yarn desired ; that is , worsted yarn may be drawn and spun ( a ) by the Bradford system , which gives a smooth , lustrous , level yarn , or ( b ) by the French system , which gives a soft , rather fuzzy yarn . These two systems differ in an operation called backwashing , which removes any oil from the wool , and in the drawing operations . In manufacturing the wool fibre it is necessary to add oil frequently to facilitate the carding and combing processes . If the wool is to be Bradford-spun no effort need be made to remove the oil except : ( i ) If top dyeing is to be done the oil must then be removed by back-washing and later applied . In the end the same result is accomplished . ( ii ) Back-washing may be done from choice to give the top a very good appearance , if , for instance , the wool is to be sold in the top . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top can be continued . Back-washing is not an absolutely necessary process , except for the tops to be used in the French system of drawing and spinning . ( a ) Bradford System. ? For the Bradford system the following operations are required : ( i ) Gilling. ? Two operations of gilling follow the comb , the first in a can gill-box , the second in a balling gill-box . The principle of these machines is the same as of those which precede the comb . The fallers are generally provided with finer pins . In the first gill-box fourteen to eighteen ends of sliver from the comb are united into one and run into a can . In the second four to five ends from the first gilling are united into one and wound into a ball , called a top . ( ii ) Doubling and Drawing. ? In the drawing-boxes , of which there may be from five to nine , the top is converted into roving . The drawing-boxes have a series of drawing and guide-rollers and a bobbin-and-flyer attachment . At the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slubbing or tops . The slubbing passes through the drawing-rollers and is then given a slight twist // by the bobbin-and-flyer attachment . This twist is put in merely to facilitate the handling of the strand in carrying it from one machine to another . When the slubbing passes through the rollers the twist is removed . The real function of the drawing-boxes is drawing . The last drawing-box is called a roving-frame , and delivers the strand much reduced in size and slightly twisted . ( iii ) Spinning. ? This is the last process in forming the yarn . For this system it may be done on the cap , flyer , or ring spinning-frames. ( b ) French System. ? For the French system the following operations are required : ( i ) Gilling. ? One operation of gilling , in a can gill-box as with the Bradford system , follows the comb . ( ii ) Back-Washing. ? The sliver is next passed through a machine called a back-washer . This has two bowls for the washing-liquor at the back , a series of drying-cylinders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed free of oil in the bowls , are dried by passing over the drying-cylinder , and straightened and united into one end in the gill-box. ( iii ) Gilling. ? Another operation of gilling , in a balling gill-box as with the Bradford system , follows . This straightens the fibres , winds the strand , and makes a back-washed top , also called a dry top . ( iv ) Doubling and Drawing. ? In the drawing-boxes , of which there are nine or ten , the slubbing , or top , is made into a roving . Several strands are made into one , much reduced in size . The drawing-boxes differ from those used by the Bradford system in that ( a ) they have , in addition to the usual series of drawing and guide rollers , a small cylinder set with pins , called a porcupine , which acts much as do the fallers in the gill-boxes in keeping the fibres straight as the strand is reduced in size ; and ( b ) in place of the bobbinand-flyer attachment they have two oscillating aprons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollers and condense it , but do not twist , as the oscillating apron of the woolen card-condenser does not twist . At the back is the creel , or rack , for the slubbing , several // strands of which pass through a guide-plate to the guide and feed rolls , then over the porcupine and through the front rolls . All the drawing is done between the porcupine and front rolls . By these rolls it is delivered to the two oscillating aprons , from which the strands are passed through guides and wound on spools placed side by side . ( v ) Spinning . This is the last process in forming the yarn . For this system it is generally done on the worsted mule but may be done on the ring spinning-frame. 3 . Special Processes for Woolen. ? Fewer processes are required for woolen yarn than for worsted . ( r ) Scouring. ? This operation is the same as for worsted . ( 2 ) Drying . This operation is the same as for worsted . ( 3 ) Burr-Picking. ? The work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in most wools . As they can not be allowed to remain , the wool is put through a burr-picker . Phis has an apron-feed , a picking-cylinder , and one or more burr-cylinders with burr-guards . The picking-cylinder , revolving rapidly , lashes the wool into the burr-cylinders and the burrs are struck off by the burrguards. ( 4 ) Mixing . This process is for various purposes : ( a ) to secure a desired color ; ( b ) to secure uniformity of fibre ; ( c ) to regulate the cost of the finished product by introducing inferior grades of wool , shoddy , etc . The mixing is done on the floor . Various layers in the right proportions are made . In feeding this mixture to the picker , care is taken to remove the material from the side of the pile to secure all the different kinds of fibres . The mixing-picker is in general action like the duster . It has cylinders , which are set with hooks rather than teeth . The mixed fibre is delivered to the machine by feed-rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibres are thrown into a chamber called a gauze-room . The picker is always used , even if no mixture is to be made , as it prepares for carding by opening up and shredding the fibres . Oil is applied from overhead to the wool at this time , to facilitate the carding operation . More oil is used for woolen than for worsted , but the object is the same . // ( 5 ) Carding. ? The fibres for woolen yarn go from the mixing process to a set of cards of which there are usually three . These are called breakers first and second breaker and finisher . Their purpose is to open and clean the fibres . ' I'he principle is in general like that of the worsted card , but t here are various differences in the detail . The breakers have more workers and strippers , and consequently each machine does more carding , which is a necessity , as the fibre goes directly to spinning from the cards . The fibre is delivered by an automatic feed to the first breaker , passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing as a sliver . It may be fed to the second breaker and to the third by either of two methods : the traverse , in which it travels without winding , or the creel-feed , in which it is wound . Both methods are to produce uniformity of product . The ring doffer is used on the finisher . This doffer , with the condenser ( an oscillating apron ) , delivers the fibre in a small roll , without twist , called roping , or roving . The ends are wound on a big spool called a jack-spool and are ready for spinning . ( For detail in Carding , see page 51. ) ( 6 ) Spinning. ? The woolen-mule is usually employed for spinning woolen yarn which requires spindle-drawing. 4 . Final Processes for Worsted and Woolen . ( 1 ) Twisting. ? Twisting , if used , follows spinning . The general method is the same for all yarns , both worsted and woolen , but different twisting attachments are used . The twisting-machines are like the upright spinning-frames except that they are without drawing-rollers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachments are all used , the choice depending on the kind of yarn . In the twisting operation one or more single yarns from spinning are combined for strength or to secure some special effect . ( 2 ) Weaving. ? The preparation of the warp and the filling for the loom and the process of weaving are in general the same for both worsted and woolen . ( a ) The filling yarns require no special treatment . If they are not on bobbins suitable for the shuttles they are rewound and are then ready for spinning . Filling-bobbins // are always wound a space at a time rather than end to end , as the yarn is thus delivered more easily . ( b ) The warp requires more preparation . The bobbins from the spinning or twisting are set in a frame . From them the yarn is wound as desired on a big spool called a dresser-spool . From the dresser-spool the yarn is drawn through two guides resembling reeds , the second guide finer than the first . It is then wound in sections on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warp-beam as the design requires . Tension , rather than a guide , is used in this winding . The warp-beam is turned by power and the tension on the yarn turns the reel , which delivers the yarn evenly . An even tension is exceedingly important in winding a warp-beam. ( c ) The weaving may be done in the plain harness-loom , in those having attachments , or in the Jacquard , as the design demands . Woolen and worsted yarns are made into a great variety of materials , which include all kinds of weaves from the plain to the very elaborate . The different twill weaves are much used for both , because they give the beauty of design which is required by worsteds as well as the firmness which is needed in the finishing of the woolens . ( 3 ) Finishing. ? Great variety is possible in the finishing of both woolens and worsteds . Each finish requires many processes , certain of which are necessary for all materials . Beyond these certain necessary processes the number and kind employed depend entirely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense which can be given to securing the desired effect . Worsted fabrics depend for beauty on the yarn and the weave , and much attention is given to enhancing the merits of both . In woolen fabrics both the yarn and the weave are frequently entirely concealed by a surface finish , toward the securing of which all processes are directed . ( a ) Perching , or Inspecting. ? After any material is taken from the loom it is carefully inspected by being drawn over a perch in a strong light and all its defects are marked . // ( b ) Burling. ? Most materials have knots and bunches of threads where ends have been joined . These are drawn to t lie wrong side by the use of Burling-irons. ( c ) Mending . All the defects marked must be repaired , all broken threads must be joined , and any missing threads replaced ; otherwise the design will not be complete . Woolens require less careful mending than worsteds , as the defects are usually covered by the finishing . Any specks of vegetable matter which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed . ( d ) Fulling. ? The chief characteristic of wool is its quality of felting . This quality is made use of in the finishing of both the woolens and the worsteds . In general , the processes to which either kind of fabric is subjected for felting are much the same , though they do not serve the same purpose for both and are done in a different degree for different materials . ( i ) In the worsted industry felting is used for the fabrics called unfinished worsteds . The chief purpose is to give softness to the weave and flexibility and firmness to the cloth . Worsteds felt less than woolens because their fibres have been straightened and paralleled . They are also subjected to the fulling process for a much shorter time than woolens . ( ii ) In woolens the purpose in felting is to make the cloth sufficiently strong , firm , and thick to stand successfully all the finishing processes required , such as napping or gigging and cropping . Woolens have great felting quality because their yarns are softly twisted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fulling process . Woolens are woven much longer and somewhat wider than is required for their finished size . Occasionally a woolen material is made to shrink half its length . As they shrink irk length and width they naturally become much thicker . For this reason woolens are usually woven rather loosely ; otherwise , as the fulling takes place they become boardlike . Fulling is done in a large machine which is fitted with rollers and a trap to regulate the shrinkage in length . The // shrinking of the fabric is caused by the action of warm , soapy water on the fibres and their subsequent compression . The warm water softens the fibres , they become more interlaced , and are pressed closely together by the action of rollers . In woolen the fabric is so solid that its weave is practically concealed . Very many times , if a woolen fabric is made of a poor yarn and loosely woven , flocks wool waste from some of the finishing processes ? are added to the back while the fulling is going on . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If carefully done it does not impair the value of the goods , but it is too often resorted to in order to cover an inferior foundation , in which case the flocks usually drop out and leave a very shabby surface . ( e ) Washing . Fulling is followed by washing and rinsing to remove all the milling agents which have been used . The ends of the material are sewed together and careful scouring done . ( f ) Gigging and Shearing. ? This is a process in which the fibres by various means are brought to the surface to form a nap or pile . The amount of nap raised depends entirely on the effect desired . Unfinished worsteds when ready for market usually show but little nap , while woolens often have their surface completely covered with nap . Wire gigs , brushes , and teazles are all used . The teazle is a vegetable growth which it is difficult to imitate successfully in metal . Revolving cylinders are set with teazles , wire pins , or brushes , and as the material passes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed surface of the material is continuously brushed by these and the nap evenly raised . The gigging or teazling is followed . usually by careful brushing which in turn is followed by shearing or cropping to secure the required length of nap . This is done by a shear which has revolving knives and is followed by brushing to remove the stray fibres . Many materials are napped several times and have generally a corresponding number of shearings and brushings. ( g ) Steaming , Crabbing , Brushing , and Pressing. ? All these processes are used to give the desired finish to maTextile // terials . The steaming and boiling methods which give lustre are accomplished by the use of steam or hot water and rollers . For either method the material is stretched tightly over the rollers . If it is to be steamed the rollers have perforations through which the steam is blown . If it is to be boiled the material passes through boiling water as it is wound from one roll to another , or it stands while rolled for several hours in the boiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be added . These give additional lustre and more careful finish . ( h ) Teetering . In drying , the material must be made to conform to a certain width and must also be carefully stretched smooth and straight . This is done by tentering . For instance , broadcloth has a regulation width of fifty-four inches ; it may come from the milling process uneven in width . To remedy this it is , while still wet , stretched into shape on a frame . It is attached to this frame by hooks which catch in the selvage . The selvages of many materials show evidence of this process in the small holes made by the hooks . ( i ) Ins pecting. ? All materials are very carefully inspected after the finishing processes . 5 . Usual Finishing Processes for Worsted. ? The following processes may be required in the finishing of a worsted fabric : inspecting ; Burling ; mending ; scouring ; fulling ( for unfinished worsteds ) ; washing to remove the soap ; crabbing ( the cloth is wound on a roll and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through boiling water , and is wound again ; by this process the cloth is set ) ; dyeing ( if it is to be piece-dyed ) ; crabbing again ; tentering ; steam-brushing ( the material is wound on a perforated cylinder and steam is blown through both cylinder and material ) ; specking ( cutting off any specks ) ; shearing on face and back ; pressing by rollers ; dewing ; water blown on it ( somewhat like sprinkling of laundry ) ; drying ; inspecting . 6 . Usual Finishing Processes for Woolen. ? The following processes may be required in the finishing of a woolen fabric ( " face goods " ) : inspecting ; burling ; mending ; fulling in grease ; washing ; rolling and stretching through // water ( left to stand twelve or eighteen hours to remove creases , much like crabbing for worsted ) ; drying ; napping to raise pile ( by wire gig ) ; shearing ; napping and teazling ; blow-steaming ( wound on a perforated cylinder and steam blown through to set the fibre ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be piece-dyed ) ; wet-gigging or brushing wet ; extracting ( water taken out ) ; brushing ( wet or dry ? wet gigging may be done ) ; tentering ; steam-brushing ( steam warms it ) ; shearing ( double or single ? depth can be regulated ) ; steam-brushing ; sanding and polishing ; pressing ( a press acts like an iron ) ; inspecting . Besides these there are special finishings , some of them employed in making a woolen look like a worsted and vice versa . Methods of finishing change constantly as fashion changes and requires new effects in materials . 7 . Substitutes Used in the Manufacture of Wool. ? There are various substitutes which are used both with and in the place of good wools in the manufacture of socalled wool materials . These are used because there is not enough good wool produced to supply the great demand for wool fabrics of all kinds . If only good wool were used the supply would be so limited and the prices so great that the materials could be had by only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior grades and substitutes lessens very materially the expense of manufacturing fabrics and makes possible the furnishing of woolen materials at prices within the reach of the general public . The adulteration of wool is , like the weighting of silk , frequently overdone . The substitutes are ( r ) cotton ; ( 2 ) wool ? reclaimed wool , fibres from materials like shoddy , and waste wool . ( Noils from the combing process , flocks from the finishing processes , and pulled wool , which is taken from slaughtered sheep , are sometimes included in this list but should not be. ) ( r ) Cotton. ? Because of the cheapness of the cotton fibre and the fact that in manufacture it can be made to resemble wool it is much used ( a ) In wool materials , in combination with wool of various grades . It may be introduced in the fibrous state durTextile // ing blending or used in the yarn form , either by itself or combined by twisting with wool yarns . Cotton yarn is frequently used as warp . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both because of the difficulty of weaving mohair warp and filling and because it gives a less harsh fabric . ( b ) In cotton materials which have the appearance of wool and are frequently called wool . Many materials , such as outing flannel , duckling fleece , canton flannel , and the cheaper blankets are made entirely of cotton fibre but are given the wool surface by teazling and gigging. ( 2 ) Wool. ? The wool substitutes are frequently classified in different ways ( a ) Shoddy . This term includes all the materials which are to be remanufactured and used in the woolen industry . It is really the shredded fibre ultimately obtained by subjecting various kinds of rags , cloth , and yarn to a shredding or tearing-up process . The materials used may be either old or new and are , in general , all kinds of rags , materials which have been worn and discarded , clippings of new materials , and those which come from cuttings in tailors ' shops , etc . The term wool extract is frequently applied definitely to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both cotton and wool . In order to obtain the wool the material must be carbonized to destroy the cotton . This process is used when necessary with all shoddy . Preparation of Shoddy. ? All the fabrics which are to be used again in wool manufacture must be reduced to a fibrous state . These fibres are used alone or they may be mixed with the clean wool in the blending process . Shoddy is used only in the manufacture of woolen yarns . It can not be used for worsted yarn , but a woolen yarn made of shoddy may be combined with a worsted yarn . ( i ) Sorting. ? Before any manufacturing process is attempted all the shoddy materials must be sorted according to color and to kind ; that is , new or old . The different kinds may require slightly different treatment . ( ii ) Washing. ? This frequently follows sorting . // ( iii ) Carbonizing. ? When carbonizing is required it is usually done in rag form . In this process all the rags which have any cotton mixture are subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton and leave carbon to be dusted out . Several different operations are required . The material is put in a cage and placed in a tank containing acid and water . It is soaked from ten to thirty minutes , according to the kind of material . From the cage it goes through three or four operations which extract the liquor and dry the material . The first is the hydro-extractor . This takes out the excess liquor , which is saved for use , and leaves the rags somewhat moist . The second machine is a drier , in which more water is dried out at low heat . In the third machine there is intense heat , which concentrates the acid and removes the water . Neutralizing follows to remove all acids. ( iv ) Oiling. ? All materials should be oiled and then left in piles to soften . This applies to all rags whether carbonized or not . ( v ) Picking. ? The machine for this operation is called a shoddy-picker . It has a travelling-apron , feed-rolls , and a picking-cylinder . In it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shreds ; that is , they are practically reduced to a fibrous form . Several layers of rags are placed in flat , thin sheets on a travelling-apron which carries them to the feedrolls . The feed-rolls pass them on to the picking-cylinder which is set with steel and iron pins . The feed-rolls go at a slower speed than the picking-cylinder , and because of this and the action of the pins the rags are shredded and reduced to a fibrous condition . ( vi ) Dusting. ? The carbonizing duster follows . It has the same general principle as the regular duster . It removes the dust or carbon from the fibres which were subjected to the carbonizing process while in the form of rags . After leaving the duster the fibres , by a blending process , are mixed in the desired quantity with the raw wool fibres and then pass through all the steps of manufacturing required in the making of a woolen fabric . // ( b ) Waste Wool. ? This includes two kinds of wool fibres : first , from the worsted industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thrown out by the burr-guards on the licker-ins of the worsted cards ; second , from the woolen industry , the waste wool mixed with burrs which comes rom the burr-picker . Removing Burrs. ? The burrs in both kinds of fibre are reduced to powder or carbon by crush-rolls . Carbonizing and neutralizing as for shoddy are necessary for some kinds of waste wool when the vegetable matter can not otherwise be removed . Dusting. ? The carbonizing duster follows . It is the same as that used for the fibre of carbonized rags or cloth . After leaving the duster the fibres are ready for the mixing or blending process . The character of the various woolen fabrics manufac-tured is discussed under Fabrics . III . Silk Silk , like wool , is an animal fibre . It comes from the cocoon of the silkworm , of which there are for manufactur-ing purposes two general kinds the cultivated , called the Bombyx mori , and the wild , such as the Tussah . The cul-tivated worm feeds on the leaves of the mulberry-tree , the wild on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unlike any other fibre in that it is several hundred yards in length and so does not have to be joined and twisted to make thread of sufficient length to use in weaving . Several strands are twisted together , however , to give more strength and thickness . The silk fibre consists of two parts ? the inner or true fibre , called fibroin , which is not soluble in water , and the gum coating , called serecin , which is readily soluble in hot water and soap . The important character-istics of the fibre are its softness , fineness , elasticity , lustre , and endurance . The life of the silkworm is short and busy . The eggs , usually laid in summer , are kept for some time in a cool place and hatched in the spring when the leaves of the mul- // berry-tree are green and tender . The worm at birth is about one-eighth of an inch long but begins eating at once and increases rapidly in size . During its life great care must be taken as to food , temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating and growing it sheds its skin . This occurs four times in its short life of thirty or thirty-six days , until the worm is finally about three inches long and much lighter in color . At the end of the moulting period its hunger lessens ; it shows signs of restlessness and a desire to climb . Twigs are provided , and soon the worm finds a desirable spot to which it attaches itself by throwing out a little silk which hardens or dries and holds the worm in place . Spinning now begins . By a waving motion of the head and a circular motion of the body , as if making the figure eight , the worm begins throwing out from two openings underneath its mouth two thin threads of silk which unite and form one . This gradually encloses the worm and forms the cocoon . The outside threads of the cocoon are usually rough and broken but the inner is a long double thread varying from five hundred to thirteen hundred yards . The spinning takes three days , and as it ceases the worm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live would become a moth and escape , injuring the silk . To prevent this the cocoon is fumed ; that is , it is heated sufficiently to stifle the chrysalis . After fuming , if care is taken , the cocoon may be kept indefinitely . Before any manufacturing processes are begun , cocoons are usually sorted and classified for color , texture , and general condition . Each cocoon has two kinds of silk ? the long , inner , continuous fibre , called raw silk , and the outer , shorter , and often rougher fibre , called spun or waste silk . These require very different treatment in manufacture . 1 . Processes for Raw Silk . ( I ) Reeling. ? Usually over one-half of the silk in a cultivated cocoon is reeled into skeins , or hanks . Preparatory to this the cocoons are put in soap and water sufficiently warm to soften the gum and are then brushed . This brushing removes the short outer floss and finds the end // the long filament . Several of these filaments , according to the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide-eyes , and wound on a reel . The water must be kept at even temperature throughout the process to keep the gum softened . Hand reeling is a simple process , but steam filatures are generally used in which the reels are run by bower . Care must be taken in uniting the filaments , which are not of equal size their entire length , in order to make as even a thread as possible . ( 2 ) Throwing. ? The next process for raw silk , after reeling , is called throwing . It includes various operations which convert the raw silk into threads suitable for warp and filling for weaving . ( a ) Several different kinds of silk thread may be made in the throwing process . ( i ) Singles , used for either warp or filling in thin materials . They are made by twisting a single strand from the reel to make it stronger and firmer . The amount of twist given depends entirely on the finished product intended . Chiffons , for instance , require a hard twist . ( ii ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly twisting two or more single untwisted reeled threads together . Usually there is just enough twist given to hold the strands together . This keeps the strand soft and makes a bulky , lofty filling and produces lustre . ( iii ) Organzine , used for warp , needs strength , and consequently it is made by combining with a left-hand twist several single strands which have already received a right-hand twist or vice versa . The number of threads and the amount of twist depend on the required strength of the thread and the desired appearance of the finished product . There are usually fourteen or sixteen turns to the inch in the singles used , of which two or more are combined . In this combining more than three twists must be used . ( iv ) Twist , which is made in the same general way and closely resembles organzine but has fewer twists . ( b ) The operations included in the throwing process are as follows : ( i ) Washing or Soaking. ? Most of the silk to be thrown is first soaked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drying is done by placing the skeins first in a hydro-extractor and then hanging them for drying in a room heated by hot air or steam .. ( iii ) Winding. ? The silk is prepared for doubling and twisting by transferring it to bobbins . This is done by means of a machine resembling a swift or reel . In winding , care is taken to make the thread smooth and of even size . To accomplish this it is passed from one bobbin to another through a cleaning-machine which removes any irregularities . ( iv ) Doubling and Twisting. ? These processes depend on the kind of thrown silk required ; for instance , singles are not doubled but go directly to the spinner , which does the twisting with the bobbin-and-flyer attachment ; tram , on the contrary , is made by combining silk from several bobbins on the doubling-machine , and is then twisted ; while organzine is twisted , doubled , and then twisted again in the opposite direction . After the throwing , if the silk is to be skein-dyed , it must be wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum . 2 . Processes for Spun or Waste Silk. ? This term includes all silks which can not be reeled and are not suitable for throwing the silk around the outside of the cocoon , which was used to hold the worm to its twig ; it is strong , uneven , and rather lustreless ; the outside layers of the cocoon ; the first silk spun , which it is impossible to reel ; the last spun , which is too fine and weak ; short fibres from pierced and damaged cocoons ; and waste from reeling and throwing . ( z ) Mixing. ? Because of the varying quality of the waste silk it must be carefully mixed to get an even product . ( 2 ) Boiling and Schapping. ? Raw silk can go through all the processes of manufacture except dyeing without having its gum removed ; waste silk can not . There are various ways of freeing the silk of its gum . The two generally used are boiling , the English method , and fermentation , the Continental method . By the first method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // hags , is put into a soapy water which is allowed to come to the boiling-point . Constant stirring is necessary . The gum is softened and passes out through the meshes . Another bath , with less soap , follows , and the silk is dried . By this method very little gum is left and the silk is much lighter in weight . In schapping , the silk is put into vats of tepid water and allowed to remain without motion for several days . A process of fermentation takes place and the silk is practically freed of its gum . This leaves a certain quantity of gum in the silk , which is an advantage for some materials such as velvets . Washing and drying follow , as in the boiling method . The processes of manufacture for waste silk are similar in many ways to those used for cotton . ( 3 ) Inspecting and Cleaning. ? Because much of the waste is gathered up in mills and from the surface of the cocoons , it has mixed in it straws , hairs , and grasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hand . ( 4 ) Conditioning. ? Af ter the gum is removed the silk is very dry and a certain amount of moisture must be added ; otherwise the necessary processes are not possible without breaking the fibre . ( 5 ) Beating and Opening. ? The beating opens up the fibre , softens it , and makes it flexible ; the opening straightens and parallels the fibres for the combing. ( 6 ) Combing . In this process the short fibres and any foreign matter which may still he mixed with the fibre are removed , and at the same time the fibres are somewhat straightened and paralleled . The waste silk fibres are of different lengths . Before they can be combed satisfactorily they must be made regular in length by some method . There are two general ways of doing this . The first is by choosing and grouping the fibres of even length . This method requires time but saves any waste of fibre . In the second method the fibres are wound on a grooved cylinder , the grooves being as far apart as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is completed a knife is slipped into the grooves to cut the fibre . This gives even length but many short waste ends . // The actual combing is done in a machine which has a comb and several book-boards . These latter are twohinged boards which close like a book . Half the length of the fibres is enclosed in the book-boards ; the other half hangs free so that it comes in contact with the combs . After it is combed the fibres are reversed and the other half combed . This removes the short fibres , which are called noils , and further parallels the long ones , which are called tops . Noils are combed twelve or thirteen times . Each time the combing produces both top and noils , the fibres of which with each combing are shorter . Those fibres nearly equal in length are combined for each of these combing operations . ( 7 ) Preparing and Drawing. ? From the combing the silk is fed to gill-boxes . These work like the worsted gill-boxes which have drawing-rollers and fallers . The rollers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than the wool . By them the silk is made into a continuous sliver , which goes on to the drawing-machines , where several slivers are made into one and sufficiently attenuated to form roving . ( 8 ) Slubbing. ? The roving-machine has rollers and a bobbin-and-flyer attachment . The roving is drawn out and given a sufficient twist to prepare it for the spinning . ( 9 ) Spinning. ? This is done , as in cotton or worsted , by the mule or by the cap or the ring spinning-frames , the choice of machine depending on the kind of yarn desired . The mule and ring are in most general use . ( ro ) Doubling and Twisting . In these processes two or more threads from the spinning are combined and given twist enough to hold them together . The machines used are like the upright spinning-frames but have no drawing-rollers . ( II ) Gassing. ? This process removes any loose fibres from the twisted yarn by running it through a gas flame or through a platinum V-shaped slot electrically heated . After this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on bobbins if for warp ; on quills or small bobbins if for filling . 3 . Processes for Both Raw and Spun Silk . ( I ) Weaving . This is the same for both raw and spun silks . For it some preparation is necessary . // ( a ) The filling yarns are wound on bobbins suitable for use in the shuttles. ( b ) The warp yarns are transferred by various steps from the bobbins to the warp-beam . In this transferring , sizing is generally added to strengthen the yarn . If fine yarn is used thin paper is very frequently placed between the different layers as it is wound on the warp-beam . This prevents tangling and assists in maintaining an even tension when the warp is unwound during weaving . Silk warp yarns are frequently printed with a design before they are woven . This is done as on the woven fabrics by roller-printing , in which a different roller is necessary for each color . In the weaving a plain filling yarn is used , resulting in softer colors and a somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbons . A great variety of weave is found in silk fabrics , from the plain , in such materials as taffeta and China silk , through the twills and satin weaves , to.the brocades , which are the product of the Jacquard loom . Many corded materials , such as the poplins and bengalines , have the plain weave and are frequently a combination of yarns of two different fibres . Cotton is used in the cheaper qualities for filling , while wool is sometimes used to give the desired weight and effect . ( 2 ) Finishing. ? The same general methods are employed for both kinds of silk . Many times the yarns are finished partially before weaving ; the processes are in general to give strength , weight , smoothness , and gloss to the yarn . Before raw silk is dyed , whether in piece or skein , the gum must be removed from the fibre by boiling . In this process the silk loses weight . To make up for this loss weighting is usually added , the kind used depending chiefly on the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salts are used , salts of tin or iron . If used in excess they affect the wearing quality of the silk , as they are themselves affected by light , air , and time . Some crystallize when exposed to the air and light and cut the silk fibre so that it breaks easily . For the woven material there are many finishings , mechanical or made by the use of dressings : the pressing and // calendering for good silk , the dressing or sizing for poor silk . There is also that larger class of special finishings , such as moireing or embossing and polishing , which also includes dressings of many kinds . These special finishings change with fashions , new ones appearing each year . The character of the various silk fabrics manufactured is dis-cussed under Fabrics . For artificial silk , see Other Lesser Textiles . IV . Linen Linen is a vegetable fibre . It is expensive , and conse-quently adulterants and substitutes are often used . They are , however , because of certain properties of the linen , less satisfactory in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from the stalk of the flax-plant . It is the bark which lies between the inner woody core and the outer bark and because of this is called a bast fibre . The fibre is long , varying from twelve to twenty inches . It is straight and has a long , cylindrical tube with lengthwise markings which look like fine black lines . At intervals there are also cross-markings which help slightly in keeping the fibre together in the spinning . It is composed of cells held together by a vegetable gum called pectin . In addition to length the fibre has various other valuable quali-ties such as strength and lustre . Flax is pulled and not cut , as in this way greater length of fibre is obtained . This is done by hand , since no suit-able machine has yet been invented . In preparation for manufacture it requires entirely different treatment from that given cotton , wool , or silk . The beginning processes are for the purpose of ( a ) breaking up and removing the bark and woody tissue and ( b ) separating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibre , called line . I. Processes for the True , or Line , Fibre . ( i ) Rippling. ? When flax is pulled it has all its leaves and seed-pods , which , after the plant dries , must be re-moved . This is done by hand , by drawing the ends of the stalks through big combs. // ( 2 ) Retting. ? This is one of the most important processes , : Ind if not well done it may injure the fibre . It begins the 1 teeing of the bast fibre from the bark and the woody core by decomposing the resins which unite them . There are various ways of doing this ; the most usual are by dew or ( old-water retting. ( a ) Dew Retting. ? The fibres are spread on the grass , exposed to sun , rain , and dew . From two to live weeks are required for the decomposing of the gum . This method is used chiefly in Russia . ( b ) Cold-Water Retting . For this there are two general methods : the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for several days or weeks undisturbed , and the use of slowrunning water a less offensive method not always possible to secure but giving a good result . The latter method is much used in Belgium , to which country the flax of other countries is frequently brought for retting . Retting is sometimes done twice . ( c ) Other methods , which have been tried to shorten the length of time required , include the use of hot water or chemicals . None of these have been successful to the present time . ( 3 ) Drying. ? After the retting the flax is dried in the open air , then tied in bundles and left standing in the air until the time for breaking and scutching. ( 4 ) Breaking. ? After the retting has decomposed the uniting gums the woody matter must be broken up and removed . The breaking , which was formerly done by hand , by a series of slabs , is now usually accomplished by several fluted rollers moved by machinery through which the flax passes . ( 5 ) Scutching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of a revolving wheel in which wooden knives or beaters are mounted . These knives strike off the woody part and begin the separation of the bast tissue into fibres . Aside from the long fibre , which is a product of this process , there is a certain amount of waste or short , tangled fibres , called scutching tow , which is used for cheaper threads and strings . At this point the work of the farmer is finished and the product is sold . ( 6 ) Hackling. ? This is a process closely resembling the combing of other fibres . It cleans , disentangles , combs , and // parallels the fibres , separating the long , or line , fibre from the short , which is also called tow . It splits what seems one fibre into several and produces fibres of uniform diameter as well as of uniform length . Hackling is done by hand or machine , or both . There is usually a certain amount of hand hackling or roughing before the fibre goes to the machine . The process is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fibre becomes finer and cleaner . Hackling by hand is expensive and is more often used when the finer qualities of yarn are required . When done by machine the strands of fibre are held in place and combed by needles which are set in revolving aprons . The tow catches in the needles and is held by them until brushed off . ( 7 ) Sorting or Classifying. ? Before preparing for spinning the flax must be arranged according to quality . This is done by hand . In doing it machines like the hand hackles are used . More short fibres are removed and the longer ones paralleled , subdivided , and cleaned ; the product is often called dressed line . In this process , if fine linen is to be made , the fibre is sometimes cut to secure the best section for the yarn . ( 8 ) Grilling. ? After securing the line fibre the first process in preparing it is done by a machine called a spreadboard . In this machine the fibre is paralleled , subdivided , and joined to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as used for other fibres ; that is , there are feed-rolls , fallers , and draft-rolls . The process is rather more difficult for flax because of the greater length of the fibre and its stiffness and irregularity . The flax is fed to the machine in tresses , which differ in thickness and width according to the desired product . A usual width is about four inches . The ends of the flax are overlapped , and by the drawing of the rollers and the action of the fallers , which keep the fibres straight , a continuous sliver is made which is run into a can . ( 9 ) Doubling and Drawing. ? This is done in a series of drawing-boxes . The series is frequently composed of a machine called a doubler , three drawing-frames , and a // roving-frame . The first machines used are much like the gill-boxes ; they attenuate and even the slivers which come from the gilling process by uniting and drawing out from two to ten or twelve of them . These slivers are fed from the different machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series , has the rollers and fallers , but in addition it has a bobbin-and-flyer attachment . The sliver is still further reduced and attenuated by the rollers and fallers and is also given a slight twist by the flyer and wound on the bobbin. ( 1o ) Spinning. ? The fibre is now ready for the actual spinning . Fly-frames are used because of the smooth straightness of the flax . The spinning may be done in one of three ways : in dry frames , damp , or wet . These flyframes are like the old machines , with rollers and the bobbin-and-flyer attachment . They have the bobbins at the back , which deliver the roving to the two sets of rollers , the receiving and the draft going at different speeds . From the rollers the drawn-out roving is twisted by the flyer and wound on a bobbin . For dry spinning the feed and draft rollers are set about one foot apart and the work proceeds in the usual way . If the spinning is to be damp the strands , after being drawn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a roll turning in cold water which moistens the yarn . If , however , wet spinning is to be done , , the drawing-rollers must be set close together ? the distance between being shorter than the length of the fibre ? and the roving must actually pass through water almost boiling before coming to these drawing-rolls . This softens the fibres and makes them more supple . It also gives a smoother yarn , as the vegetable jelly in the fibre is softened by water , hardens again , and forms an outside coating . Too hot water , however , is injurious . All yarn spun by damp or wet spinning must be made into hanks or skeins and dried at once . The wet spinning is generally used for the finest yarns , the damp for the next grades , and the dry for the coarsest . ( II ) Twisting. ? This process may follow spinning in preparation for weaving . Wet or dry twisting may be // done ; the wet makes a smoother yarn . For this the ring and the bobbin-and-flyer attachments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually combined by twisting to give more strength or to secure some special effects in the weaving . Greater strength is more often necessary when the yarn is to be used for warp . ( 12 ) Weaving. ? Weaving for flax is more difficult than for cotton because the fibre is not elastic and breaks easily . The warp yarns are sized to make them smoother and give them strength for the drawing in and weaving . All varieties of looms are used , and we find a corresponding variety of weaves from the plain of dress linens through the geometric designs of huck and bird's-eye to the elaborate damasks. ( 13 ) Finishing. ? There is much less variety in the finishings used for linens than for the other fibres . Those used are chiefly to add lustre by polishing and weight by sizing or dressing . For polishing , a liquid like starch is applied and the material passed over hot rollers . Other finishes are given by pressing , calendering , and mangling . There is also a process , called beetling , by which the threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through this process before weaving to soften it for any subsequent processes . Beetling , whether done in the yarn or on the fabric , gives a closer weave and increased lustre . The surface of the fabric is smoother because the threads are flattened and are less distinct and separate . It gives a leathery feel to the fabric . The best class of linens need very little dressing . Some of the cheaper grades ? those in which the weave is poor or a substitute is introduced ? are rather heavily sized to cover defects and thus appear a better quality than they are . Many linens are left their natural color and are stronger . Bleaching , unless very carefully done , weakens the fibre . Linen may be bleached or dyed in the yarn or in the fabric ; sometimes in both . Linens do not dye easily and do not hold dye particularly well . 2 . Processes for the Short Fibre , or Tow. ? The short fibre , or tow , is separated from the long during the scutchTextile // ing and hackling processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long fibres . The processes of its manufacture are somewhat different from those of the long fibre . It is beaten and shaken in a beater , to clean and open it up , and then carded to disentangle the fibres and con-tinue the cleaning . The card has the same big cylinder and workers and strippers as are used for wool , but the card clothing is heavier and coarser , owing to the coarseness of the tow . The carding-machine delivers the tow in the form of a sliver . This is doubled and drawn and made into rov-ing ready for spinning by the drawing and roving frames , as is the line fibre . The spinning is also the same as that of the long fibre . It may be dry , damp , or wet and is done by the bobbin-and-flyer attachment . The character of the various linen fabrics manufactured is discussed under Fabrics . V. Other Lesser Textile Fibres I. Ramie . Ramie is a vegetable fibre . It comes from the stalk of a plant belonging to the family of stingless nettles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lustrous , and non-elastic , like linen . The plants are cut , not pulled , and the leaves and branches are removed . The different countries in which ramie is grown have different methods for its preparation . Sometimes the bark is stripped off while the stalk is green ; sometimes the plant is allowed to dry and the bark retted by dew or water . Before the fibre is ready for spinning it must be put through several processes . First , decorticating , a process for removing the bark while it is still wet ; second , de-gumming , which requires care , as the gum can be removed only by the use of chemicals . When carefully degummed it is soft , lustrous , and silky . The fibre , after being im-mersed in the chemical , is boiled , washed , dried , and some-times bleached . To soften the fibre it is passed through fluted rollers which make it flexible without breaking it . It is then put through gill-boxes and made into what is called filasse . The gill-boxes disentangle and straighten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fibres , as in worsted : the long fibre , called tops ; the short , called noils . Both of these are spun , but the tops make the finest and strongest yarn and a better grade of material . The use of ramie has been tried in the manufacturing of a great variety of materials ; it is generally combined with other fibres . Efforts have been made to improve its processes of manufacture , but as yet its use has not become varied . To date it is not generally successful except for Welsbach burners . As a fibre for dress materials it is found that it does not stand twisting and does not wear well . 2 . Jute and Hemp. ? Such fibres as jute and hemp need be considered only by those interested in house furnishing , as they have , so far , proved too heavy for use in dress materials . 3 . Mineral Fibres. ? The mineral fibres , asbestos and tinsel , are so little used as to deserve but passing notice . This is especially true of asbestos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , introduced into dress fabrics . It is frequently seen in novelties and in gauzes which are used for trimmings and for evening wear . 4 . Artificial Silk . There are various kinds of artificial silk , nearly all of which are made from cellulose . The principal varieties are nitrocellulose , cuprammonium , and viscose . There are others , but they are not now widely enough used to warrant discussion here . Artificial silks resemble real silks in appearance but their properties are quite different . Until recently they have had serious disadvantages : they have been difficult to dye , were likely to disintegrate in washing , and were inflammable . Improvements have been and are constantly being made , however , and most of these difficulties have been practically corrected . One general process of manufacture is this : cellulose is dissolved by treatment with chemicals and forced through capillary tubes into another chemical which hardens or sets it . Other processes are being attempted and may prove equally successful . // Artificial silks have high lustre but are brittle and inelastic . They do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much heavier . They are inexpensive as compared to real silk and are coming more and more into use . They are made into hosiery , underwear , and sweaters , and also into a variety of dress materials , all of which include many kinds of weaves . They are found in combination with wool , cotton , and silk . In many materials they are woven in small dots or figures to form the design . 5 . Spun Glass. ? The use of spun glass in wearing apparel has been attempted but has not been considered successful . III . BLEACHING , SCOURING , AND DYEING Both yarns and fabrics may be bleached , scoured , or dyed , according to the requirements of the finished product . I. Bleaching and Scouring All fabrics are scoured or washed after leaving the loom and before the finishing is done . Bleaching and scouring sometimes precede dyeing to remow any objectionable substance in the fibre . If materials are not to be dyed the bleaching and scouring is much more carefully done , as its purpose is then to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally done to-day , requires the use of chemicals and consequently weakens the fibre somewhat ; for this reason unbleached cotton and linen fabrics are stronger than the same quality of fabric bleached . Linen is more affected than cotton . Fabrics bleached by continued exposure to the weather are not injuriously affected . II . Dyeing Dyeing is the art of coloring textile and other materials in such a way that the colors can not be readily removed by the influences to which they are likely to be subjected ; that is , water and other cleansing materials , wear , light , and sun . // In dyeing , the coloring matter is first soluble and becomes insoluble while it is being absorbed by the fibre . ( I ) Dyeing may be done at different periods or stages in the manufacturing of the fibre ; that is , ( i ) in stock ? in the loose state after washing and before any of the mechanical processes ; ( ii ) in the slub during the mechanical processes , the exact stage differing with different fibres ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ( iv ) in piece ? after the weaving . The time of dyeing depends on the fibre and on the kind of product desired . When dyed in stock the colors are thoroughly absorbed by the fibres and are considered permanent . Skein-dyeing is used for specific purposes . It is less often done than stock or piece dyeing . Piece-dyeing is for materials of solid colors. ( 2 ) Of the four most important fibres , wool dyes most readily , in general , and gives to the color depth and fulness . Silk follows , and because of the smoothness and transparency of the fibre its color is more lustrous than that of any other . Cotton does not dye readily and its colors usually lack brilliancy or depth . Linen is even more difficult to dye ; while its colors are richer than those of cotton they are not usually lasting . ( 3 ) Cotton , wool , silk , and linen do not react in the same manner in the dyeing processes ; consequently different methods and different kinds of dyes are used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treatment , differing according to the color used . For much of the dyeing a mordant is necessary . This is a substance which has an affinity both for the coloring matter and the fibre . It varies , depending on colors and fibres . It prepares the fibre so that the dyestuff may be precipitated into it in insoluble form . ( 4 ) Dyestuffs may be divided into two general classes : ( i ) artificial , which includes coal-tar products , and ( ii ) vegetable , of which madder and indigo are well known . ( 5 ) There are special kinds of dyeing , such as resist , cross , and discharge dyeing . ( a ) Resist dyeing is the process which treats part of the yarn so that it will remain unchanged when subjected to // another dye bath . This is used often in striped material . ( b ) Cross dyeing is done in the piece in materials which have both cotton and wool fibres . Cotton will not take wool dyes ; in consequence it may be used to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ) In discharge dyeing the material is also piece-dyed a solid color ; then some of the color , in the pattern desired , is removed by chemicals . CHAPTER III TEXTILE ECONOMICS Textile fabrics have design , color , and finish and are made up of one fibre or a combination of fibres . In judging any fabric to determine its value and wearing quality it is necessary to take all these factors into consideration . All materials , whether of cotton , wool , silk , or linen , should be so made as to conform to certain requirements or standards , these standards to be regulated for the purchaser by the quality claimed for the materials and the prices charged . At present , however , no definite standards exist , and wise selection must depend to a large extent on the knowledge of the purchaser . In selecting materials the purchaser should know not only what quality or grade of material may be demanded for a certain price but be able to determine as well whether that quality has actually been secured on payment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sixty-nine cents a yard is bought , the purchaser has no right to expect good linen fibre firmly woven . The fabric of that width and price must necessarily have either poor linen fibre or linen and cotton combined with a loose weave and concealed with much sizing . If , on the other hand , a bengaline silk twenty-seven inches wide is purchased for two dollars a yard , it can scarcely be claimed that proper value is received if the fabric is found to be two-thirds cotton . In order to select materials wisely both knowledge and experience are required . First , it is necessary to know ( a ) The characteristics of the various fibres used in the manufacture of the materials , their feel , appearance , strength , their similarities and differences before manufacture and after , and the manner in which they respond to various tests . 120 // ( b ) The general processes of manufacture required to make various standard kinds of fabrics from these fibres . Without some knowledge of the many operations necessary it is difficult to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( c ) What substitutions or adulterations are possible in manufacturing the fibres into fabrics . ( i ) The various operations by which one fibre may be made to resemble another or one fibre may be concealed when combined with another for the purpose of adulteration. ( ii ) Simple tests by which these substitutions and adulterations may be detected . Second , based on this ascertained knowledge there should be unlimited experience in the handling and testing of the materials themselves for comparison of quality and price . Facts , unless supplemented by experience , are of little value in judging materials . Discrimination in selection can result only from the experience which is gained by the constant use of both eyes and hands in a careful study and comparison of materials . In beginning such work , standard materials should be chosen rather than novelties , and as a starting-point or basis for comparison of any kind of material a good quality of that material should be used . The necessary qualifications for such a material are as follows : ( a ) It should be woven of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good quality of fibre but is sufficiently twisted to give the required strength to the fabric . Because of the finishing , short and imperfect fibres and substitutes may not show in the new fabric unless it is very carefully examined , but they will appear after the material has been worn a short time . ( b ) The yarns for warp and filling should be well balanced to prevent the unequal strain or wear of one set and their cdnsequent breakage . This balance is usually secured ( i ) by having the yarns of warp and filling of comparatively the same size , weight , and twist , or ( ii ) , if either warp or filling yarn is finer , by having a sufficient number of the finer to give the required strength . This latter 12Z Dressmaking method is not satisfactory in every case . Any dimity which has a few heavy lengthwise cords with a fine , tightly twisted filling and no heavy crosswise cords is an excellent illustration of lack of balance . The heavy cord , because of the extra strain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finer crosswise or filling threads , which , with wear and laundering , soon break . ( c ) To permit the developing of any desired finish from the fabric itself , without the aid of any applied fibres in the finishing processes , the yarn should be of such weight and quality and so woven as to give the fabric a sufficiently firm foundation or structure . For instance , many fabrics , particularly those made of wool , have the ends of the fibres brought to the surface to form a thick pile or nap by the use of teazles or wire gigs . If the foundation the stock ? of the cloth is too poor to supply these fibre ends it is necessary in the fulling process to add material to give substance enough for this finish . Good materials properly applied during manufacture do not injure the finished product , but in too many cases cheaper qualities are used and so carelessly added that with wear they drop out and reveal the lack of substance in the woven foundation . ( d ) The weave should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that sizing is not necessary to give the material the substance and appearance of a good fabric . The kind of weave chosen should depend on the use for which the material is intended . Designs like the basket have aesthetic but not economic value and consequently should be avoided in fabrics of which wearing quality is demanded . There are many others , however , such as the twills , which are good in design and are unrivalled from the standpoint of wear . ( e ) The material should have a true finish , one which can be brought up from the fibre by the pressing of the fabric rather than one which is artificially made by the application of various polishing and finishing mediums . The first is permanent ; the latter disappears with little wear or laundering . Such finishes are difficult to recognize because of their great variety , but they may be found in many of the // cotton , wool , silk , and linen fabrics . There are also many designs which are made by pressing down sections of the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a starchlike substance which holds them in place temporarily but is quickly rubbed off with wear . These designs are most frequently seen in novelty cotton fabrics . Because of their finish they often command a price much above their actual value . ( f ) When possible the color of the material should be lasting for the use required of it ; that is , the color of a cotton fabric is subjected generally not only to the test of wear , but of laundering as well , and must be made to meet both tests . Usually the color of a wool fabric has merely that of wear to withstand . Few colors are really " fast " to all treatment but may be to some . Constant improvements are being made in dyes , especially those used on cotton fabrics where fast colors are most necessary . Effort should be made to obtain the names of firms who guarantee fastness to certain colors . I. COMPARISON OF FIBRES As has been said , all testing of materials for fibre or fibres should be based on a comparative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner in which each fibre responds to certain physical tests . Although the fibres may be somewhat changed in the manufacturing operations , they are essentially as before and respond in the same general way when similar tests are applied to them in the fabric . The four important fibres ? cotton , wool , silk , and linen ? differ from each other in various ways , many of which may be detected without using even a simple microscope or linen-tester . , In comparing various grades and qualities of the same fibre , however , such as good wool and remanufactured wool , little can be determined accurately even by an expert with the use of a powerful microscope . In identifying fibres by physical tests the following factors should be considered : // ( a ) Appearance ; ( b ) length ; ( c ) feel ; ( d ) tensile strength ; ( e ) elasticity ; ( f ) behavior in burning . Before considering these , however , it is necessary to establish a foundation by knowing as much as possible concerning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behavior toward dyestuffs of these fibres . These are not facts which can be determined by physical tests ; they have , however , been worked out and proved by chemical and microscopic analysis and are recorded in b'oks which are easy of access to the majority . Cotton is a vegetable fibre . It is a flat , ribbonlike band with thickened edges and a slight spiral twist . Unripe or dead cotton has no twist and does not spin well . It has its inner canal closed and does not take dye . Cotton is largely made up of cellulose ; it absorbs from six to eight and onehalf per cent of moisture without evidence of dampness . It does not dye easily . Wool is an animal fibre with a scalelike surface . It is made up of flattened and overlapping cells which form a series of scales called serrations . These serrations help to give to wool its shrinking or felting quality . Kemp is the diseased fibre . It is solid and without cellular formation . It has the same structure throughout as the scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brittle , and large in diameter . It does not spin and does not take dye . It can not be improved by any process of manufacture . Wool is a protein substance composed of oxygen , hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen , sulphur , and phosphorus . It can absorb from twelve to nineteen per cent of moisture without evidence of dampness . It usually dyes easily and the color is quite lasting . Silk fibre is a smooth , structureless filament with a transparent lustrous surface . It has an outer coating of gum called serecin . This encloses two combined filaments of silk or fibroin which is a protein substance . Silk can absorb eleven per cent of moisture without evidence of dampness . It dyes easily . Linen is a vegetable fibre made up of cylindrical cells . Its surface shows lengthwise fine lines and crosswise markings like breaks in the fibre . It is cellulose and can absorb // eleven per cent of moisture without evidence of dampness . It does not dye readily nor hold its color well . Based on these facts , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table // Table II . DESIGN Textile design is produced in many ways , all of which may be grouped under two general heads : structural design , that which is made during the formation of the fabric , and surface design , that which is made after the formation of the fabric . I. Structural Design Structural design is by far the larger class . In general , it may be said to have more effect on the wearing quality of a fabric than do the majority of surface designs . Structural designs are made while a fabric is being woven . The design may depend entirely upon the character of the weave ? the way in which the warp yarn is interlaced by the filling yarn ; or , in addition to weave , there may be variety in the threads or yarns used . // 1 . Design by Yarn . ( I ) Yarns Made of Different Fibres . Combinations of yarns of different fibres are seen in wool materials in which there is a silk stripe ; in wool brocades which have the figures in silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenly combined ; in silk ginghams , in which silk and cotton are used ; in mohair , alpaca , etc. , in which mohair filling is combined with a cotton warp ; in such materials as Tussah Royal , in which mohair and wool are used and give to the surface a crinkled appearance due to the different shrinkage of the two fibres ; in many upholstery materials , in which jute or hemp is combined with plain or mercerized cotton . ( 2 ) Yarns Having Different Twists. ? Various materials are given an irregular or pebbly surface by combining yarns of different twists . The warp and filling yarns may have different twists , or different twists may alternate in both warp and filling . Crepe de chine and Georgette crepe are illustrations of different-twisted yarns . ( 3 ) Colored Yarns. ? The use of colored yarns gives a great variety of design . ( a ) Solid Color. ? Materials in which the warp and the filling are always alike , as in galatea , sateen , nun's-veiling , or wool batiste , and panama cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warp of one color and filling of another . Chambray is an excellent example , as this characteristic really distinguishes it . True chambray always has white filling and colored warp yarns , with the exception of a few white warp yarns added at each edge to keep the selvage white . ( c ) Stripes. ? Materials in which colored yarns may be introduced warpwise , with warp varied and filling solid , or fillingwise , with filling varied and warp solid . Stripes are more generally seen lengthwise than crosswise , unless to meet an occasional demand for novelty . They are found in a variety of materials ? in gingham , in madras , and in silks and wools. ( d ) Checks and Plaids. ? Materials which have both warp and filling striped ? evenly for checks , unevenly for plaids. // This kind of pattern is seen in Irish poplins and shepherd 's plaids . Checks and plaids are also found from time to time in wools , such as serges and broadcloth , and in silks , such as taffeta and surah , but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Different Sizes and Weights . Pattern is frequently made by the use of heavier yarns . These yarns may be introduced into either warp or filling , forming stripes , or into both , forming checks or plaids . Dimity is given its chief characteristic by the heavy yarns which , according to their placing , form stripes , checks , and plaids . The heavy yarns introduced filling-wise give to poplins and a large class of silks , such as bengaline , eolienne , and faille , the corded surface which makes them distinctive . ( 5 ) Yarns of Different Sizes and Weights Combined with Colored Yarns . Many materials are given more decorative surfaces by having the stripes , checks , or plaids formed by the colored yarns outlined by heavy cords . Such effects are frequently seen in ginghams and madras . ( 6 ) Novelty Yarns . These are generally made in the final process in the manufacture of the yarn , that of twisting . Yarns of the same or different fibres may be combined . Novelty yarns have been much used recently in materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general names of ratine or sponge . Nearly all such materials may be classed under the general term of novelties . They change constantly because of their dependence on passing fashions. ( 7 ) Yarns at Different Tension. ? Some materials are given a crinkled surface by the use in weaving of warp yarns at different tension . This necessitates the use of two warpbeams to carry the two distinct sets of threads . These may be arranged to give the entire fabric a irregular surface or may be made to form stripes of regular ) r different widths . This kind of design is most frequently seen in such cotton fabrics as crepe and seersucker , which do not require pressing after laundering . 2 . Design by Warp Printing . Many materials are given a design by the printing of the warp yarn after it is practically prepared for weaving . A plain filling is used , // resulting in a less pronounced design and softer colors . Dresden ribbon and taffetas are made in this way . The method of printing is described under Surface Design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two lines of yarns or threads to consider : the warp , or lengthwise , threads those which are put on the loom first and which may be said to form the foundation upon which the pattern is worked out ; and the filling threads ? those which cross the warp at right angles and make the pattern simple or elaborate by the manner of their interlacing . In the finished fabric the warp-threads are usually called ends and the filling threads picks , particularly in trade , and in any comparison of material for fineness and strength the number of picks and ends to an inch is considered . ( I ) Classification of Weaves. ? The various weaves which are used in materials offer an interesting and by no means difficult study once a general classification has been arranged . The one given here is simple and easily understood . ( a ) Plain and its variations : derivatives , basket and rib ; ( b ) twill and its variations ; ( c ) satin and its variations ; ( d ) figure : damask , brocade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e ) double cloth ; ( f ) pile ; ( g ) lappet and swivel ; ( h ) gauze ; ( i ) leno. ( 2 ) Method of Making Weaves . ( a ) Plain Weave. ? The simplest weave , and one which is important because of the large number of materials in which it is used , is the plain weave , also called tabby , cotton , homespun , or taffeta . It is found in cotton materials ? muslins , cambrics , percales , and batistes ; in wools ? nun'sveiling , panama , voile , and challie ; in silks ? taffeta , China , and India silks ; in linen ? chintz , handkerchief linen , and sheeting . The plain weave requires two harnesses , through one of which all the odd threads ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ) are drawn ; through the other all the even ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) . If the harness holding the odd threads is raised in opening the first shed , the shuttle on its trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over all the even ; that is , the first warpthread is up , the second is down , and so on across the fabric . When the next or second shed is open and the // shuttle is sent through , just the reverse happens : the odd threads are covered by the filling and the even are on top . In this the first warp-thread is down and the second is up . This completes the design , and when the third shed is opened it is a repetition of the first , the fourth is a repetition of the second , and so on until the fabric is finished . The filling passes under one and over one in regular order , alternating in each row . This weave , while giving a strong and firm material , is not particularly close be-cause the threads do not pack as compactly as those of some other designs . A material woven in this way , if held to the light before any finishing is done , will usually show openings be-tween the threads ; these are filled with sizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive . Shrinking or fulling during finishing helps to make the threads lie closer . The plain weave is often made more decorative by the use of the methods already referred to as forming designs ; that is , the introduction of colored yarns , of heavier yarns , of yarns at different tension , etc . There are several weaves which are usually called de rivatives because they are based on another with a slight variation . From the plain weave we have the basket and rib weaves . ( i ) Basket Weave. ? The basket weave is found in cotton materials , such as monk 's cloth ; in wools and linens , called basket cloth ; and in silks , such as louisine . In the simplest basket weave only two harnesses are necessary , as in the plain weave , but they are not used and arranged as for the plain . The more elaborate weaves reTextile // quire more harnesses , but the method of making is in general the same . The threads are woven in in groups of two or more to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one harness has threads r and 2 , 5 and 6 , 9 and ro , while the other has 3 and 4 , 7 and 8 , 11 and 12 . Instead of opening first one shed and then the other the same shed is opened twice in succession ; that is , the first two picks are alike . The first two warp-threads are up in the two rows , the second two are down in the two rows , and so on across the fabric . The second shed is opened twice also and its two picks are alike . In this the first two warp-threads are down in two rows and the second two are up in the two rows . The filling goes under two and over two , making a trip over and back through each shed . To hold it at the edges of the material the filling is interlaced with the threads which form the selvage . This method of weaving gives a design in squares and makes a very attractive fabric but one not satisfactory for wearing quality . The threads slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not stand the least strain . Many basket weaves have an additional warpthread which is introduced between each square or group and is interlaced in such a way as to keep the threads from sliding . This gives strength to the material . ( ii ) Rib Weaves. ? There are two kinds of rib weaves , warp rib and filling rib . In the first the warp yams form the face of the material , in the other the filling . Both are a combination of the plain and basket and require only the two harnesses . Warp rib . In the warp rib the first two picks are alike , but , unlike the basket , they go under one and over one . The first warp-thread is up in the two rows , the second one is down in the rows , and so on across the fabric . The second two are also alike and go over one and under one . In this the first warp-thread is down in the two rows and the second one is up in the two rows . This makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish this weave from the plain weave with a heavy filling , as the effect is practically the same . Filling rib . In the filling rib the pick goes through each shed only once , but in going it passes under two and over two threads of the // warp . This makes a rib lengthwise with the selvage . The cross rib formed by the warp is more often seen . ( b ) Twill Weave. ? The twill weaves are practically equal in importance to the plain weave because they are used in so many materials and with such variety of effects . Twills are found in cotton materials ? canton flannel , drillings , jean , outing flannel ; in wools ? serges , whipcords , cheviots , broadcloths ; in silks ? plain foulards , surah , silk serges ; in linen ? diagonals and some kinds of towelling . In the twill the warp and filling threads intersect , so that they produce a diagonal line or rib across the fabric either to right or to left . The regular twills have an angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; that is , instead of alternating , as is done in plain weaving , the filling moves forward in each row , one thread to right or left of the crossing of the first line , and in this way makes the diagonal . There is a great variety of twills , their names sometimes indicating the number of harnesses necessary for the weaving . There are even and uneven twills . In the even equal quantities of warp and filling yarn show on the sur face of the material , as in the common , or plain ( two warp up and two warp down ) , twill . In the uneven one yarn shows much more than the other , as in what is frequently called the prunella , or three-shaft ( one warp up and two warp down ) , twill . Besides the twills already mentioned there are many others , among them the corkscrew , broken , pointed , and fancy . One of the simplest twills is the three-shaft or three-leaf ( uneven ) . It may be either warp or filling face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric in the first shed warp threads I , 4 , 7 , Zo are lifted ; the filling passes under one ( I ) , over two ( 2 and 3 ) , under one ( 4 ) , and so on . In the second shed 2 , 5 , 8 , zi are lifted , and in the third 3 , 6 , q , 12 , giving a progression of one in the lifting of the warp in each row . For a warp-face fabric the filling passes under two ( i and 2 ) , over one ( 3 ) , under two ( 4 and 5 ) , over one ( 6 ) , and so on . All of the twill weaves make exceedingly attractive surfaces , and for this reason they are used in many materials like the worsteds , which do not have their weaves concealed by any finishing process . They also give firmness and bulk to material , as many threads can be used and packed firmly . Because of this the twill is used for materials like broadcloth which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface to form a nap . In many materials twills form the only decoration ; in others they are merely the background for elaborate figures . ( c ) Satin Weave. ? The satin weave like the twill has a progression in each pick in the lifting of the warp , but it is a progression of two or more rather than one as in the twill . It might be called a broken or irregular twill . The terms satin and sateen are both used for this weave : satin to indicate a surface formed by the warp , as in satins , in Venetian cloth , in prunella , and in galatea , which have the floating threads running lengthwise of the material ; sateen , a surface formed by the filling , as in sateen , which has the floating threads running across the material . The satin weave gives a smooth , lustrous fabric , since the surface ? because of the kind of weave used ? appears unbroken and consequently reflects the light to the best advantage . As has been said , the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either case , whether warp or filling , these'surface threads are longer than in any other weave , as they are carried under one intersecting thread and over several , and they are so closely packed that the few intersecting or cross threads over them scarcely show . This weave is found in cotton materials ? sateen , galatea ; // in wools ? Venetian cloth , prunella ; in silks ? satin , messa line , peau de cygne , and charmeuse ; in linen ? damask . An odd number of shafts is usually found ; that is , five or seven shafts or even a greater number . For a five-shaft , filling-face satin , as the name implies , five harnesses are necessary . When the first shed is opened the filling passes under one warp thread ( I ) , over four ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) , under one ( 6 ) , and so on ; in the second row , to make the progression it passes over three warp threads ( I , 2 , 3 ) , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 7 , 8 ) , under one ( 9 ) , and so on ; in the third row over one ( I ) , un der one ( 2 ) , over four ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) , under one ( 7 ) , over four ( 8 , 9 , 10 , II ) , and so on ; in the fourth row over four ( I , 2 , 3 , 4 ) , under one ( 5 ) , over four ( 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ) , under one ( io ) ; in the fifth row over two ( I , 2 ) , under one ( 3 ) , over four ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) , under one ( 8 ) ; then the pattern is complete and the sixth row is like the first . The satin weave is very frequently used in materials in which there is a combination of fibre , as in cotton-backed satins , where the silk threads floating on the surface cover entirely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silk face and a cotton back with irregular twill effect . Skinner 's satin is a well-known illustration of this . Many of these materials are less expensive than all silk and prove satisfactory in wearing quality . If the threads have too long a float on the surface , as frequently happens in some foulards , they are likely to catch and pull , and thus destroy the face of the fabric , especially if there is a colored design . Some satin-face materials in dark colors have the disadvantage of becoming shiny with wear . Generally Textile Economics 1o ' 5 speaking , however , the satin weave is satisfactory and gives many beautiful fabrics . ( d ) Figure-Weaving. ? Figure-weaving is closely allied to the satin and twill weaves , many of the designs being really a combination of the two . Figure-weaving is done on the Jacquard loom , or by some special attachments like the Dobby or Head motion , which may be added to the har ness-loom . In this class the most frequently used are the damask , brocade , huck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically all kinds of materials . Damask and brocade are terms often confused , but there is a distinct difference In damask the design or pattern is complete on each side of the fabric and is , in consequence , reversible ; there is no definite right or wrong side . In general , on one side the background is satin with the figure show-ing the twill ; on the other the figure is satin and the background has the twill effect . Damask is often woven with a sateen background and satin figure or vice versa ; this gives a crosswise twill to one on the back and a lengthwise twill to the other . In brocade there is a decided right and wrong side . The design shows very indistinctly on the wrong side , as no effort is made to have it complete . The threads which form the pattern on the right side are woven in on the wrong side when not in use or left floating to be cut off later . The damask and brocade weaves are used in a variety of ma terials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made either of cotton or linen or a combination . Such weaves as the huck , diaper , and granite are much simpler in construction and do not require necessarily the // Jacquard loom . The diaper and huck weaves are used chiefly in linens and cottons ; the granite weave in linens and wools , most often in materials called granite or crepe cloth . ( e ) Double-Cloth Weave. ? Under this general heading may come materials of various kinds : ( i ) Cloths which are backed . The extra backing is usually done by warpthreads which give additional weight without in any way changing the appearance of the face of the fabric . In many cases the materials added . to give weight are of decidedly inexpensive quality . ( ii ) Cloths which are reversible . In the reversible materials two warps or two filling threads may be used and interchanged in such a way as to make the designs alike or unlike on the two sides of the material . ( iii ) Cloths which are figured with extra materials . These frequently have two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( iv ) Cloths which are really double or compound . Many double cloths are made with two sets of warp and of filling , which are so interlaced at intervals as to make the two fabrics inseparable ; or there may be a double warp , double filling , and an additional warp which binds them together . Fabrics made in this way may easily be pulled apart . In this general class come many heavy suitings , coatings , steamer rugs , novelties , polo cloth , and silence cloth . ( f ) Pile Weave. ? The pile weave differs from others in that it does not have all the warp and filling threads in lengthwise and crosswise parallel lines , but has some threads of either the warp or the filling so raised in loops as to become vertical . Under the general head of pile weave come several classes of fabrics : ( i ) those in which the pile is formed by the warp , as in good velvets and plushes ; ( ii ) those in which the pile is formed on the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reed and two warps , one at loose tension , as in Turkish towelling ; ( iii ) those in which the pile is formed by the filling , as in velveteen and the cheaper velvets ; ( iv ) those in which two distinct fabrics are made at once and later cut apart . // ( i ) Warp-Pile ? Cut or Uncut. ? Warp-pile fabrics are of great variety , as they may be plain or figured , the latter a combination of cut and uncut pile . When the pile is formed by the warp there are two sets of warp to one of filling . Both the ground and pile warp are interlaced by the filling threads , but at short and regular intervals one set of warp-threads passes over an inserted wire which pulls the threads up to form loops . In making cut-pile fabrics the wire is provided with a knife at one end which cuts the loops as it is withdrawn . If a warp-pile fabric is to be given a design by a combination of cut and uncut pile , the pile is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( ii ) Warp-Pile ? Uncut. ? Turkish towelling and some novelty materials are made by using two sets of warpthreads one of which has a very loose tension . The regular loom is used , but the reed is so regulated that it does not beat each row of filling regularly ; that is , two rows of filling are put in and beaten very lightly . After the third row , however , they are all firmly beaten into place . As a result the loose warp is pushed both up and down and forms a loop on both sides of the material . ( iii ) Filling-Pile. ? When the pile is formed by the filling there are two sets of filling threads and one of warp . One set of filling interlaces with the warp regularly and forms a firm groundwork ; the other set floats over the woven surface for some distance and is intersected and bound to the fabric by the warp at regular intervals . After the weaving is finished this floating thread is cut in the centre and rises to form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads , a uniform and well-covered surface is formed . Velveteen and corduroy are woven in this manner , also many cotton velvets . ( iv ) Double-Pile Weaving. ? This method of weaving is sometimes employed for plushes . The weaving is done somewhat as in double cloth , but the two fabrics are far enough apart to give the requisite length of pile . The pile threads pass from one fabric to the other and are interlaced and kept in place by the filling threads . These pile threads // are later cut half-way between the upper and lower fabrics , giving two distinct materials . If a pile fabric is poorly made , with few threads or the threads insecurely fastened , the surface soon pulls out or wears off and an ugly background is left . ( g ) Lappet and Swivel Weaving. ? By the use of attachments ? either the lappet or the swivel ? decorative figures may be woven over the surface of a fabric without affecting the groundwork weave . The effect is somewhat that of embroidery . Many figured muslins , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the figures are continuous the wearing quality of the material is in no way affected by the decoration , which enhances its beauty . If an intermittent design is used , such as a dot , the long threads connecting the dots on the wrong side must be cut . These ends may pull out if the material is not closely woven . Frequently these designs are imitated ; that is , similar effects are produced in inexpensive materials without using any attachment . Dots are a favorite method of decoration , but without the attachment each dot is not made of a continuous thread . They are put in by an extra bobbin , which carries the filling back and forth across the full width of the material , letting it appear on the surface to form the dot . Each thread of the dot is a separate thread . The back of the material is covered with the long lines of floating threads between the dots , which must be cut in order not to catch . With very little wear the short threads which form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton materials are made in this way . ( h ) Gauze Weave. ? In the gauze weave we have an openwork effect obtained by a crossing of the warp-threads . Grenadine and marquisette are the best-known illustrations of this . While gauze fabrics are light and open they are exceedingly firm , more so than any other fabric in proportion to the quantity and quality of material used . An even number of warp-threads is used , and between every two filling threads two warp-threads entwine to right and left alternately ; the warp-thread , which is on top in the crossing , // passes under the filling and vice versa . This occurs regularly , because of the alternating of the warps to right and left , and gives firmness to the material . ( i ) Leno Weave . Leno is a name usually given to a variation of the gauze , a combination of gauze and plain weaving . Many cotton curtain materials have this combination . II . Surface Design As the name indicates , this kind of design is applied after the fabric itself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also structural design , as , with but few exceptions , fabrics are formed by weaving . Surface design may be applied in various ways , some of which are not of sufficient importance here to require more than passing mention . In many of these designs the decoration is made by the application of color in various ways . In others it is made in the finishing processes by pressing with special rollers without the use of color . It may also be made by hand or machine embroidery , when the pattern may be in a contrasting color or may not . 1 . Design with Color . ( i ) By Hand. ? There are two or three hand methods , the best known of which are block-printing and stencilling. ( a ) Block-Printing. ? Block-printing is the method in which the design is applied by blocks , a separate block being necessary for each color . The blocks are applied one at a time . ( b ) Stencilling. ? In stencilling , the pattern is cut out of stout paper or metal and the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( 2 ) By Machine. ? There are different machine processes , the best known of which are block-printing and rollerprinting. ( a ) Block-Printing. ? When block-printng is done by machine the general principles are the same as in the hand method . In the machine method there are at present limitations not found in the hand work as to the number of colors and the size of the pattern . // ( b ) Roller or Machine Printing. ? The most important method of textile printing is roller , cylinder , or machine printing . The majority of surface designs are made by this method . When fabrics are properly printed the color applied in this way becomes a part of the fibre and resists both washing and friction . In general , for machine-printing there is ( i ) a large cylinder covered with several thicknesses of material called lapping , over which passes the cloth to be printed . Against this large cylinder there is ( ii ) a smaller cylinder which is the engraved copper printing-roller . This copper roller in revolving touches ( iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the copper roller free from the lint of the material and to regulate the amount of color on it there are ( iv ) two knives which are so set as to operate against its surface and keep it clean . In roller-printing a different cylinder is required for each color . These different copper cylinders , to the required number , are placed around the central cylinder and print one after the other . Various methods are employed in engraving the copper rollers and there are also many different finishing processes for setting and bringing up the color . 2 . Design without Color. ? The design without color , made by pressing rollers , gives many different results which are determined by the surface finish of the rollers . ( i ) Design on Plain Weave .  --  A material with the smooth surface which a plain weave gives may have a design made by using embossed rollers . in this method the background , which is pressed flat , is often treated with a finishing gum or paste which further accentuates the difference between the flattened background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special class and are generally termed novelties . Many of the cotton ratines are finished in this way . Various crepe effects are given to fabrics having a plain weave by the use of special rollers . The crinkled surface of albatross is made in this way . ( 2 ) Design on Pile Weave . Many pile fabrics have designs made in much the same way . They may be made with uncut-pile background and cut-pile design or vice // versa . The method is the same for both . The design is made on the uncut-pile material by using engraving or embossing rollers as in the plain weave . When the design is made , if the background is to remain uncut it is pressed flat and treated with a paste to keep it flat during the next process , which is that of shearing or cutting the pile left standing . The material is then washed , a process which removes the paste and releases the background pile . The result is a light background of uncut-pile with a design in a darker shade which is given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design and cutting the background . ( 3 ) Moireing. ? Another method of securing design without color is the moireing process . The surface of the material used is generally slightly corded . This cording is made by having the threads which form the filling heavier than those of the warp . The material is folded face to face along its lengthwise centre and a paper inserted ; it is so pressed and dampened that some of the cords are flattened and its surface given the watered effect which is seen in many materials , such as percaline , moreen , moire antique , moire velour , etc . III . TESTS FOR FABRCS Before beginning any tests on fabrics it is necessary to know the various processes required in their manufacture and , with this information as a basis , to establish familiarity with the raw fibres and with the ordinary designs , by careful and constant observation and comparison of fibres and materials . In the materials many weaves are concealed by the finishes , and the fibres are combined with various substitutes , adulterated by weighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of identification . As has been said , in the beginning it is much wiser to apply all tests to good fabrics those which are sold as good by reliable firms at fair prices . If the first testing is done on cheap materials it is a discouraging task , as there are 14 2 Dressmaking usually more difficulties to be met in the way of poor fibres , substitutes , sizing , and weighting . A knowledge of good materials ? of all that the term good implies ? should when possible be made the basis of all textile testing . Some of the same tests may be applied to fabrics as to fibres , and while any one test may not give absolute results by itself , in combination with others it will help to determine , in a general way , the character of the material . Many tests require the unravelling of the threads of the material until the fibres are so separated that they can be examined . These tests may be left until various others have been used for such factors as the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i . General Comparison of Fabrics. ? A comparison of the four general classes of fabrics ? cotton , wool , silk , and linen ? may be made , but is valuable only to a limited extent , as each class includes so great a variety of fabrics which differ widely in appearance , feel , strength , etc. ( r ) Appearance. ? Because of the perfection of the art of finishing , the general appearance of many fabrics counts for comparatively little , except to the expert , in indicating the structure of the fabric and the exact quality and combinations of fibres used . ( 2 ) Feel. ? Many fabrics , however , frequently have somewhat the same feel as the fibres of which they are made . ( a ) Cotton material : unresponsive , soft , inelastic . ( It may be made to look and feel somewhat like wool , but it still retains these characteristics. ) ( b ) Wool material : springy , harsh , elastic . ( When combined with much cotton or with much shoddy it is less elastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elastic , cool . ( When weighted or adulterated it has less elasticity. ) ( d ) Linen material : firm , stiff , smooth , cold , inelastic . ( When adulterated it loses somewhat its firmness and smoothness. ) . ( 3 ) Strength. ? No comparison of the strength of the different classes of materials can be made based on the strength of the respective fibres . Two materials made of the same // fibre differ absolutely in strength , as the strength depends on the size and quality of the yarn and the kind and quality of the weave . For instance , wool fibre , which is weak in tensile strength , makes generally a strong material . ( 4 ) Burning. ? Burning a small section of cloth gives practically the same results for materials as for fibres , with the exception that the quickness with which any fibre burns may be somewhat affected by the firm twisting of the yarn and the closeness of the weave . ( 5 ) Tearing. ? The tearing of material sometimes helps in a general way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the material itself . ( a ) Cotton tears easily , with a shrill sound , and the ends of the fibres along the tear curl up and are fuzzy . ( b ) In a wool fabric the weight of the thread and the firmness of the weave have much to do with the way in which it tears . Ordinarily , however , it tears with difficulty and the sound is dull and muffled . If much cotton is present it facilitates the tearing , and the ends of the cotton fibres are unlike those of the wool . ( c ) Silk , unless it has a special design , such as very heavy filling or cording , tears easily , with a sharp , shrill sound . ( d ) Linen is difficult to tear ; the ends of the fibres are straight and smooth . If cotton and linen fibres are used in one fabric the tearing test may indicate such a combination because of the difference in the torn ends . It proves little or nothing , however , as to the proportion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tests used for determining strength and color are practically the same for all fabrics . ( i ) Tests for Strength. ? The strength of a fabric has much to do with its wearing , but it can have no fixed standard . Each material should be strong enough for its intended use . If the warp and filling threads are not well balanced , if one is much finer than the other , the fabric breaks or tears along the line of the heavy threads . Dimity , with its heavy lengthwise cords , is the most obvious illustration of this . With wear and laundering the filling threads break along the cord . No matter what design is chosen the // weaving should be well done ; that is , there should be enough threads and they should be closely enough packed to give firmness and body to the cloth . To judge the strength of a fabric it should be held firmly in both hands , with the fingers underneath and the thumbs on top , and pulled straight out , first warpwise , then fillingwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break easily and quickly unless there are so many of them used that they acquire sufficient strength to balance the other stronger threads . Later , when the material is unravelled , the respective strength of warp and filling may be tested more accurately by breaking and by comparison for size , firmness , twist , etc . Many materials which seem strong as far as quality and size of yarn are concerned are woven in a design which allows the threads to slip out of place easily where there is the slightest strain , especially in the seams . This fault in the material may be detected by attempting to push the threads apart with the finger-nail . Many fancy weaves , like the basket , do not usually stand this test . ( 2 ) Tests for Color. ? There are several ways of testing for fastness of color , because color is affected by various factors ? chiefly by washing , boiling , and the use of strong soap , by pressing with too hot irons , by wearing , by exposure to sun and air , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottons and linens which must be tested for laundering . This can be done only by obtaining a sample and subjecting it to the ordinary rubbing and soaping which must be used in cleansing such materials . It is well to keep part of the sample for comparison to know the exact loss of color . Some colors which a few years ago faded almost immediately are now , if special dyes are used , absolutely fast . Many materials , particularly those worn next the skin , must have sufficiently fast color to withstand friction . This can sometimes be fairly well determined by rubbing the fabric with another which is white . For sunlight tests it is best to expose a sample for a number of days , having half of it carefully covered with someTextile // thing which will exclude the light . By this method easy and accurate comparison may be made . 3 . Testing for Fibres and Finish in Fabrics. ? The tests used for determining fibres and finish differ for the different fabrics . ( i ) Cotton Fabrics. ? In cotton fabrics it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , because the cotton fibre is cheaper than any other fibre which could take its place . The length and quality of the fibre in the material may vary greatly , however , the weaving may be loose , and much sizing may be used . These are facts which must be considered in determining the soundness and wearing quality of the material . ( a ) Fibres. ? Good cotton fibres are blunt at the end which was attached to the seed , while the other end tapers , and the centre is a little larger than either end . The entire fibre shows a strong uniform twist . The dead or unripe fibres have practically no twist ; they do not dye or spin satisfactorily , but usually they are not present in great numbers . In untwisting the cotton yarns to identify the fibres , the general appearance of the yarn itself should be observed as to uniformity of size , evenness of twist , smoothness , etc . Care should be taken not to break the separate fibres . Only an experienced worker with the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fibres . This work is , in consequence , not possible for general use . Any experience which is gained in examining the different qualities of cotton fibres in cotton fabrics assists materially , however , in detecting cotton in various wool and linen fabrics where there are distinct differences in the different kinds of fibres . ( b ) Finish. ? The plain weave is more frequently used in cotton materials than any other . The twill weave is also found , especially in such fabrics as canton flannel and outing flannel , which are made to look and feel somewhat like wool fabrics by having a nap raised on one surface or on both . The twill weave gives firmness and bulk to material , but // the plain weave , while strong , is not particularly close . If the weaving is not well done , openings or spaces can be seen between the different threads . Many cotton fabrics have both poor quality of fibre and loose weave concealed with a sizing which is put on while the material is being finished . This sizing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces between the warp and the filling threads , giving weight to the material and providing a surface for the desired finishing processes , such as pressing and polishing . There are various ways to detect this sizing . Rubbing between the hands or , if there is a great deal of sizing , tearing the material or flecking its surface sharply with the finger-nail will cause a fine dust or powder to rise . Soaking in warm water will usually dissolve at least a part of the sizing and leave the material sleazy . By moistening the fabric with the tongue a sticky , starchy taste may frequently be detected . These tests are not possible if it is a fabric from which a sample can not be taken , but something may be learned from its appearance and feel . If it is loosely woven and much sizing is present , the sizing will probably show between the threads when the material is held to a strong light . It will also give the material a feeling of harshness which cotton does not otherwise have . The wearing quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design or the background is pressed flat and held there by starchy preparations , can easily be determined by rubbing the fabric between the hands . In many cases a little rubbing destroys the design entirely by removing the paste or starch . ( 2 ) Wool Fabrics. ? The problem of identification for socalled wool material is a difficult one . It is possible to use a greater variety of substitutes for good wool and conceal them more successfully than in the case of any other fibre . Wool can not be adulterated in worsteds , but in some cases cotton may be combined . This is not generally done in suitings , however . In woolens there is a great variety of substitutes possible , as cotton , shoddy , and wool wastes may all be used . A variety of weaves may be employed // for both . The twill weave is frequently used because it is attractive and gives the necessary background or foundation for any desired surface finish . ( a ) Good Fibres and Substitutes. ? Good wool fibres show a series of scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the variety of wool . These scales give a sawlike edge to the fibre which is also kinky and wavy . This waviness must be distinguished from the twist of the cotton fibre . In untwisting yarns to determine the fibres present the general appearance of the yarn should be observed , as in the cotton , as to uniformity of size , evenness of twist , smoothness , etc . The substitute fibres may be divided into two classes : ( i ) Vegetable , which includes cotton , ramie , and jute . Of these cotton is most frequently used , not only because of its cheapness but because of the ease with which it may be made in its manufacture to resemble wool . ( ii ) Animal , which includes waste wool and the remanufactured , reclaimed , regenerated , or recovered fibres from materials like shoddy . This class is the more important of the two . Waste wool comes from both the worsted and woolen industries and includes the fibres which are so mixed with burrs that they can not be freed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms imply , have already been manufactured and many of them have been worn . In passing through the various processes of the first manufacture and in the tearing up preparatory to remanufacture the physical structure of the wool fibre has been somewhat changed and damaged . In general , all the remanufactured wools are included in the term " shoddy , " but by some authorities they are divided into distinct classes , such as shoddy , mungo , and wool extract , varying in quality and in the use to which they may be put . In testing for different fibres all the vegetable fibres in a wool fabric are easy to detect because they respond to the burning test as when in the raw state . For instance , in burning a material which has cotton in one direction and // wool in the other the cotton disappears , leaving only ashes ; the wool is but slightly burned ; the odor is unmistakable , and each wool fibre shows the usual gummy residue on its burned end . If cotton and wool threads exist in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yarn itself , it is necessary not only to unravel the material to test the yarns separately but to untwist the yarns for the individual fibres . It is , however , very difficult ? in fact , for the majority impossible ? to identify the different qualities and kinds of animal fibres which may be used in one wool fabric . They all respond in the same way to the burning test or to chemicals , and even under a compound microscope the very expert can not always detect them . Occasionally the presence of shoddy may with care and patience be discovered . It is frequently confused with noils , however . The wool fibres in shoddy may be of many colors , and both dyed and undyed fibres may be found . There may also be no uniformity in the size , length , or general condition of the fibres . ( b ) Finish. ? When wool fabrics reach the finishing process extra materials , such as noils , flocks , and waste wool , are often added to conceal defects or to give the desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making of the yarn or in the weaving . Noils come from the combing . Flocks come from the various finishing operations , such as clipping the nap of woolen fabrics . The waste wool is swept up in the mill and is frequently of more value than flocks . All these may be of fairly good quality or of very poor , depending on the amount of good wool or shoddy used in the various materials from which they come . They are usually added while the material is being fulled or felted . If they are of good quality and carefully applied , so that they do not wear off or drop out , the material is not injured . If they are poor , carelessly added , and rub off with a little friction , the weave itself is soon exposed and , on account of its lack of substance , can not stand wear . It is generally difficult to detect these added fibres except when the fabric is unravelled and its substance examined with the microscope . There are some exceptions , // however . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tested by hard brushing with a stiff brush . Some fuzz always comes off , but if in large quantity the material should be avoided . Occasionally inexpensive materials , such as chinchilla and imitation zibelines , are found from which the entire fancy surface can practically be removed by pulling and rubbing . Too high a polish on an inexpensive quality of material should be avoided . This is particularly true of broadcloth . Because of the number of processes necessary in its making and finishing , to be well made and of good-quality fibre it must be expensive . A cheap broadcloth with a high polish soon loses its lustre and wears unsatisfactorily . Good wool responds to pressing and steaming and takes a beautiful lustrous finish which is lasting . Cheap wool , which must of necessity be present in cheap fabrics , may be given a temporary lustre , but wearing soon removes it . Tests for water-spotting should be applied to all wool fabrics . It is not wise to make up even expensive wool materials until they have been sponged. ( 3 ) Silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of both substitutes and weighting . Raw silk fibre is sometimes combined with wild silk ; with waste silk , which is a shorter fibre ; with cotton , mercerized and un-mercerized ; and with artificial silk , which has the same basis as cotton . It is also frequently filled or weighted with salts of tin or iron . Many kinds of weaves are found in silk fabrics ; those most used are the plain , the satin , and the rib , or the plain with a rib or corded effect made by the use of a heavy filling . Of the three named , the last usually proves least satisfactory for wear . Such silk as the bengalines and poplins are of this kind and are frequently woven with heavy cotton fillings . The cords which the filling forms frequently have their silk coverings , the warp-threads , worn off by slight friction or rubbing , and the beauty of the material is en-tirely gone . If materials made in this way become soiled or faded they can not be redyed , as the silk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless of very good quality , is apt to mat and separate in the dyeing and thus leave the cotton filling exposed . The result is extremely unsatisfactory . ( a ) Good Fibres and Substitutes. ? Good reeled silk fibre is long , strong , elastic , and lustrous . It differs in appearance from its substitutes . In untwisting yarns to determine the fibres present the general appearance of the yarn should be observed . The substitute fibres may be divided into two classes : ( i ) Animal , which includes wild silk and spun or waste silk . The wild silk fibres are generally coarse , broad , thick , and flat ; they have lengthwise markings . The spun or waste silk differs from the raw silk principally in being much shorter . This shortness of fibre may make a fuzzy thread or yarn , which will affect the surface of the fabric , just as cotton fabrics , because of the shortness of the fibre , have a tendency toward fuzziness . This fuzziness may be avoided by careful manufacture or it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary . ( ii ) Vegetable , or cellulose , fibres , which include all cotton fibres and the artificial silk . Cotton fibres are short and without lustre ; even when mercerized the lustre does not equal that of silk . They also lack elasticity and strength . Artificial silk has almost too much lustre . It has not the strength and elasticity of silk , is apt not to dye well ? that is , evenly ? and at present it does not stand constant moisture well . Its specific gravity is great , and all artificial-silk fabrics are heavy , as the yarns do not cover well and in consequence a large quantity must be used . Any silk material in which a quantity of cotton or artificial-silk fibre has been introduced lacks the elasticity and spring of the all-silk fabric . As a result it wrinkles much more when used . ( b ) Weighting. ? Silk fibre is often weighted with salts of tin or iron , the adulteration chosen depending somewhat upon the color of the material . Weighting , if done to excess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it much more unsatisfactory than are the various substitutes . The metallic weightings used are variously affected ; // for instance , some crystallize when exposed to air and light and act as ground glass would ; they cut the silk fibres and absolutely destroy the strength of the silk . Bargains in silks should be avoided , as after they have remained on shop-counters for any length of time they are apt to disintegrate rapidly when subjected to any use . In testing for the different fibres the waste or spun silk is the most difficult to identify as it is in general structure like the reeled silk . It is , however , shorter and the yarn made from it is frequently much fuzzier . When cotton and artificial-silk fibres are combined with raw silk they are easy to detect because the response to the burning test is the same as with combinations of cotton and wool ; that is , there is present the combination of animal and vegetable fibres . Artificial silk , like cotton , is cellulose and burns in the same way with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ordinarily burns quickly and with a darting flame , burns much more slowly and the framework of weighting remains . ( 3 ) Finish. ? Various kinds of dressing , such as glues , starches , and waxes , are used in silk finishing to produce various results . They are exceedingly difficult to detect . They may make the silk stiff , soft , lustrous , waterproof , or fireproof ; but they may also give poor quality of fibre the appearance of good . Dressings are not in general nearly as injurious as are weightings . While they frequently make a. fabric appear what it is not they do not destroy any silk fibre that has been used . If appearance and feel of silk are to be relied on in purchasing , in general it is wise to avoid stiff silks . The sof tfinished , such as crepe meteor and charmeuse of good quality , wear exceedingly well . In darker colors the satin surfaces sometimes take on an unattractive , rather greasy , polish after they have been worn some time . Good crepe de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fairly evenly balanced in warp and filling , wears well and usually washes satisfactorily . As has been said , silks with heavy fillingwise cords generally do not wear well , as the floating threads on the surface of the cords wear off . Bed- // ford cord is , however , an exception ; its cords are length-wise and are made with a woven surface rather than with floating threads . It gives excellent service . ( 4 ) Linen Fabrics. ? In linen materials the use of sub-stitutes must be considered . As linen is an expensive fibre , imitations are frequently attempted . Linen fibre is often combined with tow , with cotton , and with ramie . A variety of weaves may be found in linen fabrics . Those most frequently used are the plain and damask , or figured . As in cotton , the weaving may be loosely done and much sizing used . ( a ) Good Fibres and Substitutes. ? Good linen fibres are long , strong , and have a slightly transparent lustrous ap-pearance . In untwisting the yarn the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as sub-stitutes are vegetable , as is the linen , and in consequence they are rather more difficult to distinguish . Tow , the short linen fibre , is frequently used with the long or line fibre . It generally makes a somewhat rougher thread and consequently a less even and less desirable fabric . Of all the substitutes , cotton is more frequently used than any other because of its cheapness and the fact that it can by manufacture be made to resemble linen temporarily . It lacks the lustre , strength , and length of linen . Ramie is a long bast fibre like linen . It has strength , an even higher lustre than linen , and is exceptionally white in color . It is difficult to manufacture and can not withstand the test of wear as the linen does . It cracks and easily becomes fuzzy . It is not easy to identify when used with linen . The burning test is useless in identifying any of these fibres , as , being vegetable , they all respond in practically the same way . A linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because its fibres , being longer and smoother than the cotton , give a smoother surface which is more resistant to the flame . When linen yarn is tested for the presence of cotton , the linen fibres in comparison with the lustreless white of // the cotton show a slight transparent yellowness . If material is torn or threads are broken the torn ends of the two fibres are dissimilar ; the linen-fibre ends are straighter and smoother than the cotton , the ends of which are fuzzy and have a tendency to curl . Much of the cotton fibre used with linen is mercerized and is thus given additional lustre and strength . A test which is frequently used to distinguish pure linen from a cotton or a cotton-and-linen mixture is the dropping of water on the fabric . If it is pure linen the water spreads quickly and rather unevenly along warp and filling and dries quickly . For a similar test ink and glycerine also are sometimes used instead of water . The use of the latter gives a particularly good result as the linen shows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) Finish. ? Linen fabrics may be treated in finishing much as are cotton , with the difference that the sizing is used in many cases to conceal not only a loose weave but the presence of substitutes as well . The amount of sizing in a linen fabric may be tested , as in cotton , by rubbing , flecking with the finger-nail and soaking in water . Both cotton and tow give a fuzzy surface if used in linen materials . This fuzz may be temporarily concealed by sizing . In the wearing , however , it reappears and destroys the beauty of the fabric . The presence of cotton fibres affects the strength of a material as well as its beauty , as the cotton fibre has much less strength than the linen . Probably there is more difficulty experienced in the purchase of damask than in that of any other linen material . Good linen , because of the natural lustre of the fibre , is easily given a lustrous surface in finishing . The weave used for damask adds to this gloss , and but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been said , cheaper qualities of linen and combinations of linen and cotton may be given much the same appearance temporarily by the use of sizing and much polishing . The sized linen , however , has not the feel of good linen ; it is harsh , while the good is strong and leathery though soft and flexible . The expert depends as much upon the feel as upon the appearance of a fabric in // selecting linen . For the ordinary purchaser much experience in comparing qualities and prices is necessary . All the tests suggested here are exceedingly simple and require no apparatus . Even these are impossible , however , if samples can not be secured of a size to give sufficient length to both warp and filling yarns when unravelled . When these tests are not effectual , as in identifying different qualities of wool in a fabric , the purchaser must give the most careful consideration to a comparison of the appearance and feel of fabrics of varying qualities and prices , in order to establish a basis for judgment and a relation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND INSTRUCTIONS In making a costume there are many factors to be con-sidered each one of which plays its relative part in making the completed garment a success . Some of these ? they might be called preliminary ? such as the selection of ma-terial for color and wearing quality and the choice of design from an esthetic and economic standpoint , are discussed in other parts of this volume . They are referred to here only as showing their relative position in the whole prob-lem . The matters discussed in detail in this chapter are the various factors which determine good technique , such as accuracy and sequence , the use of good tools , the prepara-tion of material , a few general rules for cutting , marking , fitting , and the taking of accurate measures . I. CHOICE OF MATERIAL AND DESIGN When a dress is to be made there are two initial steps to be taken : choosing the material and choosing the design . The material may be purchased first and a suitable design made , or the design may be selected and the material suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two must be chosen with reference to each other and not as individual units . If the fabric is chosen first , the immediate consideration should be suitability to purpose , and at once the interdependence of all parts of the problem is evident . For on this question of the use of the costume depends also the choice of design , of color , and often of the wearing quality of one textile against the beauty of another . In the fashion world it is the textile which determines the 155 // design . The manufacturer produces new fabrics , and de-signs which seem best suited to these are worked out by the dressmakers . Many hours are spent by the dress-designers in the perusal of past fashions for suggestions and in modelling and draping in the materials themselves on living models . For this reason , as new fabrics appear on the shop-counters fashions simultaneously appear to which they seem well suited . Aside from these fabrics , some of which may be called novelties , there are also the many standard materials always on sale which change little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pass-ing fashions and easily lend themselves to a variety of de-signs . II . TECHNIQUE When the preliminary choice of material and design has been made , the actual execution of the technical part of the problem may be approached . Good technique has certain essentials which can not be overemphasized , such as accu-racy , system or sequence , simplicity of construction , and the use of good tools . A knowledge of " dressmaking-sew-ing " might be included in the list ; this differs from the others , however , in that it requires skill and is the result of experience ; while , on the other hand , accuracy and sys-tem are necessary in acquiring proper skill and experience . It is too often thought that a careful or good sewer must be also a good dressmaker . The terms are by no means synonymous . A knowledge of dressmaking-sewing appears to consist chiefly in appreciating where to " slight " and where to sew carefully ; in regular sewing there is no slight-ing ; there is a fixed standard of excellence . Accuracy in following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in fact , accuracy in all details , no matter how trifling is indispensable . The temptation is great to attempt saving time and labor by short cuts , by omitting certain steps which at the time seem scarcely necessary . Only a careful observance of sequence ? of the required order ? however , really saves time and labor and gives a satisfactory result . General Suggestions and Instructions 157 Simplicity of construction is necessary for the comfort . of the wearer . In making a design the openings for a garment are often not indicated . It is then the task of the dressmaker to work out a scheme of construction which will place all openings and fastenings so that they do not detract from the symmetry and charm of the design and at the same time are convenient and easy for the wearer to manage . Simplicity in design ? good taste shown in simple decoration ? is discussed elsewhere in this volume ( Designing , Part III ) . III . TOOLS Good tools are absolutely necessary for good work . By tools are meant such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pins , needles , emeries , tapemeasures , pincushions , tracing-wheels , tailor 's chalk , white and colored cottons , sewing-silk , and a skirt-rule or square , or both . It will save time and thought if , while sewing , all the tools . which are used frequently are conveniently placed on the table near the worker and always kept in the same relative position . i . Sewing-Boxes. ? A rather shallow sewing-box is very useful ; all the smaller tools may be kept in it in fairly good order . A convenient size is 9 " long , 6 " wide , 212 " high . At present , in red cloth , these cost from $q to $I2 per hundred . 2 . Sewing-Machines.  --  While the elaborate dresses intended for afternoon and evening wear require little machine stitching except for the linings , there is a larger class of garments of all materials which is dependent for finish , and often for decoration , upon good machine work . Many of these , even though well cut , well fitted , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This may be the fault of the worker or of the machine used . Of the two general kinds of machines manufactured the automatic , or single-thread , and the double , or two-thread  --  only one kind is suitable for dressmaking ; that is , the two-thread machine . As far as possible it is wise to buy machines of // standard make which have a recognized quality tested by years of constant use . This is particularly true of machines for school use , which are obviously subjected to rather severe treatment . There are a few well-known machines , used the world over , which are simple in construction , can readily be understood and managed , and are not easily put out of order . They have an established standard of quality to maintain and are found much more satisfactory than the machine of unknown or only locally known make . While the initial price of the latter machine may be small it frequently proves expensive in the end . To make its cost correspondingly small it must necessarily be made of materials which are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Thimbles. ? Celluloid is a good material and not expensive . Many inexpensive thimbles and also many of those which have had much wear are rough . They should be discarded because they will catch and pull the threads of the material and often ruin its appearance . 4 . Scissors . It is convenient to have both scissors and shears but not absolutely necessary . If only scissors are used , however , they should have fairly long blades in order to cut an even , straight edge . The blades should be kept sharp and without any catches in their edges . If the blade has one small place which will not cut , the threads of the material will be pulled each way several inches and much damage will be done . 5 . Pins. ? Fine pins , about one inch in length , with sharp points , are best for general use . If the pins are large they make holes in the material ; if too short they are difficult to manage . Steel dressmaking pins are excellent , but they must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly . 6 . Needles. ? Two kinds of needles , one for sewing and one for basting , are a convenience . The size for sewing depends , of course , on the material , but for ordinary use the papers of sevens to nines are best . For basting , milliner 's needles , sevens to nines , are satisfactory . 7 . Emery. ? Needles require frequent smoothing , which necessitates an emery in every sewing equipment . General Suggestions and Instructions 159 8 . Tape-Measures. ? Since tape-measures vary greatly in quality and occasionally in length of inch , they should be selected with care . Double measures , numbered on each side , are a necessity . The numbers should begin at opposite ends on the two sides ; then either end may be used . The brass clips at the ends are not desirable even in good measures ; they soon drop off , the unprotected ends fray , and the first inch is shortened . If there is no brass clip the end is made strong enough to stand wear . 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones with a tape for attaching to the belt or waist are good . They should be filled with curled hair and covered with material through which the pins slip easily . ? Wool material , like broadcloth or serge , is excellent . A convenient pincushion is one made in the shape of a crescent , with its points connected by a band long enough to allow the cushion to slip over the hand . When this cushion is worn on the back of the left hand it is always within easy reach . It is especially useful in fitting . If cushions are not used the worker quickly acquires the very bad habit of holding pins in the mouth . io . Tracing-Wheels. ? Tracing-wheels must be selected with great care . Even the best can not be used with all materials ; poor ones should always be discarded and no attempt made to use them even by experienced workers . A tracing-wheel is intended merely to mark the surface of the material ; yet in many cases , because it is poor or because too much pressure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material so that when worn it soon breaks or tears . ir . Tailor 's Chalk. ? Tailor 's chalk is used in making corrections after fittings and particularly in indicating the line of turning for skirt hems . In many instances it takes the place of the tracing-wheel , where the wheel is not safe or will not show . 12 . Basting-Cotton . Regular cotton , white , the size depending on the weight of the material , is best for basting . Basting-cotton , as it is at present made , should not be used ; it is generally coarse and uneven and leaves a mark when // pulled out , even if care is taken in cutting the stitches and removing short lengths at a time . Alterations after fitting are marked with colored cotton to distinguish them from the original basting-lines . Red should not be used , as it does not hold its color and light materials are marked by it . Light blue , yellow , and tan are generally safe . Many materials , such as soft silks and velvets , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the bastings are removed . Taffeta silks , even a good quality , frequently present as difficult a problem as these others , because not only do they show marks of basting but all pinholes as well . Fine needles for pinning and fine needles and sewing-silk or No. 120 cotton for basting give the best results . 13 . Skirt-Rules and Squares. ? In drafting , a square is indispensable , as it is difficult to strike a true angle with a skirt-rule . All squares are not true , however , and should be tested . If true at first they easily get out of order unless stayed at the corner with a metal brace . This should be remembered when purchasing . Skirt-rules sixty inches in length are often a great convenience but are not a necessity . They are more expensive and not always so easy to get as the regular yard-sticks . IV . PREPARATION OF MATERIALS Most materials need some preparation before being made into wearing-apparel . In general , all wash materials , cottons and linens , need shrinking ; all wool materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , drying , and usually pressing . With few exceptions all cotton and linen materials should be subjected to this process to remove the sizing which is usually added in the finishing . Practically no linen or cotton materials are sold which have not had some sizing applied ; it may be very little , merely to aid in finishing , or it may be a large quantity to conceal a loose weave and poor fibres . In shrinking , the water softens or dissolves the sizing . The threads // of the material , freed from the stiffening which was applied while they were under tension , close up , particularly the filling threads , and the material shrinks . The shrinkage is usually much greater in length than in width . The shrinking of a material requires a little time and care but is very simple . If the material is placed in the water , folded together in yard lengths as when purchased , it is much easier to manage and wrinkles less . The water should be lukewarm at first ; warmer water should be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material is not wrung in any way , but hung , still in its folds , it will dry without wrinkling and require little or no pressing . The drying may be done in the open air or in a warm room . The more care taken in hanging the material evenly the better condition it will be in and the less pressing it will require . If there are wrinkles , however , they should be pressed out . In doing this the iron should always follow the threads of the material straight across or up and down with the selvage . If , in pressing or hanging , the material has been stretched out of shape , it is almost impossible to place a pattern on it and have the straight or grain of the material run as it should . This straight of material is most important in dressmaking , for if the threads do not run correctly the garment will not fit properly and can not be laundered satisfactorily . 2 . Sponging. ? Practically all wool fabrics are sponged to prevent water-spotting . They usually shrink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material is to be made into garments requiring frequent pressing ; less shrinkage then occurs when the pressing is done . Sponging is not difficult to do at home unless there is a great quantity of material . If possible , a table should be used , as the ordinary ironing-board is not large enough to be convenient . The table should be covered with enough material to give a fairly soft , though firm , surface . For the outside cover heavy unbleached muslin is excellent ; it is strong and has no lint on its surface . The coverings must be fastened so that they will keep perfectly smooth , as the wrinkles will mar the surface of the material . 16 2 Dressmaking In working , the material is placed face down on the ironing-table , a wet cloth is laid over it , and a fairly hot iron used . After enough pressing has been done to make the cloth nearly dry it should be removed and the material itself should be pressed . Throughout the pressing care must be taken not to rub the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lift it slightly , otherwise the material will follow it and wrinkle . If the material has a nap the pressing must go with the nap . Only a small section of the material should be dampened and ironed at one time , as otherwise sections of it may dry before they can be pressed . If double-width material is to be used it can be left folded , with the right side inside . The wet cloth placed on one side is usually sufficient to steam through both thicknesses of the material unless it is very heavy . Both sides should have a final pressing , however , in order to have the full width of the material thoroughly dry and smooth . Many fabrics are said to be sponged before they are put on sale , but unless this fact can be verified it is wise either to have them sponged at the store or to do it at home . There are few tailors and dressmakers who do not sponge all the materials they use . 3 . Pressing. ? Much of the pressing which is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way as the pressing for sponging . When possible , all material should be pressed on the wrong side . Frequently the heat and weight of the iron is not sufficient to press the seams and hems in heavy fabrics as flat as is desired . A damp cloth should then be placed over the material while it is pressed . The steam from the cloth moistens the material slightly , and when the cloth is removed and the material pressed dry it will be perfectly flat . As in sponging , an iron must never be pushed or dragged over material . In many cases the material will follow the iron and become so wrinkled that it is practically impossible to make it smooth even by much subsequent pressing . The iron should be lifted from place to place until the surface to be pressed has been covered . General Suggestions and Instructions 163 If , in the process of making any garment , some of the pressing must be done on the right side , the material should be carefully covered so that the iron will not touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heat will occasionally change the color of a material , more especially silk ; for that reason it is wise to test the effect first on a small sample . Generally in this case the use of a cool iron will obviate the difficulty and press the material satisfactorily . Silk should be pressed as little as possible , as heat takes the life from it ; it requires no preliminary sponging or shrinking . To press the necessary seams and hems in silk they should be drawn with as much tension as possible over the surface of a not-too-hot iron . For pressing velvet ? except panne and mirror velvet ? a special kind of board is used , the surface of which is covered with small , flexible wire points . The pile of the velvet is pressed into these points by the use of an ordinary iron , the wrinkles are removed , and the velvet is made to look like new . Mirror velvet may be made from ordinary velvet by pressing . A damp cloth should be used on the right side of the velvet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are several general rules to be observed in cutting . Most materials with a nap must be cut so as to have the nap run down . Ordinary velvet and corduroy are , however , generally exceptions to this rule . If the richest effect possible is desired , the velvet can be made with the pile running up . The objection to this is that as the pile is standing up it catches the dust easily and is difficult to keep clean . Panne velvet should have its pile running down . Many materials which have no nap , such as henrietta and cashmere , show a difference in color if the pattern is not laid on so that the material all runs in one direction . A test for difference in color can easily be made by putting the two cut ends of the material together and holding them up . In that way the top and the bottom of the material I // are side by side , and it is easy to determine whether they catch and reflect the light in the same way . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns first in inexpensive material , such as cambric , . unbleached muslin , or calico , and have them tested and fitted . In cutting , the two corresponding pieces or sides of any garment should be cut together ; that is , two fronts of a shirt-waist or two sleeves , for otherwise two pieces may be cut for the same side . There are occasional exceptions to this , as , for instance , when the amount of material is limited and by cutting the pieces singly they may be more economically placed and material saved , or when the material has a decided up and down , because of nap or pattern , and must be cut separately to look and wear well . It is , in general , more economical if , in placing a pattern for cutting , its wider sections are placed at the cut end of the material . For instance , with a shirt-waist pattern the fronts are usually placed first , with the bottom of the pattern at the cut end of the material . This gives opportunity , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second piece of the pattern by the first and so save material . A similar plan may be adopted satisfactorily in cutting skirts . VI . MARKING In cutting a garment from any pattern the garment should be carefully marked , wherever necessary , with a tracing-wheel , tailor 's chalk , or tailor basting . The lines to be marked depend , of course , on the kind of garment . Seam-lines should always be indicated as a guide in basting for fitting , and such lines as the neck , armseye , waist , hip , and hem , which are needed not only for a guide in basting but for the actual making . ( I ) The Tracing-Wheel will mark two thicknesses at once and is , for that reason , especially convenient . It can not , however , be used on all materials . For instance , in soft fabrics and those with fancy surfaces the markings will not . show . General Suggestions and Instructions 165 ( 2 ) Tailor 's chalk marks only one surface at a time , and there is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) Tailor basting is in general a most satisfactory method of marking . It may be done through two thicknesses ; it stays in place as long as it is needed and does not injure any material . It requires , however , more time than either of the two other ways . When the cutting is done the seamlines are frequently marked with tailor 's chalk , which serves as a guide for the tailor basting . In making this basting a long double thread is needed . The sewing is done through both thicknesses , using first a short , then a long stitch . The thread is not pulled through tightly , as in the regular basting , but each long stitch is loose enough to form a loop . After the basting is finished the two pieces of material are carefully pulled apart as far as the loops will allow , and the stitches which hold them together are cut between the two layers of material . If this is correctly done there will be stitches enough on each piece of material to indicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the right ? is fitted , either for waist or skirt , and the other side is altered to correspond . There are exceptions to this as to every rule . If , for instance , the right shoulder or hip differs greatly from the left it may be necessary to fit the entire garment . The alterations should not be so great , however , as to accentuate the differences in the two sides . VIII . TAKING MEASURES The taking of measures is a very important preliminary to dressmaking ? for drafting , for modelling , or for the use of commercial patterns . Individual measures are necessary in constructing the drafts and in modelling . They are also necessary in testing the commercial patterns , which are all made to regulation measures and may need slight adjusting . Measures must be accurate , otherwise all the // patterns will be wrong , and , as they are rather difficult to take because of the varying outline of the figure , it is necessary to prove them by repetition . Much subsequent time and labor are saved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Measures should always be taken over the dress . Before taking the measures a band or tape should be closely pinned about the waist at the normal waist line . The tape should be a very little lower in front than in the back to give a good line . All the lengthwise waist measures are taken to the lower edge of this tape , which is resting on the waist line . In taking measures a regular order should be maintained and a record of the measures kept in a book . It is usual to take ( a ) the waist measure first , then ( b ) the sleeve and ( c ) the skirt . In measuring , as in fitting , all the work should be done on the right side . I. Waist Measures ( A ) Length Measures ( r ) Length of Back. ? This is taken from the little bone at the base of the neck straight down to the lower edge of the waistband. ( 2 ) Length of Front. ? This is taken from the centre of the hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower edge of the waistband ? an easy ? that is , fairly loose ? measure . ( 3 ) Depth of Dart. ? This measure is required in all the fitted garments but is not used in the shirt-waist . It is taken from the base of the neck at the centre front in a slanting line down to the point of the bust . It averages 8 to 9 inches . ( 4 ) Length of Underarm. ? It is very easy to have this measure too long or too short . One simple way of preventing this is to fold the tape-measure over a fairly long lead-pencil , which is then placed under the arm . The number of inches from the top of the pencil to the lower edge of the waistband in a straight line will give the correct measure . In taking this measure the shoulder must be kept in a natural position and the arm held down close to the figure . The tendency is to raise both shoulder and arm . In the normal figure the height of underarm equals one-half the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of back ? may be used with safety , as the armscye is always made large . // ( B ) Width Measures ( r ) Width of Back. ? This is taken one-quarter of the distance down , between the neck and waist , across the back from armscye to armscye . It is an important measure , especially in the drafting , as other measures are based on it . It must be neither too wide nor too narrow . On its correctness depends the fit of the entire waist . It is difficult to take , as the armscye line is rather intangible . No dependence can be placed on that line in the waist worn when the measure is taken , as armseyes vary greatly in shape and size . A tape placed around the armscye may assist in determining it accurately . This should extend in a fairly straight line from the top of the shoulder down and under the arm . Another method of determining the armscye is to place the thumb close up under the arm and let the fingers extend upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Front. ? This is taken rig " or 2 " below the hollow at the base of the neck , across the widest part of the chest , from armscye to armscye . This measure should not be too wide ; it may also be guided by the tape around the armseye. ( 3 ) Bust. ? In taking this measure it is necessary to stand behind the person who is being measured . It should be an easy measure over the fullest part of the bust , rather high under the arms and straight across the back . For a very thin person it is often wise to add an extra inch . ( 4 ) Waist. ? This measure may be taken along practically the same line as that used for guiding the length measures . It should , however , be a perfectly straight line , without any drop at the front , and a close measure . It will do for both waist and skirt . ( C ) Neck or Collar Measures Five measures should be taken : ( r ) Base of Neck. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used both for the neck of the waist and for the bottom line of the collar . If there is too large an opening at the neck of a waist it is almost impossible to adjust a good collar . If the neck is small it can easily be cut out . ( 2 ) Top of Neck. ? This should be a close measure . ( 3 ) Height at Back. ? This is taken from above the bone at the base of the neck to the height required . ( 4 ) Height at Front. ? This is taken from the hollow at the bas : of the neck to the height required . // ( 5 ) Height at Side. ? This is taken just back of the ear . It is measured from the base of the neck to the height required . It should not be more than n " or / " higher than the back . ( D ) Armseye This is taken at the joining of the arm and body , under the arm and up over the shoulder-bone , making a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . This also should be a fairly close measure . II . Sleeve Measures Four measures should be taken : ( r ) Length Inside. ? This is taken along the inside of the arm , from the little muscle where the arm joins the body to the bend of the elbow , and to the wrist at the base of the thumb . ( 2 ) Length Outside. ? Shoulder to elbow ; elbow to wrist . This is taken along the outside of the arm from the place where the widthof-back measure ended to the point of the elbow ( with the elbow bent so that the hand will rest on the chest ) ; from that same point to the wrist ending just beyond the bone at the wrist . ( 3 ) Size at Elbow. ? The tape-measure is placed in the bend of the elbow ; the elbow is then bent and the measure taken rather closely over the point . ( 4 ) Size at Hand. ? This measure is taken very closely over the knuckles with the thumb held in to the palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be passed . III . Skirt Measures ( r ) Waist. ? This measure has already been taken . ( 2 ) Hip. ? Two hip measures are necessary ; the first is taken over the fullest part of tu9b , ip , usually about 6 " below the waist ; the other is taken over the fullest part of the thigh , about roll below the waist . These two should be parallel . The second measure is chiefly used in testing the patterns and is usually from 4 " to 6 " larger than that taken at the 6 " point . The tape-measure should be placed about the hips and the thigh in a perfectly straight line , parallel to the floor , and free measures taken . ( 3 ) First Depth of Dart. ? This is taken from the waist line to the first hip line , directly over the hip . ( 4 ) Second Depth of Dart. ? This is taken from the waist line to the second hip line , directly over the hip . // Length of Front. ? This is taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre front . Length of Side. ? This is taken from the waist line to the floor over the hip . ( q ) Length of Back. ? This is taken from the waist line to the floor , exactly at the centre back . It is most important to take the last three measures to the floor , no matter what the desired finished length of the skirt may be , and to have the tape-measure fall in a perfectly straight line .. In order to simplify the work in dressmaking , which is given in the succeeding chapters , a definite division has been made between the making of patterns and the making of garments . In Chapters V , VI , and VII all the effort is directed to-ward securing satisfactory patterns ? satisfactory not only from the point of view of fit but , as far as possible , from that of design as well . The work deals not only with the various methods of making the patterns but also with their perfecting by fitting , testing , and altering . It includes di-rections for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting , the testing and altering of commercial patterns , and , based on experience in these first two meth-ods and aided by a knowledge of design , the making of more elaborate patterns in paper and on the dress-form . In Chapters VIII , IX , and X all the work is directed to-ward the making of the dress itself . Because of the limit-less variety of design and finish possible in the making of a garment and the constant change demanded by fashion , it is possible to give in this section only general rules , which must be adapted by the worker to the requirements of specific problems as they present themselves from time to time . The work deals with the various steps involved in the method of procedure : that is , the cutting , which in-cludes the correct placing of the pattern on the material and the various methods of tracing and marking the ma-terial ; the basting ; the fitting , which includes altering and rebasting ; and the general finishings , which include the foundation embroidery stitches . As has already been said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 171 and effort should be saved as far as possible . To do this , before beginning work all required materials and tools should be collected and conveniently placed and a general method of procedure decided upon . In order to secure satisfactory results the work must be carefully planned and the plan followed step by step , with no details omitted . " Short cuts " should be avoided by all except the experienced . CHAPTER V DRAFTING AND PATTERN-MAKING The drafting system presented here has two marked ad-vantages : the lack of expense connected with its use and the simplicity of its method . Both must be considered in teaching , especially in public schools . Many systems include a large number of complicated measures and numerous directions , most of which are ar-bitrary and consequently must be largely a question of memory . In addition , there are various expensive charts , curves , squares , etc. , required . In this system few meas-ures are taken , and the attempt is made to show , as far as possible , not only a definite reason for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure for which the pattern is to be made . There is but little memorizing , and all the tools necessary are a square , a tape-measure , drafting-paper , a soft pencil , and a good eraser . The garments drafted include : Shirt-Waist . Shirt-Waist Sleeve . Foundation Skirt . Tight-Fitting Waist and Collar . Tight-Fitting Sleeve . Kimono Waist . The same general construction lines form the basis for the shirt-waist , tight-fitting-waist , and kimono-waist pat-terns . As these are intended for foundation patterns from which any desired style may be developed , no marked changes in the drafting directions need be made to meet a change in fashion . The construction lines of the skirt pat-tern are based on the hip measures of the wearer and the width desired at the bottom of the skirt . By changing the second measure ? that of the width of the skirt ? according 172 // to the demand of fashion the pattern may be given any desired amount of fulness without changing the general method of its construction . Like all drafting systems and all commercial patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit unless the measures are accurately taken and the directions carefully followed , and even with care it may not always suit the unusual figure . Directions for possible changes are included which , it is hoped , will help to solve some difficulties . The practicability of drafting is sometimes questioned . As a basis for pattern-making and dress-designing , however , it is invaluable to the student . It is seldom used by dressmakers , except to acquire a set of foundation patterns of regular measurements , with good proportions and good lines , from which other patterns of varying measures are made as required . The designers in good dressmaking establishments have usually already acquired so much skill by experience that they do not need more of the preliminary drill which drafting gives . Many students and teachers sew well but they have little opportunity to become skilled through practice in the designing which is the i.1-portant factor in all good dressmaking . The appreciation for good line and proportion which is given by drafting and the subsequent pattern-making would seldom if ever be acquired by them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their part . The ability to make any desired pattern gives an independence which is invaluable and usually arouses greater interest and enthusiasm in the worker than does the use of a ready-made pattern . For beginners it is always wise to draft to regulation measures first , as it gives practice without any of the complications which may arise when individual measures are used . Regulation measures are given with each draft . All the drafts illustrated in this book are worked out according to regulation measures and , except those for the skirt and kimono waist , to a one-quarter-inch scale . The size of these necessitates the use of a one-eighth-inch scale . // The shirt-waist is generally given as the first problem in drafting because it is simple and because , whether cut from a commercial pattern or a draft , it is most often the first garment made . In making a dress , however , the logical procedure seems to be to cut the skirt first , if both the skirt and the waist are to be made from the same piece of ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waist may often be made from pieces . There is no law governing the order of drafting , and , as each draft is a complete problem in itself , the order of procedure may safely be decided by the worker with reference to her dress-making course as a whole . Individual measures are taken as described in the preceding chapter . The shirt-waist pattern is composed of two pieces , one half the back and one half the front . These may both be made , side by side , on one sheet of drafting-paper about 36 " in length . The back is drafted first . BACK In the upper left-hand corner of the paper two lines at right angles and of indefinite length should be drawn . The work then proceeds as follows : // Table // Table // Table // Table II . Fitting the Pattern After the drafting is finished there are certain directions to be followed preliminary to the cutting of patterns in material for fitting . ( r ) Testing the Draft. ? The draft itself should be carefully tested to the measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The length of back must be exact and the width of back and the bust lines in proper position . ( b ) The length of the underarm should equal the underarm measure plus W. ( c ) The size of the bust ? that is , the sum of C2K , the bust line of the back , and AB , the amount of the bust measure used for the front ? should equal one-half the whole bust measure plus 1 " . ( d ) The width of back and the width of chest must correspond to the measures taken . These should be measured for both front and back on the line D2H. ( e ) It is important to measure the neck of the front and back carefully . In measuring any curved lines the tape-measure should be held upright ; that is , on edge , with the numbered edge on the paper . If any of these measures vary much from the required size there has , without doubt , been a mistake in following the drafting directions . In this case the pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work . ( 2 ) Seam Allowances for a Paper Pattern. ? In general , it is simpler to use a paper pattern which is cut out exactly along the drafted lines than one which has the necessary allowances added to it for all seams . For the use of the inexperienced , or for those who have become accustomed to commercial patterns which have seam allowances , it is sometimes thought necessary to add the allowances to the drafted pattern before cutting it out . This should be avoided when possible , as it really complicates the use of the pattern and adds to the difficulty of the student . Without indicated seam allowances a garment is occasionally cut exactly the size of the pattern , without any thought on the part of the worker of the necessity for seams , and the garment is , in consequence , spoiled . // The required seam allowances for a paper pattern are as follows : i " at underarm and shoulder seams ; 14 " at the neck and armseye. ( 3 ) Marking the Paper Pattern. ? After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been added to it , it is wise to trace with a wheel the exact seam-lines for the shoulder , .. underarm , neck , and armseye , as these lines are very important in all the subsequent work on the waist , and the pencil-marks indicating them on the draft may be erased . In addition , the waist line should be carefully traced and cross-marks made at X2 of the back shoulder and X of the front . If , as is general , the paper pattern has been cut out exactly along the seam-lines , the only tracing necessary is that for the waist line and the cross-marks of the shoulder . ( 4 ) Placing the Paper Pattern on the Material and Cutting. ? Economy of material should always be considered in placing a pattern . The complete shirt-waist must be cut in order to give a satisfactory fitting . Half the pattern does not give sufficiently exact results . When possible , all pieces of the pattern should be cut at the same time , with corresponding ones together . This saves confusion and duplication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waist must be on a lengthwise straight of the material and the centre-back line of the back on a lengthwise fold . In cutting this pattern , in general , the economical method is to place the bottom of the shirt-waist fronts to the cut end of the material . This brings the smaller or top part of the pattern into the body of the material and gives extra space for the placing of the back . After the pattern is arranged with attention to the straight of the material the seam allowances should be measured and the pattern pinned in place and cut . The seam allowances for the cloth pattern are the same as those already suggested for the paper ; that is , I " at underarm and shoulder seams and / " at neck and armseye . In addition , however , there should be i " added at each centre front in order to pin the waist together in the fitting . ( S ) Marking the Cloth Pattern. ? The cloth pattern should be marked to indicate the exact size of the pattern as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be used , supplemented where necessary by colored bastings . A tracing should be made to indicate : ( a ) the centre-front line , for pinning the waist together ; ( b ) the seams and cross-marks of the shoulder and underarm , where the waist is to be joined by basting ; ( c ) the neck line ; ( d ) the armscye line ; ( e ) the waist line ; ( f ) the centre-back line . In addition to these tracings colored bastings should be placed in the centre-front and centre-back lines , the waist , neck , and armsDrafting // eye lines . They prevent the loss of these important lines during work , as the marks of the tracing-wheel are not permanent ; they also aid in indicating the direction of the neck and armseye very distinctly during the fitting . The position of these lines is especially important , as they determine the location of the sleeve and the collar-band. ( 6 ) Basting the Pattern. ? All seams should be basted with white thread and not with colored , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seams should be pinned together before basting . ( a ) For the underarm seam the waist and armseye lines are matched and both the pinning and basting are done between these two points and continued 1 " below the waist line . ( b ) For the shoulder seam , the neck lines , the cross-marks at X2 of the back and X of the front , and the armscye lines are matched and pinned . As the front shoulder seam is / " shorter than the back , it requires stretching between these points to give it sufficient length . After it is stretched it should be basted , holding the back shoulder toward the worker . The stretching of the front shoulder along the seam-line makes the waist spring better into the curve of the shoulder of the wearer . ( 7 ) Fitting the Pattern. ? Before the waist is ready for a fitting some further preparation is necessary . ( a ) Making a Belt. ? For this , non-elastic tape / " in width may be used or a band of the material itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2 " or 3 " longer than the waist measure to allow for lapping and pinning at the centre front . On the two lengthwise edges and across the two ends " should be turned in and creased . When the piece is folded lengthwise in the centre it makes a band about 3q. " wide and the desired length . As a guide in attaching to the waist , the centre of the band should be marked with colored basting . ( b ) Gathering the Waist. ? As the pattern is drafted to have extra fulness at the waist line in the back , one row of gathering should be put in at the waist line from underarm seam to underarm seam . This makes the arrangement of the fulness into the belt a very simple matter in the fitting . The fulness at the front may also be gathered into the belt if desired . If it is left free , however , the laundering of the waist will be much simpler . ( c ) Fitting the Waist. ? For the first fitting the waist is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , is fitted , unless the right and left sides of the wearer vary greatly . In this case time is saved by fitting the entire waist at once . 18 2 Dressmaking The waist should first be settled to the figure and pinned at the centre front exactly on the indicated lines . The shoulder and underarm seams should be turned to the front . The belt is then put on with its lower edge just at the normal waist line of the figure , even though the line of gathering in the waist may not be correctly placed . The centre mark of the belt should be placed exactly at the centre-back line of the waist and pinned . The fulness is regulated after the direction of the underarm seam is determined . This seam should appear to be a continuation of the shoulder seam and should fall from the centre underarm straight down to the waist . If the back of the wearer is very wide its appearance is sometimes improved by having these seams slant very slightly toward the back . After the belt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suit the figure . It is usually a good plan to distribute the gathers across the back to within about 2 " of the underarm seams , to avoid an evidence of much fulness . If the waist is bloused slightly it gives a straighter and more becoming line to the back . In fitting the waist it is important to observe the following : ( i ) In general the collar line should run from the bone at the base of the neck in the back in a good line or curve to the hollow in front , just above the two small bones . The line should be rather high at the side , just under the ear . The shape of the neck or its length may affect this line slightly ; that is , for a long neck the line should be as high as possible in front and for a short neck low . If the neck is too high or too tight it may be improved by slashing a little . The shoulder seam should be taken up if the neck is too large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern , is made for the shoulder of regulation height ; in consequence , if the shoulders of the wearer are very square or very sloping changes are required . If the shoulders are square they lift the waist too much at the point or end of the shoulder and there will be a wrinkle running across the waist . This should be remedied by taking up the shoulder seam near the neck and cutting out the surplus material , which is thus brought up around the neck . If the shoulders are very sloping the waist drops at the end of the shoulder and the wrinkle will extend downward from the neck toward the armscye . To change this the shoulder seam is taken up at the point of the shoulder , and the armscye cut out at the underarm seam . ( For further details , see The Use of Commercial Patterns. ) ( iii ) After such changes have been made care must be taken to reestablish a good neck line and shoulder seam . The direction of the // ( a ) If the shirt-waist sleeve has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the waist and fitted at this time . ( For directions , see Shirt-Waist Sleeve. ) ( b ) A collar-band may also be made , basted to the waist , and fitted . This is a good plan for tailored shirts which require a neck-band . It need be only a straight band , unless the neck is much smaller at the top than at its base . ( i ) To prepare this , a strip is cut on the lengthwise of the material 2 " in width and the size of the neck plus r " in length . On the two lengthwise edges 4. " should be turned in and creased and on each end W. When the piece is folded lengthwise in the centre it makes a band wide and the correct length to meet at the centre front without lapping . As a guide in attaching to the waist i ' the centre of the band should be marked with colored basting . ( n ) The neck of the waist may be slipped into it , pinned evenly , and basted . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of basting which indicates the correct neck line . If the worker is inexperienced this band will help to keep the neck of the waist from stretching while it is being handled . Table Individual measures are taken as described in the preceding chapter . The shirt-waist sleeve pattern is composed of only one piece . To make the pattern in one piece it is necessary to have the lengthwise centre of the sleeve drafted on a fold of paper . If a piece of paper 27 " in length and 24 " in width is folded along its lengthwise centre it will be large enough for any pattern . After folding the paper the work proceeds as follows : ( r ) To Determine the Top of the Sleeve : Table // Table ( 2 ) To Determine the Bottom of the Sleeve : This is the same for the upper and the under parts of the sleeve . AM = The inside length of the sleeve minus the width of the cuff , measured down from point A on the folded edge of the paper . // Table II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished there are certain directions to 1 followed preliminary to the cutting of patterns in material f , fitting . ( r ) Testing the Draft. ? The draft itself should be tested to tl measures used for ( a ) length of sleeve and ( b ) widths and all nece nary corrections made . ( 2 ) Seam Allowances for a Paper Pattern. ? In general it is mu ( simpler to use a paper pattern which is cut out exactly along tl drafted lines than one which has the necessary allowances add ( to it for all seams . If it is thought necessary to add them , hog ever , they should be as follows : 1 " on the lengthwise seams ; / " the top ; / " at the bottom . ( 3 ) Marking the Paper Pattern. ? Before the paper pattern is ci out some tracing is necessary to make the complete sleeve . ( a ) With the paper still folded as for drafting , the underar curve , DJELC , the line at the bottom , ON , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the under half of tl paper . When the paper is opened the complete outline of the slee ' is indicated and the pattern may be cut out . ( b ) Marks shou also be made to indicate the points between which gatherings a to be placed at the top and bottom of the sleeve to regulate tl fulness. ( i ) For the top J and H indicate the points between whi ( gatherings are required . ( ii ) For the bottom the position of tl // placket should first be marked . This is r " in from the folded cage on the under side of the sleeve , point R. From this point the gatherings are made around the entire bottom of the sleeve . ( 4 ) Placing the Paper Pattern on the Material and Cutting. ? Economy of material should always be considered in placing a pattern . When possible the two sleeves should be cut at once . For a pattern , however , only one sleeve is necessary . The centre line of the sleeve indicated by the fold of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . The seam allowances necessary for fitting should be measured and the pattern pinned in place and cut . The allowances for the cloth pattern are the same as those already suggested for the paper ; that is , r " on the lengthwise seams ; 14 " at top ; / " at bottom . ( 5 ) Marking the Cloth Pattern. ? The cloth pattern should be marked to indicate the exact size of the pattern as drafted , to give the correct seam-lines . A tracing-wheel may be used . The entire sleeve should be traced and the location of the placket and the marks for the gathering at the top should be indicated . ( 6 ) Basting the Pattern. ? The sleeve should be laid on a table and folded along its centre line . If it is correctly drafted its tracings match . They should be pinned together and basted , beginning at the wrist . The basting should be done with white thread and the stitches need not be short , as there is no strain . ( 7 ) Fitting the Pattern. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top and bottom and basted into the waist , as its general fit and hang can not be otherwise determined . It is not necessary to add a cuff ; the bottom of the sleeve may be drawn up to the required size and the gathering-thread held by a pin during the fitting . ( a ) Gathering the Sleeve. ? The first row of gathering at the top should be 14 " in from the edge , which is also the line of basting . The other should be / " in from that , to hold the gathers in place . ( b ) Pinning and Basting the Sleeve to the Waist. ? In pinning and basting a sleeve to a waist the position of the work is important . The following rule may be observed for placing the sleeve in the correct position in the waist . Using a point r " back of the shoulder seam , the armscye of the waist should be folded in half and the opposite point marked . This point indicates the location of the sleeve seam . The sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In doing this : ( i ) The waist should be held with the wrong side and the underarm toward the worker . ( ii ) The sleeve should be drawn up into the armscye and the seam pinned to the point indicated . // ( iii ) The ungathered or underarm part of the sleeve should be pinned to the underarm of the waist , matching the armscye tracings of the waist and the sleeve . ( iv ) With the waist still toward the worker , the gathering-threads should be drawn up around the upper part of the sleeve until the sleeve fits the armseye. ( v ) With the waist still in the same position , but with the shoulder turned back so that the upper part of the sleeve can be more easily seen , the gathers should be adjusted . ( vi ) The centre of the sleeve and the largest amount of the fulness should fall over the shoulder-bone , which in most cases is from 34 " to 1W ' forward of the shoulder seam . ( vii ) The rest of the fulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the points which indicate the end of the gathering . ( c ) Fitting the Sleeve. ? The fit of the sleeve depends somewhat on the position of the line of the armscye at the shoulder . This changes as the shoulder of the waist is long or short , according to the demands of fashion . If the shoulder is short more length may be required from point A to point D. The curve from point D to point C may be too full in proportion to the length from point D to point A and cause a bulge in the sleeve just in front of the shoulder . The sleeve should be put on right side out , with the armscye seam turned up on the shoulder . ( i ) The straight thread of the material should fall in a straight line down the arm from the bone in the shoulder . If the fulness is not so arranged as to do this the location of the gathers should be changed . ( ii ) If the sleeve is too large or too small it should be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too tight . ( iii ) The length should be observed ; there should be enough extra length over the elbow to prevent the sleeve 's pulling up at the back and away from the wrist when the elbow is bent . ( 8 ) Altering the Pattern. ? After the fitting and before removing the sleeve from the waist it should be so marked that it may be put in again without difficulty , with the proper arrangement of fulness . When the sleeve is taken out and the seam opened , all required changes should be indicated with the tracing-wheel or colored cotton and the paper pattern altered to correspond . The paper pattern is to be kept for future use . ( 9 ) Rebasting the Pattern. ? If many alterations have been necessary , the sleeve should be rebasted and placed in the waist , following the directions given for the first basting . ( ro ) Refitting the Pattern. ? In refitting , the waist and sleeve should be put on as before , with the armscye seam of the sleeve turned to the shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang and any required changes made . // III . FOUNDATION SKIRT Table Individual measures are taken as described in the preceding chapter . The skirt draft is based on the hip measure and the width of the skirt at the bottom . No matter what these measures may be , the method of procedure is practically the same for all , but the results differ as the skirts are narrow or full ; that is , for a narrow or straight skirt the curve of the waist line is large and has little depth , and as the skirt increases in width at the bottom the curve of the waist becomes shorter and deeper . The two drafts shown here illustrate this point . The regulation measures have been used ; the first skirt is about 6o " in width at the bottom , the second is a few inches less than three yards . In drafting a skirt which is to measure less than two yards around the bottom , 2 " should be added to the full hip measure . This augmented measure is then used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is removed later in the fitting by the use of darts or gores . This change in the hip measure is not required for full skirts , as their width at the bottom gives sufficient size at the hip . For making the draft , a piece of paper the length of the skirt plus ro " is needed . In the upper left-hand corner of it two lines at right angles should be drawn . The work then proceeds as follows : ( r ) To Determine the Rectangle Which Forms the Foundation for the Draft : // Table // Table ( 5 ) To Correct the Length of the Line KE and Locate Permanently the Waist Line , HE : In determining the line at the bottom of the skirt the length of back and the length of side measures were made equal below the hip line . In consequence , if the full length of back measure differs from the full length of side measure as taken , the difference must be adjusted either by adding to or subtracting from the centre-back // line above the hip line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made the right length the waist line should be adjusted by gradually raising or lowering it , as required , from point H toward point E to give the desired curve . The hip line , as has been said , should always parallel the line at the bottom of the skirt , and all changes in length should be made above it . It is above the hip line that the contour of the normal figure varies . This draft gives a foundation-skirt pattern of any desired width without gore divisions . II . Testing the Foundation-Skirt Pattern Before proceeding beyond this point it is wise to test this foundation skirt to the measures used to be sure that no mistakes have been made in drafting . ( r ) Hip Lines. ? The hip line 6 " down should be , for a straight skirt , 2 " more than the correct hip measure ; for a full skirt , the correct hip measure ; at ro " down , for the straight skirt , it should be the required size ; for a full skirt it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the required size . ( 2 ) Lengths. ? The full lengths at centre front , centre back , and side ( over the hip ) should correspond with the measures taken . These lengths at centre front , centre back , and side should measure exactly the same below the hip line . All differences in length should be adjusted and indicated above that line . ( 3 ) Waist Line. ? In all skirt patterns less than two yards or two and a half yards at the bottom there is extra width at the waist line . In fitting the foundation pattern this extra width must be regulated by darts , which will extend from the waist line below the 6 " hip line and take out the 2 " added there . Most skirts measuring two and a half or three yards at the bottom require small darts , if any , because their width gives them a short and curving waist line . The exact amount to be removed at the waist is determined by subtracting one-half the correct waist measure from the waist measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the waist and hip varies . A waist small in proportion to the hip will require longer and deeper darts than a large one . It is more satisfactory to use several small darts than one large one . These darts must be carefully placed to give good shape to the pattern . The largest , in depth and length , is always made over the hip because of the greater curve of the figure at the hip . The other somewhat smaller darts should be placed at the side front and side back . // In placing the darts the work is found to be much simplified if some gore division , such as the four or six gore , is first indicated on the pattern . If this is done the darts should then be so arranged as to give good seam-lines and good proportions to the gores . Before any gore divisions are made the pattern should be cut out , for convenience , along the drafted lines . III . Dividing the Foundation-Skirt Pattern into Gores All the directions given in skirt cutting are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible to follow them absolutely where individual measures vary greatly from the regulation , they will serve to indicate , as do the directions for gore divisions , a general method by which to work . Directions for the division of skirts into gores are very difficult to give , because the amount of fulness used in a skirt varies frequently , as fashion demands , and with each variation requires a change in the size and number of the gores . The directions given here are merely suggestive and as such may serve as a foundation for required variations . In dividing a plain skirt into gores , divisions are indicated at the hip line and at the bottom . The points showing these desired divisions are connected by lines which are continued to the waist line , where all additional fulness is later taken out by the darts . In all gore divisions the width of a gore at the bottom should bear a certain proportionate relation to its size at the hip . As the width at the bottom increases the proportion increases , or vice versa. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at the bottom sIz to z/ times the hip and is to have a front gore or panel , a back gore or panel , and a side gore with dart at hip . ( a ) Front Gore or Panel . ( i ) At the hip line : of I2 the hip measure . ( ii ) At the bottom : i times the width at the hip . ( iii ) Connect the points at the bottom and the hip with a line which extends to the waist line . ( b ) Back Gore or Panel . ( i ) At the hip line : of the hip measure . ( ii ) At the bottom : i times the width at the hip . ( iii ) Connect the points at the bottom and the hip with a line . which extends to the waist line . ( c ) Line for Direction of Dart at the Hip . ( i ) At the hip line : divide the remaining amount of the hip line in half . // ( ii ) At the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( iii ) Connect the points at the bottom and the hip with a dotted line , which extends to the waist line . ( d ) Darts to Remove Fulness at the Waist Line . ( i ) Front gore or panel : / " from the side seam . ( ii ) Side gore : 14 " from the front edge ; A " to 34 " from the back edge . ( iii ) Back gore or panel : 14 " to / " from the side seam . ( iv ) Dart at the hip : the remaining amount of extra fulness is taken out on each side of the dart line in such proportion that the sum of the front panel and half the side gore will equal the other half of the side gore plus the back panel . ( 2 ) Six-Gore Divisions. ? A skirt with six gores may easily be made from the four-gore skirt , which has the front and back panel and the side gore with a dart . To do this the wide side gore is made into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction for which is already determined . ( 3 ) Five-Gore Divisions. ? For a skirt which is at the bottom i:Z or I/ times the hip and is to have a back gore or panel , a side gore , and a side front gore . This gives a seam at the centre front which is very satisfactory for wash skirts . ( a ) Back Gore or Panel . ( i ) At the hip line : / of I2 the hip measure . ( ii ) At the bottom : I I2 times the width at the hip . ( iii ) Connect the points at the bottom and the hip with a line which extends to the waist line . ( b ) Front and Side Gores. ( i ) At the hip line : divide the whole hip line in half and mark r " to the front . ( ii ) At the bottom : divide the remaining amount from the back gore to the centre front in half and mark r " to the front . ( iii ) Connect the points at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the waist line . ( c ) Darts to Remove Extra Fulness at Waist Line. ? These vary according to the proportion of the waist to the hip and the width of the skirt at the bottom . ( i ) Back gore or panel : / " to I2 " from the side seam . ( ii ) Front gore : r Iz " to r 34 ' from the back edge . ( iii ) Side gore : / " to I14 " from the front edge ; / " to I14 " from the back edge .
