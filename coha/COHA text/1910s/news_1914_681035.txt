txt Here is Fred Larkin , young , red headed , tastefully attired in blue overalls and jumper . Mr. Larkin has a small job in the power plant of an electric light company at Aurora , Ill . There Is nothing startling or picturesque about Mr. Larkin 's appearance , Ills salary , or his work . He is happily married to a young woman who knows how to fry eggs and make n good cup of coffee . It will be difficult to get a thrill or a pang out of what lady novelists sometimes refer to us his soul life . gr . Larkin is interesting , if at all , simply because he is cast for the part of a business David as opposed to the Goliath of one of the largest and most ferocious of man eat . Jag trusts . Incidentally , it may as well be confessed that ilr . Larkin himself has no slightest idea of the rale he is about to undertake . He Is simply a widea wake young chap , anxious to make money and get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious thought or two to his work , and is always ready to shake hands with an opportunity , that is merely because he Is In earnest about his plan for becom. lag a real factor in the world of business . THE fashionable but somewhat coward- ' ly philosophy which blames most of our human failures on environment  --  which Is the same as blaming it on the other fellow  --  will call this story reactionary . They will say that it is the story of an exceptional man , and therefore not typical or worth while . All of which may very well be true . Fred Larkin 's real career started with a big piece of bad luck . He had become assistant foreman in the power plant , and was looking still higher , when the doctors said that his wife was threatened with tuberculosis . The Larkin family was ordered to leave Aurora and settle in California . Fortunately they had enough Money saved up to pay the car fare . When they struck the Pacific coast the development of hydro-electric power was Just beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been harnessed to a turbine wheel , and two big dynamos were turning out electric juice faster than a convenient market could be found for it . LARKIN found a small job in this new plant . Part of his work was the reading of the electric meters in the houses of the village . That brought him into more or less Intimate contact with the housewives , and he came to study their needs in the electric line . if water running downhill could generate electricity so cheaply . Why could n't the surplus current produced by the company which hired him be used for heating , cooking , and other domestic purposes ? They sent for some electric flatirons and ether electric devices , and they were placed in the kitchens of the village . But the blamed things were not satisfactory . The women told their troubles to Larkin as he went about reading the meters , and he took pains to find out just where each of the electric devices tell down . By this time he had learned a lot about volts , and ohms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also he had always been handy with tools . It . the evening after working hours he started to experiment in his own kitchen to see it he could n't fix the electric flatirons and other contraptions so they would work Prop . arty . And presently he succeeded -- o , Hemet ' to . WHEN he had a thousand dollars savei UP he quit his job and started on to Manufacture his improved electric de . ' lees for the household . The workshop wa Woodshed back of the cottage in which and his wife were living . He eie ' persuaded his father to invest a second thousand dollars in the business . It carne hard , for money was not plenty with the elder Larkin in those days , but it has proved what even the most greedy would call a good thing ? at present the old man draws an income of $100 a month from his stock . There was no iron foundry in the small town where Larkin started to make his electric Irons . They had to be brought from a larger town eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them delivered . And then Larkin showed a keen eye for economy , and made a little deal which would not be worth recording except for the influence it had when , a little later , he badly needed financial backing . EVERY morning a big two horse laundry wagon was driven over empty from the larger town to the village where Larkin 's shop was located . Larkin got after the driver of this wagon and arranged with the laundryman to bring over the castings each morning , at a cost of less than $1 a load . The laundryman was telling about it one day in the presence of an old banker . " That young fellow will get along , " the banker said . " I 'd like to have a little share in his business . " In a few months the Larkin flatirons also began to break down . Scores of them were turned back on his hands as unsatisfactory . Orders fell off . Bills came due . If he could only get a little time and a little money to tide him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make them stand up . He applied to the laundryman for a loan , and the laundryman told him what the banker had said . THE banker heard his story , asked a few questions , and wrote a check for $1,000 to cover immediate needs . Larkin went back to work and discovered how to snake his goods stand the strain of constant heat and hard work . He and the banker organized a real company , each of them holding 50 per cent of the stock . They began a selling campaign on a somewhat larger scale . Then the trust got busy . Larkin studied the methods of the trust as he had studied the irons in the kitchen . Because the trust was so big , because its organization was so complete and comprehensive , it necessarily moved slowly . Larkin took advantage of that slowness . While the trust was getting ready to make a campaign on the electric Iron Larkin came out with an electric bread toaster . For years he sprang a new device on the market about once every month . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PrEEN he tackled the advertising situ ' a tion . His was and had always been a hot weather business . In the winter time women were glad enough of a hot kitchen fire . Larkin got ? an idea . In December he started a big advertising campaign , calling on men generally to make Christmas presents of his time and labor saving devices to their wives and sweethearts . The factory was swamped with orders . At present there are two plants busy manufacturing the Larkin goods , which were sold last year to the value of more than $1,000,000 . The point to this story ? if it has one ? is that , in spite of trusts and combinations , labor unions , the high cost of living , and all the modern lions in the path , it is still posBible for a young man who uses his head as well as his hands to reach a position where his income tax goes up above 1 per cent .
