txt Teachers ' Salaries . On Saturday . Oct. 24. there was held a State Civil Service examination for the position of court attendant , the salary of which position ranges from a minimum of 5i.500 to a maximum of $1,800 . The examination was a Very simple one which anybody of ordinary intelligence could pass without preparation . The time given for the examination was six hours , whereas two anti a half hours would have been Moro Chan enough time . The qualifications to take the examination were , I understand . only an age limit . I wish to contrast the above facts with those concerning the elementary school teacher , whom the city believes it is Overpaying and who it opines is not doing enough work ( witness the fact of the late attempt on the part of the Board of Estimate to have him teach in the vacation schools during the Summer without pay ) . They an a class are required to have about five times the Intelligence demanded of the candidates for the position of court attendant They are required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination given by Superintendent Niaxwell , said examination having -a country-wide reputatiod for its severity . And in return the teacher receives the stupendous salary of $720 a year with an increase of $60 per riimum after the third year . So you see that in order to be placed on a par with the court attendant the teacher must teach at least fifteen years .
