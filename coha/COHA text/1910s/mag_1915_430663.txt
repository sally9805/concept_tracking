 | OF all the verse that in England has been inspired by the Great War . one sonnet sequence will live as the perfect expression of the soul of a nation awakened to self-consciousness in the hour of its trial . The five sonnets of which it is composed were the work of one of the younger generation of poets , a man of great personal beauty , a lover of life , whose work , until the outbreak of the war , was pregnant with promise that had not quite attained fulfilment . At the outbreak of the war Rupert Brooke joined the force that was sent to relieve the beleaguered city of Antwerp ; he participated in the siege and in the subsequent retreat , returned to England to join a training camp , and in February of this year sailed with the British Expeditionary Force bound for the Dardanelles . He never reached there , however , for he died and was buried on the island of Lemnos , in the Aegean , on the twenty-third of April . His work , until August of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always simple . His view of life had in it that epicureanism which we find in Horace and in the Elizabethans , but it was an epicureanism troubled by the indecision of youth , and by the intensity of spirit and of passion , of intellect and of emotion , that were continually at warfare within him . He loved the beautiful things in life , the experience of youth , and nature in her infinite variety . and his earlier verse reflects this prodigality of the things of sense that he experienced in the life around him . He was fascinated by the concrete , and in his verse dwelled for a time only upon those things that are either beautiful or hideous to see and hear , to taste , to smell , or to feel , and in the expression of such things he attained a rare degree of mastery in the manipulation of beautiful and vigorous language . He was too athletic both physically and spiritually , too much a lithe young animal in his joy for life , to be a decadent , and altho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing the Channel , and the brutal sensuality evoked in the vulgar soul by music , he did so only because he loved all life indiscriminately , and felt that in its expression both the beautiful and the hideous must have a part . But chiefly two experiences drew him most , that of love , and that of nature , and of these he sang with subtle charm . In his love of both there is present that platonic progression from the purely sensuous to the spiritual , the flood of emotion finding its resolution in a quietude of soul that he himself did not trouble to analyze . His love of women was , perhaps , rather a love of woman , a love at first wholly sensual , rising beyond the vesture of the body to the experience of spirit that was felt rather than understood . The experience of nature was , for him , much the same , and this he has exprest with perfect beauty in " Blue Evening . "  | Above all else , he hated time and the forces of change which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his poems express the merciless horror of decay , the thought of which insidiously mars even the most perfect beauty . What wonder , then , that in his earlier verse the feeling is that of " carpe diem , " love of beauty during its brief life , with no thought for thought ? For of thought he was , at first , afraid ; life seemed too full , in its little moment , to lose aught by thinking , or by questioning the relative values of its significance . But this was but a passing phase . Unconsciously , perhaps , he was a platonist , believing that sensuous beauty is the index of something nobler , and that the resolution of all great emotion is in the spirit . There are poems in which he has exprest the desire for escape from life , for retreat , and quiet , and the opportunity to see life intellectually . And it is in these poems that he was preoccupied with death , not as the destroyer of beauty , but as the release of the spirit into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he knew it , and in his verse there were indications of another and more serious mood , less troubled , less complex , and richer in its philosophy , when the war beat down upon the world , and engulfed all of Europe . And in those early days of horror , such days as " try men 's souls , " he matured in spirit , found himself , and in his verse exprest the calm , clear spirit with which the English have traditionally accepted the inevitable . He went forth with a premonition of his own- death , as many a soldier has gone , resigned , alert , keen for his duty to the tradition and the countryside that he had loved so passionately . He was , as he has written in the sonnet entitled " Peace , " thankful for the great hour that awakened him from sleeping , and " all the little emptiness of love " and that sent him forth with " . . . hand made sure , clear eye , and sharpened power , To turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown old and cold and weary . " But the sonnet by which he will always be known is " The Soldier , " a poem that in the simplicity of its beauty seems rather of the England of Elizabeth than of today , but that in its essential spirit expresses the soul of England as it has been since , when it was threatened by the Armada , the consciousness of nationality first crystallized : " If I should die , think only this of me : That there 's some corner of a foreign field That is forever England . There shall be In that rich earth a richer dust con-cealed ; A dust whom England bore , shaped , made aware , Gave , once , her flowers to love , her ways to roam , A body of England 's breathing English air , Washed by the rivers , blest by suns of home .
