SCENE is that archological mystery , a Greek interior . A door on the right leads to the King 's library , one on the left to the apartment of the Queen . Back right is the main entrance leading to the palace . Next this , running the full length of the wall , is a window with a platform , built out over the main court . Beyond is a view of hills bright with lemon groves , and in the far distance shimmers the sea . On the wall near the Queen 's room hangs an old shield rusty with disuse . A bust of Zeus stands on a pedestal against the right wall . There are low coffers about the room from which hang the ends of vivid colored robes . The scene is bathed in intense sunlight . Tsumu is massaging the Queen . HELENA There 's no doubt about it . TSUMU Analytikos says there is much doubt about all things . HELENA Never mind what he says . I envy you your complexion . TSUMU falling prostrate before Helena . Whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Tsumu . You make me nervous tumbling about like that . TSUMU still on floor . Why does the great Queen envy Tsumu ? p. 3 HELENA Get up , you silly . She kicks her . I envy you because you can run about and never worry about getting sunburnt . TSUMU on her knees . The radiant beauty of the Queen is unspoilable . HELENA That 's just what 's worrying me , Tsumu . When beauty is so perfect the slightest jar may mean a jolt . She goes over and looks at her reflection in the shield . I ca n't see myself as well as I would like to . The King 's shield is tarnished . Menelaus has been too long out of battle . TSUMU handing her a hand mirror . The Gods will keep Sparta free from strife . HELENA I 'll have you beaten if you assume that prophetic tone with me . There 's one thing I ca n't stand , and that 's a know-all . Flinging the hand mirror to the floor . TSUMU in alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little mirrors are useless . His shield is the only thing in which I can see myself full-length . If he only went to war , he 'd have to have it cleaned . TSUMU putting the mirror on a table near the Queen . The King is a lover of peace . p. 4 HELENA The King is a lover of comfort . Have you noticed that he spends more time than he used to in the library ? TSUMU He is busy with questions of State . HELENA You know perfectly well that when anything 's the matter with the Government it 's always straightened out at the other end of the palace . Finish my shoulder . She examines her arm . I doubt if there is a finer skin than this in Sparta . Tsumu begins to massage the Queen 's shoulder . HELENA taking up a mirror . That touch of deep carmine right here in the center of my lips was quite an idea . TSUMU busily pounding the Queen . An inspiration of the Gods ! HELENA The Gods have nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw at the circus . I ca n't understand how these bad women have such good ideas . Helen twists about . TSUMU If your majesty does n't sit still , I may pinch you . HELENA boxing her ears . None of your tricks , you ebony fiend ! TSUMU crouching . Descendant of paradise , forgive me. p. 5 HELENA If you bruise my perfect flesh , the King will kill you . My beauty is his religion . He can sit for hours , as if at prayer , just examining the arch of my foot . Tsumu , you may kiss my foot . TSUMU prostrate . May the Gods make me worthy of your kindness ! HELENA That 's enough . Tsumu , are you married ? TSUMU getting up . I 've been so busy having babies I never had time to get married . HELENA It 's a great disillusionment . TSUMU agast . What ! HELENA I 'm not complaining . Moo Moo is the best of husbands , but sometimes being adored too much is trying . She sighs deeply . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpet sounds below in the courtyard . Tsumu goes to the window . TSUMU They are changing the guards at the gates of the palace . It 's almost time for your bath . She begins scraping the massage ointment back into the box . HELENA You 're as careful with that ointment as Moo Moo is with me. p. 6 TSUMU Precious things need precious guarding . HELENA It 's very short-sighted on Moo Moo 's part to send everybody to the galleys who dares lift a head when I pass by  --  and all these nice-looking soldiers ! Why  --  the only men I ever see besides Moo Moo are Analytikos and a lot of useless eunuchs . TSUMU Oh , those eunuchs ! HELENA as she sits dreaming . I wish , I wish  --  She stops short . TSUMU You have but to speak your desire to the King . HELENA shocked . Tsumu ! How can you think of such a thing ? I 'm not a bad woman . TSUMU He would die for you . HELENA relieved . Ah ! Do you think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lover of peace , and yet he would rush into battle to save you . HELENA I should love to have men fighting for me . TSUMU in high alarm . May Zeus turn a deaf ear to your voice . HELENA Do n't be impertinent , Tsumu . I 've got to have some sort of amusement . p. 7 TSUMU You 've only to wait till next week , and you can see another of the priestesses sacrificed to Diana . HELENA That does n't interest me any longer . The girls are positively beginning to like it . No ! My mind is set on war . TSUMU terrified . I have five fathers of my children to lose . HELENA War , or  --  or  --  TSUMU hopefully . Have I been so long your slave that I no longer know your wish ? HELENA very simply . Well , I should like to have a lover . TSUMU springs up and rushes over in horror to draw the curtains across the door of the library . All of a tremble . Gods grant they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tsumu . Analytikos is over eighty . She bursts into a loud peal of laughter and Menelaus rushes into the room . MENELAUS in high irritation . I wish you would n't make so much noise in here . A King might at least expect quiet in his own palace . HELENA Tsumu , see if my bath is ready . Tsumu exits . You used not speak like that to me , Moo Moo. p. 8 MENELAUS in a temper . How many times must I tell you that my name is Menelaus and that it is n't " Moo Moo " ? HELENA sweetly . I 'll never do it again , Moo Moo . She giggles . MENELAUS Your laugh gets on my nerves . It 's louder than it used to be . HELENA If you wish it , I 'll never , never laugh again . MENELAUS You 've promised that too often . HELENA sadly . Things are not as they used to be . MENELAUS Are you going to start that again ? HELENA with a tinge of melancholy . I suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly . Is it too much to hope that you might be still and happy ? HELENA speaking very quickly and tragically . Do n't treat me cruelly , Moo Moo . You do n't understand me . No man ever really understands a woman . There are terrible depths to my nature . I had a long talk with Dr. sculapius only last week , and he told me I 'm too introspective . It 's the curse of us emotional women . I 'm really quite worried , but much you care , much you care . A note of tears comes into her voice . I 'm sure you do n't love me any more , Moo Moo . No ! No ! Do n't answer me ! If you did you could n't speak to me the way you do . I 've never wronged you in deed or in thought . No , never  --  never . I 've given up my hopes and aspirations , because I knew you wanted me around you . And now , NOW  --  She can contain the tears no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am old and ugly , you regret that Ulysses or Agamemnon did n't marry me when you all wanted me , and I know you curse the day you ever saw me . She is breathless. p. 9 MENELAUS fuming . Well ! Have you done ? HELENA No . I could say a great deal more , but I 'm not a talkative woman . Analytikos comes in from the library . ANALYTIKOS Your Majesty , are we to read no longer to-day ? HELENA I have something to say to the King . Analytikos goes toward the library . Menelaus anxiously stops him . MENELAUS No . Stay here . You are a wise man and well understand the wisdom of the Queen . ANALYTIKOS bowing to Helena . Helena is wise as she is beautiful . MENELAUS She is attempting to prove to me in a thousand words that she 's a silent woman . ANALYTIKOS Women are seldom silent . Helen resents this . Their beauty is forever speaking for them . HELENA The years have , indeed , taught you wisdom . Tsumu enters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you have n't forgotten the chiropodist. p. 10 TSUMU He has been commanded but he 's always late . He 's so busy . HELENA in a purring tone to Menelaus . Moo Moo . Menelaus , bored , turns away . HELENA to Tsumu . I think after all I 'll wear my Sicily blue . She and Tsumu go into the Queen 's apartment . ANALYTIKOS Shall we go back to the library ? MENELAUS My mind is unhinged again  --  that woman with her endless protestations . ANALYTIKOS I am sorry the poets no longer divert you . MENELAUS A little poetry is always too much . ANALYTIKOS To-morrow we will try the historians . MENELAUS No ! Not the historians . I want the truth for a change . ANALYTIKOS The truth ! MENELAUS Where in books can I find escape from the grim reality of being hitched for life to such a wife ? Bah ! ANALYTIKOS Philosophy teaches  --  MENELAUS Why have the Gods made woman necessary to man , and made them fools ? p. 11 ANALYTIKOS For seventy years I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  MENELAUS Give it up , old man . The answer is  --  do n't . ANALYTIKOS Such endless variety , and yet  --  MENELAUS with the conviction of finality . There are only two sorts of women ! Those who are failures and those who realize it . ANALYTIKOS Is not Penelope , the model wife of your cousin Ulysses , an exception ? MENELAUS Duty is the refuge of the unbeautiful . She is as commonplace as she is ugly . And then with deep bitterness . Why did n't he marry Helen when we all wanted her ? He was too wise for that . He is the only man I 've ever known who seems able to direct destiny . ANALYTIKOS You should not blame the Gods for a lack of will . MENELAUS shouting . Will ! Heaven knows I do not lack the will to rid myself of this painted puppet , but where is the instrument ready to my hand ? At this moment a Shepherd of Apollonian beauty leaps across the rail of the balcony and bounds into the room . Menelaus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? PARIS An adventurer . ANALYTIKOS Then you have reached the end of your story . In a moment you will die . PARIS I have no faith in prophets . ANALYTIKOS The soldiers of the King will give you faith . Do n't you know that it means death for any man to enter the apartments of the Queen ? PARIS looking from one to the other . Oh ! So you 're a couple of eunuchs . Though nearly eighty this is too much for Analytikos to bear . He rushes to call the guard , but Menelaus stops him . PARIS to Analytikos . Thanks . ANALYTIKOS You thank me for telling you your doom ? PARIS No  --  for convincing me that I 'm where I want to be . It 's taken me a long while , but I knew I 'd get here . And then very intimately to Menelaus . Where 's the Queen ? MENELAUS Where do you come from ? PARIS From the hills . I had come down into the market-place to sell my sheep . I had my hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunsets. p. 13 MENELAUS annoyed . You might skip those bucolic details . PARIS At the fair I met three ancient gypsies . MENELAUS What have they to do with you coming here ? PARIS You do n't seem very patient . Ca n't I tell my story in my own way ? They asked me for the apple I was eating and I asked them what they 'd give for it . MENELAUS I 'm not interested in market quotations . PARIS You take everything so literally . I 'm sure you 're easily bored . MENELAUS with meaning . I am . PARIS going on cheerfully . The first was to give me all the money she could beg , and the second was to tell me all the truth she could learn by listening , and the third promised me a pretty girl . So I chose  --  He hesitates . ANALYTIKOS You can not escape by spinning out your tale . PARIS Death is the end of one story and the beginning of another . MENELAUS Well ! Well ! Come to the point . Which did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd been in the hills for a long while , so I picked the girl . p. 14 ANALYTIKOS It would have been better for you if you had chosen wisdom . PARIS I knew you 'd say that . ANALYTIKOS I have spoken truly . In a moment you will die . PARIS It is because the old have forgotten life that they preach wisdom . MENELAUS So you chose the girl ? Well , go on . PARIS This made the other cronies angry , and when I tossed her the apple one of the others yelped at me : " You may as well seek the Queen of Sparta : she is the fairest of women . " And as I turned away I heard their laughter , but the words had set my heart aflame and though it cost me my life , I 'll follow the adventure . ANALYTIKOS scandalized . Have n't we heard enough of this ? MENELAUS deeply . No ! I want to hear how the story ends . It may amuse the King . He makes a sign to Analytikos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long at the stars and dreamed of possessing Helen . Analytikos makes an involuntary movement toward the balcony , but Menelaus stops him . PARIS Desire has been my guiding Mercury ; the Fates are with me , and here I am. p. 15 ANALYTIKOS The wrath of the King will show you no mercy . PARIS nonchalantly . I 'm not afraid of the King . He 's fat , and  --  a fool . ANALYTIKOS Shall I call the guards ? Menelaus stops him . MENELAUS very significantly . So you would give your life for a glimpse of the Queen ? PARIS swiftly . Yes ! My immortal soul , and if the fables tell the truth , the sight will be worth the forfeit . MENELAUS suddenly jumping up . It shall be as you wish ! PARIS buoyantly . Venus has smiled on me . MENELAUS In there beyond the library you will find a room with a bath . Wait there till I call you . PARIS Is this some trick to catch me ? MENELAUS A Spartan can not lie . PARIS What will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MENELAUS I will answer for the king . Go . Paris exits into the library. p. 16 ANALYTIKOS rubbing his hands . Shall I order the boiling oil ? MENELAUS surprised . Oil ? ANALYTIKOS Now that he is being cleaned for the sacrifice . MENELAUS His torture will be greater than being boiled alive . ANALYTIKOS eagerly . You 'll have him hurled from the wall of the palace to a forest of waiting spears below ? MENELAUS None is so blind as he who sees too much . ANALYTIKOS Your majesty is subtle in his cruelty . MENELAUS Have n't the years taught you the cheapness of revenge ? ANALYTIKOS mystified . You do not intend to alter destiny . MENELAUS Never before has destiny been so clear to me . ANALYTIKOS Then the boy must die . MENELAUS with slow determination . No ! He has been sent by the Gods to save me ! ANALYTIKOS Your majesty ! He is trembling with apprehension. p. 17 MENELAUS with unbudgeable conviction . Helena must elope with him ! ANALYTIKOS falling into a seat . Ye Gods ! MENELAUS quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a bad example . ANALYTIKOS Yes , very . MENELAUS I could n't desert her . That would be beneath my honor . ANALYTIKOS deeply . Was there no other way ? MENELAUS pompously . The King can do no wrong , and besides I hate the smell of blood . Are you a prophet as well as a scholar ? Will she go ? ANALYTIKOS To-night I will read the stars . MENELAUS meaningfully . By tonight I 'll not need you to tell me . Analytikos sits deep in thought . Well ? ANALYTIKOS Ethics cite no precedent . MENELAUS Do you mean to say I 'm not justified ? ANALYTIKOS cogitating . Who can establish the punctilious ratio between necessity and desire ? p. 18 MENELAUS beginning to fume . This is no time for language . Just put yourself in my place . ANALYTIKOS Being you , how can I judge as I ? MENELAUS losing control . May you choke on your dialectics ! Zeus himself could have stood it no longer . ANALYTIKOS Have you given her soul a chance to grow ? MENELAUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouge pot . He has been strutting about . Suddenly he sits down crushing a roll of papyrus . He takes it up and in utter disgust reads . " The perfect hip , its development and permanence . " Bah ! He flings it to the floor . I 've done what I had to do , and Gods grant the bait may be sweet enough to catch the Queen . ANALYTIKOS If you had diverted yourself with a war or two you might have forgotten your troubles at home . MENELAUS frightened . I detest dissension of any kind  --  my dream was perpetual peace in comfortable domesticity with a womanly woman to warm my sandals . ANALYTIKOS Is not the Queen  --  ? MENELAUS No ! No ! The whole world is but her mirror . And I 'm expected to face that woman every morning at breakfast for the rest of my life , and by Venus that 's more than even a King can bear ! p. 19 ANALYTIKOS Even a King can not alter destiny . I warn you , whom the Gods have joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break asunder ! ANALYTIKOS deeply shocked . You talk like an atheist . MENELAUS I never allow religion to interfere with life . Go call the victim and see that he be left alone with the Queen . Menelaus exits and Analytikos goes over to the door of the library and summons Paris , who enters clad in a gorgeous robe . PARIS I found this in there . It looks rather well , does n't it ? Ah ! So you 're alone . I suppose that stupid friend of yours has gone to tell the King . When do I see the Queen ? ANALYTIKOS At once . He goes to the door of the Queen 's apartment and claps his hand . Tsumu enters and at the sight of her Paris recoils the full length of the room . PARIS I thought the Queen was a blonde ! ANALYTIKOS Tell Her Majesty a stranger awaits her here . Tsumu exits , her eyes wide on Paris . You should thank the Gods for this moment . p. 20 PARIS his eyes on the door . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names . Helena enters clad in her Sicily blue , crowned with a garland of golden flowers . She and Paris stand riveted , looking at each other . Their attitude might be described as fantastic . Analytikos watches them for a moment and then with hands and head lifted to heaven he goes into the library . PARIS quivering with emotion . I have the most strange sensation of having seen you before . Something I ca n't explain  --  HELENA quite practically . Please do n't bother about all sorts of fine distinctions . Under the influence of Analytikos and my husband , life has become a mess of indecision . I 'm a simple , direct woman and I expect you to say just what you think . PARIS Do you ? Very well , then  --  He comes a step nearer to her . Fate is impelling me toward you . HELENA Yes . That 's much better . So you 're a fatalist . It 's very Greek . I do n't see what our dramatists would do without it . PARIS In my country there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HELENA Your people must be uncivilized barbarians . p. 21 PARIS My people are a genuine people . There is but one thing we worship . HELENA Do n't tell me it 's money . PARIS It 's  --  HELENA Analytikos says if there were n't any money , there would n't be any of those ridiculous socialists . PARIS It is n't money . It 's sincerity . HELENA I , too , believe in sincerity . It 's the loveliest thing in the world . PARIS And the most dangerous . HELENA The truth is never dangerous . PARIS Except when told . HELENA making room on the couch for him to sit next to her . You must n't say wicked things to me . PARIS Can your theories survive a test ? HELENA beautifully . Truth is eternal and survives all tests . PARIS No . Perhaps , after all , your soul is not ready for the supremest heights . HELENA Do you mean to say I 'm not religious ? Religion teaches the meaning of love . PARIS Has it taught you to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down again . How dare you speak to me like that ? PARIS You see . I was right . He goes toward the balcony . HELENA stopping him . Whatever made you think so ? PARIS I 've heard people talk of the King . You could never love a man like that . HELENA beautifully . A woman 's first duty is to love her husband . PARIS There is a higher right than duty . HELENA with conviction . Right is right . PARIS with admiration . The world has libeled you . HELENA Me ! The Queen ? PARIS You are as wise as you are beautiful . HELENA smiling coyly . Why , you hardly know me . PARIS I know you ! I , better than all men . HELENA You ? PARIS rupturously . Human law has given you to Menelaus , but divine law makes you mine . p. 23 HELENA in amazement . What ! PARIS I alone appreciate your beauty . I alone can reach your soul . HELENA Ah ! PARIS You hate your husband ! HELENA drawing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PARIS To see if there 's one woman in the world who dares tell the truth . HELENA My husband does n't understand me . PARIS with conviction . I knew you detested him . HELENA He never listens to my aspirations . PARIS Egoist . HELENA assuming an irresistible pose . I 'm tired of being only lovely . He does n't realize the meaning of spiritual inter-course , of soul communion . PARIS Fool ! HELENA You dare call Moo Moo a fool ? PARIS Has he not been too blind to see that your soul outshines your beauty ? Then , very dramatically . You 're stifling ! HELENA clearing her throat . I  --  I  --  p. 24 PARIS He has made you sit upon your wings . Helena , jumping up , shifts her position . You are groping in the darkness . HELENA Do n't be silly . It 's very light in here . PARIS undisturbed . You are stumbling , and I have come to lead you . He steps toward her . HELENA Stop right there ! Paris stops . No man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a court tradition . PARIS Necessity knows no tradition . He falls on his knees before her . I shall come close to you , though the flame of your beauty consume me . HELENA You 'd better be careful what you say to me . Remember I 'm the Queen . PARIS No man weighs his words who has but a moment to live . HELENA You said that exactly like an actor . He leans very close to her . What are you doing now ? PARIS I am looking into you . You are the clear glass in which I read the secret of the universe . HELENA The secret of the universe . Ah ! Perhaps you could understand me. p. 25 PARIS First you must understand yourself . HELENA instinctively taking up a mirror . How ? PARIS You must break with all this prose . With an unconscious gesture he sweeps a tray of toilet articles from the table . Helena emits a little shriek . HELENA The ointment ! PARIS rushing to the window and pointing to the distance . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says very blandly . There is nothing in the world like poetry . PARIS lyrically . Have you ever heard the poignant breathing of the stars ? HELENA No . I do n't believe in astrology . PARIS Have you ever smelt the powdery mists of the sun ? HELENA I should sneeze myself to death . PARIS Have you ever listened to the sapphire soul of the sea ? HELENA Has the sea a soul ? But please do n't stop talking . You do it so beautifully . PARIS Deeds are sweeter than words . Shall we go hand in hand to meet eternity ? p. 26 HELENA not comprehending him . That 's very pretty . Say it again . PARIS passionately . There 's but a moment of life left me . I shall stifle it in ecstasy . Helena , Helena , I adore you ! HELENA jumping up in high surprise . You 're not making love to me , you naughty boy ? PARIS Helena . HELENA You 've spoken to me so little , and already you dare to do that . PARIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip the inessentials . HELENA Remember who I am . PARIS I have not forgotten , Daughter of Heaven . Suddenly he leaps to his feet . Listen ! HELENA Shhh ! That 's the King and Analytikos in the library . PARIS No ! No ! Do n't you hear the flutter of wings ? HELENA Wings ? PARIS ecstatically . Venus , mother of Love ! HELENA alarmed . What is it ? p. 27 PARIS She has sent her messenger . I hear the patter of little feet . HELENA Those little feet are the soldiers below in the courtyard . A trumpet sounds . PARIS the truth of the situation breaking through his emotion . In a moment I shall be killed . HELENA Killed ? PARIS Save me and save yourself ! HELENA Myself ? PARIS I shall rescue you and lead you on to life . HELENA No one has even spoken to me like that before . PARIS This is the first time your ears have heard the truth . HELENA Was it of you I 've been dreaming ? PARIS Your dream was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me feel like this . And then with a sudden shriek . Oh ! I 'm a wicked woman ! PARIS No ! No ! HELENA For years I 've been living with a man I did n't love . PARIS Yes ! Yes ! p. 28 HELENA I 'm lost ! PARIS at a loss . No ! Yes ! Yes ! No ! HELENA It was a profanation of the most holy . PARIS The holiest awaits you , Helena ! Our love will lighten the Plutonian realms . HELENA Menelaus never spoke to me like that . PARIS ' T is but the first whisper of my adoration . HELENA I ca n't face him every morning at breakfast for the rest of my life . That 's even more than a Queen can bear . PARIS I am waiting to release you . HELENA I 've stood it for seven years . PARIS I 've been coming to you since the beginning of time . HELENA There is something urging me to go with you , something I do not understand . PARIS Quick ! There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arms . There is a passionate embrace in the midst of which Tsumu enters . TSUMU The chiropodist has come . HELENA Bring me my outer garment and my purse . Tsumu exits , her eyes wide on Paris. p. 29 PARIS Helena ! Helena ! Helena looks about her and takes up the papyrus that Menelaus has flung to the floor . HELENA A last word to the King . She looks at the papyrus . No , this wo n't do ; I shall have to take this with me . PARIS What is it ? HELENA Maskanda 's discourse on the hip . A trumpet sounds below in the courtyard . PARIS excitedly . Leave it  --  or your hip may cost me my head . We have n't a minute to spare . Hurry ! Hurry ! Helena takes up an eyebrow pencil and writes on the back of the papyrus . She looks for a place to put it and seeing the shield she smears it with some of the ointment and sticks the papyrus to it . PARIS watching her in ecstasy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name will blaze as a symbol throughout eternity . Tsumu enters with the purse and the Queen 's outer robe . HELENA tossing the purse to Paris . Here , we may need this . PARIS throwing it back to Tsumu . This for your silence , daughter of darkness . A prince has no need of purses. p. 30 TSUMU looking at him . A prince ! HELENA gloriously . My prince of poetry . My deliverer ! PARIS divinely . My queen of love ! They go out , Tsumu looking after them in speechless amazement . Suddenly she sees the papyrus on the shield , runs over and reads it and then rushes to the door of the library . TSUMU calling . Analytikos . She hides the purse in her bosom : Analytikos enters , scroll in hand . ANALYTIKOS Has the Queen summoned me ? TSUMU mysteriously . A terrible thing has happened . ANALYTIKOS What 's the matter ? TSUMU Where 's the King ? ANALYTIKOS In the library . TSUMU I have news more precious than the gold of Midas . ANALYTIKOS giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking very dramatically and watching the effect of her words . The Queen has deserted Menelaus. p. 31 ANALYTIKOS receiving the shock philosophically . Swift are the ways of Nature . The Gods have smiled upon him . TSUMU The Gods have forsaken the King to smile upon a prince . ANALYTIKOS What ? TSUMU He was a prince . ANALYTIKOS apprehensively . Why do you say that ? TSUMU clutching her bosom . I have a good reason to know . There is a sound of voices below in the courtyard . Menelaus rushes in expectantly . Tsumu falls prostrate before him . Oh , King , in thy bottomless agony blame not a blameless negress . The Queen has fled ! MENELAUS in his delight forgetting himself and flinging her a purse . Is it true ? TSUMU Woe ! Woe is me ! MENELAUS storming . Out of my sight , you eyeless Argus ! ANALYTIKOS to Tsumu . Quick , send a messenger . Find out who he was . Tsumu sticks the third purse in her bosom and runs out . MENELAUS with radiant happiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank ye . Peace and a happy life at last . The shouts in the courtyard grow louder. p. 32 ANALYTIKOS The news has spread through the palace . MENELAUS in trepidation , springing up . No one would dare stop the progress of the Queen . TSUMU rushes in and prostrates herself before the King . Woe is me ! They have gone by the road to the harbor . MENELAUS anxiously . Yes ! Yes ! TSUMU By the King 's orders no man has dared gaze upon Her Majesty . They all fell prostrate before her . MENELAUS Good ! Good ! Attempting to cover his delight . Go ! Go ! You garrulous dog . Tsumu gets up and points to shield . Analytikos and the King look toward it . Analytikos tears off the papyrus and brings it to Menelaus . Tsumu , watching them , exits . MENELAUS reading . " I am not a bad woman . I did what I had to do . " How Greek to blame fate for what one wants to do . Tsumu again comes tumbling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies through the city . He  --  he  --  ANALYTIKOS anxiously . Well ? Well ? p. 33 TSUMU He  --  he  --  MENELAUS furiously to Analytikos . Rid me of this croaking raven . TSUMU Evil has fallen on Sparta . He  --  ANALYTIKOS Yes  --  yes  --  MENELAUS in a rage . Out of my sight , perfidious Nubian . Sounds of confusion in the courtyard . Suddenly she springs to her feet and yells at the top of her voice . TSUMU He was Paris , Prince of Troy ! They all start back . Analytikos stumbles into a seat . Menelaus turns pale . Tsumu leers like a black Nemesis . ANALYTIKOS very ominously . Who can read the secret of the Fates ? MENELAUS frightened . What do you mean ? ANALYTIKOS He is the son of Priam , King of Troy . TSUMU adding fuel . And of Hecuba , Queen of the Trojans . She rushes out to spread the news . ANALYTIKOS That makes the matter international . p. 34 MENELAUS quickly . But we have treaties with Troy . ANALYTIKOS Circumstances alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANALYTIKOS No more than a scrap of papyrus . Sparta will fight to regain her Queen . MENELAUS But I do n't want her back . ANALYTIKOS Can you tell that to Sparta ? Remember , the King can do no wrong . Last night I dreamed of war . MENELAUS No ! No ! Do n't say that . After the scandal I ca n't be expected to fight to get her back . ANALYTIKOS Sparta will see with the eyes of chivalry . MENELAUS fuming . But I do n't believe in war . ANALYTIKOS still obdurate . Have you forgotten the oath pledged of old , with Ulysses and Agamemmon ? They have sworn , if ever the time came , to fight and defend the Queen . MENELAUS bitterly . I did n't think of the triple alliance . ANALYTIKOS Can Sparta ask less of her King ? MENELAUS Let 's hear the other side . We can perhaps arbitrate . Peace at any price . p. 35 ANALYTIKOS Some bargains are too cheap . MENELAUS hopelessly . But I am a pacifist . ANALYTIKOS You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers . MENELAUS desperately . I am too proud to fight ! ANALYTIKOS Here , put on your shield . A great clamor comes up from the courtyard . Analytikos steps out on the balcony and is greeted with shouts of " The King ! The King ! " Addressing the crowd . People of Sparta , this calamity has been forced upon us . Menelaus winces . We are a peaceful people . But thanks to our unparalleled efficiency , the military system of Sparta is the most powerful in all Greece and we can mobilize in half an hour . Loud acclaims from the people . Menelaus , the papyrus still in hand , crawls over and attempts to stop Analytikos . ANALYTIKOS not noticing him . In the midst of connubial and communal peace the thunderbolt has fallen on the King . Menelaus tugs at Analytikos ' robe . Broken in spirit as he is , he is already pawing the ground like a battle steed . Never will we lay down our arms ! We and Jupiter ! Cheers . Never until the Queen is restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Menelaus squirms . A loud cheer . Even now the King is buckling on his shield . More cheers . Analytikos steps farther forward and then with bursting eloquence . One hate we have and one alone ! Yells from below . Hate by water and hate by land , Hate of the head and hate of the hand , Hate of Paris and hate of TroyThat has broken the Queen for a moment 's toy . The yells grow fiercer . Zeus ' thunder will shatter the Trojan throne.We have one hate and one alone ! Menelaus sits on the floor dejectedly looking at the papyrus . A thunder of voices from the people . We have one hate and one alone . Troy ! Troy ! Helmets and swords are thrown into the air . The cheers grow tumultuous , trumpets are blown , and the Curtain falls.                                         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
