I wish to show here . as concisely as possible , that the above impression is not justified , so will use round numbers only . Since 1860 and up to the present census the rates of gain in the decennial census figures for Manhattan have been 15 , 24 , 23 , and 40 per cent . respectively . The average rate of tDese increases for the last forty years is exactly 23 per cet . This average Manhattan has Just exceeded by three points , giving her at the same time her largest numerical increase on record . Brooklyn 's rates of increase for the four decades above mentioned were 50 , 43 , 40 , and 59 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This rate she has fallen short of by two points , in spite of her magnificent showing . As to the future , much could be said as to why Manhattan 's growth will continue for many years to come . Her general metropolitan atmosphere , the incomparable Scenic beauty of her upper portion , and other advantages which are to numerous to mention here , will always make her the Mecca for those who would find life less worth living elsewhere .
