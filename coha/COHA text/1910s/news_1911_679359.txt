txt Commissioner of Accounts Raymond B. Fosdick. who has laid hare not a few ' dark spots in the administration of the city 's affairs , talked about graft at the West Side Young Men 's Christian Association yesterday afternoon . He sought to drive home its significance by showing its ultimate effects on tile health and comfort of the citizens , especially those of the poorer classes . " The trouble , - he said , " is that we do n't intepret graft in terms of its social significance . Every cent you use for unrighteous purposes you rob from its rightful disposition . We roust ' earn to translate graft into tuberculosis , and padded payrolls into the dead babies in the tenement houses , bemuse the money that should he spent in milk inspection and visiting nurses has to go ' to pay the debts of past maladministration . " No Board of Estimate ever came into office with a higher slumlord of social usefulness than the present one , but it has had to refuse increased appropriations to the Health D " partment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to pay interest en bonds issued to pay for the corrupt transactions of other days . The curse of Tweed is on us as the curse of Croker will be on our children . " Great sums were taken to build the Tweed Court House and for the purchase of Hunt 's Point Park . : ma result to4 day is that we have n't enmigh money to fight disease . If we clearly understood/ the appalling meaning of misgovernment I believe we ha , : e enough pent-up independence to make efficient government a ' matter not of politics bat of stern necessity under the compelling hand of the people . " Mr. Fosdick began and elnsod his address by referring to Sir Philip Sydney 's advice to his son : " If you hear of a good war anywhere , you had better get into This advice , said Mr. Fosdick , the people should take to heart as applying to the fight for honest and efficient city government . " Recent crowding together In great cities , " he said , " has brought new and complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the City Government as paternalistic to the last degree . Our aim now is the health and comfort of the citizens . We are no longer frightened by the bogy of Socialism . The modern city Is a factor of greater social significance than any other influence to-day . Its activities affect the citizens in direct ratio as their incomes decrease . " Mr. Fosdick said he had often been asked how citizens could help to bring about better city government , aside from voting , participating in their party primaries , and paying taxes . He had three suggestions to make  --  that they should be somewhat reserved in their criticism of public officials ; that they should gain a better understanding of the problems of government ; and that they should have more faith in the triumph of democracy in city administration . " It is the general idea , " be said . " that anybody who goes into public life , especially in city administration , has some ulterior motive . Unfounded criticism would not be so frequent if the people understood what a conscientious official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance . It is easy to criticise the Police Department , but it re ; quires the patience of a Job and tho genius of a Napoleon to run it . " The matter of snow removal eonlea In for harsh criticism , but if ever a job taxed a man 's patience it is : Big Bill ' Edwards 's . I know what it is , when a public official is doing his best , not to have public opinion behind him . " Remember that graft is not confined to politics . There is more graft in business than in the Municipal Government . There is graft in business , graft in churches , graft In charitable societies . If my department should investigate some charitable organizations it would furnish material to keep the newspapers screaming for months . We face an atmosphere of graft that pervades not politics alone but other forms of organized activity . " We need a better understanding of the problems of government . How many here to-day understand the subway cluesLion or the details of the budttet'u Yet the City Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be honestly administered until the people understand it better . I do n't believe we need a moral awakening . We need the facts . It did n't take a moral awakening to clean up the insurance business . It needed a , , eigees to lay bare the facts , and the people did the rest . ' It is n't morals we lack , but the application of the morals we have to the facts . The sole cure for the evils of democracy is more democracy . Open up the windows and let in the air and the light . " Another thing we need is less cynicism and more faith and hope in democracy . I probably come in contact , in my official capacity . with more graft and corruption than almost anybody else . Yet I am not discouraged , and I believe I democracy is going to succeed in this ' city . In England City Governments are ' successful largely heeause of a spirit of local pride and responsibility that we seem to lack . We ere too discouraged . I and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the question , ' What 's the use ? The gang will get in. anyhow . ' We need something like the British pluck . and in time we will work the problem out . If you hear of a good war '  --  and this is one ? ' be sure to get into it . ' "
