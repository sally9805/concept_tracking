txt Representative NE:ELEY 'S proposal for issuing currency upon corn , cotton , and wheat certificates was rejected by the House Banking Committee , 10 to 4 , the ayes being Representatives NEELEY , WINGO , RAGS ? DALE , and EAGLE . There is little doubt that the caucus and the House will follow the example of the committee , and yet , since the matter is to be brought forward again , it may be well to consider the arguments advanced by Mr. NEELEY . He says : There is no good reason why the producers of the thirteen billion dollars ' worth of agricultural products raised in the United States last year should not receive the same consideration at the hands of the Federal Government as does the holder of corporate securities . There is no authority for ' the Representative 's thirteen billions , but that is a detail . The reason against basing currency upon such collateral is the same in principle as that against the bond-secured currency . Cotton and United States bonds are both " good . " If anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is easier to conceive that there should be an absence of demand for United States bonds than for cotton or food . They always have a value . Their indestructibility is high , and , if burned , their value can be recovered by insurance . More might be said by way of showing that there is no prejudice against agricultural collateral . The argument against it as the basis of currency lies in the nature of banking rather than in the nature of the collateral . It is a banker 's first duty to make sure that he shall have nothing to do with his collateral . He does not accept it because he wants it for his own use , but because it binds the borrower to pay . A planter who has sold his cotton does not deposit it as collateral , nor does he warehouse it . Bills against cotton on the way to Market , or in process of spinning , are good basis for currency , because they are sure to be paid . Warehouse receipts of anything are not good basis for currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . The same thing is true regarding securities carried in hope of a rise in price . They may be as " good " as cotton , and can hardly be better , but too many such loans of either sort will prevent a bank ? from serving its commercial customers . So long as the market is rising the customer does not like to sell , and the banker is loath to compel the sale . When bad times come the collateral can not be Sold except at a sacrifice , and the customer considers a sale on such conditions a hardship . Warehouse receipts do not produce cash automatically on a fixed date . Their liquidation is uncertain , and they add to the banker 's business perplexities , which ought to be no part of it . Would the Representative have the farmers confined to agricultural currency , and would its payment to others than farmers be forbidden ? They are no worse off than anybody else as regards getting their share of the general currency , and they have no claim to be specially considered unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own money . That is too absurd for proposal . Yet now , as in 1901% the idea is revived , and when it is rejected in committee it is said that it is to be appealed to the caucus and the House . There can be no objection if the result is the same as in the committee .
