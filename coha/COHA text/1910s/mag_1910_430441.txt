At last Shakespeare stands revealed to us It is nearly three hundred years since he died . yet it is only now that we have " his tragic lifestory . " It is almost as if a new play , a greater than " Hamlet , " had been discovered . And the amazing thing is that one had only to read Shakespeare to see the man , the lover , the ruined life , all as plain as words can make them . This is what amazes Mr. Frank Harris , too , who in his modesty is forced to assume superiority to the hordes of Shakespearian critics who saw not the light . Only Goethe and Coleridge got glimpses , which , however , led nowhither ; all . the rest , and their " tons of talk , " are far astray . This book of Mr. Harris 's would show that Shakespeare painted himself not once but twenty times . The character that is preeminently Shakespeare is Hamlet ; and whenever Shakespeare , in delineating other characters , grew careless , as he very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , he depicted himself . Some characters are merely Hamlet in other circumstances . Romeo is Hamlet in love , as Hazlitt had already remarked ; Jaques is Hamlet in melancholy discontent . Thus , " if we combine the character of Romeo , the poetlover , and Jaques , the pensive-eyed philosopher , we have almost the complete Hamlet . " As Mr. Harris frequently remarks , " Think of it ! " These three characters we may therefore regard as Shakespeare prepense . The real task is to find the unconscious Shakespeares . And from the wealth of choice let us take ? oh , anyone will do ? say Macbeth . Like Hamlet , Macbeth weighs the pro and con of action to fulfil the witches ' prophesies ; he is courteous in his address ? calling Banquo and the others " kind gentlemen " ; he is " too full of the milk of human kindness " ; he is irresolute when it comes to murdering Duncan ; he has Hamlet 's " peculiar and exquisite intellectual fairness , " and remarks that " this Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the mouthpiece of Shakespeare 's " marvellous lyrical faculty " ; he has a religious tinge in his nature ? " But wherefore , " he says , " could not I pronounce Amen , " and Hamlet exclaims , " Angels and ministers of grace defend us , " and later , " I 'll go pray . " " This new trait , " remarks Mr. Harris , " most intimate and distinctive , is therefore the most conclusive proof of the identity of the two characters . " Could the most skeptical dryasdust professor ? Mr. Harris 's bete noirdemand more ? But in case he should , here it is : After the strain of the murder , Macbeth loses his nerve . " All this is exquisitely characteristic of the nervous student who has been screwed up to a feat beyond his strength , ' a terrible feat , ' and who has broken down over it ; but his words are altogether absurd in the mouth of an ambitious half-barbarous chieftain . " Yet , strange as it may seem , Hamlet managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to the final surprise of their lives . But after the second act , Macbeth seems to be able to do things more or less bloody . How account for the change ? In the first part , Macbeth is Shakespeare ? " gentle , bookish , and irresolute " ; in the latter part , where the dramatist has to follow Holinshed and set Macbeth to murdering , he yet " did not think of lending Macbeth any tinge of cruelty , harshness , or ambition . His Macbeth commits murder for the same reason that the timorous deer fights ? out of fear . " This shows how kind Shakespeare was ! The same quality is further shown in Macbeth 's unwillingness to fight Macduff in their final meeting , in his confession of " pity and remorse , which must be compared to the gentle-kindness with which Hamlet treats Laertes and Romeo treats Paris . " Anyone must now be convinced of the identity of these characters ! In somewhat similar fashion we are taught that Duke Vincentio in " Measure for Measure " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " King John , " and Richard II. , are after the same model . In the case of the latter there is a difference between his character in the early part of the play  | and that in the later . In the former case he is selfish , greedy , cruel ; in the second he is all that is lovable . Why ? Because in the first part Shakespeare is following history ; in the second , he is drawing himself . Would the same reasoning apply to Edward II . in Marlowe 's play ? From these delineations of character Mr. Harris shows that " Shakespeare 's nature , even in hot , reckless youth , was most feminine and affectionate , and that . . . he preferred to picture irresolution and weakness rather than strength . " If you do n't believe it , look at Hotspur . When he is brusque , blame Holinshed ; when he talks about " gentle Severn 's sedgy bank , " he is Shakespeare , ? such language is too poetical for Hotspur . Again , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone . And yet we seem to have heard these lines : " Send Danger from the east unto the west , So Honour cross it from the north or south , And let them grapple. 0 , the blood more stirs To rouse a lion than to start a hare ! " So , too , he can not present Prince Hal as possessing manly virtues . He is not much more than a weak imitation of Hotspur . Moreover , we learn from Poins that he is lewd , ? and , as a remarkable coincidence , so are Jaques ( or so the Duke says ) , and Vincentio ( for does not Lucio say so ? ) ; therefore Shakespeare was lewd , he was a sensualist . The character of the Prince as here expounded explains the vexed question of the rejection of Falstaff . Shakespeare too had spent time in bad company , and " like other weak men was filled with a desire to throw the blame on his ' misleaders . ' He certainly exulted in their punishment . " How Professor Bradley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convincing simplicity of this brilliant discovery ! But Professor Bradley is a Dryasdust , and not a revealer . This Shakespeare cuts a pretty poor figure ! He has no virile virtues or vices , no desperate courage , only " a love of honour working on quick generous blood " ; no " cruelty , hatred , ambition , revenge , " the ancillary qualities of courage . And yet it seems to us that there is some cruelty depicted in " Lear , " some hatred and revenge in " The Merchant of Venice , " and some ambition in " Richard III . " But no , " manliness was not his Shakespeare 's , forte ; he was by nature a neuropath and a lover . " A few more aspects remain . Orsino , in " Twelfth Night , " the lover of music and flowers and passion , is Shakespeare . " Shakespeare lends no music to his villains " ? Iago and his song . " And let me the canakin clink , clink , " to the contrary notwithstanding . Shakespeare had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for we would see in this a masculine trait . So we take much comfort out of Falstaff . But this staff is a broken reed . Not even Shakespeare was great enough to create Falstaff ; he must have had a model , and that model was probably Chettle Why ? Because Falstaff surpasses all of Shakespeare 's other comic characters ; because he depicted Falstaff so poorly in the " Merry Wives " that he must have depended on his model whom he had already exhausted in " Henry IV . " ; and because Chettle was a jovial soul ! But now we come to the actual events of Shakespeare 's life , which we glean from the Sonnets and some of the plays . " W. H. , " we are to accept without question , is William Herbert , Earl of Pembroke ; and the " dark lady " is Mary Fitton . There is no doubt about it . " The story is very simple : Shakespeare loved Mistress Fitton , and sent his friend , the young Lord Herbert , to her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commend Shakespeare to the lady . Mistress Fitton fell in love with William Herbert , wooed and won him , and Shakespeare had to mourn the loss of both friend and mistress . " Moreover , this story has been treated three times in the plays ? in " Two Gentlemen of Verona , " " Much Ado , " and " Twelfth Night " ; yet no one has noticed it . " If after these three recitals , " Mr. Harris says , " anyone can still believe the sonnet-story is imaginary , he is beyond persuasion by argument . " Now this Mary Fitton has already appeared in the plays , for we can recognize her by Shakespeare 's very careful descriptions . She is Rosaline in Romeo and Juliet , " as well as the girl of the same name in " Love 's Labour 's Lost . " In all cases we have dark hair , dark eyes , pale complexion . All would fit in so nicely with Mary Fitton , were it not that Mistress Mary , we know from authentic portraits , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Fitton he loved with an intense passion ; but towards the traitor Herbert he expresses no anger , since Shakespeare dearly loved a lord . He was an arrant snob , like all your English . And thus Shakespeare , for twelve mortal years from 1597 to 1608 , suffered such agonies as only a genius and a disappointed sensualist can endure . The fruit of this agony we have in the plays , ? so let us be thankful that poor gentle Shakespeare had a sad and weary lot . It is  | accordingly not Brutus , but Shakespeare , who , " racked by love and jealousy , tortured by betrayal , was at war with himself . " Like Hamlet , he was prompted to his revenge by heaven and hell , but he was too gentle and kind to act it out . Rosencrantz and Guildenstern did not report their opinion of Hamlet 's farewell kindness . All Hamlet 's unreasoning rage at his mother 's lechery is Shakespeare telling Mary Fitton what he thinks of her . " If anyone can imagine that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " sadly comments our author , " he is past my persuading . " Past , long past ! How simple the complex problem of " Hamlet " becomes in the light of these revelations ! Othello 's jealous fury against Desdemona merges into Shakespeare 's wrath towards Mary Fitton . Desdemona never showed " high and plenteous wit and invention , " but Mary did , alas , too much ! A still closer portrait of Mistress Fitton we get in Cressida ; and , what is equally interesting , we learn that Shakespeare wrote this " wretched invertebrate play , " this libel on Greece , to mock Chapman , the rival poet of the Sonnets . Ignorant of Greek , he poured contempt on it and on Chapman . " This establishes the opinion that Chapman was indeed the rival poet . " Reasoning can no farther go ! As we might guess ( provided we are not professors , like Dowden and Gollancz ) , Cleopatra is Mary Fitton , and Antony is Shakespeare . The interview between Thyreus and Cleopatra was written " out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . She does n't mind it , now that the discovery has just been made , ? but she wrecked Shakespeare 's life . " Hamlet in love with Cleopatra , the poet lost in desire of the wanton , ? that is the tragedy of Shakespeare 's life . " His passion led him to " shame and madness and despair ; his strength broke down under the strain , and he never won back again to health . " Lear expresses his own disillusion and naked misery ; it is the first attempt in all literature to paint madness , Mr. Harris informs us . We receive the news with fitting modesty . " Timon " is merely " a scream of pain " closing the agony . After all this , Shakespeare went to Stratford to recuperate under the care of his daughter : Mr. Harris tells us so . Then came the Romances , ? ? all copies " ; Shakespeare was " too tired to invent or even to annex . " Prospero is Shakespeare ; and so is Ariel , who was imprisoned painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom , indeed , but Mary Fitton ? The close of this veracious history is occupied with Shakespeare 's " Life , " which incorporates , as credible , stories ranging from Audrey 's account of Shakespeare 's killing a calf in high style and making a speech , to his parentage of D'Avenant . A fitting close to the romance . It is interesting to note that the book , which contains such violent diatribes on the English aristocracy as would have made good Radical campaign literature in the recent elections , is dedicated to an English peer . A fitting beginning to the romance  |
