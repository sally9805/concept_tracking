what the French laws call " Grand Cabotage , " as distinct from the " Petit Cabotage " which consists in plying from port to port along the coast . The latter would still be reserved for ships of American register , though foreign vessels would be allowed to take cargoes from New York through the Panama Canal to San Francisco or Seattle or Honolulu . Admiral Stockton points out the advantages in the way of competition that would result from such a change in our navigation laws , as well as the relief from the charge of deliberately violating a treaty which could be obtained in that way . He takes note as follows of the argument that it is necessary to retain a complete monopoly of the coastwise trade in order to " build up a merchant marine for the United States " : In answer it can be stated that for over fifty years this trade has been in the hands of American-built merchantmen without having had any material results in the creation of an American merchant marine In fact , our mercantile marine plying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our great railway systems , with freight charges so arranged as not to affect its land freight charges when it comes in competition therewith , and really either to feed the lines alone or to give them advantages over competing railway systems The contempt with which certain politicians have dismissed the treatment of the big Trusts by the Administration and the courts as futile and laughable has been nowhere more marked than in connection with the Standard Oil case But here comes Mr. C. D. Chamberlain , secretary and general counsel of the National Petroleum Association , an organization of independent refining companies , and tells us that the fight against monopoly in oil has been anything but futile . In a carefully thought-out discussion of the situation , he makes such statements as that the condition , in regard to the chance open for competitors , " continuously improved during the pendency of the Government 's suit , and improvement has continued since the decree of dissolution " ; and that , while " too short a period has elapsed since the disintegration of the Standard Oil combination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's decree , " the independent companies have to-day an unrestricted and uncontrolled opportunity to carry on their business without unfair , secret , and oppressivecompetition on the part of one great rival ' that they have not enjoyed for years past . " To charge unrestricted immigration with being one of the principal causes of the present discontent , and to argue in the next breath that the present discontent is the , sign of a great moral awakening in the nation , is obviously unfair to the poor immigrant . But whether we call it plain discontent or a movement for moral and social regeneration , it is not out of place to inquire in what sections of the community the present unrest is chiefly localized . The revolt against the ild parties and the old ideals has been strongest in the agricultural communities of the Middle West and the Far West , where the competition of immigrant labor is felt least of all . Certainly , the Western farmer has no grudge against the alien masses who have come in to swell the ranks of food consumers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer . The spirit of discontent , if we take Mr. Roosevelt 's , popularity as an index , la also strong in industrial communities like the Pennsylvania and West Virginia mine regions , where the bulk of the population is of immigrant origin , a state of affairs which would argue that the foreigner resents being forced to compete against himself . Mr. Hapgood 's resignation as editor of Collier 's follows evidences of internal dissensions in that weekly , which have been for some weeks plain . This campaign left it in a very unpleasant situation . It had supported Roosevelt , in the hope that bid would get the Republican nomination , and it had been filled with praise of Wilson , seemingly in the conviction that he would not get the Democratic nomination . The actual result of the Conventions was obviously awkward for Coffer 's . It began by announcing that it would hold the scales even as between Roosevelt and Wilson . Twitted with being " on the fence , " it declared that on the fence it would stay . But in actual fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other  --  often on both Sides at once  --  but latterly , in its editorial columns at least , more and more strongly leaning to Wilson . But now Mr. Collier is to change all that , and , as editor himself , to make his publication . in the future a thickand-thin Roosevelt organ . With all respect for the powers of the new editor , we doubt if he will be able in two weeks ' time to decide the election . What is termed a plan to complete the nationalization of Harvard is under consideration by the Harvard Club of Chicago . The project is to found scholarships of $300 for freshmen ' in ' all States having fewer than four representatives at Cambridge . These ' States are all in the West and Soutli. " " he first effort is to be in the direction of finding Harvard alumni in the States concerned who will endow such scholarships , but in the event of failure in this attempt , Harvard alumni clubs elsewhere will be asked to contribute towards a fund for this purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something which they themselves are unwilling to do , is sufficiently evident from the fact that this- club has a fund of $5,000 for the assistance of Illinois high-school students who contemplate entering Harvard . An incidental consequence of this campaign for the " nationalization " of the university will doillitless be to increase the influence of the West and South in its governing boards . These sections of the country have been claiming and obtaining larger representation in the Board of Overseers , and the sending of more students to Harvard from their borders must strengthen the tendency towards the " nationalization " of the body which is directly responsible for its policy . Not many can have read without a pang of true and keen sympathy of the death of William Rugh , the Gary , Indiana , newsboy who risked and lost his life to save that of a young girl whom he had never seen . One is at a loss to say whether the pathos , the chivalry , and the self-sacrifice of his act are more moving because of its unusual nature , or because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroism which is to be found in thousands of men in the humblest walks of life . Hardly a railway disaster , a perilous fire , an accident on the water , but furnishes its tale of instant courage and self-forgetfulness . But there is something peculiarly touching in this quiet and undramatic sacrifice in the Gary hospital . The girl had suffered extensive burns through an explosion of gasolene in a motor-cycle . When Rugh , a newsboy with a crippled leg , heard of this , and that only by the grafting of a large amount of cuticle could the girl 's life be saved , he offered his crippled leg for amputation . He was warned that the operation might result fatally . " What 's the odds , " he said , " if it will only save her life ? The leg is no good to me , and I have no friends to , worry in case I die . Go ? ahead and cut it off . " No heroics in it at all ; but many a less knightly act has been embalmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain popular didactic play , Mr. Belasco remarks that if the exceedingly long preachment had not been " somewhat cunningly introduced at the moment of greatest suspense , " " the auditorium would have been emptied of its listeners long before . the end of the dissertation . " This might be passed by as a piece of conventional hyperbole . But if Mr. Belasco had stuck to the actual facts of his supposed case , he would have had to picture the theatre as filled with listeners longing to escape but helplessly glued to their seats . Why should they not escape ? Is it not a ridiculous lack of resourcefulness that keeps them there ? From the extreme infrequency of actual departures , one would suppose the audience to be under the impression that buying a ticket involves one in a contract to hear a play out . Many people , of course , think that plays are only relatively dull  --  that any play is better than no play at all . But those who complain afterwards of having lived through an evening of utmost boredoin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are too kind-hearted nowadays to hiss , but in " the argument of legs " ? to use a happy phrase of Mrs. Gilman 's  --  we have at hand a punishment that exactly fits the crime , and combines the minimum of disturbance with the maximum of effectiveness . The latest outbreak in Mexico has not been precipitated by revolutionist successes in other parts of the country . On the contrary , in the north there is a decided cessation of rebel activity . The guerrilla campaign that followed the dispersal of Orozco 's regular forces has nearly ended . But no sooner does appeasement come in one section of the country than revolt starts up in another section If we take these successive uprisings as proof of a smouldering general discontent with Madero and his policies , then the Government is indeed doomed . But Madero may yet find his salvation in the fact that the motives of the men who have risen against him are far from irreproachable . The revolution in the north , it is pretty well established , has been financed by followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by a nephew of the ex-Dictator . There must be a saving remnant in the Mexican people to whom it is quite clear that the fall of Madero must mean the restoration in whole or in part of the Diaz influence . The present Government has been charged with failing to redeem its promises of reform with regard to the land policy established under the Diaz regime . The reestablishment of the Diaz influence is hardly the way to bring about that reform . What is this that Dr. Albert Weidemann , of Elberfeld , Germany , syndic of the chamber of commerce there and managing director of the Rhenish-Westphalian Textile Association  --  what is this that he is talking about ? He had been speaking of the high perfection of organization . in American industrial plants , and that is all right ; but what does he mean when he goes on to chatter as follows : We were greatly surprised , too , to see the extensive provision made everywhere for the comfort and weltare of the employees The large number of rooms , gardens , playgrounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not most of us realize that America possessed Plerr Dr. Weidemann is behind the times . The sort of thing he is telling us would have passed current in this country a few years ago , and indeed would have been regarded as a natural acknowledgment of the fortunate conditions to be found in our favored land ; but we have got beyond all that now . Do n't we all know that America is sadly behind all other countries , and especially behind Germany , in everything that pertains to the welfare of the working people ? Does Dr. Weidemann expect to pull the wool over our eyes , and make us believe that there is any possible source of benefit for the masses other than the paternal care of a strong central government ? Mrs. Pankhurst wants war to break out in England as well as in the Balkans . It may be that her fervid declaration , " I incite this meeting to rebellion , " is only an echo of the recent bellicose talk of the Conservatives in Ulster . If Sir Edward Carson is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dubbed " Queen . " But seriously , her summons to her followers to indulge in every form of violence except attempts to take life , will only alienate still more of her former associates , and do her cause great harm . One thing is certain : if the militant suffragists set out deliberately to violate the laws and defy the authorities , they can not complain when punishment is inflicted on them . You ca n't be a willing martyr and at the same time cry out against the hardships of the martyr 's lot . Every broad-minded American will rejoice at the part which this country has played in bringing about a good understanding between Japan and Russia , even though it has involved a series of rebuffs to our Government from both the others . The initial repulse ' has just come to light in an address by a Japanese which is dignified by publication in the Eastern Review It was nothing less than the refusal of Russia to enter into an alliance with us . This event occurred in 1907 , when Mr. Taft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petersburg by way of Siberia . A few journals suggested at the time that he had important objects in view , but their " voice was too weak to attract the attention of the people in general " This wise man of Tokio , however , was not to be caught napping . Soon after Mr. Taft had left the Russian capital , this Japanese made a journey to Southern Russia , where he , " strangely enough , learned that Russian officers there were busy studying English . " The significance of this was plain . " If Russia , from sheer enmity towards Japan , had jumped at the proposed hand , who knows what would have been the effect on the Far East ? But she refused . " Then came the rejection by both Russia and Japan of Mr. Knox 's proposal for the neutralization of the Manchurian railways , and now has followed " Russia 's abnegation of the Russo-American treaty " regarding the equal treatment of all American citizens . These disclosures may take away Mr. Taft 's last hope of reelection , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Orient .
