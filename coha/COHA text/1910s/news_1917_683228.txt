txt BARON ROSEN 'S VIEWS . An Earlier Statement on the , Relations of Germany and Russia . A Petrograd dispatch given with considerable prominence in this morning'spapers presents the views of Baron . Rosen . former Russian Ambassador to the United States and former member of the Council of the Empire , as to Possible basis for peace with the Central Powers . " Baron Rosen urges the negotiation of a conciliatory peace with Germany , based on the impossibility of a victorious ' termination of the war ; and his professed motive for so doing is - the desire to save his country from impending ruin . Whether his real feelings on the subject are unalloyed with any desire to aid Germany may perhaps be judged by placing alongside his present declaration a statement of the views on Russian national policy expressed by him in 1913 , which happens to be referred to in the course of an article on the Russian revolution which appeared in the Revue de Paris last . month . The Revue has . reference to a confidential memorandum of Rosen 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Baron Rosen declares that he can not understand " in what way German domination over Europe runs counter to the interests of Russia , which is rather an Asiatic power . " He adds : " By abandoning to Germany supremacy in the western part of Europe and completely disengaging herself from the rivalry between European powers in the domain of purely European interests , Russia would assure the safety of her western frontier and would have her hands free to accomplish her mission in Asia . " It looks as though anything Baron Rosen may say at this time on the question of peace negotiations were fairly ' subject to a considerable discount  - -  say about 99 per cent.  - -  on the score of pro-Germanism.
