txt In discussing Europe 's ailments arising out of the war , inflated currency is an outstanding symptom . While the war has produced some novelties , inflation , by paper money unsecured or inadequately secured by gold , can not be so classified . After the Napoleonic wars it took four years for the English paper price of gold to come down to the mint price . The following figures , designed to make a technical subject as untechnical as possible , have been discussed with English bankers and money market experts . The proportions of the note issues of the great countries now , as rompared with five years ago , when they were on a fairly sound financial basis in spite of some months of war , may be compared as follows ! INFLATION Br COUNTRIES The world 's paper currency , beginning with Germany , which makes the worst showing , and ending with Spain , which makes about the best , ( excluding Russia as worthless ) has been multiplied , approximately , five times since 1914 . Taking this proportion as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her note issues nine times , and the printing press is ? ohing overtime at the rate of 700,000,000 marks a week . The Bank of France , the sole issuer of notes ( which the German Reichsbank is not ) , has multiplied its paper issues 5.4 times . The Bank of England has issued only 20% of British paper currency . The remaining 80% is in " Bradburys " ? so-called from the signature of the Treas. ury official on the first issues of the one pound and ten shilling notes . Britain , therefore , has multiplied its currency , with these two printing presses taken together , 5.7 times . These three are above the line of the world 's average . COUNTRIES BELOW THE AVERAGE As might be expected , Italy , with four times her 1914 currency , comes nearest of those below the line . The United States comes next with 3.5 times ; then , in succession , Norway , 3.2 ; Japan , 3 ; Sweden 2.6 ; Holland 2.2 ; Denmark , 2.1 ; Switzerland , 2 , and Spain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , Gerrhany and Italy these figures are based upon those of the national banks of the respective countries , because these have been the sole agents for the emission of currency . Bankers here say that it will be easier for England to get back on a gold basis than for any other country . This , of course , excepts the United States , which is in a class by itself . The British Empire is the world 's greatest gold producer . The free market for gold in London at present offers a premium of 20% on gold , and this is tending to become larger , as might be expected from the decline in British exchange . But the South African and other gold will come here first or be sent direct to such points as the British Treasury may designate . THE RAND GOLD PRODFCTION While the Rand gold production is not up to its highest figures , as the monthly output shows , it keeps well above 700,000 ounces a month , and 800,000 ounces would be an event , even in pre-war times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the effort failed , as every , economist had foreseen . Paper money would , of course , not buy the labor and other materials necessary for getting out the gold , in view of the advance in cost caused by paper inflation . The Treasury was therefore compelled to allow the South African gold mines a free market , and the premium upon the mint price is the consequence . People with South African experience , especially the bankers largely interested in the Transvaal gold mines , tell me that native labor , always the chief difficulty in production , especially in mines which can extract sixteen pennyweights from a ton of ore and make a profit , has been remarkably manageable and reasonable in its demands throughout the years of the war . To this is due the fact that 640,000 ounces was the poorest monthly showing . It was by no means a bad one , all things considered , and is not likely to be repeated in the calculable future . SOME LOCAL . EFFECTS OF INFLATION ? One effect of inflation is shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As in the United States , inflation has brought mines into operation which would not be worth working in conditions of sound money . Price fixing as a check upon inflation has miserably failed . It has cost the consumer incalculably more than it can ever have saved him . It has been , in practice , a cause of inflation rather than a check . In recording how Justinian fixed the prices of something over six hundred commodities , Mommsen remarks that his well-meant effort did incalculable harm and no good , bechuse he could not fix the prices of everything else , including wages and rent . He drove many articles out of production , and foreign importations finally toppled over an edifice with no foundation , which was bound to collapse from its own weight anyway . The British Coal Commission , of which Mr. Justice Sankey ( sometimes called Mr. Justice Thankye from his unappreciated methods of conciliation ) was the presiding officer , inquired into the coal situation . It is difficult to find any independent critic here who will speak of that commission and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F1771LE MINIMUM WAGES The commission , like some of our own Congressional committees , had found its verdict , in this case the nationalization of the coal mines , before it heard the evidence , and called witnesses to prove its fore-ordained findings . Some of these witnesses , however , notably the Duke of Northumberland , one of the largest proprietors of coal royalties , and remarkably well informed on the whole coal situation , and one or two Australians speaking with experience of nationalization in . Australia , disappointed the commission . It was not until after the commission 's recommendations and findings were published that hostile evidence of this kind was available to the coal consuming public . ' With a futile effort to carry inflation to its limits , the commission fixed a minimum rate for the miner 's wages per day , mostly above what he could , or rather would , earn on the value of his product . One Derbyshire coal owner told me that in his own and neighboring mines this had actually reduced the miner 's output from lO% to 20 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it is remembered that the desperate necessity is increased production of coal , both in gross quantity and in units of heating power , it will be seen that the Coal Commission , so far from settling anything , left the situation much worse than it found it . Too MUCH SPENDING MONEY One obvious result of inflation through paper currency is that people carry about with them , in their pockets , habitually , far more spending money than they need , and as a result the money burns holes in their pockets . In Berlin the flourishing trade of the stores dealing in pure luxuries of the most expensive character ? furs , jewelry , costly clothing and even objects of what the German is pleased to call art  --  was most noticeable . London is engaged in a similar orgy of spending , and reports from Manchester , Birmingham and other great industrial centers are to the same effect . If the German attitude is one of " Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die " , the British temper is only a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost wanton extravagance of the administration . Wealth is undoubtedly increasing if we measure British output by mere prices . But this does not yet represent an increased reserve of those tangible things expressed in tons , bales , barrels , quarters and pounds ? wealth independent of inflation and , indeed , the only true cure for it .
