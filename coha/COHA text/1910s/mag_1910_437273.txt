THE witty remark of Dumas , that Lamartine had raised history to the dignity of romance , would have appealed to Thomas Buckle , who was much occupied with reducing it to the level of a science . Critics have told us that the attempt of the latter was a flat failure . But the attitude of the critics toward Buckle is less reassuring than the attitude of the scientists toward history ; for while the former maintain that Buckle pursued a good end by a false method , the latter to this day reproach history with being entertaining and useless . The remarks of Herbert Spencer in this connection are well known to every one . But perhaps there are some who have not heard the complaint of Professor Minot , who recently took occasion , in some public addresses , to lament the quite obvious futility of present historical methods . Whereas , in all other departments of knowledge great and useful advances were being made , historians alone were industriously engaged in aimless endeavor . In this opinion he had been confirmed only the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , or wherever it was that he spent his vacation , a work which he supposed represented the best that modern historical scholarship could offer ? the first volume of the Cambridge Modern History ! A part of his summer had been pleasantly spent in perusing this work . In it he found much of interest : events related in great detail ; facts , curious and suggestive , presented , the truth of 024 which could doubtless not be questioned . But of fruitful generalization , there was little indeed , no effort having been made , apparently , to reduce the immense mass of facts to principles of universal validity . I do not suppose there are many historians who carry the Cambridge Modern History with them to the mountains . It is not a book to be read in the greenwood . Certainly , the vision of the eminent professor dropping the ponderous tome into a vacation trunk , and pressing the lid deliberately down without a qualm , is pathetic enough . And yet the Cambridge Modern History is a serious work . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should be . Until Professor Minot found it interesting , no one , I imagine , ever thought it in danger of being classed as literature . If it is not science , it is nothing . Professor Minot , who is perfectly clear about its not being science , in spite of its being entertaining , would doubtless find the lively remarks of Bagehot , in his essay on Gibbon , even more entertaining . ' Whatever may be the uses of this sort of composition in itself and abstractedly , it is certainly of great use relatively and to literary men . Consider the position of a man of that species . He sits beside a library lire , with nice white paper , a good pen , a capital style , every means of saying everything , but nothing to say ; of course he is an able man , ? but still one can not always have original ideas . Every day can not be an era , ? and how dull it is DETACHMENT AND THE WRITING OF HISTORY 525 to make it your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to write , and then to have nothing to say ! What a if something would happen ! Then one could describe it . Something has happened , and that something is history . Perhaps when a Visigoth broke a lead , he thought that that was all . Not so : he was making history ; Gibbon has written it down . ' Humorous sallies like this are to be enjoyed , but happily need not be answered . At least it is so in this case , for most historians will readily agree with Professor Minot that the Cambridge .110 ( lern History contains a great mass of facts the truth of which can not be quest ioned . But they will think that in saying so he has given the book a very good character indeed . You can not disconcert the orthodox historian of our day by saying that he has got a mass of facts together without knowing what 10 do with them : if the truth of them can not indeed be questioned , he will know very well what to do with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine the sentiments of the authors if Professor Minot had said that the beautifully coiird Mated generalizations , with which t he Cambridge Modern History is packed , are most stimulating and suggestive . ' Their chagrin would have been immense ! No , the modern historian is not given to generalization . It is not his business to generalize , ? so , at least , he thinks ; it is his business to find out and to record exactly what hap-petted . ' So far , Bagehot is quite right after all . History is what happened ; the historian must write it down , if not like Gibbon , at least wie es ist eigentlich yiresen . If historians Ole this attitude somewhat uncompromisingly , it is not because they do not care for scientific history . Quite the contrary ! They care for not ling so much ; and to contribute a little to such history ? to make a permanent contribution to knowledge ' ? is their chiefest ambition . Yet the thoughtful man knows well , in spite of what the reviewers say every month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution to knowledge . In nearly every age , able men have written histories ; of them all , a few have proved permanent contributions to literature ; as history , not one but must be edited . Even the great masters , whom we loyally advised every one to read without reading them ourselves , do not escape . Of course Tacitus was a great writer , but he was not at all scientific : he had ideas , and they were , unfortunately , the ideas of a Roman republican . Even Gibbon , with all his fine lack of enthusiasm , gave expression to the eighteenth-century dream of a golden age . Finding nothing in the Middle Ages but the triumph of barbarism and Christianity , ' he too , in his ponderous fashion , voiced the demand gerstsmLinfcime !

Hatred of tractarianism guides a facile pen through twelve volumes . The Reform Bill is read back into the Revolution of 1688 . The memory of Sedan becomes a misleading gloss in all Merovingian manuscripts . Little wonder if the modern historian , stumbling over the wreckage that strews his path , has no desire to add anything of his own to the debris . Much better , he thinks , to be employed quarrying out of the bed- 526 DETACHMENT AND THE WRITING OF HISTORY rock of historical fact even one stone , so it be chiseled four-square , that may find its niche in the permanent structure of some future master-builder . This attitude of mind is not peculiar to historians . In every field of intellectual activity , men of science are reconstructing the cosmos in terms of the evolutionary hypothesis . We are most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium , and yet there is one thing that seems to be exempt from the operation of this law of change and adaptation which incessantly transforms everything else ? truth itself : everything is unstable except the idea of instability . It is true , the Pragmatists are asking whether , if everything is subject to the law of change , truth be not subject to the law of change , and reality as well ? the very facts themselves . But whatever scientists may think of this notion , historians have not yet been disturbed by it . For them , certainly , truth is a fixed quality : the historical reality , the ' fact , ' is a thing purely objective , that does not change ; a thing , therefore , that can be established once for all beyond any peradventure . So well established is this idea , that it has been formulated in a law of history . Il y a toujours un correspondance entre les faits intellectuels , et l'etat general des esprits ; une loi qui a comme corollaire la suivante : le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faits de l'esprit qu'il entoure . La verite seule n'est pas soumise a ' influence du milieu ; elle ne change pas avec le dernier . ' The truth , which alone changes not , is what must be got at . The objective reality must be caught , as it were , and mounted like a specimen for the instruction of future ages . But this is exceedingly difficult , precisely because le changement du milieu intellectuel entraine toujours un changement dans les faits de l'esprit qu'il entoure . ' This difficulty must therefore be the rock on which all previous historians have split . Not sufficiently aware of the disastrous influence of the milieu , they have unconsciously read the objective facts of the past in the light of their own purposes , or the preoccupations of their own age . But , after all , how is it possible to avoid the influence of one 's milieu ?

' But it is Nietzsche who has sketched for us , in his inimitable manner , the portrait of the detached man : ? ' The objective man is in truth a mirror : accustomed to prostration before something that wants to be known . with such desires only as knowing or " reflecting " implies ? he waits until something comes , and then expands himself sensitively , so that even the light footsteps and gliding past of spiritual beings may not be lost in his surface and film .

Neither is he a model man ; he does not o in advance of any one , nor after either ; he places himself generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil .

' If you like , you may ' believe there never was such a mal : the wonderful creature is doubtless only an ideal . The ideal , nevertheless , is clear enough . It is an ideal based upon the familiar conception of the ' pure reason ' ? reason cut loose from will and emotion , from purpose and passion and desire , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some methodological purifying flame . Intelligence , thus reduced to a kind of delicate mechanical instrument , set carefully in a sealed ease to protect it from the deflecting influences of environment , we are to suppose capable of acting automatically when brought in contact with objective phenomena . These phenomena ? the ' facts ' of history , for example ? come before it , ' wanting to be known ' ; it expands itself sensitively , and truth is registered upon its polished surface , as objects are upon a photographic plate . Only in this manner can we know the thing wie es ist eigentlich ger , ell ; but in this manner , if at all , we shall surely be able to record exactly what happened . Certainly there is something impress-e in the assertion that it is the business of the historian to ' get the facts . ' In our generation , the mere word ' fart ' is something to conjure with .

A fact is something substantial , something material , something you can perhaps take up in your hand , or stand upon : it will always bear your weight . And so , with much talk about cold facts , ' and hard facts , ' and not being able to ' get around the facts , ' it has come to a pass where the historical fact seems almost material too , something that can be handed about and pressed with the thumb to test its solidity . But , in truth , the historical fact is a thing wonderfully elusive after all , very difficult to fix , almost impossible to distinguish from theory , ' to which it is commonly supposed to be so completely antithetical . It is said to be a fact that Cwsar was stabbed by the senators , in the senate-house at Rome ; and this is , I suppose , as simple a fact as one will ordinarily deal with : as hard as any , and quite as difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister purpose , to get around it . But it is really simple only in the sense that it is a simple statement easily comprehended . It is itself made up of many simpler facts : the senators standing round , the words that were said , the scuffle , the three and twenty dagger-strokes , ? numberless facts , indeed , make the single fact that Caesar was stabbed in the senate-house . With equal facility , this single fact may be combined with others to form a more complex , but still relatively simple fact , ? the fact that Antony , Octavius , and Lepidus replaced Csar in the government of Rome . Thus , while we speak of historical facts as if they were pebbles to be gathered in a cup , there is in truth no unit fact in history . The historical reality is continuous , and infinitely complex ; and the cold hard facts into which it is said to be analyzed are not concrete por- 528 DETACHMENT AND THE WRITING OF HISTORY tions of the reality , but only aspects of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' facts ' of history , whatever they once were , are only mental images or pictures which the historian makes in order to comprehend it . How , then , are these images formed ? Not from the reality directly , for the reality has ceased to exist . But the reality has left certain traces , and these help us to construct the image . Some one saw Cmsar stabbed , and afterwards wrote down , let us suppose , this : ? On the Ides of March , Cmsar was stabbed by the senators in the senate-house at the base of Pompey 's statue , which all the while ran blood . ' I suppose myself an historian , reading this statement . As I read , a mental picture is at once formed : several men in a room , at the base of a statue , driving daggers into one of their number . But it is not the statement alone that enables me to form the picture : my own experience enters in . I have seen men and rooms and daggers , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture is composed . Suppose me to know nothing of the ancient Roman world : my picture would doubtless be composed of the senate-chamber at Washington , of men in frock coats , and of bowie-knives , perhaps . It is true , the picture changes as I read more of the Roman world . Yet at each step in this transformation , it is still my own experience that furnishes the new elements for the new picture . New sources enable me to combine the elements of experience more correctly , but experience must furnish the elements to select from . The ' facts ' of history do not exist for any historian until he creates them , and into every fact that he creates some part of his individual experience must enter . But experience not only furnishes the elements for the image which thesources guide us in forming : it is also the final court of appeal in evaluating the source . themselves . History rests on testimony , but the qualitative value of testimony is determined in the last analysis by tested and accepted experience . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naivete of Joseph De Maistre , who imagined that the negations of science could be destroyed by the assertions of history . With a single perfectly proved historical fact , he courageously proposed to defy the whole tribe of geometers , J'ai it vows repondre qu'Archimede bride la flouc romaine avec un miroir ardent , ' ? if it were once perfectly proved . But the historian knows well that no amount of testimony is ever permitted to establish as past reality a thing that can not be found in present reality . And it is not enough to be able to find in present experience the elements for a picture of the alleged past fact . One can , for example , readily picture the destruction of the Roman fleet by means of a burning-glass , or the bleeding of Pompey 's statue ; the elements for such pictures are familiar . But the sources ask us to make a combination of the elements which the registered experience of our age does not warrant . In every other case the witness may have a perfect character ? all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he says the Germans do not inhabit cities , we believe hint , though we do not know precisely what he means by cities . But when he says that Tiberius , having lived for fifty years a sane and well-ordered life , became quite suddenly a monster of lust and cruelty , we do not believe him so readily . If he had said a thousand times oNter that the Germans had wings , we should still say that the Germans had no wings . The classic expression of this truth // is of course Hume 's famous argument against miracle . That argument does not really prove that miracles never occurred in history ; it proves only that there is no use having a past through which the intellect can not freely range with a certain sense of security . If we can not be on familiar terms with our past , it is no good . We must have a past that is the product of all the present . With sources that say it was prth not so , we will have nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so . The sources say ? and it is a commonplace now that they say nothing more persistently , or with greater particularization of detail ? that during the Middle Ages miracles were as common as lies . The modern historian admits that there were lies , but denies that there were miracles . He not only rejects the miracle , ? the explanation of fact , ? he rejects the facts as well ; he says that such facts are not proved ; for him , there were no such facts . And he rejects these facts , not because they are contrary to every possible law of nature , to every possible experience , but simply because they are contrary to the comparatively few laws of nature which his generation is willing to regard as established . But as rapidly as scientists can find a place for such facts in experience , historians will create them in history , ? a truth which the progress of psychical research promises to illustrate in a striking manner . Even now , indeed , Anatole France and Andrew Lang can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because one of them takes psychical research seriously , while the other thinks it is all moonshine . I f the reality of history can be reached only through the door of present experience , one may well ask how our objective man , so detached and indifferent , with no mental reservations referring to human affairs , will proceed in determining the facts . There he sits in Mars , ? or , better still , the British Museum , ? ready to expand sensitively when something comes , wanting to be known . Unfortunately , nothing comes . Our perfectly detached man is mildly distressed , perhaps , to find that the thing first of all absolutely required is an act of will : a painful thing , and , strictly speaking , impossible for him . Suppose this difficult step once taken , still there is nothing before him but paper with writing on it ; and I think he may expand himself sensitively for an endless term with no great result . The trouble is that the dead manuscripts do not want to be known ' ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our objective man must himself want to know , and wanting to know implies a purpose in knowing . Even the will , to be purely objective is itself a purpose , becoming not infrequently a passion , creating the facts in its own image . But we are not told that the business of the historian is limited to finding out exactly what happened ; he must also record exactly what happened . It is the fashion to call this the problem of synthesis , as distinguished from investigation , criticism , or analysis . The distinction is doubtless a convenient one , but it will not bear too close inspection . If there is no unit fact in history , if the facts are only mental images , why , then , it must be very difficult to assert a fact without thereby making a synthesis . Cmsar was stabbed in the senate-house ' is a fact , but it is also a synthesis of other facts . Strictly speaking , analysis and syn .. thesis can not be rigidly distinguished . And the reason is not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis and no real synthesis . When the historian is engaged in what the met hodologists call analysis , it is not the reality that he takes apart , but only the sources , ? a very different matter . 530 DETACHMENT AND THE WRITING OF HISTORY Perfect analysis is achieved when each source is transformed into as many statements as it explicitly or implicitly contains . These statements are then set down on separate cards or slips of paper ; and with these cards the historian must be content , for the simple reason that nothing better is possible . Even this analysis is , indeed , not always possible . For some periods of history it is possible , but for most of modern history , at least , it remains only an ideal : a wilderness of slips would not suffice for even a few years ; so that , if scientific history is inseparable from complete analysis of the sources , we are confronted with the disquieting paradox that the less knowledge we have of history the more scientific that knowledge becomes . Without attempting to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already finished : all the sources critically edited , separated into their simplest statements , recorded on separate cards ticketed with date and reference , arranged chronologically . There are the ' facts ' ; it remains to construct the synthesis . The chronological arrangement would , sure enough , be no mean synthesis in itself . One may ask what , after all , remains to be done by our objective man , sitting there before his card-cases , intent to record exactly what happened . Everything that happened , so far as any trace of it is left , is already recorded , it seems . But the truth is , no one is satisfied with that , unless it be our objective man . For most of us , afflicted with mere human purposes , a case full of cards may be magnificent , but it is not history . Out of these cards we will get some useful , intelligible meaning . The problem of synthesis is , indeed , not to record exactly what happened , but by simplification to convey an intelligible meaning of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first step to the last . This necessary simplification mar be achieved , I suppose , in one of too ways : by classification in terms of corn . mon qualities , or by grouping in terms of concrete relations . Comparing what is related of all kings ( assuming that the term king is precisely understood ) , the historian may find that all kings have been crowned . This quality common to all kings is then reduced to a single statement , ' all kings are crowned . ' This is the method of the natural sciences , and of sociology as well . Certainly , it is a method well worth while ; but , as we are all agreed that history is not sociology , it can not be the method of the historian . The historian , therefore , proceeds by the other method . Concerned with a particular king , he will group the facts related of this particular king , according to their concrete relations , thus : ' George III , having succeeded to the throne of England October 23 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and formally crowned at Westminster , September 22 , 1761 . ' The historian , like the sociologist , has simplified the facts for the purpose of conveying an intelligible meaning . But the difference between the two methods is profound . The statement that all kings arc crowned is an abstraction , a generalization of qualifies common to all kings . From this generalization , it can be inferred of any actual king that he was crowned , and that inference every one must make , because the statement implies just that and nothing else . But the statement about George III is not an abstraction . It is just as concrete as any of the numberless particular sta tements upon which it is based . From it no particular fact can be deduced : it can not be inferred that the Privy Council met , or that mounted heralds went forth // reading a solemn document on the London streets to crowds of gaping le The historian knows that these prop ? things were done , and he has crowded them all into the term proclaimed . ' lint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England were customarily proclaimed in that way , the term sill have only a vague significance : something was done , he does not know what . The sociologist has simplified by combining particular facts in a generalization , from which any one can deduce again the particular fact , and no other . The historian has simplified by selecting , from a number of particular facts , certain facts which he considers most important to be known . It seems , then , that the great point in historical synthesis is selection : which of the numberless particular facts shall the historian select ? One wishes to know at once , therefore , if there is some objective standard for determining the relative value of facts ; a standard which , being applied by any somber of trained historians , will gi vc t he same result in each case . Well , 1 OS , We are told there is such a standard , and one residing in the facts themselves , and therefore purely objective . The facts to be selected for constructing What is called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the initiated , distinguish t hem as clearly as if they were labeled for historians only . ' Professor Fling , in his admirable summary of the elaborate work of Rickert , ' tells us what these characteristics are : the historian selects facts that are unique , facts that have value On account of their uniqueness , facts that are casually connected , facts that reveal unique change or evolution . Historians who proceed thus , proceed scientifically ; and while it is doubtless true that no two historians will use identical terms in phrasing their ' concepts , ' yet ' the progress of historical synthesis means a growing agreement among scientific historians touching the important facts of this or that period . " If they proceed scientifically , ' the same facts will be selected by the opponents of the French Revolution . as have been selected by the supporters of it . ' It seems , therefore , if this is indeed a practical standard for evaluating the facts of history , and one truly objective , that we have at last a kind of philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even for one who has attained complete detachment , or for our disinterested objective man . One has only to examine the facts , select such as bear the mark , and put them together : the result is sure . Nevertheless , the use of the word value in this formula is disquieting . The difficulties which it is sure to raise have been recognized , but not altogether disposed of . ' The use of the word value , ' says Professor Fling , ' seems to introduce an uncertain and arbitrary element into the problem . But the question of value is not a question of partisanship , nor of approval or disapproval ; it is a question of importance . Is this fact important for the Reformation ? Is an account of the Reformation intelligible without it ? The Protestant may love Luther , the Catholic may hate him , but they would agree that Luther is important for the Reformation . ' To say that the question of value is a question of importance , does little to resolve the difficulty . We still ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reformation . But 532 DETACHMENT AND THE WRITING OF HISTORY I suppose the Reformation is one of those very concepts ' which Professor Fling is telling us how to construct in a scientific manner . All that we yet know , therefore , is that the concept is formed by selecting the facts that are important for the concept . If Protestant and Catholic have a concept of the Reformation to begin with , the concept is not determined by the facts ; if they have no concept to begin with , why is Luther more important than Tetzel ? Indeed , the historian may be neither Protestant nor Catholic , and to him I should think the Reformation might be perfectly intelligible if Luther 's part in it were reduced to very slight proportions ; to him , it might be intelligible on that ground only . Have we not already been told that the Reformation was primarily an illustration , on a grand scale , of the law of diminishing returns ? That concept , if it is intelligible at all , is intelligible without Luther . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept , or does the concept come first and determine the facts ? The heart of the question is there . It seems that Professor Fling virtually admits that the concept comes first . The historical method is thus teleological in a certain sense . The subject of an historical investigation is a unique thing . . .. It has beginning and end . We know what the end was , and we wish to know what the chain of events was that led up to the final event . We seek such facts , to be wrought up into a synthesis , as may be necessary to show how the end was attained . ' We know what the end was . But in what sense do we know what the end was , of the French Revolution , for example ? Of the French Revolution , surely the end is not yet . Lord Morley tells us that it is still some way from being fully accomplished . ' The process is still going on , and a man of M. Taine 's lively intellectual sensibility can no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dients of the air he breathes . ' And if we hold to the doctrine of the continuity of history , how far back must we go to find a period that is fully accomplished ? In truth , we know the end only in part . The historian may choose to consider the Restoration of 1815 as the end of the French Revolution ; but his concept of that end , which must determine the facts he selects , will be born of the age in which he lives . One can scarcely imagine any historian living in 1825 , even the most scientific in the world , having the same concept of the Restoration that Professor Fling has . Unfortunately , the historian and his concepts are a part of the very process he would interpret ; the end of that process is ever changing , and the historian will scarcely avoid changing with it , whether he have the lively intellectual sensibility of M. TaMe , or be as placid as Nietzsche 's objective man . If the historian could indeed separate himself from the proCess which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemist is outside of chemistry , his greatest success should be with those periods that differ most from the one in which he lives . But he has , in fact , most success with those periods in which men 's habitual modes of thought and action most resemble his own . Strange and remote events , to he synthesized intelligibly at all , must be interpreted in terms of motives that are familiar . It is true , the actions of men in all past ages have been such as to justify us in assuming a fundamental similarity in human motives . Yet familiar motives are much more intensely felt in some ages than in others . The religious motive is still active in the twentieth century , but the exaggerated asceticism of the Middle Ages al- DETACHMENT AND THE WRITING OF HISTORY 533 ready partakes of the unreal . The historian finds that for some centuries men entered monasteries and lived im-possible lives of self-stultification , and they did this , so the documents tell him , for the love of God and the salvation of . outs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fashion , is remote from us of the twentieth century . It no longer satisfies us to label monasteries with the words ' salvation of souls , ' and so we are writing over their portals the words ' economic institutions ' instead . Did they not serve as inns , and recover much marsh land ? Of this exaggerated asceticism , St. Simeon Stylites is the classic example . In explaining him , the modern historian , whether M. Thine or another , has some difficulty . Not that he finds it impossible to form an image of the poor monk standing there ; he can form the image perfectly . Nor can he reject the fact because contrary to observed experience ; he has seen men standing at the top of a pillar , has done it himself , or could do it , perhaps . To find a motive that would induce him to do what Stylites is said to have done , ? the difficulty is there . He ca n't just explain him by the lack of inns . So he says , ' interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really too remote . For the normal child , St. Simeon would be perhaps one of the least remote objects of the whole Middle Age , because the child , even the twentieth-century child , lives in a world which we do not know , and which we are therefore pleased to call the world of fancy . The child is , in fact , perfectly detached from all those dull practical interests with which mature men are so preoccupied . He is as indifferent to them as if he did indeed live in another planet ; and yet he makes a synthesis of the historical reality that would fail to satisfy , I suppose , even M. Renan. . fairly obedient child , it is true , willmake any synthesis you require of him ; but he regards it , for the most part , as a meaningless and vexatious business . For him , the reality is whatever relates itself to his interests , whatever coordinates readily with his dream world . He is unpatriotic enough to prefer the winged gods of Greece to John Smith or Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knights-errant without purpose , St. Simeon Stylites standing , solemn and useless , at the top of a pillar , ? from these he is not detached . He , too , has a concept of the end , and will , if left to himself , select the facts that are important for that concept , thereby constructing a synthesis quite true and valuable for his purposes . The method of the trained historian is not essentially different , I suspect , from that of the child . He achieves a different result , it is true ; but that is because he has a different concept ' round which to group the facts ? a concept derived from the practical or intellectual interests that concern him . If there is a growing agreement among scientific historians touching the important facts of this or that period , ' it is because there is , in every age , a certain response in the world of thought to dominant social forces . But the agreement is only for the particular age ; the next age , or the next generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political revolution there is perhaps a growing agreement that ' history is past politics . ' In an age when industrial problems are pressing for solution the economic interpretation of history ' is the thing . The advent of the social state will doubtless give us some new formula . Whatever it may be , the historian of the future will select the facts that are important for that concept . The historian , as Professor Fling has said , does indeed have a concept of the end , and he selects the facts that will 534 DETACHMENT AND THE WRITING OF HISTORY explain how that end came about . But it is the concept that determines the facts , not the facts the concept . From beginning to end , the historian is outside the subject of his investigation , ? ' the life of an historical personage , a battle , an economic crisis , a period in the life of a people , ' or whatever it is that he professes to confine himself to . Instead of sticking to the facts , ' the facts stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they will stick to him to some purpose only if his ideas are many , vivid , and fruitful . Complete detachment would produce few histories , and none worth while ; for the really detached mind is a dead mind , lying among the facts of history like unmagnetized steel among iron-filings , no synthesis ever resulting , in one case or the other , to the end of time . Consider the trained historian , intent on studying the sixteenth century . Before him are the analyzed sources ? t he ' facts ' ? neatly arranged in cases . He begins thumbing the cards , reading the statements , taking in the facts . Doubtless he says to himself : ' This fact is unique , important because unique , casually connected ; I will therefore set it aside to be wrought up into my final syntlisies ! No such thing . As he goes over and over his cards , some aspects of the reality recorded there interest him more , others less ; some are retained , others forgotten ; some have power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be casually connected ; some logically connected ; some are without perceptible connection of any sort . And the reason is simple : some facts strike the mind as interesting or suggestive , have a meaning of some sort , lead to some desirable end , because they associate themselves with ideas already in the mind ; they fit in somehow to the ordered experience of the historian . This original synthesis ? not to be con fused with the making of a book for the printer , a very different matter ? only half deliberate . It is accomplished almost automatically . The mind will select and discriminate from the very beginning . It is the whole ' apperceb : - ing mass ' that does the business , seizing upon this or that new impression and building it into its own growing content . As new facts are taken in , the old ideas or concepts , it is true , are modified , distinguished , destroyed even ; but the modified ideas become new centres of attraction . And so the pro . cess is continued , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed of facts unique , casually connected , revealing unique change ; but the unique fact , selected because of its importance , was in every case selected because of its importance for some idea already in possession of the field . The original concepts , which give character to the entire synthesis , were cottribtfted , not by the facts of the sixteenth century , but by the facts of the twentieth century . If the modern historian exhibits detachment , certainly it is not from the dominant ideas of his own age . The very purpose of the age is to comprehend without purpose , to judge of the event by the event itself , to register a fact and call it a law . The effort to be purely objective , the aversion from stereotyped religious and political formulat , the solemn determination to see the thing as it really is , ? these are fixed concepts , round which the historian constructs his synthesis . It is not because he is detached from his environment , but because he is preoccupied with a certain phase of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a chronicle , something less than literature . The modern historian , for example , is . detached from any fixed idea in religion , placing himself too far off ? for espousing the // cause of either good or evil . ' But he knows well that he must espouse , with tine enthusiasm , the cause of not eslon:ing any cause . His synthesis must ? indicate , not Luther or Leo X , but hi . own ideal of detachment . Was Catholicism or Protestantism true , or ; . al , or useful ? Why , both and neither , tries the modern historian , and he can tutswer yott that without ever having expanded himself sensitively before the one or the other . In so far as either ( Akio ! , it was necessary , adapted to the conditions , and therefore doubtless good and true . Whatever happens , the historian will be detached ; he will not take sides . Rut it is difficult not to take sides if . harp contrasts and impassable gulfs arc permitted to appear . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dispense with both . The modern historian has therefore a con --  rcpt. a preconcept , of continuity and culution , with ' natural law ' at the lack of things . The historical reality must be conceived as all of a piece , like a woven garment . In things evil must be perceived an element of things good , and in things good an element of things evil . Facts which do not con-I rilm e to establish these concepts will not be selected ; they may be unique , but they are judged not important . No man is a hero to his valet . Doubtless valets have a definite concept of what masters are , and select only the facts that are important for that concept . owadays , certainly , no man is a hero to his biographer , much less a villain . The historical mind is detached from all concepts of that sort , and thus Napoleon becomes a necessary process instead of a scoundrel . Do you ask the modern historian whether he loves Luther or hates him ? What a question ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Diminishing Returns , that we owe religious liberty . There is profound truth in the biting remark of Voltaire , that , after all , history is only a pack of tricks we play on the dead . If useful social ends are served , it does not harm the dead , who had in any case tricks of their own . The trick of every past age ? of St. Augustine , of Bossuet , of Gibbon and Rousseau and Voltaire himself , all the brilliant legerdemain of the eighteenth century ? has long since been exposed . Yet it is the theory of the detached historian himself that these syntheses served , like every vital institution , a certain social purpose . If the medieval Church was necessary to preserve Europe from anarchy , a synthesis like St. Augustine 's , creating history in the image of the Church , was surely necessary and useful . If ' enlightenment ' was all that could save Europe from obscurantism in the eighteenth century , a synthesis of history proving the Church indispensable to human welfare , as the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite useless , and impossible . And so the synthesis constructed by modern historians may very likely have its uses . When old landmarks are being washed away , and old foundations are crumbling to dust , it is doubtless useful and necessary to conceive the historical reality as continuous , casually connected , and changing only in response to forces largely remote from purposive human will . Some future Lord Morley will tell the world how the histories of the nineteenth century served a useful social purpose , and did ' a certain amount of good in a bad way . ' And if useful and necessary , then true  --  true in the only way that historical synthesis is ever likely to be true , true relatively to the needs of the age which fashioned it . At least , it is difficult to understand how the modern man , so wedded to the doctrine of evolution , can conceive of historical synthesis as true in any absolute sense . Institutions , he would agree , are true or false only as they are adapted for survival . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas too , only the fittest surviving ? One can readily imagine the doctrine of survival of the fittest proving socially disintegrating in the end , in which case some other hypothesis will doubtless prove itself fittest to survive by surviving in fact . Certainly , the evolutionary hypothesis gives us no assurance that detachment will forever be in fashion among historians . The state of mind best calculated to find out exactly what happened is perhaps incompatible with a disposition to care greatly what it is that happened ; and whatever value the notion of detachment may have just ROW , the time may come ? there have been such times in the past ? when it is most important that every one should care greatly what happens . In that case , one can hardly think of the objective man ' as possessing qualities exceptionally well adapted for survival . Then we may perhaps have histories as interesting as Professor Minot imagines the Cambridge Modern History is now . One scarcely ventures to hope they will be as scientific as he thinks they ought to be .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
