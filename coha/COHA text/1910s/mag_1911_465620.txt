WE are self-conscious beings ; we know that we exist , and this knowledge is the starting-point of every possible kind of further knowl ? edge . By means of the senses we also know that the world of Nature exists , but not with the same kind of absolute knowledge which self-consciousness gives ; still , for all practical purposes , we know and admit that besides the self , or ego , there is the not-self , equally real but real ? ized in a different way . We find an ad ? mirable fitness or correspondence between ourselves and our world , and the more we know of both the more complex and wonderful we find the affinities and rela ? tionships between the microcosm of man and the macrocosm wherein he dwells . There appears to he no limit to what we may discover in these directions . The glory of modern science is twofold , as it reveals progressively the wonders of Man and the wonders of Man 's dwelling . But there are questions which science can not answer , though a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leads us to ask them . Was there ever a beginning of time ? Is there a limit to space ? When did the cosmic whole begin to be ? Whence did it come ? How and why did it become what it is ? What will be the end of us and it ? If God is the first cause and origin of all things , was there a time when there was only God and no universe ? These are only a few of the questions to which the utmost develop ? ment of scientific research can promise but imperfect replies . Much to the order of our minds seems to be unknowable . Lord Kelvin asked another question , prompted by the profound acquaintance with physics to which he attained , and , put briefly , it was this : Do the cosmic processes , of which we know the principal laws , contain a promise of permanence , of endless renewal ? He was reluctantly compelled to reply in the negative . Although Lord Kelvin exercised sound reasoning , we may still ask , Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind overlooked some impor ? tant physical factors ? Were his induc ? tions wrong when lie pictured the scheme of creation as similar to a clock that , having been wound up once , is now run ? ning down ? a scheme in which all the tendency of matter is to aggregate and of energy to dissipate ? The dissipation of energy is often re ? garded as the converse of the conservation of energy , whereas the conservation of energy actually involves and necessitates dissipation . We can never do any kind of work involving the transfer of energy without its dissipation being involved . Milk spilled on the sand is still milk . only it is no longer available to quench . our hunger or thirst . And similarly we may say that dissipated energy is no longer capable of sustaining life . The conservation of matter and energy may he regarded as rigidly true even in " a wound-up and running-down " scheme of creation . Although Kelvin 's idea of life and phenomena as ' being transitory may ap ? pear to be scientifically sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not agree with man 's intuitions , and these , being the product of Nature , must have a cer ? tain value in the interpretation of Nat ? ure , although they have no scientific precision , and , of course , can hardly bear to be tested by the rules of logic . We instinctively feel that what has so long been prepared for , what has been so minutely and correctly correlated , and so lately comprehended in much of its glory and beauty , can not have appeared only to he qnenehed again In endless night . It is difficult to think that the thread of infinity should go on smooth and con ? tinuous for countless eons , that then comes a time when the kink in it which we call life should come into being , that this kink should occur only to be dis sipated , and that the thread of existence should again straighten out into an eter ? nal lifelessness . The intuitions of most of us tell us that the beautiful thread is ever spun of the multiple fibers of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that interaction of things and agencies we call animated existence , and that consequently life is not a kink , but a continuity . Agencies exist that can deal with the ceaseless radiation that is continually be ? ing so prodigally poured forth from the sun and his peers , the stars , seemingly to be dissipated and rendered unavailable . There are agencies that can pick up this degraded energy and convert it into those higher forms of energy that are involved in life . There are also factors that can distribute as well as concentrate matter . Able philosophers have rightly said that tho clash of dead suns may give birth to vivid stars , but each new star , made up of completely colliding dead suns , has taken two such dark stars to supply the fuel for this rebirth . Ts this rolling up into larger and larger masses to continue until the whole matter of creation is aggregated and has finally become one cool . dead einder ? Is all the energy that is now giving life and beauty to the uni ? verse doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incessantly poured out toward the endless regions of space , to remain spilled and unavailable in those boundless voids ? The answer in each case is emphatical ? ly no . Degraded energy can be lifted up , agencies can diffuse matter as well as con ? centrate it . Gravitation is not the only aggregating agent that Nature may use in the mechanism of existence . There is another collecting agent in addition to gravitation , not mysterious and elusive , but quite easy to understand . The whole creation is like the differential governor of an engine , in which all inequalities are enabled to right themselves . The life of the universe is this struggle of Iwo sets of opposing agencies , one set tending to inequality , while , on the other hand , another set is ever regulating this tidal action and converting it into a rhythmic cycle of eternal life . Clerk-Maxwell showed that a set of imaginary " demons " could render the theory of dissipation ineffective . He sug gested that , were the swift atoms alone allowed to escape from the bounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way would be elevated . It will he shown that atoms actually do thus sort them ? selves by natural means , and that the recently detected aggregating agency tends to the concentration of such es ? caping atoms . Let us try to understand some of these agencies which Lord Kelvin overlooked . It must first of all be stated that almost the whole cyclic scheme of the creation about to be discussed depends upon graz ? ing collisions between cosmic bodies and systems , of all orders of complexity of dimensions and of mass . An atom when isolated is a molecule . Except in special cases , the temperatures dealt with in problems of cosmic collisions are general ? ly so high that complex molecules must be largely dissociated into atoms . Pro ? fessor See accepts this idea as de ? monstrated in his remarkable and most suggestive book The Cophire Theory . A number of astronomers accept the idea that suns collide ; some doubt it . Were the collision of two suns a chance event , dependent alone on their accidental hitting , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we might well doubt . But no fewer than eleven agencies actually tending to ac ? celerate collision have already been de ? tected . One alone , namely , deflection produced by attraction , has been cal ? culated by Mr. Gavin Burns , B.Sc. , to increase the chance of a graze about one hundred times . Suppose the other ten agencies each increase the chances only twice , though some of them are certainly nearer ten times , We have then 100x2 ' , that is , over 100,000 times more hits than mere chance encounters would suggest . It is also shown by many spectroscopic and other observations , until the evidence is indisputable , that solar grazing impacts do occur : that when we see Nova we are actually observing the explosions pro ? duced by grazing suns . Lord Kelvin and a great number of other learned men who have discussed solar impacts appear to have omitted from their calculations the following fundamental consideration : We know that flint and steel swiftly struck do not expend all the energy of the blow on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced . The same is true of grazing suns . It can easily be shown by the laws of dynamics that the speed acquired by the falling toward one another in the case of a slightly grazing pair of similar stars must result in the greater portions of the stars passing on , and the actually col ? liding parts forming a third body . It is the formation of the third body , an intensely heated , stupendous cosmic spark , that has been so generally missed . Al ? though Lord Kelvin discussed solar im ? pact in great detail , he , as well as the other numerous students of impact , missed the principle here alluded to . The con ? ception is basic and all-important in cosmic physics . The idea threads itself through the problems of all kinds of col ? lisions , except direct encounters , center to center . It applies equally to the im ? pact of dense bodies such as suns and planets , and to such vast Rebuke as we find clothing the Galactic poles . It plays a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such gigantic cosmic systems as the clouds of Magellan ? systems similar to those which I regard as having mutually interpenetrated and formed the " Galactic Universe , " of which our own solar system is one of the king ? doms . Upon the theory of the Third Body , produced by partial collision of dead suns , an understanding of the wonderful mechanism that orders the movements of the whole Cosmos largely depends . More ? over , the careful study of the groups of phenomena included in this comprehen ? sive theory and its deductive products supplies us with the materials out of which we may evolve the grand concep ? tions of an immortal Cosmos , an endless cyclic scheme of creation , involving birth , maturity , decay , and renovation . The average speeds developed by gravi ? tation during the falling together of stars may be taken to be such that were two railway locomotives to meet while each was going at a similar speed , the blow would possess some hundreds of millions of times the kinetol or the energy of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of a mile a minute . Hence it is quite certain that a grazing blow would not stop the main portions of the stars ; they would pass one another , while the portions that actually met would ar ? rest one another 's motion , would be torn from the passing stars , and would coalesce to form a ' third star . Granting solar col ? lisions , the formation of the third body has never been contested . Dead suns are perhaps much more numerous than bright stars , so that the most frequent case of stellar collision would be between dead suns , but some ? times a bright star would be involved . In either ease the portions cut away would result in a third body being formed . The speed arrested in this graze must develop such high temperatures that the newly formed third body explodes and must appear to us as a temporary star . The two torn suns , while passing each other , will be heated on the struck side , will revolve and become a pair of variable stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which must be added the retarding pull of each upon the other , so that the speed of the escaping torn suns will be greatly lessened , and the pair will often be welded into a double star . The revelations of the spectroscope render it certain that most cosmic bodies are made up , like our earth , of a mixture of elements . The third body consists of parts taken . from Iwo suns ; therefore it also must consist of many elements . When at the same temperature the atoms of various gases have different velocities , the less the atomic weight the greater is the speed of their motion . In a mechan ? ical mixture of all the elements , hydro ? gen will be moving about ten times as fast as the mean velocity . Every tem ? porary star whose spectrum has been photographed at the right period shows hydrogen moving at incredible speeds . In the case of Nova Persei the velocity of hydrogen recorded in this way amount ? ed to over a thousand miles a second . Heavier elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would carry the lighter elements completely out of our Galactic System . The question is , Whither will they go ? They will grad ? ually lose speed during countless ages , while wandering away from our system , and they will probably travel to other cosmic systems . That there are such systems is strongly held by Sir David Gill and other astronomers . The system of which our solar system is part is often called the Galactic TJni ? verse . It has a very singular and quite definite form and structure ; it consists of a vast belt of stars that hag probably roughly the form of a double spiral . At the poles of this belt in both directions the celestial sphere is covered with hun ? dreds of thousands of dust nebulae . A careful physical study , made over thirty years ago , suggested that exactly such a configuration might be deduced on dynam ? ical grounds as having been produced by the interpenetrating of two previously existing cosmic systems . The double drift of stars in the Milky Way , recently discovered by Rapteyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomers , offer most valuable evidence as to the truth of these deductions . If our system is granted to have been made up from two cosmic systems , we are justified in assuming that there may he others . Perhaps an infinite number of such systems may be sparsely spread through the infinitude of space . The light atoms expelled from exploding stars would be reduced to their least speed somewhere midway between such systems , and it is easily seen that if atoms are moving in every direction indiscriminate ? ly through space they will linger longest where they move slowest ; thus the empty parts of space not occupied by massive bodies will tend to become the resorts of light gases ; and because the position where these gaseous atoms move slowest is the position of highest potential , this principle , when it was detected some thirty years ago , was named " the ag ? gregating power of the position of high potential . " Thus there are two aggregating ten ? dencies in nature : gravitation , that tends to concentrate the heavy atoms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which may perhaps be called levitation , as it tends to retard and concentrate the light elements of matter ; doing this in those parts of space which without the operation of this agency are most devoid of matter . Thus old cosmic systems tend to consist of widely separated immense masses of densely aggregated heavy ele ? ments ; and the newly forming systems , cosmic systems of the first order , consist of widely diffused masses of light gas . By many agencies bodies are sent out beyond the gravitational reach of sys ? tems . ( These agencies are discussed in the Romance of the Heavens and The Birth of Worlds and Systems . ) Such bodies will tend to pass through the old groups of compact bodies of decaying systems , but must be retarded upon ar ? riving at the widely diffused masses of gas that constitute the systems in process of birth . As material accumulates in these comparatively vacant parts of space , the energy necessary to carry other atoms so far becomes less , and permanent gases of greater atomic weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere ? helium , neon , argon , etc. ? will be able to attain that goal . From the fact that these bachelor elements have no combining power , and seem to have no place in chemical union with other elements , I have called them " cosmic pioneers , " as undoubtedly they must possess most valuable functions in the building of the foundations of new systems . By these agencies we see that gaseous matter tends to be distributed and escape from old cosmic systems , and to regather in regions of space that pre ? viously have been drained of matter by gravitation . Other material , such as com ? pact bodies and cosmic dust , escaping from systems , must tend to be entrapped by these extensive gas-fields , which will also of themselves get denser by the mutual attraction of their constituents . We thus see that there are agencies tend ? ing to diffuse as well as to concentrate matter . We have now to ascertain if any agency exists by which the radiant energy that flows so incessantly from millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmic life . What becomes of all this energy ? Perhaps it partly falls on finely divided matter in space . There are many lines of evidence to suggest that all space is interpenetrated with cosmic dust . The immense number of dust nebula ; at the poles of the Galactic Circle , comets , meteoric swarms , the Zodiacal Light , and other phenomena , all tell what vast num ? bers of wandering particles of dust exist in space . Emphatically ' we detect dust-clouds in the photographs of nebula ? . So that , perchance , let radiant energy but go far enough and it will fall on some cosmic body or some particles of cosmic dust , and tend to raise their temperature ; and it will do so as long as their tempera ? ture is lower than that of the radiating source . By this means matter in space tends gradually to become warmer , and we have before us what the Germans called " Warm Death , " unless there is some agency that can transmute this dif ? fused heat into another form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution of the problem . The cool par ? ticles of residual gas that strike upon the warm , blackened vane bound away with a higher velocity than that with which they approach it . The same action must be at work in space . Slowly moving atoms of hydrogen and other light gases corning into contact with a particle of warm cosmic dust would leave the par ? ticle with a higher velocity than that with which they approach it , having turned some of its vibrating diffused heat , which is considered to be the lowest form of energy , into potential energy of gravi ? tation , which may be looked upon as the highest form of energy . But the question may be asked , Would such an apparently feeble interchange be sufficient to pick up all the radiant energy that has warmed the dust of space ? It is quite possible that it is sufficient . Hydrogen is an abundant element on the earth , and it looms large in the atmos ? phere of every star ; indeed , few spectro ? grams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without hydrogen being one of them . Consider now the length of time dur ? ing which free atoms would remain at low velocity compared with high speeds , and by inference the relative number of such atoms . The study of the motions of matter free in space , and not entrapped ? by massive bodies or systems into orbits , tells us that each occupies countless ages at very low speeds , as compared with a very short space of time at high maximum velocity ; it must be the same with the hydrogen molecules . Hence as each molecule of hydrogen tends to use up its velocity by doing work against gravita ? tion , such molecule will be apt to take energy from every particle of cosmic dust it meets . In this way the vagrant hydro ? gen atom obtains energy for its journey from particle after particle of cosmic dust . So gradually it wanders , till it reaches those high potential portions of space where gas is accumulating and where the foundations of new cosmic sys ? tems are being laid . This radiometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must involve a ceaseless elevation of energy ; nor does this principle apply to hydrogen alone ; it applies to all free molecules , and sug ? gests a most important function for those bachelor elements , the noble gases helium , neon , argon , cryptcn , etc . It is something like a dozen years since I first called these elements " cosmic pioneers , " and all the study devoted to these non-combining elements since then only confirms me in the faith that their chief function is to act as a kind of scaffolding in the building of cosmic sys ? tems of the first order . These elements , never becoming compounds , only play the port of temporary adjuncts during the growth of cosmic systems . Thus we see how molecular selective escape acts the part of Clerk-Maxwell 's " demons " ; how radiometer action ele ? vates energy ; how the principle of retar ? dation at positions of high potential tends to fill the more empty parts of space with gas . We know that many agencies exist capable of discharging massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be entrapped by the gas aggre ? gating where matter is sparsest . These and other agencies taken together present us with the picture of a cyclic scheme of creation infinite and immortal . The following series of steps represents a sequence in this continuously acting set of agencies ; ( 1 ) Diffusion of heat by radiation , and consequent death of suns. ( 2 ) This radiation , falling on the dust of space , heats it . ( 3 ) The heat of this cosmic dust is taken away by slowly moving molecules of small atomic weight , and the velocity of the molecules is at the same time in ? creased . ( 4 ) These free molecules are thus pro ? jected beyond stellar systems , and other atoms also are sent out of systems by partial impacts , by selective molecular escape , and other agencies . ( 51 Free molecules will move slowest , and therefore remain longest , in the posi thins of maximum potential . Where their motion is least , that is , in the more empty parts of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the interaction of three bodies the velocity acquired by one sometimes takes it out of its cosmic system . ( 7 ) Hydrogen , other light gases , and the noble gases , together , become a trap for wandering bodies , which are stopped and partially volatilized and sometimes converted into dense nebulae. ( 8 ) These dense nebulae attract more surrounding gas ; they cool and shrink , some ultimately forming nebulous suns. ( 9 ) These entrapped bodies by attrac ? tion gradually increase the density of new cosmic systems . ( 10 ) Such gaseous cosmic systems are of the first order ? that is , are in the first stage of evolution . They have no definite structure . ( 11 ) The coalescent impact of two systems of the first order produces a sys ? tem of the second order , with its conse ? quent double spiral structure . 12 ) Coalescent impact in which one only of the colliding systems is a dying one ? that is , is a heavy-element universe ? produces a system of the third order , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) In such systems condensations around nuclei originate and develop suns. ( 14 ) The coalescence of two cosmic systems does not necessarily , as a final result , produce a system of a larger mass than one of two original systems from which it was formed , as partial impacts , selective molecular escape , radiometer ac ? tion , and the action of three bodies are tending to send material out of the coalescing mass. ( 15 ) It is thus seen that dissipation of energy is but a factor in a complex cyclical process ; and there is consequently the possibility of an immortal cosmos , in which we have neither evidence of a be ? ginning nor promise of an end , the pres ? ent being but a phase of an eternal rhythm . ment afterward came in , and the world marched forward with giant strides . Mere speculation was discounted , and rightly so . But now , as the late Simon Newcomb suggested , we are in danger of being buried under the mass of the un ? correlated facts which we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scientific imagination , using the revealed facts of phenomena and the laws of nat ? ure. must play a great part in the imme ? diate future . Mentally we must bridge time and space and think no longer of flying suns as fixed stars . Were we to picture time as passing so swiftly that centuries are as seconds , to the eye of the mind we should see the star clusters appearing as moving masses of many-hued fireflies , the planets as rings of silver light , and we should see the whole stellar heavens astir as a swarm of shining bees . Again , were we able to transcend the limits of the finite , survey the whole celestial vault , and read the greater book of Nature , whose messages come to us in the language of light , then we should peruse the rainbow-tinted sen ? tences that tell of atoms , suns , and sys ? tems , the whole story being the epic of creation , whose uncut leaves are able to tell us of an infinite cosmos eternal and perfect . Thus instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the sublime whole to be a scheme of creation , flawless , boundless , and im ? mortal . In this great realm a being trav ? eling through infinity on the wings of light would see birth , maturity , death , and rejuvenescence of dead suns and cosmic systems , but in the mighty whole would see as little permanent change as does the sea-bird in the restless ocean . Such is the cycle of the eternal heavens which the scientific use of the imagina ? tion can now reveal to the starved soul of humanity . Is not such mental food the true nectar of the gods ? Does it not suggest an optimistic philosophy , securely based on scientific fact i On such a foundation we can only conceive of evil as indication of wrong action . When nature is fully understood we shall real ? ize , with the firmest faith , that the cosmic whole is a perfect system , without evidence of a beginning or promise of an end , the object of existence being a maximum of joy to all organic life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
