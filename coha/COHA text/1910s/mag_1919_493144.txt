THE NEW confirm the theory of human depravity . Anthropology and psychology are beginning to converge upon a theory of man and of society which portrays them as , indeed , the arena of interminable domestic conflicts which lends some plausibility to the doctrine of depravity , but they also open the door to the liberation of men and women from their bondage by the discovery of a valid moral compensation for their immediate losses . Psychology may soon be qualified to supply to those who are interested in the art of living a much sounder science of human life than our forbears have ever had . But not unless psychologists recognize the extent to which the knowledge of human nature depends upon faith in human nature . The effective testimony in favor of human regeneracy must come from the affirmation by a renascent Christianity of the saving virtue of the imitation of Christ . The love and reverence for human life born of the imitation of Christ constitute the substance of a truth which in so far as it is acknowledged really has some chance of setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of What the human mind is learning about particular aspects of man and his natural environment in Order to contrive immediately operative methods of liberation . They could build a civilization whose security would depend upon the moral authority of a Church rather than the irresistible power of a state . And that Church would consist of men and women who were capable of understanding what it means to love your neighbor as yourself and of thing in the light of that understanding throughout their days in this world . HERBERT CROLY . A Christmas Carol HE horses were steaming . Over their heads the driver 's whip cracked with the same brit- die sound the wheels had on the snow . Occasion- ally the driver swore . But softly , and the five of his Were boxed inside his coach could not catch , 18 choice of words .

A erY small toy cannon for his son had rolled b , eneath the seat and down through , a wide crevice ill the floor . He could not reach it , though he kept trying to , at intervals . When he was n't under the seat he sat staring sullenly at the floor , a misan-thr ? Pe on Christmas Eve . The other three were not so taciturn . The travelling salesman did most , I think , to keep the conversation running . But the dry-goods jobber and the little man with gold-rimmed glasses kept him company . Their talk had followed a beaten track , as men 's talk will , this Christmas Eve . Amazing , one of them had said , that all nine of those judges had stood together . Not one dissenting vote . That was n't generally the case , observed the man with the gold-rimmed glases . Usually it was 6 to 3 , or evens to 4 . He was no gossip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should nine Justices , who had never before in their lives agreed on anything , now suddenly cast their votes together ? The dry-goods jobber nodded knowingly ; and the travelling salesman declared that his brother , who used to live in Washington , knew it for a positive fact that there was n't a single Justice of the Court who had n't a cellar full of contraband . There was one Justice ? Garfield , was n't it ? ? who had brought so many cases of Jamaica rum into Washington that three drays had to be borrowed from the Smithsonian Institute to move it . And him having the nerve to write the Court 's decision ! And those lame ducks in Congress I They could act quick enough to vote down a repeal of the wartime prohibition act . But what good were they when the Germans sank the Lusi-tania ? There were times , however , when the conversation took a brighter turn . And it was on these occasions that the travelling salesman reached his greatest heights . He had a brother ? his brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own patrol ? who was sending back reports of ribald triumphs in Havana . He had another brother , this one in West Virginia , who could take a bicycle and a sprinkling can and go patronize any one of the seventy-seven different mountain stills he had a mind to . He had stories , too , of his own prodigious travels . Of Rhode Islanders drinking cocktails exquisitely compounded of purchasable toilet waters . Of coughdrops , bought in Chattanooga , that might be melted into a rare elixir by the addition of warm gravy . Of the pied piper who came into Kenosha with a magic hair-oil . It was an Arabian Night 's Tale . But though it set the man with glasses marvelling , it never caught and held the attention of the dry-goods jobber . The jobber listened absently . And now and then he 'd rub a forefinger on the frosted window-pane and squint with one eye at a corner building no longer gay with lights . " Ike 's , " he 'd say softly . " Rudy 's . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half way on the long journey from one of New York 's uptown ferries to a downtown station that the travelling salesman touched off his dynamite . Probably he had been intending to touch it off , all along , but had waited for the sufficiently dramatic moment . That moment came when a traffic jam made it evident we should miss our connection by a good four minutes . The next connection was three and a quarter hours later . We were downcast . " Gentlemen , " . said the travelling salesman , waving a hand to all four of us , " Gentlemen , what do you say to stopping off somewhere and drinking a little toast to Christmas ? " At that moment the thin man with the packages was on his knees . He had found a hair-pin , and with it he was making another futile effort to retrieve his cannon . With a snarl he turned upon the travelling salesman . " Toast ! " he jeered . " Go write a poem about it ! " And back he went with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the small man with the glasses were more cordial . But not a whit less sceptical . Since the last series of federal raids , they declared , there was nothing to be had in the city , by bribe , by theft or murder . Of course there were rumors . But they were rumors ? and nothing more . But the travelling salesman knew better . The city , he said , was wide open . All that was necessary was to know the ropes . Of course you need n't expect any success if you went around with a megaphone and a clothes-hamper . But it was easy enough if you knew how . Easy as rolling off a log . For instance , there was a place in Seventh avenue ? much pounding on the window-pane ? where he knew the bartender ? more pounding ? knew him like a brother ? much hallooing at our half-frozen driver ? and since we 'd missed our train ? instructions shouted how to reach the place on Seventh avenue ? we 'd go there directly and he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to do it . I do n't think there was anything unusual about the bar to which the travelling salesman guided us . Nor was there anything unusual about its tender . He leant on the counter ? a spare man with a curl in the center of his forehead ? serving his patrons with tall glasses of what might have been anything . " That 's him ! " said the travelling salesman as we entered the smoky room . " That 's old Ed himself 1 " We elbowed our way through a hostile crowd , with our uninvited driver following hopefully behind us . The travelling salesman stepped briskly to the bar . " Well , well ! " he cried , " if it is n't my old friend Ed 1 " Ed fixed him with a glassy eye . " My name , " he said , " is George . " It might have staggered the ordinary man . It never staggered the travelling salesman . " Why , sure it 's George ! " he agreed , after the briefest of pauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if 1 did n't know it was George 1 Why , many 's the time we used to appear before the judge together , eh George ?

Ask me if we did n't 1 Ask me 1 Now , George "  - -  -  ( this with a suddenly confidential tone , straight at the small of George 's back as he stopped to rinse two glasses in a bucket of water ) ? " I 've got ' a few friends with me , old friends , friends of mine for years , come from my home town , friends since 1 was a lad in knee breeches . And we 've got stuck in a snowdrift . And we 've missed our connection . And one of my friends here has chilblains . And it 's Christmas Eve . And I want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time 's sake , what we can have . " George looked up from his water-bucket long enough to say : " You can have a ginger ale . " When we were outside again , and had climbed back into our coach , the thin man with the packages was grumbling . It was n't that he had expected all luck . Oh no . He knew it would be a flivver . But the trouble was , either in getting out of the roach or getting back into it again he must have upset his parcels . For one of them was missing . It wias a pearl-mounted comb for his sister Grace . 1-c could see it , but he could not touch it . It was down through the chink in the floor , with the lead canon ' The travelling salesman , however , was thel:e to i reassure us . " Never mind , " he said . " We 'll wnt out yet .

But it was n't quite accurate to say his sister married the law partner of the man Who enforces the dry law . She married the cousin of the Superintendent of City Streets . But this man had , at any rate , been a politician high in the councils of Tammany . Unfortunately , however , it was in the days when Richard Croker was a young man . And on the present occasion he was in bed With tonsilitis . But the travelling salesman did n't let that news discourage us . We tried a second politician close to the seat of power . We tried other politicians . Before our search ended we had also tried two hotels , an Assyrian restaurant , a converted stable , a deputy coroner 's office , and a roadhouse in whose c ? tIrtyard the travelling salesman assured us he had Played as a boy of seven .

REPUBLIC I 4 I News from the Sick Room B EWILDERED observers of current natural phenomena in a disordered and confused world had begun to think that the peak of topsyturviness had been reached when the so long despised Mexican dollar came to be worth in the open market $1.05 in United States gold currency , and at the same time the British gold sovereign , so long the world 's standard of coin values , declined to $3.70 . Before the puzzled analysts had been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new high level of bewildderment by the public appearance of the Honorable Albert Bacon Fall , a Senator from New Mexico , on the steps of the White House , certifying to President Wilson 's mental competency . Nothing queerer ever happened in Washington . And the queerest part of it all is that it was taken quite as a matter of course . Nothing has so vividly shown the state of mind into which Washington has fallen . Mr. Fall 's disclosure was treated as a matter of large public import . After his pronouncement for the benefit of the press , at the White House , he was swiftly translated to the Republican cloak room in the Senate wing of the Capitol and there subjected to a critical cross examination by the lawyers and doctors of the.Senate . They took turns at him . It was an amazing performance . " How long were you in his bedroom ? Was anybody else there ? Did she say anything ? In what position did you find the President ; lying down or sitting up or propped up ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Which hand did he use ? Did you see his other hand , or did he try to use it ? Did you see him move his body or his legs ? How did he look ? How long did he talk and how long did you talk ? Was his voice clear and his utterance unimpeded ? How do you mean , husky ; do you mean his voice was hoarse , or that it was thick ? " ( much detail on this point ) and so on and so on and so on , until all the bones had been picked clean . In point of fact , not the least illuminating aspect of Mr. Fall 's revelations was his disclosure of how vaguely he had seen what he had seen . It took him some time to remember whether the President had offered his left hand or his right hand to be shaken . There were minor discrepancies between Mr. Hitchcock 's report and Mr. Fall 's report . The whole amazing , incredible episode has a value and an interest as disclosing the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision are taken for our guidance and direction .
