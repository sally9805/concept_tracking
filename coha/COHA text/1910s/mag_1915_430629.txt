 | The effect of the European conflict on the Peace movement in the United States has been paradoxical . On the one hand the cause of true pacifism has been enormously strengthened . On the other hand the professional Peace advocate has been discredited . The historical event itself has brought about this result . As neutrals and spectators Americans can see the full horror of warfare , and to some degree its futility . It is fair to say that the mental reaction of the vast majority of thoughtful men and women in this country to the European conflagration has been a revulsion against the doctrines and practices of militarism . Although we are a bit puzzled concerning the causes which brought the war to pass , we are agreed in denouncing it as a calamity to the world . We are appalled by the suffering , the heartbreak , the gigantic waste , ? by the sight of ten million men trampling everything precious in their civilization under foot in the frantic effort to slaughter one another . And we can see , as only neutrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations engaged in deadly combat , each sacrificing itself in the name of civilization or culture , each invoking the aid of God and humanity to its righteous cause . Such a flow of pacifist sentiment ought , it would seem , to strengthen the Peace movement in the United States . But the Peace movement suffers a handicap in its leadership . Its spokesmen have been , and to some extent still are , men and women who exhibit a surplus of good intentions and a deficiency of practical sense . These enthusiastic advocates have earned for themselves the name of fanatics because they have proved themselves incapable of looking the facts of the international situation in the face . Up to the first of last July they went about assuring whoever would listen that a great European war was " impossible . " In the April issue of the Unpopular Review , " for example , one of the most prominent of the  | pacifists in the United States declared , in speaking of the armies of the Old World , " The watchdogs bark , but the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidently foretell the reign of Peace , but they drew the immediate corollary that we should cease to arm against a foe who would never appear , and stop all preparation for a struggle which international finance and good-feeling had rendered chimerical . We were living , they said , in a New Age . Armaments were an anachronism . These pacifists were , it is needless to remark , gazing into a mirage . They had missed the essential truth that the world of today is a militaristic world . Their error was precisely on a par intellectually with the error of the Var advocates , who tell us that strife between nations is part of the order of the universe , and is rooted in some irremediable pugnacity or fighting instinct of human nature . But were the spirits of the pacifists dashed when they found their pleasant prophecies falsified , and the continent of Europe devastated by the greatest conflict in its history ? Not in the least . Pacifists of this fanatical stripe are among the most optimistic of creatures . They still repeat their promises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disarmament as the door to the better time . It is just this incapacity to learn a patent lesson from contemporary history that makes the future of the Peace movement , in this country at least , a matter of doubtful issue . Already , since the war started , this inability to envisage things as they are has led the Peace jingoes into one of two errors of tactics . Many of them have given up all pretense of neutrality and taken a position of violent partisanship for the Allies . Dr. Eliot of Harvard for instance sees the guilt of militarism as personal , resting on the Kaiser and the military caste of Prussia , or at best as national , resting on the whole German people . Such pacifists as Dr. Eliot talk about this being a war against war , ? which is merely a generalized phrase for the assertion that it is a war on Prussian militarism . Of course it is nothing of the sort . If it is anything beyond a war of mutual fears it is a crash between rival imperialisms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | win , the " blood and iron " doctrines of her military caste will have received a spectacular and terrible vindication . If the Allies are able to beat Germany to her knees , Europe and indeed the world will be overshadowed by the autocratic militarism of Russia and the unchallengeable navyism of England . In the event of Germany 's defeat , furthermore , the military position of Japan in the Pacific will be strengthened . And what will be the result if a deadlock is reached and the opponents fight to a standstill of mutual exhaustation ? Nothing will have been settled , the old jealousies will be supplemented by new hatreds , and the rivals will arm themselves afresh . Of course all historical prediction is hazardous . But it is fatuous for the pacifists to trust in the logic of events , as some of them are doing . So far as we can see it is useless to expect that when terms of peace are signed in London or Berlin , Europe will cease to be an armed camp , or that the nations will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same blind optimism has within a month or two led the Peace jingoes into an agitation against a policy of preparedness on the part of the United States . They have scented , they declare , a plot among the militarists to rush America into the race for predominant armaments ; ? and to these pacifists armaments mean the same thing as militarism . Consequently they are fighting any increase in our army or our navy . Now there are two separate questions in this problem of armaments . First , are we prepared for a war with any first class military power . Second , have we any need or desire to be prepared ? The first question is not worth arguing . Every impartial and intelligent man in the United States agrees that the country , with its inadequate navy and its negligible army , is in no condition to fight a big war . Imagine that we keep our defenses in the same state as at present for the next five or ten years and that at the end of that time we engage a great military power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winpossibly ? but only through good luck , or because after great preliminary sacrifices in life and materials we wore down our opponent by the weight of our resources . The answer to the first question is , No . Only the pacifists are presumptuous enough to give a dog- matic answer of any kind to the second question . Who shall foretell what international complications shall arise within the next decade ? At present , it is true , we are unthreatened , and at peace with a strife-torn world . We are free from aggressive designs ourselves and we have no direct evidence that any power contemplates an attack on us . But is it safe to argue that because no cloud can be seen on the horizon there will never be another storm ? When that little cloud appeared last July on the Austro-Servian frontier it did not at first awaken much alarm . It looked indeed less threatening than the Morocco cloud of 1905 , or the Bosnia cloud of 1908 , or the Agadir cloud of 1911 , all of which were safely weathered . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that the little clouds on our own diplomatic horizon will never blow into a tempest ; but on the other hand a cyclone may break sooner than we expect . If we seek to generalize from the recent history of the world we can arrive at only one conclusion : in the life of every nation wars occur frequently and arise suddenly , and no nation can hope to avoid all possibility of war unless it definitely commits itself to a policy of non-resistance . Surely the people of the United States are not ready for a policy of non-resistance . Even the Peace jingoes realize that . So they attempt to accomplish their object ? which for the extreme wing is peace at any price ? by indirection . They would keep us out of wars by making us impotent . They believe that the possession of armaments breeds the desire to use them , and that to prepare for war is to bring a war on . Says President Butler of Columbia , " The European nations that had on so elaborate a scale prepared for war have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard a big navy or army in the hands of a nation like a sharp knife in the hands of a mischievous child : both the nation and the child will have an itch to put the instrument to the test . They have apparently a profound distrust of the temper of the people , and an even profounder suspicion of the wisdom of cabinets and diplomats . It may be that the pacifists are partially right in this uneasiness . Possibly there is weight to the contention that if the United States had had last August a standing army of one or two million men she would by this time have been drawn into  | the war on one pretense or another by the Anglo-maniacs . And possibly there is truth in the general statement that so long as diplomacy is secret and wars are made or avoided by a handful of men in cabinets and Foreign Offices whose discussions and actions are screened from the gaze of the rest of the people , just so long will armaments be liable to reckless use . But how does all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has anyone demanded that we institute conscription or that we create a standing army of a million men ? The most that is asked for from any responsible quarter is an army of a few hundred thousand and a navy second but not so absurdly disproportionate to the navy of Great Britain . Nevertheless the pacifists of the extreme school grow very excited about these modest proposals . They are setting out the danger signals against " militarism . " Now this , as I said , is an error in tactics . The American people are at present in no danger of becoming Chauvinistic . Militarism is a state of mind not a number of guns . The great majority of intelligent American are unexcited about the issue of militarism . They are unimpressed by the bogies of the alarmists . Will they be impressed by the soothing assurances of the Peace jingoes ? The latter would persuade us that the country , inert and unarmed , is secure from any trial of strength ; ? and in this they are playing with fire . Should their tranquilizing views prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States as in the case of Europe , the responsibility of allowing the Republic to enter a war unprepared would rest on their shoulders . The voice of the peace advocate could not be safely raised in the United States for a century thereafter . The real trouble with the Peace advocates is this : like all reformers convinced of the righteousness of their cause they seek to reach their goal in a hurry . Their hope is so strong that they constantly underestimate the difficulty and length of the campaign before them . They hate and detest war ; they see the full criminality of allowing a handful of men in Foreign Offices to throw millions of peace-preferring workers ? artisans , factory employees , farmers , ? into a welter of blood-lust and carnage . A little increase in humanitarian sentiment , they  | page deleted  | though various degrees of conspicuousness , in Germany , Russia , England , France and Japan . The second outstanding fact is the ability which these imperialistic classes hold , in time of crisis , of imposing their opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . Their power comes partly from the fact that foreign relations are handled and alliances negotiated in secret , and partly from the fact that the general public shares in greater or less degree the ideals , the fears , and the illusions of the militarists . Nevertheless the public is , in most modern countries , powerless to control the issues of war and peace , once a crisis arises . The process by which the imperialists gain the upper hand the moment the Foreign Offices begin to quarrel was illuminatingly shown in England last summer . I was in London at the time and saw in a brief period three distinct shifts of opinion on the part of the British public . During the latter days of July there was a feeling of astonishment and stupefaction at the gravity and suddenness of the rupture on the continent . All the newspapers viewed a general European war with abhorrence . The whole nation prayed that the conflict might be localized to Austria and Servia . Then , as the rift widened , and a war between Germany and Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ) problematical attitude of Great Britain . In the first four days of August there was a sharp clash of opinion . The imperialistic party , powerful in the government and capitalistically in control , was patently seeking to rush the nation into the fray . Against them were arrayed the more inarticulate forces for conciliation . A great labor demonstration , which I attended , was held in Trafalagar Square on the afternoon of Sunday , August 1 , when the orators who argued against England 's possible participation were loudly cheered . Strong protests appeared in the press , condemning Sir Edward Grey 's policy , which ( the protesters maintained ) was one of baiting Germany on . A Neutrality League , headed by prominent writers and politicians , was hastily organized , and distributed thousands of circulars and pamphlets , demanding that Britain stand clear and giving reasons why it was foolish  | to sacrifice England 's sons " to aid Russia in a war of aggression . " Various women 's organizations held meetings urging a position of strict neutrality . Now these efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been ill-advised . But the essential point is that they failed , absolutely and pitifully , to turn the course of events by a hair 's breadth . The arguments of the Neutrality League were never answered , but the League itself died an ignominious death , after the declaration of war , amid showers of abuse . Labor was swung into line by appeals to patriotism . And the women were ignored . Both the psychology of the crowd and the shortness of time played against the pacifist elements in England . It is an absurd overstatement of the facts to say that the huge armaments of modern times force nations into war by their own weight ; but it is incontestable that armaments quicken the descent into hostilities once the brakes of international goodwill begin to slip . Simultaneous mobilization is now a matter of military necessity . If Russia starts to call out its reserves and muster its horses , Germany feels that it must follow suit within a week . If Germany orders mobilization France does not dare withhold its retaliatory order a single day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced . The third and final stage of public opinion was , of course , the " united front against the enemy . " When war was declared against Germany there was no irrepressible enthusiasm , no burning passion , manifest in England . I was told that feeling ran much higher at the beginning of the Boer war . The British public acquiesced in the war ; they did not demand it . But within a few weeks all that was changed . The country lashed itself into a fury . The cultivated classes devoted themselves to writing poems and letters breathing defiance to the foe and expanding on his viciousness , while the man in the street , fed daily on newspaper reports of the enemy 's atrocities and perfidies , talked with scorn and hate of " those bloody Germans . " There was an identical development of feeling in Germany and in France . The military castes had won " the day . " The war  | raged between great populations each firmly consolidated into a fighting whole by the hot cement of enmity and dread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years appear futile and in part foolish , it is simply because its sponsors have been hugging delusions . The world conflict presents them the opportunity to revise their program and slough off their sentimentalities . It is no part of the pacifist 's business to fix the " blame " on this nation or on that . He is at grapples with a system , ? the war system , which should command his respect if only for its power . He might well give up wasting time and energy in formulating paper schemes of world federation , and in seeking to tie the hands of Mars with parchment treaties and arbitration agreements . These schemes can never succeed until they are the expression and the outgrowth of an inner spirit . The cabinets of Europe can not be tricked into signing away their right to make war until they are ready . War , it has been said , is the failure of human reason . But the truth is that human reason has never been much exercised on the problems of international harmony . Alliances to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthen national advantages . Arbitration dodges the issue . It erects the status quo into the arbiter of all disputes , and gives no opportunity for either the correction of past injustices , or the flexible adjustment of future disputes over territory , population and economic rights . Arbitration puts the scales of international justice in the dead hand of the past . The rationalistic attack on the war system will involve more hard thinking than the professional pacifists have yet brought to the task . Most of the problems to be solved have been touched only at the edges . In the economic world we do not yet know at what points the interests of separate nations converge and at what points they conflict , and certainly we have no machinery to settle by peaceful means the differences at issue any more than we have a machinery to change national boundaries without war .
