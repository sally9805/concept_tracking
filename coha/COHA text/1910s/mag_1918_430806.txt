 | ON the mutual understanding of each other by Britons and Americans , the future happiness of nations depends more than on any other world cause . I have never held a whole-hearted brief for the British character . There is a lot of good in it , but much which is repellent . It has a kind of deliberate unattractiveness , setting out on its journey with the words : " Take me or leave me . " One may respect a person of this sort , but it 's difficult either to know or to like him . I am told that an American officer said recently to a British staff officer in a friendly voice : " So we 're going to clean up Brother Boche together ! " and the British staff officer replied : " Really ! " No wonder Americans sometimes say : " I 've got no use for those fellows . " The world is consecrate to strangeness and discovery , and the attitude of mind concreted in that " Really ! " seems unforgivable , till one remembers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American and Briton . In a huge , still half-developed country , where every kind of national type and habit comes to run a new thread into the rich tapestry of American life and thought , people must find it almost impossible to conceive the life of a little old island where traditions persist generation after generation without anything to break them up ; where blood remains undoctored by new strains ; demeanor becomes crystallized for lack of contrasts ; and manner gets set like a plaster mask . The English manner of to-day , of what are called the classes , is the growth of only a century or so . There was probably nothing at all like it in the days of Elizabeth or even of Charles the Second . The English manner was still  | racy when the inhabitants of Virginia , as we are told , sent over to ask that there might be despatched to them some hierarchical assistance for the good of their souls , and were answered : " D ? n your souls , grow tobacco ! " The English manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that epitaph of a lady was written : " Bland , passionate , and deeply religious , she was second cousin to the Earl of Leitrim ; of such are the Kingdom of Heaven . " About that gravestone motto was a certain lack of the self-consciousness which is now the foremost characteristic of the English manner . But this British self-consciousness is no mere fluffy gaucherie , it is our special form of what Germans would call Kultur . Behind every manifestation of thought or emotion , the Briton retains control of self , and is thinking : " That 's all I 'll let them see " ; even : " That 's all I 'll let myself feel . " This stoicism is good in its refusal to be foundered ; bad in that it fosters a narrow outlook ; starves emotion , spontaneity , and frank sympathy ; destroys grace and what one may describe roughly as the lovable side of personality . The English hardly ever say just what comes into their heads . What we call " good form , " the unwritten law which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull and glacial ; but there lurks within it a core of virtue . It has grown up like callous shell round two fine ideals ? suppression of the ego lest it trample on the corns of other people ; and exaltation of the maxim : " Deeds before words . " Good form , like any other religion , starts well with some ethical truth , but soon gets commonized and petrified till we can hardly trace its origin , and watch with surprise its denial and contradiction of the root idea . Without doubt good form has become a kind of disease in England . A French friend told me how he witnessed in a Swiss hotel the meeting between an English woman and her son , whom she had not seen for two years ; she was greatly affected ? by the fact that he had not brought a  | dinner-jacket . The best manners are no " manners , " or at all events no mannerisms ; but many Britons who have even attained to this perfect purity are yet not free from the paralytic effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths of their souls , and never do or say a thing without trying not to show what they are feeling . All this guarantees a certain decency in life ; but in intimate intercourse with people of other nations who have not this particular cult of suppression , we English disappoint , and jar , and often irritate . Nations have their differing forms of snobbery . At one time the English all wanted to be second cousins to the Earl of Leitrim , like that lady bland and passionate . Nowadays it is not so simple . The Earl of Leitrim has become etherialized . We no longer care how a fellow is born , so long as he behaves as the Earl of Leitrim would have behaved , never makes himself conspicuous or ridiculous , never shows too much what he 's really feeling , never talks of what he 's going to do , and always " plays the game . " The cult is centred in our public schools and universities . At a very typical and honored old public school , the writer . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what : a curious life educationally speaking ! We lived rather like , young Spartans ; and were not encouraged to think , imagine , or see anything that we learned in relation to life at large . it 's very difficult to teach boys , because their chief object in life is not to be taught anything , but I should say we were crammed , not taught at all . Living as we did the herd life of boys with little or no intrusion from our elders ? and they men who had been brought up in the same way as ourselves ? we were debarred from any real interest in philosophy , history , art , literature , and music , or any advancing notions in social life or politics . We were reactionaries almost to a boy . I remember one summer term Gladstone came down to speak to us , and we repaired to the Speech Room with white collars and dark hearts , muttering  | what we would do to that Grand Old Man if we could have our way . But he contrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him vociferously . In that queer life we had all sorts of unwritten rules of suppression . You must turn up your trousers ; must not go out with your umbrella rolledYour hat must be worn tilted forward ; you must not walk more than two abreast till you reached a certain form ; nor be enthusiastic about anything , except such a supreme matter as a drive over the pavilion at cricket , or a run the whole length of the ground at football . You must not talk about yourself or your home people ; and for any punishment you must assume complete indifference . I dwell on these trivialities , because every year thousands of British boys enter these mills which grind exceeding small ; and because these boys constitute in after life the great majority of the official , military , academic , professional , and a considerable proportion of the business classes of Great Britain . They become the Englishmen who say " Really ! " ; and they are , for the most part , the Englishmen who travel and reach America . The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools is that they form character . As oatmeal is supposed to form bone in the bodies of Scotsmen , so our public schools are supposed to form good sound moral fibre in British boys . And there is much in this plea . The life does make boys enduring , self-reliant , goodtempered , and honorable , but it most carefully endeavors to destroy all original sin of individuality , spontaneity , and engaging freakishness . To know all is to excuse all ? to know all about the bringing-up of English public-school boys makes one excuse much . The atmosphere and tradition of those places is extraordinarily strong , and persists through all modern changes . Thirty-seven years have gone since I was a new boy , but cross-examining a young nephew who left not long ago . I found almost precisely the same features and conditions . The war , which has changed so much of our social  | life , will have some , but no very great , effect on this particular institution . The boys still go there from the same kind of homes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the traditional unemotionalism , the cult of a dry and narrow stoicism is rather fortified than diminished by the times we live in . Our universities , on the other hand , are now mere ghosts of their old selves . At my old college in Oxford last term they had only two English students . In the chapel under the Joshua Reynolds window , through which the sun was shining , hung a long " roll of honor , " a hundred names and more . In the college garden an open-air hospital was ranged under the old city wall , where we used to climb and go wandering in the early summer mornings after some all-night spree . Down on the river the empty college barges lay void of life . From the top of one of them an aged custodian broke into words : " Ah ! Oxford ' 11 never be the same again in my time . Why , who ' s to teach ' em rowin ' ? When we do get undergrads again , who ' s to teach ' em ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . No ! Rowin ' 11 never be the same again ? not in my time . " That was the tragedy of the war for him . Our universities will recover faster than he thinks , and resume the care of our particular Ii ult ur , and cap the products of our public school with the Oxford accent and the Oxford manner . An acute critic tells me that Americans reading such deprecatory words as these by an Englishman about his country 's institutions would say that this is precisely an instance of what an American means by the Oxford manner . Americans , whose attitude towards their own country is that of a lover to his lady or a child to its mother , can not ? he says ? understand how Englishmen can be critical of their own country , and yet love her . Well , the Englishman 's attitude to his country is that of a man to himself ; and the way he runs her down is but a part of that special English bone-deep self-consciousness of which I have been  | speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country as much as the French love France , and the Americans America ; but she is so much a part of them that to speak well of her is like speaking well of themselves , which they have been brought up to regard as " bad form . " When Americans hear Englishmen speaking critically of their own country , let them note it for a sign of complete identification with that country rather than of detachment . But to return to English universities . They have , on the whole , a broadening influence on the material which comes to them so set and narrow . They do a little to discover for their children that there are many points of view , and much which needs an open mind in this world . They have not precisely a democratic influence , but taken by themselves they would not be inimical to democracy . And when the war is over they will surely be still broader in philosophy and teaching . I am no revolutionary who wishes to see vanish all that is old , and has , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age upon it ; there is a beauty in age and a health in tradition , ill dispensed with . What is hateful in age is its lack of understanding and of sympathy ; in a word ? its intolerance . Let us hope this wind of change may sweep out and sweeten the old places of my country , sweep away the cobwebs and the dust , our narrow ways of thought , our mannikinisms . Those who hate intolerance dare not be intolerant with the foibles of age ; we should rather see them as comic , and gently laugh them out . I pretend to no proper knowledge of the American people ; but , though amongst them there are doubtless pockets of fierce prejudice , I have on the whole the impression of a wide and tolerant spirit . To that spirit I would appeal when it comes to passing judgment on the educated Briton . He may be self-sufficient , but he has grit ; and at bottom grit is what Americans appreciate more than anything . If the motto of my old Oxford College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should often be sorry  | for the Briton . But his manners do n't make him ; they mar him . His goods are all absent from the shop-window ; he is not a man of the world in the wider meaning of that expression . And there is , of course , a particularly noxious type of travelling Briton , who does his best , unconsciously , to deflower his country wherever he goes . Selfish , coarsefibred , loud-voiced ? the sort which thanks God he is a Briton ? I suppose because nobody else will do it for him . We live in times when patriotism is exalted above all other virtues , because there happen to lie before the patriotic tremendous chances for the display of courage and self-sacrifice . Patriotism ever has that advantage , as the world is now constituted ; but patriotism and provincialism are sisters under the skin , and they who can only see bloom on the plumage of their own kind , who prefer the bad points of their countrymen to the good points of foreigners , merely write themselves down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America is advantaged in this matter . She lives so far away from other nations that she might well be excused for thinking herself the only people in the world ; but in the many strains of blood which go to make up America , there is as yet a natural corrective to the narrower kind of patriotism . America has vast spaces and many varieties of type and climate , and life to her is still a great adventure . Americans have their own form of self-absorption , but seem free as yet from the special competitive self-centrement which has been forced on Britons through long centuries by countless continental rivalries and wars . Insularity was driven into the very bones of our people by the generation-long wars of Napoleon . A Frenchman , Andre Chevrillon , whose book , " England and the War , " I commend to anyone who wishes to understand British peculiarities , used these words in a recent letter : " You English are so strange to us French , you are so utterly different from any other people in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our hearts , I think ,  | we feel that only the American people could ever really understand us . And being extraordinarily self-conscious , perverse , and proud , we do our best to hide from Americans that we have any such feeling . It would distress the average Briton to confess that he wanted to be understood , had anything so natural as a craving for fellowship or for being liked . We are a weird people , though we appear so commonplace . In looking at photographs of British types among photographs of other European nationalities , one is struck by something which is in no other of those races ? exactly as if we had an extra skin ; as if the British animal had been tamed longer than the rest . And so he has . His political , social , legal life was fixed long before that of any other Western country . He was old , I wo n't say mouldering , before the Mayflower touched American shores and brought there avatars , grave and civilized as ever founded nation . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth at which it keeps its real yearnings , about the perversity with which it disguises them , and its inability to show its feelings . We are , deep down , under all our lazy mentality , the most combative and competitive race in the world , with the exception perhaps of the American . This is at once a spiritual link with America , and yet one of the great barriers to friendship between the two peoples . We are not sure whether we are better men than Americans . Whether we are really better than French , Germans , Russians , Italians , Chinese , or any other race , is of course more than a question ; but those peoples are all so different from us that we are bound , I suppose , secretly to consider ourselves superior . But between Americans and ourselves under all differences there is some mysterious deep kinship which causes us to doubt , and makes us irritable , as if we were continually being tickled by that question : Now am i really a better man than he ? Exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is British , I know not ; but enough to make us definitely cousins ? always an awk-  | ward relationship . We see in Americans a sort of image of ourselves ; feel near enough , yet far enough , to criticise and carp at the points of difference . It is as though a man went out and encountered , in the street , what he thought for the moment was himself ; and , wounded in his amourpropre , instantly began to disparage the appearance of that fellow . Probably community of language rather than of blood accounts for our sense of kinship ; for a common means of expression can not but mould thought and feeling into some kind of unity . One can hardly overrate the intimacy which a common literature brings . The lives of great Americans , Washington and Franklin , Lincoln and Lee and Grant , are unsealed for us , just as to Americans are the lives of Marlborough and Nelson , Pitt and Gladstone and Gordon . Longfellow and Whittier and Whitman can be read by the British child as simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James are no more difficult to us than Darwin and Spencer to Americans . Without an effort we rejoice in Hawthorne and Mark Twain , Henry James and Howells , as Americans can in Dickens and Thackeray , Meredith and Thomas Hardy . And , more than all , Americans own with ourselves all literature in the English tongue before the Mayflower sailed ; Chaucer and Spenser and Shakespeare , Raleigh , Ben Jonson , and the authors of the English Bible Version are their spiritual ancestors as much as ever they are ours . The tie of language is all-powerful ? for language is the food formative of minds . A volume could be written on the formation of character by literary humor alone . The American and Briton , especially the British townsman , have a kind of bone-deep defiance of Fate , a readiness for anything which may turn up , a dry , wry smile under the blackest sky , and an individual way of looking at things , which nothing can shake . Americans and Britons both , we must and will think for ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We have that ingrained respect  | for the individual conscience , which is at the bottom of all free institutions . Some years before the war , an intelligent and cultivated Austrian who had lived long in England , was asked for his opinion of the British . " In many ways , " he said , " I think you are inferior to us ; but one great thing I have noticed about you which we have not . You think and act and speak for yourselves . " If he had passed those years in America instead of in England he must needs have pronounced the same judgment of Americans . Free speech , like every form of freedom , goes in danger of its life in war time . The other day in Russia an Englishman came on a street-meeting shortly after the first revolution had begun . An extremist was addressing the gathering and telling them that they were fools to go on fighting , that they ought to refuse and go home , and so forth . The crowd grew angry , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairman , a big burly peasant , stopped them with these words : " Brothers , you know that our country is now a country of free speech . We must listen to this man , we must let him say anything he will . But , brothers , when he 's finished , we 'll bash his head in ! " I can not assert that either Britons or Americans are incapable in times like these of a similar interpretation of " free speech . " Things have been done in my country , and will be done in America , which should make us blush . But so strong is the free instinct in both countries , that some vestiges of it will survive even this war , for democracy is a sham unless it means the preservation and development of this instinct of thinking for oneself throughout a people . " Government of the people by the people for the people " means nothing unless individuals keep their consciences unfettered , and think freely . Accustom people to be noseled and spoon-fed , and democracy is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the freedom and sense of individual responsibility in its humblest citizens . And democracy , I say it with solemnity , has yet to prove itself .  | A well-known English scientist , Dr. Spurrell , in a recent book , " Man and his Forerunners , " thus diagnoses the growth of civilizations : A civilization begins with the enslavement by some hardy race of a tame race living a tame life in more congenial natural surroundings . It is built up on slavery , and attains its maximum vitality in conditions little removed therefrom . Then , as individual freedom gradually grows , disorganization sets in and the civilization slowly dissolves away in anarchy . Dr. Spurrel does not dogmatize about our present civilization , but suggests that it will probably follow the civilizations of the past into dissolution . I am not convinced of that , because of certain factors new to the history of man . Recent discoveries have unified the world ; such old isolated swoops of race on race are not now possible . In our great industrial states , it is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nature on which the civilizations of the past were reared . All past civilizations have been more or less southern , subject to the sapping influence of the sun . Modern civilization is essentially northern . The individualism , however , which according to Dr. Spurrell dissolved the empires of the past , exists already , in a marked degree , in every modern state ; and the problem before us is to discover how democracy and liberty of the subject can be made into enduring props rather than dissolvents . It is the problem of making democracy genuine . If that can not be achieved and perpetuated , then there is nothing to prevent democracy drifting into anarchism and dissolving modern states , till they are the prey of pouncing dictators , or of states not so far gone in dissolution ? the same process in kind though different in degree from the old descents of savage races on their tamer neighbors . What , for instance , will happen to Russia , if she does not succeed in making her democracy genuine ? A Russia which remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west and east . Ever since the substantial introduction of democracy  | nearly a century and a half ago with the American War of Independence , Western civilization has been living on two planes or levels ? the autocratic plane with which is bound up the idea of nationalism , and the democratic , to which has become conjoined the idea of internationalism . Not only little wars , but great wars such as this , come because of inequality in growth , dissimilarity of political institutions between states ; because this state or that is basing its life on different principles from its neighbors . The decentralization , delays , critical temper , and importance of home affairs , prevalent in democratic countries , make them at once slower , weaker , less apt to strike , and less prepared to strike than countries where bureaucratic brains , subject to no real popular check , devise world policies which can be thrust , prepared to the last button , on the world at a moment 's notice . The free and critical spirit in America , France , and Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own affairs . We fall into glib usage of words like democracy , and make fetishes of them without due understanding . Democracy is inferior to autocracy from the aggressively national point of view ; it is not necessarily superior to autocracy as a guarantee of general well-being ; it may even turn out to be inferior unless we can improve it . But democracy is the rising tide ; it may be dammed or delayed but can not be stopped . It seems to be a law in human nature that where , in any corporate society , the idea of self-government sets foot it refuses to take that foot up again . State after state , copying the American example , has adopted the democratic principle ; the world 's face is that way set . And civilization is now so of a pattern , that the Western world may be looked on as one state , and the process of change therein from autocracy to democracy regarded as though it were taking place in a single old-time country such as Greece or Rome . If throughout Western civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its single  | level of state morality in thought and action , we shall be well on our way to unanimity throughout the world ; for even in China and Japan the democratic virus is at work . It is my belief that only in a world thus uniform , and freed from the danger of pounce by autocracies , have states any chance to develop the individual conscience to a point which shall make democracy proof against anarchy , and themselves proof against dissolution ; and only in such a world can a League of Nations to enforce peace succeed . But even if we do secure a single plane for Western civilization and ultimately for the world , there will be but slow and difficult progress in the lot of mankind . And unless we secure it , there will be only a march backwards . For this advance to a uniform civilization the solidarity of the English-speaking races is vital . Without that there will be no bottom on which to build . The ancestors of the American people sought a new country , because they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from Britain , the first large state in the Christian era to build up the idea of political freedom . The instincts and ideals of our two races have ever been the same . That great and lovable people , the French , with their clear thought and expression , and their quick blood , have expressed those ideals more vividly than either of us . But the phlegmatic and the dry tenacity of our English and American temperaments has ever made our countries the most settled and safe homes of the individual conscience , and of its children , democracy , freedom , and internationalism . And if we English-speaking races quarrel and become disunited , civilization will split up again and go its way to ruin . We are the ballast of the new order . I do n't believe in formal alliances , or in grouping nations to exclude and keep down other nations . Friendships between countries should have the only true reality of common sentiment , and be animated by desire for the general welfare of mankind . We need no formal bonds , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let no petty matters , differences of manner , divergences of material interest , destroy our spiritual agreement . Our pasts , our geographical positions , our temperaments make us beyond all other races the hope and trustees of mankind 's advance along the only line now open ? democratic internationalism . It is childish to claim for Americans or Britons virtues beyond those of other nations , or to believe in the superiority of one national culture to another ; they are different , that is all . It is by accident that we find ourselves in this position of guardianship to the main line of human development ; no need to pat ourselves on the back about it . But we are at a great and critical moment in the world 's history ? how critical , none of us alive will ever realize . The civilization slowly built since the fall of Rome has either to break up and dissolve into jagged and isolated fragments through a century of wars ; or , unified and re-animated by a single idea , to move forward on one plane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this war there is , beneath the lipservice we pay to democracy , a disposition to lose faith in it , because of its undoubted weakness and inconvenience in a struggle with states autocratically governed ; there is even a sort of secret reaction to autocracy . On those lines there is no way out of a future of bitter rivalries , chicanery , and wars , and the probable total failure of our civilization . The only cure , which I can see , lies in democratizing the whole world , and removing the present weaknesses and shams of democracy by education of the individual conscience in every country . Goodbye to that chance , if Americans and Britons fall foul of each other , refuse to pool their thoughts and hopes , and to keep the general welfare of mankind in view . They have got to stand together , not in aggressive and jealous policies , but in defense and championship of the self-helpful , self-governing , " live and let live " philosophy of life .  | The house of the Future is always dark . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Fate . But of these few , one is the brotherhood and bond of the English-speaking races ; not for narrow purposes , but that mankind may yet see Faith and Good Will enshrined , yet breathe a sweeter air , and know a life where Beauty passes , with the sun on her wings . We want in the lives of men a " Song of Honor , " as in Ralph Hodgson 's poem : The song of men , all sorts and kinds , As many tempers moods and minds As leaves are on a tree , As many faiths and castes and creeds , As many human bloods and breeds As in the world may be . In the making of that song the English-speaking races will assuredly unite . What made this world we know not ; the Principle of Life is inscrutable and will forever be ; but we know that Earth is yet on the upgrade of existence , the mountain top of man 's life not reached , that many centuries of growth are yet in front of us before Nature begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , another moon , in space . In the climb to that mountain top of a happy life for mankind , our two great nations are as guides who go before , roped together in perilous ascent . On their nerve , loyalty , and wisdom , the adventure now hangs . What American or British knife will sever the rope ? He who ever gives a thought to the life of man at large , to his miseries , and disappointments , to the waste and cruelty of existence , will remember that if American or Briton fail himself , or fail the other , there can but be for us both , and for all other peoples , a hideous slip , a swift and fearful fall into an abyss , whence all shall be to begin over again . We shall not fail ? neither ourselves , nor each other . Our comradeship will endure .
