BY the time Sophie Pratt had got to be twenty years of age , her father had all but given up hope of her ever getting married . This not because she was unattractive , ? quite the contrary in fact , ? but because he could not conceive of any man in his senses marrying an incorrigible tomboy . The young lady herself , however , entc. ' ' fined no such misgivings . From childhot .. d up she had looked forward with cheerful confidence to the married estate , to which she felt herself distinctly called by reason of her strong preference for playing with boys . ' As if getting married was games and stunts ! ' her brother Sandy used to argue , with much heat and no little show of reason . For Sandy , in whose mind weddings were fatally associated with velvet jackets and patent-leather pumps , cherished a deep-seated aversion to matrimony and all its attendant ceremonies . But to Aleck , their father , that sacred institution offered the only prospect of relief from a well-nigh intolerable cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence , usually so inscrutable , were never more plainly manifest than in the bestowal upon Aleck Pratt of a tomboy daughter . For while the good man would have been properly grieved had this eldest child of his developed some physical infirmity or moral twist , the circumstance could hardly have furnished that daily and hourly flagellation of spirit corn-monly regarded as beneficial , which was mercilessly inflicted upon him at the hands of his innocent child . The sight of a little girl ? anybody 's little girl ? walking fences or playing hopscotch , was an offense to his well-ordered mind . In so much that when his wife Louisa sought to placate him by the confession that she herself had been something of a tomboy in her day , he could only render thanks that he had not been earlier made aware of the circumstance , since the knowledge thereof must inevitably have deterred him from what had been on the whole a very happy marriage . This guarded admission , made in the secrecy of his own consciousness , was characteristic of Aleck . His feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of injury . In this , as in nearly every particular , little Sophie formed a sprightly antithesis to her excellent father . The delights of life it was that she keenly realized , ? the joy of living that sent her scampering along the decorous thoroughfares of Dunbridge , that gave her the catlike agility which made nothing of the most contumacious apple tree or the dizziest barn-loft . It was sheer bubbling spirits that set her whistling like a bobolink under the very nose of her outraged parent . Scant comfort did Aleck derive from his brother Robert 's assurance that the little bobolink whistled in tune . Might as well swear grammatically , ' 655 he would declare , in cold disgust ; thereby causing Robert to rejoice mightily at thought of the salutary discipline in store for the tomboy 's father . Nor was Robert alone in his unchastened triumph . Old Lady Pratt herself was not above breathing the pious hope that Aleck had got his come-uppance at last . And although she was forced to depart this life before the situation had fully developed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her grandson 's expense . ' You 'll never fetch it over that girl of yours , ' she assured him more than once . You might as well try to make an India-rubber ball lie flat . ' And Aleck 's handsome , clean-shaven mouth would set itself in a straight line indicative quite as much of martyrdom as of resistance . Little Sophie , meanwhile , who could no more help being a tomboy than she could help having curly hair and a straight back , took reprimands and chastisement in perfectly good part , all unconscious of that filial mission from which her elders hoped so much . For herself , she had but two grievances against Fate : namely , the necessity of wearing hoop-skirts , and the misfortune of having been christened Sophie , ? a soft , squushy , ' chimney-corner name , ludicrously unsuited to a girl who could fire a stone like a boy . But after all , there was compensation in the fact that she could fire a stone the right way , and not toss it up like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoop-skirts , whatever their iniquities ( which were legion ) , they had never yet deterred her from any indulgence of her natural proclivities . Why , there was a tradition in the neighborhood that the first time Sophie Pratt stuck her feet under the straps of her brother 's stilts , she had walked off on them as a calf walks about on his legs the day he is born . After which exposition of the child 's quality it is perhaps superfluous to state that she was famous for hairbreadth escapes , or that she had a way of coming out of them with a whole skin . She was indeed a living witness to the efficacy of that spontaneous order of gymnastics which is independent of rule and regimen ; for , now that she was past her teens , she could recall having been so much as ill-abed only once in her life , long , long ago , on which memorable occasion the doctor came and stuck a spoon down her throat and nearly strangled her . But he was so firm about it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over he called her a good girl . She used in those childish days to wish it might happen again , just so that she might hear him call her a good girl . For the doctor had a beautiful voice , low and wise , ? oh , very wise , ? but somehow it went straight through you , and Sophie did like things to go through her . But she was incurably healthy and got no more compliments from the doctor , who never took the least notice of her when he came to attend the interesting invalids of the family . This was of course quite natural , since the doctor , being even then an elderly widower , ? going on for thirty ! ? with a little girl of his own to leo , . after , could hardly be expected to bother with a small tomboy who never had anything the matter with her . Then all of a sudden , before anybody knew what she was about , the small tomboy had grown into a big tomboy , ? a gay , flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-swim the best of them , or ride bareback when she got the chance , ? who could even curl up in a corner , if circumstances favored , and pore over her Shakespeare by the hour together , ? but who was never to be caught sewing a seam or working cross-stitch unless upon compulsion . And Aleck wondered morosely why he of all men should have been singled out for this particular penance , and why on earth some misguided youngster did n't come along and take the girl off his hands . Youngsters enough there were , dancing attendance upon the young hoyden , but so far as Aleck could discover , all had heretofore warily avoided committing themselves . ' I doubt if she ever has an offer , ' he declared impatiently , as he and Louisa were driving together behind " old ' Rachel one day in early spring . The outburst was called forth by the sight of Sophie , tramping across-lots with Hugh Cornish , pitcher on the ' Varsity Nine . ' But you surely would n't want her to marry young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel about college athletics . ' I should be thankful to have her marry anybody ! ' Aleck insisted , treating Rachel to a sharp flick of the lash , which caused the good beast to jerk them almost off the seat . Whereupon Louisa , in the interest , not only of corporal equilibrium , but of marital harmony as well , allowed him to have that last word which he looked upon as his inalienable prerogative . After that they were silent fora time , while the excellent Rachel drew them at her own pace along the quiet highway . Sophie and her stalwart cavalier were long since lost to view , yet Aleck 's mind still dwelt upon the picture , harassed perhaps by a gnawing conviction that the girl had not got into that field by the legitimate ingress . And presently Louisa , divining her husband 's mood as a good wife will , cast about for a palliative . In some ways , ' she remarked , ' Sophie is a good deal like your mother , Aleck . The dear woman was perhaps not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there never was her like for rising to an emergency . ' Here Aleck , as in duty bound , emitted a corroboratory grunt , though it must be owned that he had never more than half approved of his charming but undeniably erratic mother . And Louisa , encouraged by that grunt of acquiescence , deemed the moment favorable for pursuing her theme . ' Just think , ' she urged , what a tower of strength the child was when little Henry was so ill last winter . After the first week the doctor was quite willing to have her left in charge for hours at a time . That was a great compliment to pay a girl of twenty . ' Hm ! He did say she was a good nurse , ' Aleck admitted ; for he was a just man . ' Well , ho ought to know , for he was watching her as a cat watches a mouse . Especially that night when we were all so frightened , the night he spent with us . You remember ? ' But Aleck , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . What 's become of that girl of his ? ' he inquired . Lily ? Why , she has been abroad with her aunt this last year . Dear , dear ! I often think how hard it was for the poor man to be left a widower so young ! ' At which the talk trailed off into harmless gossip , and Aleck 's face cleared , as a man 's does , when he transfers his attention from his own perplexities to those of his neighbors . Fate , meanwhile , was doing its best to set his wisdom at naught , and we all know Fate 's resourcefulness in such matters . For at that very moment Hugh Cornish , fresh from an intercollegiate victory , was bracing himself for that categorical proposal which Aleck , too faint-hearted by half , had prematurely despaired of . Sophie was as usual in high spirits , none the less so , if the truth be known , because of the glory inherent in the attendance of so distinguished a personage . As they tramped along together over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing of a thousand hidden , mounting urgencies of spring , she was deterred from challenging her escort to a race only by the well-founded conviction that he would win . She gave him a sidelong glance , of which he appeared to be quite unconscious , ? a man accustomed to the plaudits of the multitude might well be oblivious of such a little thing as that , ? and she concluded that she would have liked the inarticulate giant well enough , if it had not been for his ill-judged zeal in the matter of helping her over stone walls . Presently , after a somewhat prolonged silence , Sophie , at sight of a pair of horns over yonder , was so magnanimous as to own that she was afraid of cows . One must find something to talk about , and Hugh 's resources might be trusted to fall short even of the bovine level . I 'm glad there 's something you are afraid of , ' he remarked , in his stolid way . Whereupon she had immediate resort to hedging . Oh , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . Not with my brains , you understand . Only with my elbows . ' With your elbows ? ' ' It 's only that when a cow stares at me , or waves her horns ever so little , I get the jumps in my elbows . ' You mean your nerves . I 'm glad you 've got nerves . ' Hugh was apt to be repetitious , but then , he was a personage , and fairly entitled to indulgence . So , ? Why are you glad ? ' she inquired , willing to humor him for the battles he had won . Because , ' he answered , standing stock still and squaring himself for the attack , a girl who 's got nerves needs a man to take care of her . And ? and ? Sophie , what I want is to take care of you ? for always . ' And before she could get her breath he had added something fatuous about a strong arm , and Sophie , to whose self-sufficient spirit other people 's strong arms were a negligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good gracious , she thought , was that the way they did it ? Well , there was nothing very alarming about that ! And she rashly undertook to laugh it off . Upon which the popular idol , inured only to that order of opposition which may be expressed in terms of brawn and muscle , came suddenly out of his calm stolidity as he was said to have a way of doing when the game was on . Then Sophie sprang to her guns , and so effectual was the repulse that , next thing she knew , she was climbing a stone wall to the road , quite unassisted , while Hugh stalked in great dudgeon toward the woods . And her silly tieback skirt , lineal successor to the hoops of yore , played her one of those scurvy tricks that are in the nature of petticoats , and somehow or other a small stone tilted , and a big stone shifted , and there was her right foot caught in a kind of vise , and to save herself she could n't wriggle loose without danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not doing any harm for the moment , but it was ignominious to be squatting there like a trussed fowl . She only hoped Hugh would not look round and catch her in such a plight . She shuddered to think of his triumph . But he never once turned his head , as he went stalking away toward the woods . Well , so much for Hugh ! And here were wheels on the road , ? not her father and mother , she hoped ! But no , it was nothing but the doctor , the very man she would have chosen for the emergency . It was not the first time he had caught her climbing stone walls ; in fact he had once picked her off one and given her a ride home , telling her that he was to be put out to pasture himself in a day or two , going up with Lily to see the colored leaves . With this reassuring recollection , and reflecting also that he would understand how to get her loose without pulling her toes off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , she promptly made a signal of distress . Then the doctor drove on to the grassy border across the road , and making fast the weight , came toward her , looking exactly as he had looked years ago , when he stuck the spoon down her throat and called her a good girl , ? wise and firm and very professional . Somehow , in spite of their later intercourse , much of it so important , and in which she was aware of having played a creditable part , Sophie always thought of the doctor as sticking a spoon down her throat and calling her a good girl , in a voice that went through her . How nice to be Lily and have a father like that ! The doctor meanwhile was finding it a ticklish job to lift that stone without hurting the foot . He said afterward that it was one of the most delicate operations he had ever been called upon to perform . When it was accomplished , and the foot drawn.out , the impromptu patient ' said , Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the wall to stretch herself . But as he extended a hand to help her down , she jumped lightly off to the other side . Still the tomboy ! ' he remarked indulgently . Yes , ' she retorted ; and then , with an exultant thought of her late encounter , ' Father says I shall die an old maid if I go on like this ! ' It was a very flighty thing to say , but Sophie was feeling flighty , as a girl does after a first offer , especially when it was based on the strong-arm plea . As if she were to be the beneficiary , indeed ! ' Should you like that ? ' the doctor asked , studying the vivid young face with amused attention . She looked anything but a sick-nurse , the little fraud ! A reversion to type , he told himself , complacently misusing the familiar phrase . He remembered having once stated in a moment of inspiration that a tomboy was an organism endowed with an overplus of vitality . Well , here was vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , played in her lightest movement . It quite made the good doctor 's nerves tingle ! Nor was it all a question of youth , either . One did n't lose that sort of thing with the years . And it crossed the doctor 's mind , parenthetically , that he was himself on the sunny side of forty . He had just saved a man 's life with a quick operation . He could never have done a thing like that in his early twenties , when he was a hotheaded medical student , making a runaway match with Jennie , poor child ! Oh , yes , vitality had staying power , and this little friend of his certainly possessed it to an unusual degree . And how would you like that ? ' he repeated , a quizzical look gleaming in those wise , kind eyes of his . ' Oh , that would depend , ' Sophie answered , with a little toss . ' On what ? ' On Mr. Right , I suppose . ' Old Mrs. Inkley was expecting the doctor that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really the matter with her but temper , and if he found her more spicy than usual , all the better for him . So he lingered a bit , and remarked , in his fatherly way , ? at least Sophie supposed it must be fatherly , since he had a sixteen-year- old daughter of his own , ? ' I wonder what a young girl 's idea of Mr. Right is , now-a-days . A baseball hero , I suppose . ' A baseball hero ! ' she flung back . Anything but that ! ' ' You do n't say so ! ' They think they are so strong , ' she explained . They want to take care of you . ' Oh , that 's it ! I never understood before . I 've got a daughter just growing up , you know , so I gather data where I can . ' Upon which , abandoning for the time being his strictly scientific investigations , he turned to regain his buggy . But Sophie , tomboy to the last , was over the wall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps you would like to know more about Mr. Right , ' she remarked , with a saucy challenge , ? on account of your daughter . ' Startled to find her so near , he turned sharp about . But the quizzical eyes met hers with an answering gleam that was entirely reassuring . So , without a misgiving , and thinking to please the kind doctor , ? Do you remember sticking a spoon down my throat years ago ? ' she inquired . I 'm sure I do n't , ' he laughed . I 've stuck spoons down the throats of half the youngsters in Dunbridge . ' His calling her youngster settled it . ' Well , ' she observed demurely , I made up my mind that day that I should marry somebody exactly like you ! ' Exactly like him ! He looked into those dancing eyes , he felt the tingling contagion of that vitality he had been philosophizing about , again he remembered that he was on the sunny side of forty , and his heart leaped . ' Why not marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being all unpracticed in the most primitive mo tions , knew no better than to stand still . ' Oh , ? could I ? ' she faltered . Would you ? ' he urged vehemently , seizing both her . hands . But she snatched them away . How ridiculous ! ' she heard herself say . And the next instant she was over the wall , and speeding across the pasture , to the tune of a heart that had caught the rhythm at last . With a long look at the flying figure , the doctor turned away and went back to his buggy . There he picked up the weight , climbed in , and drove straight to Mrs. Inkley , who lived in a boarding-house , where he was quite likely to find other patients with nothing the matter with them . But there was something the matter with the doctor himself this time , and later on he should have to take up his own case . His case did not lack attention , for his friends and patients took it up with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlong affair ; quite what might have been expected of Sophie , but so unlike the doctor , who had always been accounted a model of caution and good judgment , and of touching constancy to the memory of his first love . Old Mrs. Inkley went so far as to assert , as any Mrs. Inkley , old or young , might be depended upon to do , that there was no fool like an old fool . In this case , considering that she might have been the doctor 's grandmother , the stricture savored of hyperbole. he declined to admit ; even to himself , that he had been thinking about anything but his patient during those long hours of the night when it had been professionally incumbent upon him to keep a close watch upon the interesting young creature whose overplus of vitality was standing them in such good stead . It had certainly been a revelation of the girl 's character , in which he had taken a keen psychological interest , ? but purely psychological , he would have himself understand . A pretty state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about falling in love with his nurses while they were on duty ! He hoped he was old enough to know better than that ! And after all , the one thing that really mattered was to get the consent of Aleck and his wife to hurry up the wedding so that they might have a chance to get sobered down before Lily got back . For really , the situation was too surprisingly delightful just at present for reasonable behavior . The doctor was so far gone in recklessness that more than once he caught himself smiling at the way he had stolen a march on Lily . Lucky that she was the kind of girl she was , by the way , for if she had been a less vigilant guardian all these years , who could say what might have befallen him before ever Sophie thought of proposing ! And that admission , that there might perhaps be other marriageable young women in the world than Sophie , if he had but chanced to observe them , was the only indication the doctor gave of having passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . For when Aleck tried to conceal his satisfaction under cover of the perfunctory argument that a man who had once made a runaway match could not be very dependable , Sophie retorted that she thought that was the way such things should always be managed , and she did n't know but she and the doctor might decide upon it themselves . At which Aleck was so scandalized that he felt , and not for the first time , as we know , that he should be lucky to get her married off on any terms . And when her mother asked how she could ever expect to cope with a grown-up stepdaughter , she said she was glad of the chance to show that a stepmother could be a real mother to a girl ! And she said it with such ingenuous good faith that Louisa did n't know whether to laugh or cry . And so the doctor and Sophie were married , and lived happily ever after , ? until Lily came home . Sophie had essayed a correspondence with her stepdaughter , but she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One morning in early September , as she sat behind the ciiffee-urn , doing her prettiest , and very pretty it was , to look matronly , she glanced across the table and observed doubtfully , I 've just had a letter from Lily . Would you like to read it ? ' ' Oh , I know Lily 's letters pretty well , ' was the lazy response . ' Ca n't you tell me about it ? ' Well , there 's not much to tell . That 's just the trouble . I wonder ? do you think it possible that she may be afraid of me ? ' And the doctor , who knew his Lily quite as well as he knew her letters , replied , with a somewhat artificial cheerfulness , ? for the day of reckoning was at hand , ? Oh , that will pass off . Just you see if it does n't . Shall you feel like driving me round this morning ? ' Feel like it ! ' the formidable stepmother cried , falling joyfully into his little trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving the doctor round was in itself a delectable function , and it was astonishing how quickly the rounds were made , and how often the busy practitioner found time for a spin out into the open country . He said it was because Sophie was a so much better whip than he , and also because he did n't have to bother with the weight . But it must be confessed that those of his patients who had nothing the matter with them were inclined to feel neglected . Old Mrs. Inlcley said that she had half a mind to send him about his business , only that nobody else understood her case ! And then , by the time these two young people ? for they certainly felt near enough of an age to be twins ? had ceased to be an object of interest to the community at large , and were settling down into that state of homespun content which is about the best weave there is , ? especially when shot through with flashes of something keener and more stimulating which a youthful dynamo of Sophie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the inevitable occurred , as the inevitable is forever doing , and Lily arrived . Her father met her at the dock and brought her home , and Sophie was at the open door , her hands outstretched in eager welcome . And Lily was so polite , and so disconcertingly self-possessed , that Sophie instantly experienced that fatal sensation in the elbows which theretofore only one created thing had had the power to induce , and would no more have dared kiss her than ? well , it would not be respectful to the doctor 's daughter to pursue the comparison . Thoroughly unnerved , and for the first time too in a career that had not been wanting in adventure , Sophie dropped the neatly gloved hand and took refuge in a conventional observation which smacked so strongly of her father that it gave the doctor quite a turn . To his intense relief , however , this proved but a passing seizure , and before the day was out , Sophie was her own spontaneous , irresistible self . Irresistible that is , to Lily 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to resent . That there was something seriously amiss , Sophie became aware to her cost , if not to her complete enlightenment when rash enough to venture upon non-debatable ground . Coming into Lily 's room next morning , ? Wo n't you let me help you unpack ? ' she had the temerity to ask . No , thank you , ' was the crisp reply . ' I do n't like to have a stranger handling my things . ' And Sophie , rarely at a loss for a retort , bethought herself just in time of the peculiar obligations of her position , the which she so misconceived as to rejoin , with preternatural good humor , I hope we sha' n't be strangers long , Lily . ' In a way , I suppose not , ' Lily parried , while she measured her stepmother with a hostile eye , since we 've got to live in the same house . ' Whereat Sophie , still rather new to the exercise of angelic virtues , made as dignified an exit as circumstances would permit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gasped . I meant to be such a good stepmother ! And I will be , too , ' ? this with an accession of high resolve , materially reinforced by a pinch of the Old Adam . I 'll be a good stepmother , whether or no I ' Now Sophie was a young woman of strong will , unschooled to reverses , ? had not everything always come her way , even to the most adorable of husbands that she had got just for the asking ? ? and she certainly had no mind to be thwarted by a snip of a girl like Lily . And thus put upon her mettle , and erroneously concluding that Lily 's hostility was but an instance of that oft-incurred disapprobation of which her father was exponent-in-chief , she unhesitatingly launched out upon the doubtful emprise of changing her nature . She would be a tomboy no longer , but , mindful at last of her father 's admonitions , she would immediately institute a thoroughgoing reform , in deference not , alas , to her own filial obligations , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidently assumed . Above all , she would be invariably kind to Lily . And it never once dawned upon her that nothing in the world could have been so exasperating to the little rebel as this conciliatory attitude . She had come home armed to the teeth against a tomboy stepmother , and here she was confronted with a pattern of good manners and good temper , in face of which the poor child , at her wit 's end , relapsed into a smouldering suspiciousness which found its account in the most pertinacious chaperoning ever administered to a pair of properly accredited lovers . The doctor meanwhile had been not unprepared for trouble ; for , young as he claimed to be , and as he firmly intended to remain , he had seen something of human nature in his day . If lie was rather taken aback to find his daughter turning the tables on him in this highly original fashion , he was too fair-minded to begrudge the child any small indemnification she could devise for herself . What did bother him was the unlooked-for transformation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violation of contract . He took her point , however , for he had had his misgivings touching the effect of her innocent but spirited lawlessness upon the discreet Lily . And he also entertained the hope that so precipitate a reform might prove short-lived . Could n't you relax a bit ? ' he inquired , at last , with a whimsical supplication difficult to withstand . ' But I simply must win Lily over , ' was the ardent , not to say obdurate , protest . And how about Lily 's father ? ' That expressive voice of his could be perilously appealing . But the young enthusiast was on her guard . ' Oh , he 's too dead easy ! ' she ' retorted wickedly . In which lapse from grace the doctor was obliged to find what consolation he could . It was but a week after the reign of decorum had set in that they repaired to the mountains for the doctor 's autumn holiday , Lily in assiduous attendance . The self-constituted chaperon had ? heroically sacrificed a seashore invitation , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to Sophie 's own ; and this although she had been urgently admonished not to take the others into consideration at all . And so it came about that the proverbial three , almost as abhorrent to Nature in certain contingencies as the vacuum she more consistently repudiates , went to see the colored leaves . These latter did all that could be reasonably expected of them . They glowed and they gleamed and they shimmered ; they splashed the mountain-sides with bronze and carmine ; they spread a gold-embroidered canopy overhead and a Persian carpet under foot ; and Sophie , who had never seen their like , found it difficult to refrain from an unbridled expression of delight . Thanks , however , to Lily 's repressive influence , she succeeded in keeping her spirits in check , ? to such good purpose indeed that , when one day the doctor was summoned in consultation to a remote farmhouse , no child delivered into the hands of an unscrupulous stepmother could have felt the sense of utter abandonment that overwhelmed poor Sophie , as she turned from bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . True to her colors , however , she made a valiant rally . Shall we go for a walk later on ? ' she asked , with unflinching affability . Whatever you wish , ' was the crushing response . And accordingly just at the perfect hour of the day , they started on one of Lily 's conventional promenades . Thus they circumspectly followed the dusty highway , though fields and woods were beckoning ; and very rough going it would have been for Sophie , only that she was walking in step to that trumpet-call of color , and her thoughts were not of Lily , but of Lily 's father . Perhaps Lily suspected as much , and it may have been with a view to discountenancing the indiscretion that she remarked brusquely , ' I wish you would n't race so . ' I beg your pardon , ' said Sophie , bringing herself up short in more senses than one . I was n't thinking . ' You appeared to be , ' observed Lily , with veiled satire . After which brief dialogue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily announced , as if she had really come to the end of her endurance , I 'm going back across the fields . It 's shorter . ' Good I ' cried Sophie , literally jumping at the chance . Here 's a gate . ' A gate , indeed ! Did Lily know how to estimate the concession ? Oh , you ' 11 not care to come , ' she demurred , with a too palpable satisfaction in the circumstance . You 're afraid of cows , you know , and there are sure to be some over the hill . ' And Sophie , yielding to the spirit rather than to the letter of the argument , meekly acquiesced . I 'll meet you on the lower road , ' she said . And then , having taken down the bars and put them up again , ? for Lily was peculiarly liable to splinters , ? she stood a moment , watching the slender figure as it progressed , straight and stiff , across the field , the silk skirts swishing audibly from side to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hard , to be possessor of an in. comparable father like the doctor , and then to have another girl , a perfect outsider , come along and insist upon going snacks . She only wondered that Lily bore it as well as she did . And , speaking of fathers , ? what a pity that her own was not there to see how she was beginning to profit by his excellent bringing-up . He would certainly have had to approve of her at last . And somehow that reflection , which should only have confirmed her in well-doing , worked just the other way about , and in a flash she was all tomboy again . Lily had disappeared in a hollow , and the general public seemed to be represented for the moment by one old plough-horse , temporarily out of business , and a vociferous flock of crows . Perceivipg which , and shaking her head in a characteristic way she had , as if her mane of hair were loose and flying , the model stepmother caught at the chance for a run . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming , up went the tie-back skirt to her very boot-tops , and away went Sophie down the road . Oh , but it was good to run , ? it was good ! As she raced along the road , ? really raced this time , ? the swift motion going to her head like wine , she felt herself purged of alien virtues , as irresponsible as any young animal , bounding over the good friendly earth for the sheer joy of it . If only she might run like this forever ! If only she need never arrive anywhere ! If only She had rounded the great rolling pasture , and as she approached the lower gate , she slackened her pace . There were cattle as Lily had predicted , scattered about the field , grazing quietly , or standing here and there under an apple tree , switching at belated flies . It was all very peaceful and rural , save for the intensely dramatic setting of the autumn foliage , and Sophie smiled to think that she could ever have imagined herself afraid of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life when she thought that ! And there was Lily now , a natural sequence in her train of thought . As she watched the sedate figure , appearing at the crest of the slope , she only hoped that there was nothing in her own aspect to suggest that she had been guilty of anything so undignified as a run , with skirts picked up and hat on the back of her head . And still Lily came sedately on . Already Sophie could hear the swish of silk skirt and overskirt . She would never have ventured to question their appropriateness for a cross-country stroll , ? so had the day of the stepmother waned , ? but she was glad that she herself knew the comfort of jersey and corduroy . And Lily , giving no more sign of recognition than as if the waiting figure had been clad in a garment of invisibility , came sedately on , while the skirts swished from side to side , and ? What was that ? A low rumble as of distant thunder , ? then louder , and louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those swishing skirts who was not afraid to say so ! One of the cows , her horns lowered , ? no , no ! ? a cow did n't do that ! It was a bull ! And look , he was charging , head down , tail up , straight across the field at the unconscious Lily ! Run , Lily , run ! ' Sophie screamed , vaulting over the bars , and tearing across the field in the general direction of the bull , who , fortunately , had yet much ground to cover . Run ! Run ! ' And Lily gave one glance over her shoulder , saw the awful brute bearing down upon her , and stood rooted to the ground , stiff with horror . Run ? She could no more have run than she could have flown ! And Sophie , wildly waving her scarlet jacket , and yelling with all her might dashed straight for the bull . Perplexed , not to say annoyed , he halted an instant . Which should it be ? That mean-spirited blue thing just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or that maddening red thing over there , flourishing defiance in his very eyes , and daring him , with vociferous insults , to come on ? With a blood-curdling bellow he announced his choice , and as Sophie turned and fled before him , ? Run , Lily , run ! ' she found breath to scream . Then Lily looked again , and the horror lifted , ? the horror that was paralyzing her . But in its place came another horror that lent wings to her feet ; and , espying a passing team , she picked up her swishing skirts , higher than Sophie 's had ever gone , and flew over the ground , shrieking , ' Help ! Help ! ' But in her heart was a deadly fear , and she did not dare look back . The men were at the gate , and making her a clear passage . And as she stumbled over the lowered bars aslant , Save her , save her ! ' she choked . ' Oh , save her l ' Then one of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad ? Or was she mad herself ? I reckon she do n't need no savin ' , ' he opined , with slow deliberation fitting the bars back again , ? for he was himself not over-anxious for an encounter with a bull on the rampage . Look , Sissy ; she 's up in the gallery , ' n ' he 's doin ' the bull-fight act for her , all by himself . Ai n't that pretty , now ? ' Then Lily looked ; and there among the higher branches of a low-spreading apple tree , sat her pattern stepmother , quite at ease , while the bull , with deep growlings and mutterings , trampled and tore the offending jacket into finders . Such was the bucolic scene that met the doctor 's startled eyes as he came driving home along the quiet country road , discussing congenital errors of circulation with his professional colleague . ' It was really great fun , ' Sophie declared , with easy nonchalance when , the bull having been subjugated and led away , she found herself at liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had my eye on that apple tree from the start , so that I knew there was n't the least danger . ' This with a tentative glance at the doctor , who struck her as looking not quite himself . ' But you are afraid of cows ! ' Lily stammered , still rather white and breathless . You said you were . ' Yes ; but you never heard me say I was afraid of a bull ! ' With which gallant disclaimer , the heroine of the hour took on an air of buoyant unregeneracy , which proved so reanimating to the doctor that he was able to observe , with only a slightly exaggerated composure , that the tomboy had won out at last . And yet , ? was it then the tomboy , he asked himself that same evening , when , coming out on the moonlit piazza , he caught sight of two girlish figures on the steps over yonder , leaning close , in earnest talk , ? Sophie 's voice low and caressing , Lily 's subdued to a key of blissful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? Or was it that other Sophie , ? the Sophie he had seen brooding over her little patient , mothering him so tirelessly through the long night-watches , ? the Sophie whom the doctor had made such a point of not having fallen in love with ? A vagrant whiff of cigar smoke betrayed his presence , and instantly the two were on their feet and coming toward him , ? Lily a bit shame-faced and disposed to reticence . But Sophie could brook no secrets from the doctor . As they came up to him , ? ' Only think , ' she announced cheerfully , yet with a just perceptible vibration of feeling , ' Lily says she will have me for a mother after all . And , do you know , ' ? the shy note of feeling hurrying to cover , ? I did n't have to offer myself , either ! ' ? But there was no trace of banter in the doctor 's tone , as he drew Lily to him and said , with a look that Sophie put away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've been in want of all our life ; eh , little one ? ' And at the word , that primal and essential three which Nature in her wisdom prefers above all others , came quietly into its own .
