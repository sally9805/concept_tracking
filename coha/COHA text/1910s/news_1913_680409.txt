txt Gov . SULZER 'S proposal to double the tax on the transfer of securities is based primarily on the State 's need of more money . The brokers ' objection to the tax is due to their natural dislike of such a burden on their activity . But neither of these considerations is so important as the effect of the tax on the people who buy and sell securities on their own account and not for other people . A seller or buyer as principal of a 100-share unit , say $10,000 value , will not be deterred by either a $2 or $4 tax , but he would suffer if the price which he realized were shaded by as much as a single point , or $100 . The fact is that the proposed tax would alter the price more than a point . Indeed , there is danger that the market would largely disappear if there were no third party to intervene between the actual buyer and seller ash the mere holder of the stock for the . turn of the market , without reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its permanent rise or fall . This function is performed by the brokers of a certain class , who always are ready to trade on the chance of an eighth . Whatever operates to narrow their profits or increase their risks tends to deprive first-hand buyers and sellers of their services . It is easy to illustrate this by the market in real estate , or in certain securities for which there is no constant , close market . In that case there is always need for a. buyer to find a , seller or for a seller to find a buyer , and the bid and asked prices are so far apart that separate bargains must be made in each Case . Such transactions in the security field are now few and far between , and to make them the rule by driving out the broker would seriously diminish the value of the securities as collateral , apart from their worth as investments . New York now is the best market for securities of all sorts . People buy and sell here rather than elsewhere , because here is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exchange might remain in New York , and yet it might be reduced to the provincial class of other cities which deal only in local properties . The proposed tax is therefore a blow at New York 's primacy , because it would operate to the disadvantage of primary buyers and sellers . So excessive a step as doubling any tax tends to defeat its own ends . It is thought a hardship when the real estate tax rises and falls by mills . If It were proposed to double it the protests would appall the proposer . It is an easy calculation that the proceeds of the tax would be doubled with the tax if the business remained the same  --  but there 's the rub . The business would not remain the same . It has not remained the same while the present tax has been imposed , and the increase of the tax would emphasize the tendency of the business to decrease in dull times . It would probably be useless to appeal to Gov . SULZER 'S better nature in tenderness to the brokers ' Outcries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries are music to many . But everybody who has any investments will suffer with the brokers . We are thinking of the brokers ' customers , and of New York as a market , when we suggest that the tax will be disappointing as a money-maker and injurious otherwise to an even greater extent . Doubtless the proposal is made with the best intentions , and , since there is no presumption of punitive intent , there is every reason to hope for a better second thought , for which there is ample time .
