THE news from Germany continues to be fragmentary , and the outside world is permitted to know little of the movements which are agitatinethe country . The reported outbreak of the Liebknecht forces at Berlin undoubtedly indicates the existence of organized opposition to the Ebert-Haase Government ; how serious the opposition is , however , or how far it has taken form outside of the capital , is not . yet clear . Any spread of the Bolshevist spirit , of which the radical or independent Socialists are the embodiment , is a serious natter at this juncture , and can hardly fail to strengthen , in the Allied countries if not in the conservative circles of Germany itself , the call for Allied or American military intervention . On the other hand , the report that returned soldiers are giving their support in various places to the existing revolutionary Government , and are exerting themselves to put down violence , is encouraging ; for while the soldiers are probably- able to take complete control wherever they choose , they have thus far shown no disposition to upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictatorship . The action of Herr Ebert in declining to assume the Presidency of a German Republic without the approval of a Constituent Assembly has also made a favorable impression . ' It now seems probable that an assembly of some kind will convene this month instead of in February . Some of the most disturbing influences come from without , in the reported determination of the Allies to insist upon the surrender of the Kaiser by Holland , and the demands for huge indemnities which it is said the peace conference will be asked to endorse . The most optimistic German must ? feel that the outlook for leniency , or even for an opportunity for Germany to work out its own salvation without interference , is dark . IT is many a wrote century since Erasmus of Rotterdam ote his " Praise of - Folly . " Our European " special correspondents " are adding a few supplementary chapters . For more than a year they have been telling us of the wicked -- ness of Lenine and Trotzky , the " traitors " who sold their ? duntry for German gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with accounts of the suffering of that noble popular hero , Karl Liebknecht , who was slowly dying in an imperial jail for having dared to raise his voice against Prussian militarism . And now behold , With a single touch of Clio 's magic wand , the ? scene is changed . Militarism is dead . The great prophet of a joyful war enjoys the windy privacy of an island of the dreary Zuyder Zee . Lenine and Trotzky , slain countless times by assassins ' bullets , are alive and seemingly prosperous and content . Liebknecht , as leader of a radical group of Socialists , has become an object of Allied denunciation . This week he is accused of having sold his country for Bolshevist money ! If we understand the matter aright , the Teutonic millions that first corrupted Russia have returned to Berlin and are now corrupting the German Republic . Unless these millions come to rest the world will continue in a state of turmoil . I N settlement of a suit filed on January 26 , 1917 , in behalf of the Imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee Copper Company , Federal Judge Knox has ordered , according to press reports , the payment of $1,000,000 to the Czecho-Slovaks . The decision is said to be based upon the alleged fact that the territory under the jurisdiction of the Czecho-Slovak Government " takes in some of the territory that formerly was part of Russia . " " The court 's order , " concludes the report , " made it possible for the money to be paid to the Czecho-Slovaks instead of the Bolshevik regime . " Following close on the ' heels of this incident came the news that Germany had restored to the Allies , as part of a large collection of stolen goods , 300 , - 000,000 francs in gold taken from the Russian treasury . The disposition by the Allies of this considerable sum has not yet been announced . The whole problem of Russia 's money must be vexing in the extreme to Governments which- are legally at , peace with the Russian Government , but which are trying , by force of arms , to overthrow it . Apparently we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help an enemy who is not an enemy , - or  --  to give his money to the Czecho-Slovaks . T UST to , let the world know that there is still war on J earth , the rioting and bloodshed in Chili and Peru , appear to continue . The army reserves of Peru have been called to the colors , and two divisions of the army of Chili are being mobilized , presumably to keep order . Even the ? most reassuring reports from those republics make it evident that no real order can be attained until the vexed question of Tacna and Arica is settled . Peru and Bolivia ? demand an application of the principle of . self-determination , confident that the people of the contested provinces would return t if given a free chance . The Chilean Foreign Office seems to be considering the feasibility of ' applying a plebis : cite according to the provisions of the Treaty of Ancon . The offer of mediation by the United States in conjunction with Argentina is reported to have been accepted by the Peruvian Government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended pending a settlement . Whether the matter is settled by some such arrangement , or , whether , as was rather na  --  vely requested ; it is submitted to the general peace conference , its connection with the world ? situation is clear . The people of all countries know that this iS a time when old debts are being liquidated and new arrangements are in the making . No state of affairs which gives rise to irritation and discontent will be respected . THE provisional estimates submitted to Congress , last week by Sec'ketary McAdoo show a substantial keducton in governmental expenses in prospect for the next fiscal year beginning July 1 , 1919 . The army estimates were cut down by . the cessation of the war from a probable nineteen lbillion to two billion . The navy estimates , on the lather hand , amount .. to a billion dollars more than was appropriated for this purpose during the current year . The people may be grateful that the figures are no higher . Nevertheless they may with reason inquire why , they should beas - high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment will maintain a standing army of half a million men , and according to the best professional authorities , we shall . shortly have the most powerful navy in the world . This surely seems an extraordinary outcome of-a war whose avowed end was the destruction of militarism . The Allied nations who crushed Napoleon justified themselves by precisely the same grandiloquent phrases about " the reconstruction of the moral order " and " the establishment of an enduring peace " ; and we now see what they amounted to . Some day , possibly , we shall learn that the prospect of gathering grapes- of thorns or figs of thistles is hopeful and encouraging beside that of maintaining an enduring peace by the competitive accumulation of armaments . But our estimates seem to show that the day is not near at hand . rrHE announcement of another great drive , this time I for the benefit of the American Committee of Armenian and Syrian Relief , calls attention to the excellent work already - done and the future plans of the committee in the Near East . A Commission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last July to cooperate with and strengthen a group of workers who had been on the field for two years . They found Persia in serious condition . A year of drought , which destroyed even vegetables and fruit , and the occupation of Persian territory , from the very beginning of the war , by foreign troops , which devastated the land and requisitioned all foodstuffs , have caused famine to spread through all Persia . The war has also destroyed Persian trade , particularly the rug trade , and has brought desolation to all connected with it . The Commission found the most abject misery and no recuperative power among the people . Persia is a land rich in undeveloped natural resources , but living conditions and means of communication are as primitive as they were several centuries ago . The Commission is spending $250,000 a month , and has established many relief stations where refugees and sufferers can be fed and clothed . FUrther , they are bringing Ford cars , sewing machines , looms , and agricultural implements to Persia in the hope of making a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of self-support . N reviewing that little classic , " Why Freedom Matters , " a writer in the New Republic spoke thus : " The sobriety and sanity of the author of this pamphlet is eloquently attested by the growing number of his intellectual converts . No single source of illumination has contributed more to effective and astute exposition of the genuine foundations of international polity than Norman Angell . " The Intercollegiate Socialist Society felt this essay to be so well worth consideration that they secured a special donation for its reprinting and sent out , in the spring or early summer , four or five hundred copies to the colleges , where , if anywhere , one might expect to speak to those whose especial business it is to judge and sift ideas . On November 26 , having had no previous intimation that the pamphlets had not been received in due course , ? the senders got word from the Post- Office Department that the pamphlets had been declared unmailable and " disposed of " as such ; . that is , - apparently , destroyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sanctity of the mails or for the American sense of humor , where is that sacred regard for the constitutionally protected rights of property which has annulled so many needed laws on the groundthat the unrestricted right to make a contract was a property right . What , is this monstrous power entrusted , in Walt Whitman 's phrase , to the " never-ending audacity of elected persons " ? persons in this case , however , not elected but appointed ? Without advice , without notifying the sufferer , without a hearing , without appeal , not only may the threads of intercommunication be secretly cut , perhaps doing incalculable and absolutely irretrievable damage , but apparently actual physical property ; without any limit to its possible value , may be not only seized for an indefinite period , but " disposed of . " What is there to safeguard a unique copy of an unublished manuscript by the greatest genius in the world from being thus disposed of if Mr. Burleson happens to disapprove it , as one of his predecessors disapproved one of Tolstoy 's masterpieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all its attacks on others , can not itself boast of being " 100 per cent . American ? " There is certainly some piquant evidence to that effect . Those who have had the opportunity to examine the material , which the energetic Congressman Frear of Wisconsin has gathered , preparatory to the investigation of the funds and activities of the National Security League , report evidence shOwing that that super-patriotic organization was for several years , and up to last Spring , in the closest possible alliance with  --  of all persons ? William Randolph Hearst ! According to Washington reports , Mr. S. Stanwood Mencken , the founder and president of the organization , enlisted Mr. Hearst 's active interest in it several years ago . Mr. Hearst declined to take a position on the board of directors but became one of the most substantial contributors . Things went merrily along until the campaign of hysteria which the League fomented last winter evolved ; as almost the first of its by-products , a bitter newspaper war against Mr. Hearst , led by the New - York Tribune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors of the League were forced by the Tribune to join in the attack on the editor . The latter promptly forced Mr. Mencken to give the Hearst papers a more or less friendly endorsement , for which offence against the prevailing Draconian code Mr. Mencken , as all the world knows , was compelled to resign . All this is much like New York , but in Washington , where a certain rough simplicity still seems to obtain , Mr. Frear 's discovery that the League has been financed by the one American editor whose position on the war has been most , savagely attacked has filled the Congressional breast with amusement and scorn , as well it might . Those who know Congressman Frear best describe him as a fighter ? slow to action but a. hard hitter when he actually strikes . His resolution demanding an investigation of the League seems to have the solid support of both parties in the House  --  excepting , perhaps , the thirty " lily white Congressmen " who were endorsed by the League  --  and the short session ' will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and methods of the League . P-1- ? HE formation of an Ameiican Labor party seems to be . i assured . The plan originated , as stated in our columns last week , out of -a local grievance in Chicago . It has been endorsed by the Illinois State Federation of Labor and by certain local unions in the East ; and it has every prospect of success with the extreme left of the labor movement , represented by the Northwest and the Pacific coast. , If it broadens its scope to include brain workers as well as manual workers , it can no doubt command some valuable accretions from the new National party , which seems to be in a more or less fluid state , from the Socialists , and from that section of the independent vote which is reluctant toward doctrinaire tendencies . Probably the new party will model its machinery largely after that of the old , and go on the political stage with its own candidates , tickets , and platforms . Americans seem slow- to learn anything new in political methods . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the two who refused to hold office under any circumstances ? William Cobbett and Richard Cobden . The campaigns which were most effective for just the sort of thing that the American Labor party seems to have in mind were those of the Anti-Corn-Law League ; and instead of bending its energies to electing a politician on a ticket of its own ; it educated the people to its principles and made the politician of whatever party " come to taw . " There is muchto be said for this method ; the political conversion of Sir Robert Peel is a most impressive example of its power . We should like to see it tried in this country . The nearest thing to it has been done by the National Woman 's Party in behalf of universal suffrage , and its success has been sufficient , one would think , to recommend it highly . The new Labor party might well consider it . A leadership of principle 's and not of men , a campaign of economic policies and not of candidates , would be something almost brand-new in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an astonishing success . THE week 's news has furnished an interesting example of our enforcement of the principle of equality before the law . Federal Judge Morrow , of San Francisco , on December 2 quashed indictments against the twenty-five men charged with having instigated the forcible deportation of twelve hundred striking miners from Bisbee , Arizona , eighteen months ago . These twenty-five men included public officials , mine owners , and members of the organization known as the " Loyalty League , " and the informations against them were to the effect that they had conspired against the constitutional rights of the miners in the manner specified . We do not know upon what technicality their demurrer was sustained , but we feel certain that the collapse of the inquiry will stir a sullen and dangerous sense of grievance . A gross and scandalous outrage was committed against the striking miners , and the public is by no means convinced that a serious effort has been made to fix the responsibility for it . Meanwhile , ninety-three members of the I. W. W. , some of whom were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate term of 800 years and to pay an aggregate fine of over $2,500,000 . Without laboring the contrast , we wish- merely to remark once again , as often before , the extremely - bad impression made upon us and others of non-partisan sympathies ? by the marked difference in our dealings with the two kinds or brands of suspects . The brisk and energetic certitude of our legal processes when applied to the I. W. W. , as compared with their indolent and reluctant methods with the anarchist mob of " leading citizens , " is utterly offensive to a natural sense of justice . It is all very well to talk about the suppression of sedition and revolution , but it is much more to the point to consider the conditions which inevitably breed them ; and the history of the Bisbee affair affords a capital example , to date , of precisely such conditions . AT the first three sessions of the meeting of the Academy of Political Science , held in New York last week , there was a distinct note of pessimism . ' Men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment during the war feel that the Government has let the crisis of reconstruction come without developing an effective . policy ; yet they are reluctant to leave the whole problem to the captains of . industry . At this meeting several of them urged the immediate adoptiOn of a national minimum wage . In this connection it is interesting to note the resolution recently passed by the Associated Merchants and Manufacturers of New York State , favoring a minimum wage law for women and minors and the appointment of a State commission to study the subject , and also favoring a Federal minimum wage law which , when enacted , shall supersede all State legislation . Professor Henry R. Seager at the Academy meeting also suggested the formation of a Federal Industrial Relations Commission whose function should be not merely the indication of evils , but the undertaking of a definite propaganda among employers and employees for adjustment through more extended use of collective bargaining . A S to the immediate labor situation , there is a sharp divergence of view . Charles M. Schwab and Frank A. Vanderlip spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Hamilton , of the staff of the War Labor Policies Board , indicated that there is a possible discrepancy between the need for materials abroad , upon which hope the ' optimists base their prophecies of prosperity , and the actual demand for these goods . He fears that capital may hesitate to plunge into production until cost of raw materials goes down and ' until the labor market becomes sufficiently glutted to insure cheap labor . Labor , through its representatives on the conference programme , insisted that wages should not decrease , and pointed out that as a matter of fact , except in a few trades , real Wages have actually decreased during the war period . Moreover , with the approach of winter , neither public works nor farms- will be ready for the absorption of surplus men . - THE only Government bureau functioning at present in a really positive fashion is the United States Employment Service . This , according to Mr. Nathan A. Smyth , the assistant director , has a represe-ntative in every camp , and is working in conjunction with community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iormed a central committee for joint action among army , navy , Red Cross , Y. M. C. A. , American Federation of Labor , and other interested bodies , to find positions for returning soldiers and dislocated industrial workers . Already , Mr. Smyth reports , destitute soldiers are applying for civil relief in some ? of the larger cities . As he points out , the employment service can only place men ; it can not create jobs . The suggestion of failure so commonly applied to governmental boards at the Academy meeting , excepted the Railway Labor Adjustment Board , which , it is hoped by many , will remain in existence . That the Government should relinquish any additional control over industry , however , was the dominant note in the utterances of Mr. Schwab and Mr. Vanderlip . That the actual effectiveness of the War Labor Board itself is at an end ' is plainly indicated by the recent action of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in repudiating its award with regard to collective bargaining .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
