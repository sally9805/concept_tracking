To the ordinary layman war is a picturesque function . Your troops are landed , they take their place in the line , and then they fight . To the soldier , however , one of the foremost questions ? if not the very foremost ? of a campaign resolves itself into those two prosaic words , ' Transport ' and ' Supply . ' Without a satisfactory solution of this dual problem , your immense modern army might just as well have stayed at home . Supply , of course , means food for man and beast , while transport is your vehicular or other means of carriage . In the old wars , of relatively small armies , the question of supply was often solved by the natural process of ' living on the country . ' Your victorious and advancing army helped itself to food ; and so , the more victorious and more advancing it was , the better it fared . The defeated army starved and surrendered , unless it could retire on new armies . The question of transport , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had little need to go beyond the animals , carts , wagons , and so forth , which had been diverted from their peace-time occupations . The story that Xerxes led a million men against the Greeks , is manifestly an exaggeration . The supply and transport of such a body , even did the ancient Persian manage to subsist for twenty-four hours on a loaf of bread and an onion , would have proved a physical impossibility . To-day , however , we have to face this problem , and even a far larger one ; and in so far as the United States and the British Empire are separated by water from the common foe , the matter as it presents itself to the English-speaking Allies is more or less identical . In both cases the subsistence of the Expeditionary Force is based on sea-power , and the lines of communication start several thousand miles from the scene of action . But let us land in France to begin with , and stand open-eyed in what is called a Base Supply DepOt . Every one of the Allies has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the easier it is to deal with our vast armies . From the base you send men and material to the Front by rail ; and so , if you increase the number of your bases , you are able to double , treble , or even quadruple your effectiveness as a belligerent . Your base supply rtepOt is on the coast , and alongside the quays , piers , and wharves of a great harbor . Day and night the great ships come , unload , and disappear . They bring with them a new problem , that of Labor ; and so it has come about that , beyond your army in the firing-line , and your army of transport-drivers , and your army of supply men , you need a new army to clear the holds of these great ships , to check and stack the cases , bales , sacks , drums , and barrels that are put ashore , and , further , to load the railway-trains that are for ever passing out of your depot . Every one of these considerations applies likewise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tentage , hutments , fuel , mineral and lubricating oils ; to barbed wire , sleepers , rails and bridging material for the engineers . I am dealing , however , only with the food-problem , which , though all-important in itself , is but the part of a far vaster matter . I had qualified as an interpreter in French and German , and for that reason I was suddenly requested to leave the gallant regiment I had newly joined and to proceed forthwith to France . We were untrained , we had neither rifles nor equipment ? it was in the first six months of the war , when everything , though seeming chaos , was in point of fact a wise and far-seeing preparation . In two days I could get out to France , and that was exactly what I wanted . Like many another , I had the feeling that the war would be over pretty soon , long before we of ' the first hundred thousand ' were fit and ready . My exact job would be to tackle the French railway authorities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , truth to tell , cared less . I landed at a base and was immediately posted to the supply &pit.; It was only then that I began to realize the place of food and forage in modern warfare . The French had done us handsomely , giving us ample storeroom and abundant cover ? acres of it , in fact , and we needed it all . Our ration in France in those days was , and probably still is , composed of meat ( canned or frozen ) , bread or biscuit , bacon , jam , preserved milk , cheese , tea , sugar , salt , mustard , and pepper . To these may be added butter , fresh or dried vegetables , compressed soup-tablets , rum , lime-juice , and a tinned delicacy , familiarly known as a Maconochie , ' ? such is the most popular maker 's surname , ? but officially called an M. and V. ration . It is a stew . of meat and vegetables , ? hence the M. and V. , ? and like the other inter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu . The horses and mules lived then on oats , hay , bran , and maize ? bulky and mountainous articles that suffer more than case goods from rain and weather . To all this must be added fuel ; for without wood , coal , or charcoal , how are you going to cools your food or make your tea ? In addition to these staple articles , and carefully protected from a pilfering world , one found a lesser apiit devoted to what are known in the army as ' medical comforts . ' In this holy of holies are stored the noble meat and drink supplied to hospitals . Cases of champagne are here , of port wine , and of stout ; of tinned chicken , sago , anon-root , jellies , soups , and what not . Articles have been written about these base supply clepOts , their dependent bakeries , and the immensity of their dealings ; about their wonderful organization , and the busy fellows who move and labor in them . The men employed here are comfortable , but often bored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have permanent quarters ; and rumor has it that , being where food is , they have first choice of whatever comes to hand . But against this must be set off the perpetual sameness of the work , the eternal vista of beef and biscuit-boxes , the monotonous accounts , the unvarying hindquarters and fores in the cold storage . There is romance at first , as one pictures the whole wide world converging on this centre . One comes across strange and unknown grasses in the bales of hay that have crossed oceans ; Chicago , South America , Australia , and even Madagascar , have slaughtered cattle for us ; one discovers that the honestest and most varied jams in the world come from British Columbia and Tasmania . But as time goes on , uneasy fellows like myself grow sick and tired of the same old story . The work here should be given to men well broken to the routine of offices and counters ; the big and little business men are well at home here ; with a difference , it is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lipton . From the depot the loaded trains go out to railhead . At first a train was allotted to an army corps , but on my second stay in France I found that the unit had changed to a division . We had only the existing railway tracks and railway material to work with , then ; to-day there is an undreamed-of network , and wagons to match . The food and forage of a division is weighed and counted out . You have your scale , and each day you are told the number of men , the number of mules and horses . These vary with the casualty lists or the drafts sent forward . A big battle may decimate your division , or reinforcements swell it . A wire comes to your depOt , and it is up to you to collect the goods . At first an officer and five men went with each train as escort , and I was one of those officers . We led a roving life , much like that of a ship 's captain . We dealt with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as R.T.O. 's . Railway transport officer is the long of those initials . From them we took orders and to them reported progress . Now train-traveling officer and middle-aged ' dugout ' are alike abolished , and the stuff gets to railhead more simply . In theory a railhead stands well behind the reach of the enemy 's guns , and so , more often than not , you can unload your train in peace , if not in quiet . But every now and again the German will surprise you with a long-range weapon , or his aviators will tryand make a mess of you . The long-range gun is easily answered . You shift your railhead farther back , till the gun is knocked out or abolished . The aviators are a necessary evil . But all these excursions and alarums are the exception rather than the rule , and spice a life that tends to grow too civilian . It is well to remind a supply officer once in a while that he takes risks , otherwise he grows too confoundedly meticulous and full of worries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so one must picture an extended front as dotted with these centres of activity . But the division itself is the main unit ; so , next , the contents of your train are packed into motor-lorries and borne away to the divisional dump . From all the roads that lead to railhead these lorries converge , in clouds of dust when the roads are dry , in indescribable mud when the days are wet . The supplies are checked , receipts are given , and off go the lorries in long strings again . We are now quite definitely in the war area , and sailing those crowded roads depicted in the picture-papers . The guns are thundering , the aeroplanes are up , the resting infantry is swinging back to billets , and reliefs are going forward . You , however , are bound for the divisional dump . Follow the motor-lorries , and you come across it at a convenient spot , where traffic can enter at one side and depart at another , without much turning . As with the railway-train before them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into heaps , each heap the property of a brigade . For a brigade is your next unit . Matters are now becoming intimate . The people at the supply &pit; have no personal contact with the troops . The motor-convoys are almost as remote as they , but each division has its 564 FEEDING divisional train , which in turn is divided into companies , each of which is attached to a brigade . The divisional train consists of horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons . Company after company it rolls up , takes its load , and goes oft ' to its various refilling points . These are lesser dumps , controlled by the brigade supply officer . This officer has to deal with the smallest unit on our list . His heap is subdivided into little heaps , each one the property of a battalion ; and to his rendezvous comes daily the battalion transport , still horse-drawn , which makes the penultimate stage to the first-line trenches . The quartermaster is now in charge , and when night falls , the fatigue parties manhandle the food and drink that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down the communication trenches they go , loaded and welcome . And so the company is fed , the dim platoon , right down to the last and hungriest Tommy . II Thus roughly I have attempted to describe the various processes that prevail in an ordered country like France , where communications are good , roads are in being , and all the ground explored . I have omitted all mention of the endless checks and counter-checks : how the battalion quartermasters send their figures to the brigade supply officer , how the latter summarizes these figures and passes them on to the divisional supply officer , who in turn sends his calculations to someone more important . A vast deal of arithmetic and paper work goes on behind the physical phenomena of supply ; and here again you are up against the value of a business training . The good supply officer is the mother of his brigade . Down at the dump he does his best for man and beast ; at his AN ARMY own refilling point he watches over the interest of each particular unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trenches , and assure himself with his own eyes that the men of his brigade are faring well and plentifully . The particular officer I have in mind was cheered by the men as they went back to billets . In addition to the regular supply from home , the army consumes a vast amount of material purchased in the country . There are fresh vegetables , ? notably potatoes , ? fruit , and wine , ? a hospital item , ? bran , yeast for the bakeries , live sheep and goats for our Indian troops , and many another article . During part of my stay I attended to such purchases , and officially was known as local purchasing officer . This business brings one into notable contact with the civilian , and especially the civilian who is out to make money by the war . He or she ? in France , especially now , with so many of the men away , it is often she ? are among my most entertaining memories . I think I thoroughly enjoyed pitting them one against the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were out to help , and not to exploit , the soldier . The French market-gardener is a wonderful fellow . Often rich as Crcesus , he receives you in his earth-stained blouse and wooden shoes . I sought him where I could , and avoided the middleman . We were , in fact , brother artists , for generally he seemed far more interested in growing his leeks , carrots , potatoes , and turnips than in selling them . The middleman or woman has no such idealism but I must except a certain dear old lady who , the moment she knew that the fruit I was buying was for our wounded in the hospitals , suppressed her husband and came down to rock-bottom prices without further palaver . They are wonderfully frank , these Frenchwomen . Madame A ? , whom I called on in quest of bran one morning , received me in her dressing-gown and explained with circumstance that she had taken a purge . I had to be very severe with some of these ladies who were not above using their fine eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ! ' they would say , when one stuck out for a fair market price ; and often one 's unwillingness to lose time , besides being described as dur , was called brutale . They had the leisure to bargain and discuss ; I had not . One singular piece of ' brutality ' on my part consisted in reducing the price of live sheep by a good percentage . I remember going off in triumph to my chief with the great news . To hell with you and your sheep ! ' he cried ; and burst into tears . He had just got word that his only brother and a cousin had been killed at Loos . I enjoyed those months and the many homes I peeped into ; for here in the provinces the Frenchman usually did his business in the middle of his family . Sons , daughters , uncles , aunts , nieces , would all chime in , wine and biscuits would be produced if the affair was one of importance ; yet often I had to retire empty-handed . The prices would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay hands on a sufficient quantity ? The consumption of an army is enormous and staggers the small contractor . How many fortunes might have been made if the material at issue had been available ! And in such buying , the man more deadly than all is the contractor who will promise you everything , but , when it comes to delivery , makes excuses . One had to beware of these opportunists . Even worse was a man I heard of in Greece , who sold the same parcel of hay to the buying departments of three armies , received the money thrice over , and was about to depart with his mistress for the Fortunate Isles , when a brutal embarkation officer discovered him . The main requisite of an officer buying for an army , besides ordinary common sense , is a rather more than ordinary honesty . Half the people he deals with will try to corrupt him , by bribery , by flattery , or means more insidious . And I think , too , that I have been cured , by my experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have had . The average man 's attitude toward the state and its property seems not far removed from my own toward a railway company . Like most people , I have often traveled first-class with a third-class ticket , and felt that the action was rather meritorious than otherwise . The state , too , seems ? especially to the civilian ? fair game and outside the pale of ordinary morality . What is everybody 's business and everybody 's property often seems to be regarded as nobody 's business and nobody 's property . So far I have discussed only the feeding of an army under conditions that are more or less constant . It is , however , when you must deal with an advance , or a retirement , or a retreat , that the problem grows really exciting . Everything is in flux , your railheads may be wiped out , uncertainty dogs you . The supply officer then does the best he can , pushing up stores , following the advance in darkness or in rain , snatching sleep where he can , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his units are scattered ; if he is wise he will keep a smiling face and accept , disappointments and chuckle over his successes . The men have their emergency or iron ration to go on with ? beef , biscuit , oxo cubes , sugar , and tea . Or , in a retreat , he may have to pack his stores and get them away , or even destroy them 566 FEEDING or leave them to the enemy . He has a car in France , a horse elsewhere , so is spared much that discomforts the infantry ; but work hard he has to , often the clock around , keeping his men going , dodging in at an opening , or saving what he can not pass forward . There are compensations , however , even in a retirement , for I have known a supply officer and his sergeant-major hold their end up to good purpose with a mixture of champagne and stout ? hospital comforts salvaged from the advancing enemy . Perhaps the most joyous days of all are those in which your division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In summer , with fine weather and starry nights , there is no trek more exhilarating . The French front is businesslike , and you entrain ; but in Macedonia , where much of my time was spent , you struck camp overnight and were away at dawn . The day 's march was conditioned by the water-supply . You had a good horse , no cares , and saw the sunrise ; your meals were a picnic on the bank of a shallow river ; you slept out under the stars . Once a day , at an arranged spot , you would pick up the division 's food , come up by rail or lorry . Your transport would carry your share of it to an improvised dump ; your men would sort it out in readiness for the battalion convoys . These dealt with , you were free to bathe , to sleep , or , better still , to watch the jeweled dragon-flies . Every shady streamlet was bright with them ? green , blue , red , gray , black , and white , they flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frogs here , with which our French comrades supplemented their rations , and lizards and tortoises , and once or twice I saw the swift passage of a snake . Two , three , or even four days you might trek through a beautiful country where only the squalor of the villages AN ARMY distressed you . Some of them , destroy . ed in earlier wars , were hardly more than a few ruined walls and an empty church ; the Turkish villages were cleaner than the Christian . You would leave the bare , intolerable plains , the marshy lakes , and go up into wooded hills which in some regions are almost Swiss . Macedonia is ever varied , and each changing light or season marks it . The spring is a gorgeous tumult of wild flowers ; the summer withers this carpet and strews it with the black patches of grass-fires ; the winter brings mud  --  mud inconceivable , and a perpetual dewdrop at the end of your cold nose . But one spot I shall never forget . On an August evening we topped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often mentioned in the newspapers , but I am going to take shell-bursts for granted ; also the aeroplanes and dropped bombs . You stand high up ; the lake is a circular sheet of glass below you , the little town with its white minaret tucked away in a corner ; and all the wide valley to your right gives on to mountains that look like the end of the world ? bare , unbroken , and impassable . A wall of iron confronts you , and only miles away you catch at a break in it ? the Rupel Pass , which now guards the road into Bulgaria . You realize then why the Saloniki army has marked time in this sector . But suppose it rains ? Then the rivers that you thought to ford so easily swell to torrents , and you may even be cut off from the men and animals whose mother you are ; or your sugar spoils , your bread gets spongy , your vegetables a pulp . For shelter you have a waterproof sheet supported and pegged down ? it is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but good-fellowship and the habit of the open air make light of a situation that in pre-war days would fill one with forebodings of sciatica , rheumatics , and other damp-bred evils . And very often you strike a friend who will give you a corner of his tent ; and by ' friend ' I often mean a perfect stranger . There is a camaraderie , a heartiness , in the front line that is occasionally to seek in the more sheltered areas . I have dropped down on many unknown hosts . There was H ? , an ex-trooper of the N.W. Mounted Police ; there was G ? , who let me sleep on a pile of blankets in a corner of his mess after a right royal supper , and who gave me a bath in the morning ; and poor C ? , now bombed into the next world , who gave me a stretcher in a tent where mice ( or was it rats ? ) played round me in the dark till I found a couple of boles and so got off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fixed positions , you go buying what extra luxuries the land affords . Macedonia , unlike France , was a very poor country for such diversions . The country is depopulated , its agriculture backward , the Greek-speaking capitalist a difficult customer . The villages I struck seemed to be governed by this potentate , who might keep a wine-shop , and certainly owned the only pair of scales . I found peasants who were only too glad to accept the price I offered them in ready money ; but there was usually a more important fellow , who would interfere , and who had the whole day before him . However , he would collect the hardworking and prematurely aged females of the place and set them to pick beans , collect marrows , watermelons , and cucumbers . When my limbers were full , out came the scales , and Plato would start his argument , which amounted to this . Forty miles away , at Saloniki , beans were fetching 50 lepta an oke ( 5 pounds ) more than I was offering him . // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , ' he grudgingly admitted . Meanwhile my men were weighing the stuff , and I had already settled with the one or two independent growers , who were only too glad to see me and simple enough to show it . I finished with Plato as soon as I knew the weights , and rode away with my men to the dump , rather pleased at getting fresh green stuff for the brigade . To the edge of the village Plato would pursue me . His parting thrust was always , ' What about the sixpence for the Samos you drank when you came in ? ' Samos is a kind of wine made out of figs , and has the merit of being wet . You may have noticed that the wagons that we used to use in France are changed to limbers . On these bad roads and in this hilly country we found that the limber , with its two halves and simple yet tough construction , could go where the wagon failed . I do not know how many parts there are to a wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in winter , and in the more mountainous country , even the limber gave way to the pack-mule , pure and simple . Our first-line transport drivers here were turned into muleteers . I often wished a cinema operator had taken pictures of the convoys as they came winding along , each animal with its load , and a picturesque ruffian to every pair . I would pass them as they crossed our road , they going away into the hills that our wheeled transport could touch only at certain places . But my own journey then was jolly enough , as we climbed upwards on the new-cut highways that Italian engineers had made . I had a sure-footed blue roan , and rode at the head of the column to avoid the choking dust we made . Often-the road was precipitous , and we looked far down into the villages or up at the wooded mountainsides . At the dump we unloaded , then watered and fed the animals ; and I used to stuff figs off the trees that grew here . Other officers strolled or rode or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes ; the hour would go only too quickly . Riding back in the dark , I usually left the horse to pick his way . He could see where I could not , and the old fellow knew that the day 's work was done when we struck homeward . Tired , yet wonderfully fit , one rattled in with one 's convoy ; and before going off to one 's own supper , one first of all saw that the animals were well looked after . We had been out since two P.M. , and now it was past nine . You sleep the peaceful sleep of an angel after such a day . With luck you can lay in till seven ; but maybe you have to take early stables at six . Still , you have no convoy on that day and can get a good nap in the afternoon . III So far I have dwelt mostly on supply-work , but the question of transport is ever involved in it , and is so much a part of it as to need a few pages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , and what not ; but , unless you can move them to the desired point , they might almost as well be nonexistent . In France this problem is now at its simplest . Railways have been doubled and even trebled , good roads are ready to take your motor-traffic and your horse wagons , and there are Decauvilles , where your trolleys can run in strings on narrow rails ; and , last but not least , there are the Labor battalions to mend roads and keep the whole mechanism in order . The matter in France , except when an offensive was working with or against you , presented most of the features of an old estab lished and finely organized business . In Macedonia and Egypt , where I served as well , it is not so easy . There the machine is frequently replaced be the beast of burden , and the transport officer is as often as not a donkey , mule , or camel-driver . Till I went to Saloniki I had known the mule only from hearsay ; ' obstinate as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was yet to gather . The first one I rode ? no pony being available ? was a mouse-colored creature and very docile . We went along together in search of locally grown vegetables , across scorched and barren country , of which the only permanent resident seemed to be the black and yellow tortoise . I came across some French gunners at last , camped in a ruined village . When I mentioned vegetables , they laughed . There was nothing nearer than Kukus , outside the region I was supposed to ransack . They invited one in to have lunch , however , and I remember this particularly well , because one of them was a champagne-grower and a most useful fellow to have in a mess . After lunch the mule and I came to the sandy bed of a dried-up river . Instantly the mule knelt down , and almost as instantly I was off , demanding the why and the wherefore . The mule did not leave me long in doubt . There was sand , and the chance of a good roll . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would and did . I had not previously been aware of this habit . Another mule I had was a confirmed convoy-follower . In company he was all right ; but get him alone on the road , whether I liked it or not , I had to join up with any chance convoy that happened along . He had a mouth like iron and a will to match . I might tug at the snaffle till my hands bled ; the best I could hope for was to make him go round in a circle till that convoy . had FEEDING disappeared . But there were far too many of them ; and after a long and painful morning I said I would rather walk . Thus I acquired Rupert , my first real officer 's charger . ' Rupert was mine all one summer . The dumps we visited , the troops we fed , the long marches we made together ! To be quite frank , Rupert was a greedy beast , with all his passions centred in his tummy . If he ever reads this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy he 'll admit that his sole distraction in life was a good feed . Like his rider , he was middle-aged , and middle age is often the season of gluttony . He was a lazy old beast , too , and as we rode along , I would say , Now if I let you have a whack at yonder maize-field , will you buck up and save me the trouble of kicking you along ? ' He would promise anything , and bite off head after head , until I began to feel sorry for the poor Macedonian we were robbing ; and even then he would reproach me all the way home for not letting him eat up half Macedonia . The only thing that could really set him going was a sharp-set morning , or a cloud of flies worrying the life out of him on a hot day . The poor beggar would try running away from them , and he had a real good trot on these occasions . One other mount of that summer was a chestnut mare , lent me by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not left the lines for three days . I set off gayly , with a loose rein , and she , seeing how matters stood , put her head between her knees and carried me over a few miles of broken country at what seemed a mile a minute , but was probably less . She took any blessed thing in her stride , and where most horses would have broken both our necks , she finished smiling , as if enjoying the blue-and-white funk of her rider . A curious commentary on the // value of evidence is the fact that 111 . N servant , who had started out with us , returned to camp alone , declaring that the mare had bolted with me and that he had actually seen me thrown ; which proves that imagination is far more real than lagging truth . Here in Egypt , or rather on what is now called the Palestine Front , the problem of feeding and watering an army was complicated by the intervening desert . The Sinai Peninsula is 150 miles across , from the Suez Canal side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no railway and next to no water . The Turk was driven back and the railway built , and a pipe-line was laid down bringing Nile water all the way to Palestine . The railway is now connected with existing lines , and from Kantara on the Canal , you can go straight on to Jaffa or Jerusalem . So far so good ; but away from the line , how are you to negotiate the sand , which changes , farther on , to dust ? Someone thought of the camel , and to the camel has been added the donkey . Without the aid of these two quadrupeds , the Turk might still be in Jerusalem . Thirty-five thousand camels , so I am told , were collected , and a legion of donkeys . The latter worked mostly in the hilly country , the camels in the plain . These accompanied the army , driven by Egyptian fellaheen . In a waterless country , they were the very thing , and they could go where wheeled transport was useless . All their equipment was a stout pack-saddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side . These you filled with food or water-cans , and a good camel can take his four hundred pounds . My last job in the field was with the camels and their Egyptian drivers . Speaking no Arabic and knowing the camel only as a beast you see in the Zoo , I was nonplussed at first . However , a wise system gave me a week to get going , during which I lived camel , thought camel , and was completely cut off from all other interests . I learned that the beasts ate only twice a day and drank only every third day ; that they required little grooming , and thought nothing of picking you up with their teeth and shaking the sand out of you . I have never met anyone who liked a camel . He will go on till , literally , he drops dead ? that is the best thing that can be said about him . Socially he is an ill-conditioned churl , and treacherous into the bargain . A mule will save up an honest grudge for months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick ; but a camel will go for you simply because he feels like it . Our Egyptians put up with him and seemed to understand him . I had 75 of them and 150 camels . The men were the best-humored fellows I have ever worked with . They were not much to look at ? so many were cross-eyed or even one-eyed ; but when they stripped and gamboled in the sea , they were well-shaped and muscular enough . And they could sing in a way . The reis , or leader , used to improvise a line , and the rest of the troop would follow with the chorus . A favorite method was to make remarks about their officer , thus : The Reis : The officer is kind and loves us . Chorus : So he is ; so he does . The Reis : He is strong as a lion and fears no foeman . Chorus : So he is ; so he does . The Reis : He is beautiful to look at and gives much backsheesh . Chorus : So he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved by maidens and sings like a nightingale . Chorus : So he is ; so he does . There need be no end to this song , or to the something similar which used to accompany our work in the desert . One plaintive chorus , reminiscent of forced labor and the days of the Pharaohs , ran , ' How many days , how man nights ? ' It was a favorite , and mast have been sung for hundreds of years . The men , in truth , had little to complain about . They were clothed , well-fed , and well paid . Their contract is for six months . I asked one of my three reises what he would do when his time was up . He would go back to his village , he said , and sit in the shade and smoke cigarettes . I can picture him , squatting outside his mud hovel on the Nile , his mind rather a blank , his body comfortable and warm , his women ministering to him . Occasionally he showed symptoms of wanting to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver to the camel often amused me . The man would put his head alongside the beast 's , and drink out of the same trough . I remember one man who preferred a tin can of his own . ' You think you 're too good to drink out of the same trough as your camel , ' the others reproached him ; and of course they had quite an argument . The camel was so much one of themselves that they would curse him as they cursed each other , beginning with the modest son of a dog , ' and ending with ' an al dinale which expresses the speaker 's contempt for the camel 's religion ! I show , perhaps , too great an inclination to linger over my camels and my last days of active service near the firing-line . When the push came that was to end with the defeat of Falkenhayn and the capture of Jerusalem , we old subalterns were weeded out . One seemed rather like a woman who has been made to feel that the days of her beauty are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , who am two years less , were set aside for younger and more damp-resisting bodies . Yet one thing will always stay with me ? the dun sand and the blue sky , and , silhouetted against the blue , the endless lines of camels , dun-colored as the sand . On every sky-line one saw this picture , and never tired of it . Barely it moved , and one might fancy it had stood thus for century on century , since the first caravans had gone out of ancient Egypt into the hills and deserts of Philistia , and away to distant Assyria and the far lands of Hittite kings . I have said nothing of the risks run by your supply and transport men , except that at the base they are negligible , while farther up country , in the early part of the war , a tacit understanding seemed to prevail on either side . In those days , ' Eat and let eat ' was our motto . To-day , however , all that is changed , and aeroplane and high-velocity gun do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport driver . They take their risks , and have not even the satisfaction of answering back . Of course , their dangers are never comparable to those of the infantryman ; but certainly , at Gallipoli , with everything in the open and the beaches continually under shell-fire , they were not far short . At those times many a good man crawled into his forage-dump and envied the infantry in their trenches . I have been bombed from the air , and shelled at very long range . In the latter case , you soon got to learn the line the shells would take , and so you kept outside it ; in the former , I was at one time glad because of my partner . He was one of those overzealous individuals who are forever worrying about nothing . A fair bombing made him realize that he was a soldier , and I admit to having taken a malicious pleasure in watching him contemplate the unpleasant possibility // of a sudden extinction . It used to sober him for quite two days . Just now , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transport men are getting their opportunity . They are all class B men , that is to say , men who are not good enough for the first line ; but they are sticking it like heroes , and taking their convoys up , no matter how broken the roads , how severe the bursts of the big shells and the bombs dropped by the gothas . They get little credit for their work and never a chance to show their mettle in the hand-to-hand of actual conflict ; there are no V.C. 's for them and precious few other distinctions . Still , they are carrying on , and munitions go up , and man and beast are fed ; and if some poor devils are blown to bits , they have at least had a pretty lengthy run for their money . I have no wish to be statistical , and figures are dull reading , but the essence of supply-work is this . Every man you have in the field means about three pounds of food a day , seven days a week and three hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forage a day , and eight pounds more for the big teamsters . You have to collect this material , you have to waste as little of it as you can , you have to carry it and distribute it to perhaps a couple of million mouths ? day after day , week after week , month after month . It is the one job that never ceases . You want honest men for it ? food and forage just now are easily what literary folk would call the bestsellers ' ; you want men who are good at figures ; and , thirdly , you want men who are patient and not afraid of doing to-day as they did yesterday , and the day before , and the day before that .
