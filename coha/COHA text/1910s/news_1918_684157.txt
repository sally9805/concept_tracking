txt Lord Robert Cecil , Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , at a dinner tonight celebrating the conclusion of the deliberations of the Allied Maritime Transport Council in London , made an important announcement respecting the pooling of allied shipping . He also alluded to the pooling of allied food supplies and of allied munitions . Incidentally Lord Robert paid a warm tribute to Walter Hines Page , the retiring American Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , who , he said , had done so much to assist the allied cause . The following are salient passages from the speech of Lord Robert : " The Allied Maritime and Transport Council was established last December at a meeting of all the Allies . It has grown and its organization has been completed , but its central principle remains what it always was , the necessity of allied control for allies supplies . " We have seen lately much to cheer us . That , however , is no reason for diminished effort , but rather for increased effort . Now Is the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As far as the actual fighting is concerned , that is in other hands , and in hands which give us no anxiety . We have profound confidence in our armies and our commanders . " In order to feed our armies , apart from our civil population , we have got to pool all our resources , we must bring together the whole economic strength of our allies . The accomplishment of that task is not so easy . Fighting Under Disadvantage . " In this and many other matters we are fighting under a certain disadvantage . Our enemies have been content to enslave themselves to the German General Staff . That gives them a certain unity of control , a certain perfection of machinery , which it is difficult for us to imitate . For , after all , the essential part of our struggle is that we are free nations , that we claim the right to decide each for ourselves what is necessary in the interests of the general cause in which we are engaged . " That is true . I do not myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its inconveniences it gives us a spiritual strength which ultimately will secure victory for us over the enemy . But if we are to succeed despite our freedom we must be prepared to scrap national prejudice , national sentiment , and even , I would say , national interests . That is essential , if we really propose to make the best use of the strength which we have . " Now , speaking as an Englishman , I am quite confident that some of our allies have suffered more than others . We have not had to undergo the ordeal of invasion . I agree most fully that in many respects the sufferings of France and Italy , not to speak of the smaller allies , such as Belgium , have been greater than our own , greater than those of our friends in America . But that makes all the more necessary the pooling of our resources . If our sacrifices are to be in any degree equal , the only solution is common allied control of all the resources of the Allies . " The key of allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest importance that you should have common allied control of shipping , yet even that can not be made perfect unless you have also full consideration of the allied needs . ' " The principal organization for which we are pressing is control of allied shipping and complete examination and control of allied needs , and also of allied resources to supply those needs . It is the co-ordination of the allied needs and allied resources with allied shipping which would make an overwhelming economic power of the alliance to which we all belong . A Great Deal Accomplished . " We have done a great deal . It is well that everybody should know , even that our enemies should know , how much we have done . The best example of our efforts in the matter of allied need and supply has been the wheat executive . It has done wonderful work . Not many months ago there were many of us who were feeling a deep anxiety about the maintenance of the food supplies of the allied nations . " Now by the efforts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to reach the next harvest . The danger of starvation has been conjured away and much more than that has been accomplished . We have secured the guarantee of a fair distribution of allied resources among the Allies . We have by co-ordinated , allied efforts in this respect saved Immensely in our shipping expenditjires . Each allied country gets its supply from its nearest allied source . Italy gets her supply from India , we get ours from the American continent , and an immense saving in allied shipping has been accomplished . For that great effort there are no two people who are entitled to greater credit than Etienne Clementel , Minister of Commerce of France , and Sir John Beale , President of the Board of Allied Food Controllers . " But our efforts have not stopped there . Quite recently we established the Food Council , which brings together all of the various ? committees engaged in food supply and the consideration of food needs . We also established the Munitions Council , which sits in Paris , and which brings together all of the allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do more in this council than to distribute in the best way possible our shipping resources . The demand is even now greater than the supply . We say with great truth that the submarine attack upon our shipping has been a failure . We can feed our people and we shall go ' on being able to feed our people . We can transport across the sea vast armies to fight the Germans , and submarines are powerless to stop us . " But , admitting all that , rejoicing in all of that , our shipping is not large enough to deal with the whole of the effort that we might make if it were larger . Recently to sneet the German attack we and our other Allies and our American friends made a great effort to transport large numbers of American soldiers to France . We are profoundly grateful to the Americans for all of the gallant efforts they made then . We are Profoundly grateful to our seamen and to our Allies-for all of the efforts they made to transport them . It would be living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us nothing . It cost us a very great deal . It meant a great diminution in imports into this and other allied countries . Ships were , taken from other trades and other work . I will not say they were taken from essential work , because we had got on without it , but they could only be taken from that work by inflicting great hardships and necessities on the people , The Need of Sacrifice . " We have made our sacrifices in this country as other people have made perhaps in a. greater degree in other countries . We do not grudge anything we have done for the common purpose , but I do want to impress upon my hearers that the resources of our shipping are ? strictly limited , and if we wish to strengthen ourselves against the common foe we must continue to endure hardships , every one of us in the allied countries . Every saving means larger armies and an earlier peace . " After all , the hardships we are enduring are as nothing compared to those to which our enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gloat over the hardships inflicted upon the enemy populations , but It is right to remind ourselves from time to time that they who fight in a bad cause have endured for years suffering compared to which ours are light indeed . If they can do that for their cause , surely we can afford to suffer more or less hard- , ships than they for ours . " I am satisfied that we shall not be found wanting . The only thing that is necessary is that we should bind ourselves together to secure the greatest possible result for our effort . We see on the field of battle what magnificent results have followed from the united command . " I do not say it is possible to put the whole economic resources of the Allies under the command of any one man . I am not sure there is such a man in existence , but I do say if we could only bring together in some similar fashion the whole of our economic forces the st:ength of the alliance would be ' prodigiously increased . There must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of our economic effort . That is the cause for which the Allied Maritime Transport ' Council exists . The machinery which we build up in time of war will last , let us hope , beyond the conclusion of the war . This great economic alliance and the machinery we are calling into existence in pursuance of it may be , if we are worthy of our calling , turned to uses of peace . " High Tribute to Page . In proposing a toast to the allied sovereigns and the Presidents of the allied republics , Lord Robert Cecil made the following reference to Ambassador Page : " I trust you will permit me to say one word on a subject which has no direct relation to the toast . We have learned that Mr. Page has been compelled by ill health to resign . It would not be right for me to dwell on the great personal blow that this was to me . A very valued friendship has been interrupted by a cause which must give us all the deepest pain . " Apart ' from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Allies have suffered a great loss in the termination of this great career . It seems a long time ago , in the dim and distant past , when America was not yet a co-belligerent . That time did exist , and very difficult times there were . During that period I remember ; very well feeling how anxious these times were . One felt like a man groping his way along a ridge on a high precipice with a somewhat rocky wall on one side and an abyss on the other . A false step might have brought the whole allied cause to ' destruction . During all that time we had as our guide Mr. Page , who warned us when we were getting too near the abyss and shielded us from the somewhat rocky projections of national feeling and sentiment . And if we avoided disaster , the credit is due very largely to the Ambassador . While he always remained a good American , he always was a very good friend of Great Britain . " Now , thank Heaven , we arc on smoother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfailing tact , good temper , broad wisdom , sympathy , great courage , and insight . When the history of this period comes to be written no small place will be alloteil in the gallery of those who performed tilde part in this great struggle for fr. , edein and justice to that good fellow and great Ambassador , Walter flints Page . " Raymond Stevens , American delegate to the council , responding to the toast , emphasized- that , if the war was fought to a complete victory and if the proper peace was written when victory was achieved , the war might well be worth all of the sacrifices which it coat the world . " We have learned a great deal in the four years of the war about ourselves and about our allies , " Mr. Stevens said . " This war can only be won by complete co-epartion in all its phases of the national activity of the Allies . " This is a matter of utmost difficulty , but it is also a matter of utmost value for the future of the nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get close to each other and to realize their common needs and their sacrifices is the most valuable thing that could happen in international relations , because misunderstandings and frictions occur largely out of ignorance more than out of the natural of mankind . I hope that these bodies we are now building up to exercise joint control over the essential resources of the Allies may ? continue in some form after the war ' and become a part of the machinery to preserve peace .
