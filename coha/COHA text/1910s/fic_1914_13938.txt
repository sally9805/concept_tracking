SCENE .  --  The library of CYRUS MARTIN 'S home in New York City : a very handsome room , in tapestry and dark oak . Doors up left , down left , and down right . Books , chairs , divans , as necessary . Down left is an oak typewriting table with a typewriter on it . It is obviously out of place in the room , and is evidently only a temporary arrangement . Handsome walnut furniture . Mantel set on mantel . Fire dogs and irons in fireplace . All-over carpet . Handsome busts on bookcases . Chandelier and four brackets . Curtains on windows at back . It is seven o'clock in the evening  --  early September . AT RISE : MARY GRAYSON is seated at typewriter . She strums the keys idly and indifferently with one finger . She might hum a turkey-trot , keeping time with a one-finger accompaniment . In a moment JOHNSON , a typical English butler , enters from door upper left . JOHNSON I beg pardon , Miss Grayson . GRAYSON whirling about eagerly.What is it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHNSON No , Miss . GRAYSON But I told you not to interrupt me until he did . JOHNSON I know , Miss , but it 's that Mr. Ambrose Peale again ; he 's called four times . p. 3 GRAYSON Say that Mr. Martin will be back at eight o'clock . JOHNSON Yes , Miss . There 's a lady waiting , too , Miss , to see Mr. Martin Senior . Here 's her card . GRAYSON Mme. la Comtesse de Beaurien . Tell her that Mr. Martin Senior can see no one . JOHNSON I ca n't make her comprehend anything I say . She just sits and waits . GRAYSON Oh , bring her in , then . I 'll make her understand somehow , but , Johnson , do n't fail to let me know the minute young Mr. Martin gets home . JOHNSON going to door up leftYes , Miss . MARY rises from typewriter , takes off her sleeve-protectors and smoothes out her skirt . JOHNSON announcingCountess dee Beauree-en  --  The COUNTESS enters from door upper left . She is a very smart-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner and does not speak a word of English . He exits GRAYSON to COUNTESS.How do you do ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN advancing to her.Mam ' - selle Martin ? p. 4 GRAYSON Oh , no , I 'm Miss Grayson , Mr. Martin 's secretary . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN blankly.Sec-ree-taree ? GRAYSON I 'm sorry , but it 's quite impossible for you to see Mr. Martin . He is confined to the house with a severe attack of gout . If you will write him I will see that he gets your letter . You can address him here instead of the office ; while he is ill I come here every day for the mail . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Pardon , mais je ne comprends pas  --  je ne parle l'anglais . Vous parlez Franais peut-tre ? GRAYSON blankly.You see , Mr. Martin is ill COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Je rpte que je ne parle pas anglais . Mr. Martin est-il ici ? GRAYSON It 's quite useless for you to talk : I do n't understand French . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Un moment , Mam'selle  --  peut-tre je parle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affaires . Je suis riche . Mais on peut toujours tre plus riche . Si je pouvais obtenir l'agence du savon Martin pour la France a serait une belle affaire . Je donnerais cinquante mille francs pour cette agence . Rpter cela M. Martin et je suis sre qu'il me recevra immdiatement . Vous comprenez maintenant  --  p. 5 GRAYSON But I really do n't understand French . Slowly and loudlyMr . Martin is ill  --  sick ! He can see no one  --  you 'll have to go  --  please do  --  COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Mon Dieu ! Vous tes stupide . Sitting down in chair left of tableJ'attendrai M. Martin . GRAYSON There 's no use your sitting down . She goes to herMr . Martin does n't understand French , either . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN C'est bien , c'est bien , mam'selle ; je ne suis pas presse . GRAYSON I do n't understand . Please go  --  She waves her hands COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Ah , laissez-moi donc tranquille  --  vous m'embtez . GRAYSON Oh , dear ! JOHNSON enters JOHNSON Young Mr. Martin 's come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She goes over and makes a wild sweeping gestureMr . Martin is out  --  out . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN with marked accentOut ? p. 6 GRAYSON nodding her headOui  --  COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN rapidly.Oui ? Ah vous parlez Franais ? Je voudrais savoir si Mr. Martin est ici . Je voudrais lui parler tout de suite . GRAYSON Heavens ! She 's off again ; let 's act it for her . Let 's see  --  She points to JOHNSON.That is Mr. Martin . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Eh ? GRAYSON We 're pretending that is Mr. Martin . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN shaking her head.Ah , non , a ce n'est pas M. Martin . GRAYSON We 're pretending  --  see , pretending ? Now , you see  --  Mr. Martin is out  --  see ? JOHNSON exits and enters immediately COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN suddenly.Ah , Mr. Martin n'est pas ici ! Je comprends . GRAYSON Heavens , she understands , Johnson ! Take her by the arm and lead her out . Crosses left JOHNSON starting to do so as COUNTESS rises to go out.Yes , Miss . p. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rentrera-t-il ? She sits again JOHNSON Now what 's the matter ? You 'd better come quietly , Miss  --  He takes her by the arm COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN shaking him off.A quelle heure rentrera-t-il ? There is a blank pause . To MARYMaintenant  --  faites attention votre tour . Regardezmoi : je suis M. Martin , vous comprenez ? Moi je suis M. Martin  --  GRAYSON nodding.Mr . Martin . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN going to door.Mr . Martin n'est pas ici ; il est sorti  --  il est au bureau . Enfin s'il n'est pas au bureau c'est pas mon affaire . Maintenant je voudrais savoir quelle heure rentrera-t-il ? GRAYSON as COUNTESS goes.Heavens , she 's going . She turns at doorShe 's coming back . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN returning to MARY.A quelle heure M. Martin rentrera-t-il ? There is another pause . Suddenly the COUNTESS takes out her watch p. 8 GRAYSON eagerly.Oh , she wants to know when he 'll be in ! She runs over and points to clockEight o'clock  --  eight  --  o'clock . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Oui  --  Oui , huit heures  --  je @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mais je reviendrai . Au revoir . GRAYSON I can understand that ! Au revoir  --  au revoir  --  good night . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN going.Merci  --  merci  --  a huit heures  --  bonsoir  --  bonsoir  --  She exits GRAYSON Do n't let her in here again unless you have an interpreter . JOHNSON Very good , Miss . He exits door upper left MARY primps , and sits at typewriter again , and idly touches the keys with one finger , maintaining an eager watch on the door . She hears someone coming and hastily and busily bangs away at the typewriter . RODNEY MARTIN enters door left . He is a young man of twenty-four with a certain quaint frank charm , in spite of his funny little mustache , English morning coat , spats and white carnation . He is by no means brainless , but simply undeveloped by reason of the kind of life he has led under appallingly frictionless conditions p. 9 RODNEY Miss Grayson ! MARY 'S previous business-air has entirely disappeared , and she assumes the fluttering airs of a timid ingenue , overdoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her GRAYSON What a surprise ! RODNEY goes and locks both doors leftWhy , Mr. Martin what are you doing ? RODNEY coming to her and facing her over back of chair.I want to talk with you . Mary , will you marry me ? GRAYSON Why , really  --  RODNEY You love me , do n't you ? GRAYSON I  --  I do n't know what to say  --  RODNEY Say Yes . GRAYSON shyly.Yes . RODNEY trying to grab her.You angel ! GRAYSON eluding him.Wait ! RODNEY We 'll be married right away . GRAYSON But suppose your father disapproves ? RODNEY He wo n't know anything about it until we 're married , and then what could he do ? p. 10 GRAYSON He might cut you off . RODNEY Would you care ? GRAYSON hastily.I ? No , no , indeed . I was thinking of you , dear . RODNEY Do n't you bother about me . We 'll be married to-morrow , and then come home for the parental blessing . GRAYSON Oh , I could n't do that . It would n't be square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To bring me here to his home and then to find I 'd married his son on the sly  --  we could n't do that . RODNEY You do make it sound rather bad . I would n't want us to give father the worst of it ; we 've always been pretty good friends , he and I. I guess I 'd better tell him  --  in a week or so . GRAYSON Why , Rodney , if you love me , we must get this awful suspense over . RODNEY But suppose he does object ? GRAYSON Even then I would n't give you up . RODNEY Mary ! GRAYSON You could go into business , make a big man of yourself , make me proud of you  --  RODNEY You talk just like the heroine in a play I saw last night . She wanted the hero to go to work , and he did , and then for four acts everybody suffered . p. 11 GRAYSON Do n't you want to work ? RODNEY seriously.I should say not . Imagine going to bed every night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to business . GRAYSON You 'd be happier , would n't you , if you had a job ? RODNEY Please do n't talk like father ; he 's preached a job at me ever since I left college . Why should I work ? Father made millions out of soap and is forever complaining that he 's always had his nose to the grindstone , that he 's worked fourteen hours a day for thirty years , that he 's never known what fun was , and it 's all made him old before his time . I ca n't see the sense of following an example like that  --  I really ca n't . He 's got enough for you , and me , and our children . Yes , and our children 's grandchildren . I 've explained all this to him but I ca n't seem to make him understand . But it 's simple : why work when there 's millions in the family ? And why even talk of money when you and I are in love ? Come , kiss me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He crosses right GRAYSON No , you must n't  --  not till you 've spoken to your father . RODNEY You wo n't kiss me till I tell him ? GRAYSON No. p. 12 RODNEY And you will when I do ? GRAYSON Yes . RODNEY Then I 'll tell him right away . He goes toward door left . She crosses right GRAYSON Oh , Rodney , you 're splendid ! And do n't be afraid . RODNEY Afraid ! Pausing.You do n't think I 'd better wait till the morning ? CYRUS MARTIN knocks at the door violently , and says " ouch " in a loud tone CYRUS off-stage.Why is this door locked ? What the devil does this mean ? GRAYSON If you do n't ask him now , I 'll never marry you . CYRUS off-stage.Open the door . RODNEY Coming , father , coming . He goes and unlocks both doors CYRUS loudly.Ouch , ouch ! The devil ! He entersWhy was that door locked ? RODNEY Was it locked ? CYRUS You young fool , did n't you just unlock it ? Crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone to her typewriter and now begins typing CYRUS Stop that noise ! She does so . RODNEY looks at her , discouraged . She motions to him to go on . Meanwhile MARTIN has painfully limped to a chair down-stage by table and sinks into it . His foot gives him another twingeOuch ! Oh , my poor foot ! RODNEY hastily picks up footstool and comes with it to his father RODNEY I 'm afraid you foot hurts . CYRUS Not at all  --  I just pretend that it does ! RODNEY fervently.I hoped you were better . CYRUS Well , I 'm not . What have you got there ? RODNEY A footstool  --  I thought it might make you more comfortable . CYRUS How much do you want ? RODNEY Why , nothing , father . CYRUS Well anyhow , the answer is not a nickel  --  RODNEY You do me an injustice . I 'm just sorry to see you in pain . CYRUS Well , you want something , that 's certain . p. 14 RODNEY Why do you say that ? CYRUS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have it . RODNEY turns appealingly to MARY . She ignores him . He turns back to his father and tries to muster up his courage RODNEY clearing his throat.Well , as a matter of fact , I did want  --  CYRUS Now we 're getting to it . RODNEY I wanted to have a talk with you  --  an important talk  --  CYRUS Curious ! That 's just what I wanted with you  --  I 've wanted it all day and now we 'll have it  --  Miss Grayson ! GRAYSON Yes , sir ? Rises CYRUS Get out . She exits through door upper left , without noticing RODNEY , who stands looking after her dejectedly . As he hears the door closeNow , what do you mean by overdrawing your allowance again ? RODNEY innocently.What it simply proves is that I was right when I told you my allowance was too small . CYRUS aghast.What ! p. 15 RODNEY And if my allowance is too small for one , it 's much too small for two . CYRUS For two ? RODNEY Father has it ever occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has ! You 're fool enough for anything . RODNEY I do n't consider a man a fool because he 's married . CYRUS That 's because you 've never tried it . RODNEY I intend to try it . CYRUS Who is the girl ? RODNEY nervously.The girl ? CYRUS Yes , girl  --  you 're not going to marry an automobile or a polo pony  --  you 're going to marry a girl , are n't you ? Some blue-eyed , doll-faced , gurgling , fluttering little fool . Oh , why does n't God give young men some sense about women ? RODNEY I object very strongly to your speaking in that way of Miss Grayson . CYRUS Miss Grayson ? Miss Grayson ? You 're not going to marry a typewriter ? RODNEY Yes , sir . CYRUS Does she know it ? RODNEY Yes , sir . p. 16 CYRUS Of course she knows a good thing like you when she sees it ! RODNEY I wo n't listen to you talk of Miss Grayson in that way . CYRUS You 've got to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage ! Thank Heaven , you had sense enough not to elope  --  RODNEY I wanted to , but she would n't . She insisted on your being told , so you see what an injustice  --  CYRUS Injustice ? Ca n't you see that she wished me to know , so that if I disapproved and cut you off , she 'd not be stuck with you on her hands . RODNEY Please , father  --  it 's quite useless . He starts to go CYRUS No , my boy , wait a minute . Remember , I 'm your friend even if I am your father . Rises , goes to door right to ring bell.Do n't you believe it 's only your money she wants ? RODNEY I know it is n't . CYRUS pushing bell.I 'll prove it is . RODNEY What are you going to do ? CYRUS Send for Miss Grayson . RODNEY You sha n't humiliate her . p. 17 JOHNSON entering from door upper left. Yes , sir ? CYRUS Ask Miss Grayson to come here at once . JOHNSON Yes , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you persist in this marriage , I 'll disinherit you ! Then watch her throw you over . RODNEY Even if you are my father , you sha n't insult the girl I love . CYRUS Poppycock ! You 're afraid to put her to the test : you 're afraid she will chuck you . RODNEY quickly.I am not afraid . GRAYSON entering from door upper left. You wanted me , Mr. Martin ? RODNEY going to her , she crosses to center.Mary ! CYRUS Wait a minute . My precious son informs me that you and he intend to marry . GRAYSON timidly.Oh , sir  --  CYRUS And I wish to tell you that if he marries you , he does n't get one penny of my money and that means he 'll starve . p. 18 GRAYSON Then at least we can starve together . They hold hands RODNEY Mary ! CYRUS Making a grand-stand play , eh ? You think I 'm too fond of him not to relent ? Well , you 're wrong . Neither of you can get nickel from me : you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CYRUS What can you do ? You 're not a producer  --  you never will be . Crosses to leftYou 're just an idler . You could n't earn five dollars a week , but you 'll have a chance to try . You 'll get out of my house to-night or I 'll have you thrown out . RODNEY Now , father  --  CYRUS Not another word , sir , not another word ! He kicks chair , and stamps out angrily , thru lower left door RODNEY to MARYIt 's getting more like that play every minute . GRAYSON half cryingOh , Rodney , Rodney , what have I done ? I 'm so  --  so sorry . RODNEY You have n't done anything  --  neither of us has . Father did n't seem to give us a chance to . He did it all  --  p. 19 GRAYSON Oh , Rodney  --  RODNEY You were bully the way you stuck up for me . When you said we 'd starve together , I just choked all up . GRAYSON genuinelyPlease do n't , Rodney . RODNEY Just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there is n't any left , but I 'll show him . I may not have much at the start , but watch my finish . GRAYSON What are you going to do ? RODNEY I 'm going to work . GRAYSON excited : You are  --  really ? Rises RODNEY Yes , indeed  --  father could n't make me do it , but you have . I 'll work for you . GRAYSON Oh , you are splendid . Will you get a position ? RODNEY I should say not ! Work for someone else ? No , sir  --  I 'm going in business for myself  --  for you . I 'm going to show the stuff that 's in me . Of course , we ca n't get married till I 've made good . Will you wait ? GRAYSON shyly.Yes , dear . RODNEY You 're a dandy . p. 20 GRAYSON What business are you going in ? RODNEY I do n't know yet . I 'm going upstairs to pack a suit-case and think . Crosses to rightI 'll be back in fifteen minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRAYSON Oh , oh  --  please  --  RODNEY Do n't mind , Mary . You 'll get used to ' em . Exits door lower right She goes over and raps three times on the door through which MARTIN left , and backs away from it . She stands there expectantly . In a moment MARTIN tiptoes in with no trace of a limp . She puts her fingers to her lips to indicate silence , and points off-stage right to indicate where RODNEY has gone . MARTIN tiptoes nearer , nodding his head , questioning and eager . MARY smilingly nods her head in reply CYRUS in stage-whisper.You mean our scheme worked ? GRAYSON delighted.Yes , yes . CYRUS You really have got him to go to work ? GRAYSON I have ! CYRUS gleefully.By George , that 's great ! p. 21 GRAYSON Is n't it ! CYRUS You 're sure he was n't just talking ? GRAYSON No , he 's gone upstairs to pack and go out and make a name for himself . CYRUS You 're a wise girl . Is n't it wonderful ? GRAYSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said I did n't think you could , but you have , and I owe you $2500 . Crosses to chair left of table to make out check GRAYSON Oh , there 's no hurry . CYRUS Never put off till to-morrow the money you can get to-day . GRAYSON Are n't you proud I 've been so successful ? CYRUS Proud ? I 'm so doggone happy I 'm making this out for $5000 . GRAYSON Oh , Mr. Martin ! CYRUS And it 's worth $50,000 to me to have my boy really want to work , not just to do it to please me . What a difference an incentive makes ! Hands her the check GRAYSON smiling at checkDoes n't it ? CYRUS crosses to left.Especially if it 's a girl . And to think I begged and threatened Rodney for months , and then you plan this scheme , you invent my gout , you rehearse me , you come up here for six short weeks and  --  Bing , you get him so he 's in love with you . p. 22 GRAYSON Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your marriage ? Sits in chair left of table GRAYSON He said he would n't marry me till he 'd made good  --  if I 'd just wait . Sits in chair right of table CYRUS anxiouslyDo you think perhaps he may really love you ? GRAYSON Of course not . CYRUS It 's the first time he 's actually wanted to marry anybody . GRAYSON Oh , it 's just that I 've been very blue-eyed and baby-faced . CYRUS I guess you 're right ! GRAYSON Of course I am . When I break our engagement he may feel sort of lonely for a while and give up women forever , but pretty soon some charming girl of his world will come along  --  some limousine lady , and they 'll live happy ever after . CYRUS I sort of begin to wish this marriage were going to be on the level . GRAYSON It would n't work out . I 'm a business woman . Even if your son did love me  --  really love  --  I would n't marry him . Just now he 's twenty-four with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to snap back . All boys at twenty-four are like that . p. 23 CYRUS reminiscentlyI guess so . I remember when I was a young man , there was a girl my heart was broken for a week  --  perhaps ten days . I went down to the club one night and got spifflicated  --  however , however  --  Abruptly changing the subjectWhat 's my son going to work at ? GRAYSON I do n't know yet . CYRUS Do you think he 'll make good ? GRAYSON He will if he keeps at it . Rises and goes right CYRUS Well , you 'll keep him at it ? Rises and goes right GRAYSON That was n't our agreement . I only undertook to get him to start to work . CYRUS Hum . GRAYSON quickly.Is n't that true ? CYRUS Quite  --  quite . I was just thinking we might make some new agreement to have you keep him on the job . GRAYSON rubbing her fingers as if handling money.I 'm a business woman . CYRUS What strikes you as fair ? GRAYSON I 'd rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say to your present salary , and at the end of the year I will personally give you a check for twenty-five per cent . of what Rodney has made . GRAYSON Oh , that would n't interest me at all . CYRUS What 's your proposition , then ? GRAYSON promptly.My present salary doubled . CYRUS Um  --  that 's pretty steep . GRAYSON You told me what I 'd done already was worth $50,000 to you . CYRUS Merely a figure of speech , my dear . Let 's see , you 're getting $40 a week , and GRAYSON $50 , and I want $100 . CYRUS Sounds like a hold-up . Crosses right GRAYSON Then let 's drop it . This new contract was your idea , not mine . Good-evening . She starts to go , gets to door , which she bangs as if she had gone . She remains however in the room CYRUS Hold on  --  hold on  --  He turns and sees her , and then chuckles at her joke on him . She laughs , tooI was simply figuring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 10 per cent . of what Rodney makes . p. 25 GRAYSON Seventy-five a week and 10 per cent . of what he makes ? All right , I 'll go you . CYRUS Good . GRAYSON goes to desk , takes note-book.Will you just write me a note stating the facts and the consideration ? CYRUS You want it in writing ? Crosses to table right and sits GRAYSON Certainly , it 's always safer that way . He writes . As he writesAs soon as you see Rodney , you 'll have to discharge me . CYRUS I will , violently . I make a pretty good actor under your direction . How did you like that irate father stuff ? GRAYSON Great ! You need n't make the note long . Just a memorandum . CYRUS holding up paper.How 's that ? GRAYSON reading.I think that covers it  --  if you 'll sign it . CYRUS confused.Did n't I sign it ? GRAYSON smiling.No , and never put off till to-morrow what you can sign to-day . p. 26 CYRUS signing.There you are . Hands MARY paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's just one question I 'd like to ask . CYRUS Go ahead , I 'll answer you anything . GRAYSON Why is it , when Rodney 's been out of college for two years , that it 's only the last three months you 've been so persistent about getting him to work ? CYRUS It 's like this . You know old John Clark ? GRAYSON The man you dine with so often ? CYRUS Yes , friends and rivals for thirty years . GRAYSON He 's in Ivory Soap , is n't he ? CYRUS emphatically.I should say he is  --  one of the big men there . We 've fought all our lives over soap , but he 's never been able to lick me , and  --  well , I have n't been able to lick him , either . GRAYSON Perhaps that 's why you 're such good friends . CYRUS Perhaps it is . Anyhow , as it 's fifty-fifty in business , we 've lately narrowed the fight down to a family matter . You know old John Clark has a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young puppy . p. 27 GRAYSON I know , I 've talked to him . CYRUS Well , old Clark thinks Ellery is the prince of all modern business , and he kept pitying me so much about Rodney 's being an idler  --  a rich man 's son  --  it got on my nerves , so lately I made a bet with him . GRAYSON A bet ! CYRUS I bet him thirty thousand dollars my son could make more in a year than his son could . So I had to get Rodney busy , and he 's got to make good . He ca n't be such a pin-head as he looks ! If there 's anything in heredity there must be something of me in him , and we 've got to find it  --  we 've got to develop Rodney , dig deep , maybe blast . If he does n't win out  --  GRAYSON But he will , I 'm sure he will . CYRUS It is n't just the money . I guess I 'm a sentimental old fool , but I 'm proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just Cyrus Martin 's son , and I want to show old Clark that as a judge of character he 's a bigger fool than I am . If I do n't get that bet  --  GRAYSON But you 're going to , I 'm sure you are . CYRUS By George , Miss Grayson , if I were n't a bit old and on the shelf , I 'd marry you myself . You and I could clean up all the loose change in America . RODNEY enters right . MARTIN , seeing him , changes his whole attitude . RisesI do n't care to discuss the matter further , Miss Grayson : consider yourself discharged . Good evening . Crosses to left p. 28 RODNEY It 's all right , Mary . You can have a job in my office . Crosses to center CYRUS scornfully.Your office , ha ! SuddenlyOh , my foot , my poor foot ! He limps painfully towards doorYour office ! It 's a joke , young man ! RODNEY Oh , you need n't laugh ! I 'll show you . Crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , my poor foot ! He exits GRAYSON Oh , Rodney ! Sits on sofa RODNEY goes up-stage , and passes behind sofa so that he is at the right end of sofa RODNEY Gout 's an awful thing , is n't it ? Sits on sofa GRAYSON Oh , Rodney , I 'm afraid I 've spoiled everything for you  --  your future  --  RODNEY Nonesense , you 've made my future . Without you , I 'd never have got the idea , the big idea . GRAYSON Idea for what ? RODNEY The idea to make money out of ; that 's all you need . And , just think , I found it in this book . p. 29 GRAYSON What idea ? What book ? RODNEY It 's a cook-book . GRAYSON What on earth  --  ? RODNEY Well , you see , when I was packing I stumbled across this book ; it fell open at this page  --  fate was on the job  --  it was a hunch . Look ! GRAYSON looking.But what is it ? RODNEY It 's an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the cheapest soap in the world . Cheaper even than the manufacturers make it . I 'm going into the soap business . GRAYSON amazed.What ? RODNEY Sure . Father did ; look at the money he made . Why should n't I ? GRAYSON rises , goes left. You 're joking . RODNEY I 'm in dead earnest . I 'm going to buck the trust . Rises GRAYSON But how can you ? RODNEY I do n't know , but I will . You see , I 'll have all the popular sympathy : independent young son of soapking fights father ; do n't buy from the trust . GRAYSON But is that very nice to your father ? p. 30 RODNEY Has he been nice to me ? It 's great ! Down with monopoly ! Hurrah for the people ! I 've heard political speeches like that . Hurrah for the people 's soap ! That is n't a bad name , either . The People 's Soap . Lays book on table GRAYSON But you have n't any capital . RODNEY dejected.I never thought of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODNEY bracing up . Well , I 'll have to get it , that 's all , and you 'll be my secretary . Of course , till I make big money I would n't ordinarily have thought of taking , you away from father  --  but as long as he discharged you  --  well , you work for me now . What does father pay you ? GRAYSON Fifty dollars a week . RODNEY I 'll pay you a hundred and fifty . GRAYSON But you have n't any money . JOHNSON enters from door upper left JOHNSON Beg pardon , Mr. Rodney , but Mr. Ambrose Peale is here to see you . GRAYSON For the fifth time  --  RODNEY puzzled.Ambrose Peale ? Oh , yes , I remember . Ask him to come in. p. 31 JOHNSON Yes , sir . He exits door upper left GRAYSON Who is he ? RODNEY He 's got something to do with the theater . When I was in Harvard two years ago I met him one night in the lobby of the theater . I have n't seen him since  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You and Mr. Peale ? RODNEY No , no , the fellows threw eggs at the people on the stage . You see , it was a college play  --  GRAYSON Did you throw eggs ? RODNEY I forgot to bring any . Peale was the manager of the show and was mighty decent to me  --  kept me out of jail . PEALE enters from door upper left PEALE Well , well , Rodney Martin , how are you ? To MARYHow are you , dear lady ? RODNEY How do you do ? Miss Grayson  --  Mr. Ambrose Peale . PEALE Ambrose Peale  --  that 's me absolutely . Well , I 'm still in the show business . To MARYEver see " The Belle of Broadway " ? Great show , great girls , great cast . GRAYSON Oh , are you an actor ? p. 32 PEALE scornfully.An actor ? I should say not . I 'm a press-agent . GRAYSON Oh ! PEALE But , say , be sure to catch that show ; it may leave the city soon  --  out-of-town bookings , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway . " And now if you 'll excuse me , Miss , I came to talk business with Mr. Martin . RODNEY Business ? Surely  --  surely . Winking at MARYI 'm a business man  --  now . GRAYSON I 'll be back in a few minutes . RODNEY Thank you , Miss Grayson . She exits door lower right PEALE Now , I 'm not much on handing myself flowers across the footlights , but do you happen to remember what I did for you the night of the egg fight ? RODNEY You fixed things with the chief of police and kept me from being expelled . PEALE By George , you do remember . And you said any time you could do anything for me  --  RODNEY That 's still true . PEALE You 're immense , son . Now , it 's this way  --  have a chair . He sits . RODNEY does likewiseBetween you and me , " The Belle of Broadway " is an awful thing  --  business gone to pot . Something 's got to be done . Some great stuff pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you come in. p. 33 RODNEY I ? PEALE You 've got an aeroplane , have n't you ? RODNEY Yes , but  --  PEALE Then everything 's all right . Now you abduct the leading lady , Julia Clark , to-morrow night , in your aeroplane  --  elope with her  --  RODNEY What ? PEALE Sure  --  some stunt , too  --  never been done . Julia 'll stand for it  --  she 's game for any press gag  --  RODNEY But I could n't do that . PEALE Certainly you can . I 'm telling you Julia 'll stand for it  --  a bird of a story  --  no performance . Why ? You 're up in the air with the leading lady . The next night standing room only to catch a look at the girl you 're stuck on . I can see the headlines now : Soap King 's Son Takes New Star Among the Stars  --  with flashlights . RODNEY But it 's out of the question . Rises , takes chair to table PEALE What 's the matter with it ? RODNEY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gee , that 's tough ! RODNEY I 'm not backing down  --  anything in reason , but you see , there 's someone who might object . p. 34 PEALE A girl ? RODNEY nodsHer ? Pointing to where MARY exited RODNEY Yes . PEALE rises and puts chair back. I guess it 's cold : girls are funny about their beaux doing a little innocent thing like eloping with some other girl . RODNEY Why do n't you try somebody else ? PEALE I have ! You were my last card . Well , I 'm fired ! RODNEY Fired ? PEALE Sure , that stunt would have kept us going , but now , on the level  --  well , the show 's so bad , people wo n't even go see it on a pass . We 'll close Saturday and I 'm out  --  RODNEY A fake story like that would really have helped ? PEALE Helped a whole lot : given us a fresh start , and then I 'd have pulled off some new stunts and saved my job . RODNEY Oh , nonsense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at not being able to oblige you , but an obvious trumped-up lie like that ca n't be any good . PEALE It ca n't , eh ? RODNEY Oh , I know it 's advertising  --  p. 35 PEALE You bet it 's advertising . What made Anna Held ? Milk baths . What made Gaby Deslys ? A dago king . RODNEY But that kind of advertising ca n't be of real value . Sits PEALE Oh , you 're one of those guys who do n't believe in advertising , are you ? Now , do n't get me talking advertising . That 's where I live , where I have my town house and country estate , my yacht and motors . That 's my home . Maybe you think love is important ? Piffle . Advertising , my boy , the power of suggestion , the psychology of print ; say a thing often enough and hard enough and the other chap 'll not only believe you , he 'll think it 's his own idea , and he 'll fight for it . Some old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls the other day two samples of satin , one blue , one pink , same grade , same value , same artistic worth . One he described as a delicate warm old rose , the other a faded blue . He asked them to choose their favorite . Thirty-nine out of the forty picked the old rose . Why ? Because they 'd been told it was warm and delicate ; no faded blue for theirs ! What did it ? The power of suggestion  --  advertising ! RODNEY amused.You seem to know something about it  --  PEALE I not only seem to , I do . You heard me tell that girl of yours a few minutes ago that " The Belle of Broadway " was the biggest hit in town . Ask her to go to the theater . Give her her choice and I 'll bet you four dollars to a fried egg she picks " The Belle of Broadway . " Advertising ! p. 36 RODNEY I do n't believe it . PEALE Well , try it  --  and say , what makes you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what you 've read about the play or what some fellows told you . RODNEY beginning to be convinced.Why , I suppose that 's true . PEALE And what he tells you , some other guy has told him . Ninety-seven per cent . of the public believe what they 're told , and what they 're told is what the other chap 's been told  --  and the fellow who told him read it somewhere . When you see a thing in print about something you do n't really know anything about , you come pretty near believing it . And all the advertiser has to do is to tell you right and you 'll fall . RODNEY But I never read advertisements . PEALE Oh , you do n't , eh ? I guess you do . If I say His Master 's Voice , you know that advertises a phonograph . You 're on to what soap " It Floats " refers to . There 's a Reason  --  Uneeda  --  Quaker Oats  --  Phoebe Show  --  Children Cry For It  --  Sapolio  --  Grape Nuts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrow  --  57 Varieties  --  Kodak  --  White Seal  --  Gold Dust Twins  --  He Wo n't Be Happy Till He Gets It  --  Bull Durham  --  Pianola  --  Cuticura  --  Melachrino  --  Clysmic  --  Goodyear  --  Steinway  --  Thermos  --  Coca-Cola  --  The Watch that Made The Dollar Famous . I suppose you do n't know what any of them mean ? p. 37 RODNEY amused.Why , I know what they all mean . PEALE You bet you do . What kind of garters do you wear ? RODNEY Why , let me see : Boston . PEALE Exactly . What do you know about ' em ? Nothing . Are they any better than any other garter ? You do n't know  --  I do n't know  --  but all my life , every magazine I 've ever looked into has had a picture of a man 's leg with a certain kind of garter on it  --  Boston  --  so when I go into a store to buy a pair of garters I just naturally say Boston ; so do you . What do you know about Mennen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture of the homeliest man in the world on the box and it 's so impressed your imagination , you just mechanically order Mennen 's . If I say to you , E. &amp; W. , you do n't think it 's a corset , do you ? If I say C. B. , you do n't think it 's a collar , and what about the well-known and justly famous B. V. D. 's ? You do n't read advertisement ? Rot ! RODNEY But  --  PEALE No but about it : adververtising 's responsible for everything . When a department store advertises a seven-dollar shirt-waist for four dollars , you do n't believe it 's on the level , do you ? RODNEY No , I don't. p. 38 PEALE Neither do I , but there 's a hell of a lot of women who do . When Bryan advertised the Grape Juice Highlball , do you know that its sale went up 652 gallons a day ? RODNEY How do you know it was 652 ? PEALE I 'll let you into a little secret : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about grape juice , and as long as my health and strength keep up , I hope I never will , but if I said I 'd read in a newspaper that the sale had gone up 652 gallons , you would n't have doubted it , would you ? RODNEY No , I suppose I would n't . PEALE And you 'd have told somebody else and he 'd have believed you , too . Say , do you drink much ? RODNEY No . PEALE Can you tell the difference between a vintage wine and last year 's champagne ? Sure , you can : it costs more . Son , the world is full of bunk . Ninety-seven per cent . of the people are sheep , and you can get ' em all by advertising . RODNEY You are gradually making me come to the conclusion that you believe in publicity . PEALE Believe in it ! It 's my life . What kind of eggs do you eat ? RODNEY Why , hen 's eggs , of course . p. 39 PEALE Why " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg ? RODNEY Why , no . PEALE Do you know anything against the duck ? RODNEY No . PEALE Exactly . When a duck lays an egg it 's a damn fool and keeps quiet about it , but when a hen does , my boy  --  cluck-cluck all over the place ! She 's advertising . So you eat hen 's eggs . RODNEY You 're beginning to convince me . PEALE If I 'm beginning to convince you , that 's advertising , too . Say , are you for Roosevelt or against him ? RODNEY I 'm for him strong . PEALE I 'm against him . I read one paper , you read another . I think he 's a faker , you think he 's a great man . But does either of us really know anything about him except what we 've read ? Have you ever met Roosevelt or talked to him or known anybody who did know him ? I have n't , but the point is , whatever we may think , good or bad , we 've heard a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . And that , my son , is the whole secret of it : get ' em talking about you , get ' em praisin ' if you can , or get ' em cussin ' , but for the love of Heaven , do n't let ' em be quiet . Mention your name  --  have ' em argue about you  --  boost or knock  --  be a hero or a villain , but do n't be a dub . Why , give me the money , a little time , a few pages of advertising , and I can sell you shares in the Atlantic Ocean ! p. 40 RODNEY excited.You really believe that with proper advertising you could build up a great business ? PEALE Believe ! Look around you : everything 's doing it . RODNEY And you are out of a job . PEALE Unless you do the aeroelopement . RODNEY rises.Then you 're out of it . Do you want to work for me ? PEALE Sure . RODNEY When can you begin ? PEALE Now . RODNEY What 's your salary ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth $75 . RODNEY I 'll give you a hundred . PEALE What is your business ? Counterfeiting ? RODNEY No , it 's  --  PEALE Do n't tell me . As long as it do n't send me to state 's prison or the chair , it 's all right . Could have about $25 advance on my salary now ? RODNEY Is that customary ? PEALE It is with me . RODNEY Oh , all right . He gives him the money p. 41 PEALE Just as an evidence of good faith . He counts moneyWell , now I 'm working for you , what business are you in ? RODNEY The soap business . PEALE grinning.Nice clean business . With father ? RODNEY Against him ! PEALE Oh ! RODNEY My father and I have had a quarrel . PEALE I know , I know : fathers are very unreasonable these days . RODNEY I 'm going to fight the soap trust . PEALE Well , you 're no piker . You 've picked out a nice refined job . How long have you been at it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODNEY Fine , since I got an idea from you . PEALE They grow all over me  --  help yourself . RODNEY I 'm going to get a factory , advertise like the very dickens : Soap King 's son fights father  --  and licks him , too , by George ! PEALE Wait a minute , wait a minute , do you know why your father is the soap king ? p. 42 RODNEY I suppose because he controls all the soap business in the country except Ivory . PEALE Exactly , and the way he keeps control of it is by buying out all his live competitors . Now , here 's a blue-ribbon champion of the world scheme . Why do n't we make good and sell out to father ? RODNEY No , I do n't care to do that . I want to make good myself . PEALE Well , if father is forced to buy you out , is n't that enough ? What do you want ? RODNEY I 've got to be a success on my own . I 've got to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Making good with the dame , eh ? RODNEY You see , father says I ca n't earn five dollars a week . PEALE He is n't right , is he ? RODNEY No , sir , you 'll see . PEALE I hope so . Pretty tough if you could n't . Some job trying to sell soap if father 's against us . RODNEY I suppose it is . PEALE I tell you : why not make such a hit with the soap , advertise it so strong , he 'll just have to back you ? p. 43 RODNEY Now that 's settled , we 're going to lick father . PEALE Yes , that 's settled . What do I do ? RODNEY You write the ads that make us . PEALE It 's my chance . Think , I 'll never have to see " The Belle of Broadway " again ! I 'll write ads , I 'll conduct a campaign that 'll keep your father awake , and in three months at the most he 'll be begging for a chance to back us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , come on . Let 's get busy . What 's the name of the soap ? RODNEY It has n't been named . PEALE Well , what is there about it that makes it different from any other soap ? RODNEY I do n't know . PEALE Well , what could there be about some soap that was different from some other soap ? RODNEY Well , let 's see . PEALE Where did you get it from ? RODNEY From this cook-book . PEALE Are you kidding me ? RODNEY No . Half an hour ago I decided to go into business , and I happened to find this recipe for soap in a cook-book  --  it 's the cheapest soap in the world . ReflectingThat 's not a bad title : the cheapest soap in the world . A pause . They reflect p. 44 PEALE You 're wrong , son . There 's an awful bunch of people that buy a lot of expensive stuff , not because it 's better , but because it costs more  --  and the poor nuts think it ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODNEY Well , how about The Most Expensive Soap in the World ? PEALE My boy , I could kiss you . A pupil after my own heart  --  fifty cents a cake . RODNEY A dollar , and we 'll make it a warm delicate old rose . PEALE Each cake in a separate box with a paper rose on the lid . RODNEY Great . PEALE But what 'll we call it ? RODNEY Old Rose . PEALE Rotten  --  does n't mean anything . RODNEY Let 's think . PEALE I am thinking . I never stop . RODNEY The Soap that Made Pittsburg Clean . PEALE Too long , and no good anyway , because Pittsburg is n't clean . You need something catchy . RODNEY I had an idea a while ago : The People 's Soap . PEALE Not if you 're going to catch the rich boobs. p. 45 RODNEY That 's true . PEALE We need something that 's universally appealing . What is it ? What is it ? RODNEY looking off-stage toward where MARY went.Love . PEALE Slush . RODNEY Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's superstitious . RODNEY Rot ! I 'm not . PEALE I say , there 's a bit of luck for us right at the start  --  a pin with the head toward you . RODNEY stoops to pick it upSee , you were going to pick it up ! Everybody is superstitious . Oh , they say they 're not , just as you did , but did you ever meet a guy who , if he did n't mind walking under a ladder , did n't hate to spill salt , or else he wanted to see the moon over his right shoulder  --  or he picked up pins , or carried a lucky coin , would n't do things on Friday ? Why , the whole world 's superstitious . Get something on that and you hit everybody . I 've got eighty-six horseshoes home myself . I never saw a gink that would sit thirteen at table . We 're all crazy . They pause and think . They both sit on end of table RODNEY Could we  --  ? p. 46 PEALE What ? RODNEY No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PEALE No  --  Pause RODNEY Wait ! Wait  --  listen ! The Thirteen Soap  --  Unlucky for Dirt . PEALE coming over and kissing RODNEY on the brow.Son , it 's all over : the old man 'll be on his knees in a month . RODNEY We open the office Monday . PEALE Where 's the office ? RODNEY Let 's get one . PEALE With furniture and everything . Say  --  MARY enters from door lower right . Seeing herThere 's the dame ; ask her to go to the theater , just to prove what I say . See for yourself . He goes up-stage RODNEY turning to her. Oh , Mary , to celebrate , let 's go to the theater to-morrow night ? GRAYSON I 'd love to . RODNEY What do you want to see ? p. 47 GRAYSON I hear " The Belle of Broadway " is very good . PEALE yawns and stretches out his arms complacently PEALE to RODNEY.I guess I do n't know about advertising , eh ? To MARYMy last official act is giving you a box for to-morrow night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that play , are n't you ? PEALE I am . Handing her passEr  --  I was . GRAYSON But is n't it an imposition ? PEALE Not on us , it is n't . GRAYSON Thank you . Crosses to RODNEY . To RODNEYI did n't mean to bother you , but I 'm so interested : I thought , regarding Mr. Peale 's business , I 'd like to hear  --  RODNEY It 's all settled , Mary . Mr. Peale , my general manager . Mr. Peale , my secretary . Mary , here it is : The Thirteen Soap  --  Unlucky for Dirt : The Most Expensive Soap in the World . GRAYSON genuinely.Why , that 's perfectly wonderful  --  who thought of it ? Looking at PEALE p. 48 RODNEY I did . GRAYSON turning to him.You did , really ? Why , you 're splendid . PEALE Youth , brains , efficiency  --  that 's our motto . RODNEY We 'll make a hundred thousand dollars the first year  --  sure . GRAYSON reflectively.And ten per cent . of that is  --  RODNEY What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuring . RODNEY We 're going to make our soap famous by advertising , and then force father to back us . GRAYSON That sounds bully , and at the start you wo n't need much capital . RODNEY Capital ? PEALE With fifty thousand dollars I can make the Great American People have hysterics for the Thirteen Soap . RODNEY Fifty thousand dollars , and I 've got only a thousand . Oh ! Sits on chair right of desk GRAYSON Oh ! Sitting on sofa PEALE sitting in arm-chair left of table.But ca n't you raise it ? p. 49 RODNEY to PEALE.How ? PEALE Do n't ask me . Raising money is the only thing I never got on to  --  RODNEY Peale , you 're fired . PEALE Well , it was a good job while it lasted . RODNEY rises.Gimme back that $25 . PEALE rises , takes out money and returns it to RODNEY.Good-bye , old pal . GRAYSON rises , and comes down-stage between RODNEY and PEALE.But could n't you start with less ? RODNEY Of course we could . Could n't we , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use wasting money piking when you advertise . Splurge , my lad , splurge or let it remain dormant . RODNEY I 've got a thousand in the bank ; the aeroplane 's worth four  --  it cost eight . PEALE Then if you 're lucky it might sell for two . RODNEY The motors ought to bring another four . That 'd be seven , is n't that something ? PEALE Seven thousand is not to be spoken of venomously , but in advertising  --  well , going easy , it might last you a week . p. 50 GRAYSON I have a  --  PEALE Some money ? RODNEY We could n't take money from you . GRAYSON No , I know a  --  a man that might put in five thousand . RODNEY That 's twelve . PEALE suddenly.Does your father advertise much ? RODNEY I do n't think so ; does he , Mary ? GRAYSON Not very much : he 's conservative . He does n't believe in reckless advertising . PEALE Nothing sensational or exciting ? GRAYSON No . PEALE Why , he 's licked now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertise just for your father 's benefit alone . RODNEY I do n't quite understand your plan ? PEALE Why , plaster this neighborhood with Thirteen Soap advertisements . Do the same around your father 's office so that every time he went out or came in he 'd see Thirteen Soap . We could advertise only in the newspapers he reads . We 'd send him circulars every mail . I could make a splurge just for him that would look like we were giving up $10,000 a day . Within a month he 'd think that Thirteen Soap was the only soap in the world . p. 51 RODNEY How much would it take ? PEALE Five thousand a week . RODNEY And you could land him in a month . PEALE My boy ! RODNEY And we 've got one thousand  --  all cash , and eleven thousand in prospects . Go ahead . PEALE You mean I 'm hired again ? RODNEY Sure you are . PEALE Gim me back that $25 . RODNEY giving it back.Certainly . PEALE The best thing you ever did was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . PEALE With your money and my ideas , I 'll be a millionaire . RODNEY Well , I hope I will , too . GRAYSON Me , too . JOHNSON entering from door upper left.Countess de Beou  --  ree  --  enn . GRAYSON Oh , that dreadful woman again . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN entering and coming over to RODNEY . To RODNEY.Vous tes M. Martin ? p. 52 RODNEY nods.Yes . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Ah , cher M. Martin  --  je suis enchante de vous voir . PEALE The dame 's looney . GRAYSON No , she 's French . PEALE Same thing . RODNEY What 's all this , anyhow ? GRAYSON She wanted to see your father , and she does n't speak English . RODNEY Well , let her speak to me . Fire ahead . PEALE Say , can you speak French ? GRAYSON surprised.Can you ? RODNEY No , but I can understand it . Going to COUNTESSFire ahead . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Eh ? RODNEY Let me see  --  oh , yes . Parlez .

Je voudrais obtenir l'agence du Savon Martin pour la France . RODNEY Wait a minute  --  wait a minute . GRAYSON What did she say ? PEALE She 's a speedy spieler all right . RODNEY to COUNTESS.Would you mind saying that over and say it slow ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Comment ? RODNEY Oh . Rptez a s'il vous plait  --  pas vite . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Je suis Madame la Comtesse de Beaurien . Je dsire obtenir l'agence du Savon Martin pour la France . Je peux donner cinquante mille francs pour cette agence .

To PEALEShe wants the agency for father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ francs for the concession . p. 54 PEALE How much is that in money ? RODNEY Ten thousand dollars . GRAYSON Had I better tell your father ? Goes to door lower left RODNEY inspired . Crosses to MARY.No , no , why not keep father out of this ? We 'll sell her the agency for the Thirteen Soap  --  that 'd be another $10,000 for us . Peale , she 's a gift from the gods ! Goes to COUNTESS PEALE She is . Go to it . GRAYSON But how can you sell her your agency ? RODNEY I do n't know  --  how can I ? PEALE A pipe . Ask her if she 's superstitious ? RODNEY Oh , if I only knew how to talk French !  --  Madame  --  tes vous superstitious ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Eh ? RODNEY I mean  --  superstitieuse ? COUNTESS looks blank PEALE She does n't get you . RODNEY No . PEALE he goes and takes the COUNTESS ' parasol.Pardon me . Starts to raise it . With a cry of protest : " Faites pas a , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To herIt ought to be a pipe to land you . p. 55 RODNEY Listen : je suis le fils de Museer Martin  --  vous savez ?

RODNEY Oh , yes ,  --  sal  --  pas bon pour sal  --  COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN laughing.Savon Treize  --  pas bon pour sal  --  c'est bien  --  - c'est bien . PEALE gleefully.She likes it  --  she likes it . RODNEY Je start  --  je begin  --  je commence  --  un nouveau compagnie  --  le trs grande compagnie de la universe  --  je suis le president . p. 56 PEALE Je suis le advertising agent . After laugh , JOHNSON enters from door upper left with a letter , and exits door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and if we can do business with you for the French agency  --  MARIE enters COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Mais non , mais non , mais non , monsieur , je ne comprends pas . MARIE I beg pardon . GRAYSON What is it , Marie ? MARIE in French dialect.Where is M. Martin ? RODNEY Marie ! Another gift from Heaven . MARIE Mr. Smith to see your father . RODNEY That 's a man I might get money from . JOHNSON enters from door lower leftHe 's a great friend of the family . Used to dangle me on his knee , and all that sort of thing . He sees JOHNSONOh , Johnson . JOHNSON Yes , sir ? RODNEY Mr. Smith is downstairs  --  in one minute bring him up here . JOHNSON Yes , sir . He exits door upper left p. 57 RODNEY Now , Marie , tell the Countess you speak French . MARIE Je parle Franais , Madame . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Mon Dieu  --  enfin quelqu'un qui parle Franais !

They talk together violently in French , and at the end of the speech , the COUNTESS kisses MARIE RODNEY Mary , take them away  --  take them into the library . Explain to Marie about the agency  --  Mary can translate your slang to Marie and she can turn it into French . GRAYSON I 'll do my best . Come , Marie . Crosses to door lower right , and opens itBring the Countess . MARIE Madame la Comtesse , je vous montrai le chemin  --  COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Bien . MARIE and COUNTESS , chattering volubly in French , followed by MARY , exit door lower right p. 58 PEALE looking after them.Paris must be a hell of a place .

SMITH laughing uproariously.You 've done what ? RODNEY I 'm a business man . p. 59 SMITH That 's the funniest thing I ever heard of . RODNEY What 's funny about it ? SMITH You in business ! He laughs again RODNEY And as a business man I 'd like to talk to you regarding a very interesting business proposition in which I am now interested . SMITH Nothing doing . RODNEY gulping.I thought I 'd like to borrow ten  --  say a few thousand dollars . SMITH No . RODNEY Perhaps five thousand . SMITH If it was a new club or some tomfoolery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business  --  it 'd be just throwing it away . Why do n't you get your father to back you ? RODNEY Father and I do n't agree on the value of advertising . SMITH Oh , that 's it , and you expect me to do what your father wo n't ? RODNEY Well , I thought as a friend of the family  --  SMITH You were wrong . Where is your father ? RODNEY In there , I guess . Indicating door lower left p. 60 SMITH I 'll bet he 'll think this as funny as I do . He exits left . RODNEY sinks down dejectedly into a chair . PEALE enters with contracts PEALE Well ? RODNEY rises.He would n't give me a cent . PEALE He would n't ? Well , he sounds like your father 's oldest friend . RODNEY What about the Countess ? PEALE proudly.I got her . RODNEY You did ? $10,000 ? PEALE Fifteen thousand . RODNEY Holy jumping Jupiter . PEALE Pretty good , what ? RODNEY Good ? Why  --  why  --  I 'll have to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

PEALE Coming now . Sign the contract . RODNEY Sure , I 'll sign anything  --  I 'll sign it twice . Signs PEALE You know , this has got the show business beat a mile .

RODNEY That 's all right  --  you need n't go , Mary . Mr. Smith , this is the future Mrs. Martin . SMITH crosses to MARY.You do n't say so ? Well , well , a thousand congratulations ! RODNEY I suppose you and father had your laugh ? SMITH No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyhow . p. 62 SMITH Of course , it sounded funny to me at first , but when I thought things over , after all , why should n't you be a success in business ? RODNEY amazed.What ? SMITH You have been in everything else you 've tried . RODNEY Yes , yes , certainly  --  sure . SMITH Of course , you have n't tried much . But as you said , I am an old friend  --  and I figured if you gave me your word that you 'd return the money within a year  --  perhaps after all it would only be the act of an old friend to take a chance . That 's what friends are for . RODNEY Why , that 's simply great of you , by George ! SMITH How much was it you wanted ? MARY holds up fingers of both hands RODNEY promptly.Ten thousand dollars . SMITH But , did n't you say  --  ? RODNEY Oh , I 'm sure I said $10,000 ,  --  that 's the very least . SMITH Um  --  well I 'll mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply a her . She stops p. 63 RODNEY enthusiastically.I 'll never forget it . I tell you , old friends do count . Thanks , thanks . SMITH embarrassed.That 's all right  --  do n't thank me . Good-night , Miss Grayson , and I hope you 'll be very happy . GRAYSON Good-night . RODNEY Good-night . Good-night . SMITH exits door upper left . At door , calling after him Oh , Mr. Smith , have you your car with you ? SMITH off-stage.Yes . RODNEY Well , tell the chauffeur to drive slow and careful . RODNEY grabs MARY by her two hands and dances around excitedlyTen thousand  --  and he lent it to me . Oh , is n't it great ? He kisses herWait till I tell Peale . Exit door right COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN off-stage , to RODNEY.Oh , Monsieur , c'est une affaire magnifique . She enters , followed by MARIE - to MARIEJe vous remercie , Marie , de ce que vous avez fait . Ah , les Amricains ce sont des gens d'affaires superbes mais les dames  --  oh , l , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper left p. 64 GRAYSON to MARIE.What did she say ? MARIE She said the American men are splendid but the women were crazy and they could all go to hell . Exits door upper left GRAYSON Oh ! She goes over and knocks three times at door left CYRUS entering.Well , how goes it ? GRAYSON Oh , Mr. Martin , he 's perfectly splendid . So full of energy , hustle and ideas . He 's a different man already . You were right : he only needed development . CYRUS Good ! Good ! You 're not saying this to flatter an old man 's vanity ? GRAYSON Indeed , I 'm not . We wo n't have to blast . CYRUS shrewdly.Would you rather take a guarantee of $2500 additional and give up that 10 per cent . of his profits ? GRAYSON I should say not . CYRUS You know , Miss Grayson , you 're making me believe we 'll win that $30,000 from old John Clark . Crosses down right GRAYSON Oh , indeed we will : you should have just seen Rodney borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 65 CYRUS smiling.Oh , that was my money . GRAYSON What ? CYRUS When Smith told me Rodney tried to touch him  --  well , I thought the least I could do was to back my son , so I sent Smith to make good with him . GRAYSON That was nice of you . RODNEY enters from door right , with dress-suit case CYRUS Well , I owed the boy a chance , anyhow . Seeing RODNEY , turns to him , crosslySo you 're still here , are you ? RODNEY Yes , sir , but I 'm going . Come , Mary . Crosses to MARY CYRUS Really going into business , eh ? Well , when you fail , do n't come sniveling back here ! You ca n't count on a dollar from me . RODNEY I wo n't snivel  --  and I do n't want your money . I do n't need it . Why , I 'd have gone to work long ago if I 'd known how easy it is to raise $10,000 . CYRUS grinning at MARY.You would , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RODNEY The soap business . CYRUS genuinely annoyed.What ? Why , he ca n't make any money out of soap . Crosses to MARYThat takes brains . p. 66 RODNEY Oh , yes , I can . CYRUS I control all the important soap business in the country . RODNEY I know you do , but I am going to take it away from you . CYRUS What ? RODNEY Yes , sir , I 'm going to manufacture the Thirteen Soap : Unlucky for Dirt : The Most Expensive Soap in the World ! I 'm going to break the trust ; I 'm going to attack monopoly . I 'm going to appeal to the American people for fair play against the soap trust . You 've always wanted me to go into business . Well , I 'm in , and forgive me , father , but I 'm going to put you out of business . I 'm going to advertise all over the world . CYRUS You ca n't fight the soap trust with advertising : we 're established . RODNEY Yes , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suggestion  --  the psychology of print . Why , 97 per cent . of the public believe what they 're told , and what they 're told is what the other chaps have been told , and the fellow who told him read it somewhere . Advertising is responsible for everything . People are sheep , and advertising is the way to make ' em follow your lead . He is beginning to forget the speechSay , what makes you go to the theater ? PEALE enters from door right . MARTIN starts to speakDo n't tell me : I 'll tell you . It 's what you 've read of the play or what some fellows told you , and the fellow that told him , read it  --  in a newspaper . Remembering  --  rapidlyAnd that , my boy , is the whole secret of it . You 've got to be talked about  --  get ' em praisin ' or cussin ' , but do n't let ' em be quiet . I want to tell you ; what kind of duck eggs do you eat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODNEY Do you know anything against the duck ? No , you do n't , but when a duck lays an egg it 's a damn fool and keeps quiet , but when a hen does  --  cluck , cluck , all over the place ! Advertising ! The curtain is down The Second curtain  --  PEALE and RODNEY on either side of MARTIN , are talking advertising , while MARY has her fingers to her ears The Third curtain  --  MARTIN is protesting angrily to MARY , while RODNEY and PEALE are talking gleefully to each other and shaking hands@@ SCENE .  --  The private office of the 13 Soap Company . A rather commonplace room , furnished comfortably but not elaborately . The walls have several posters extolling the virtues of 13 Soap  --  such as " Do you believe in signs ? " " 13 Soap is unlucky for dirt . " " Be Clean . Cheap Soap for Cheap People . " " 13 Soap is the most expensive soap in the world , one dollar a cake . " There is a particularly large stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soap gives you 56 washes . A cake of 13 Soap gives you only 24 , But What Washes ! " There is a door on the left and two more at right . At back are windows through which the audience sees the building across the street literally covered with 13 Soap posters . There is a desk , down center , with chairs , cabinets , hatrack , a water-cooler , a safe , etc. , which complete the equipment of the room . Light oak office furniture . Three telephones , one on stand right , one on desk left , and one on desk center . Shades on windows . All over carpet . Four brackets . The time is one month after the first act , about ten o'clock in the morning . The curtain rises on an empty stage RODNEY 'S voice heard off-stage : RODNEY enters from door upper right.Forward march ! Six sandwich-men enter door upper right , bearing boards : " 13 Soap  --  unlucky for dirt " Halt ! They stopNow , you understand you 're all to go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parade there all day  --  and to-morrow the same thing . Be in front of his house to-night at six sharp , you understand ? p. 69 SANDWICH MAN Yes , sir . RODNEY Then forward march ! They exit through door left . RODNEY goes to his desk . Business with papers , etc . PEALE enters from door upper right PEALE Hello , little boss . Holy Peter Piper , you 've shaved off your mustache ! RODNEY grinning.Yes , I 'm just beginning to get on to myself . By George , I certainly used to look like the devil . Do you observe the clothes ? PEALE right center . Crosses up ; removes coat , and places it left of center corner left of desk.Why , you are getting to be a regular business man . RODNEY Business is great stuff . I thought it 'd bore me , but it 's immense ; it 's the best game I ever played . What 's the news with you ? PEALE We only just got back from Buffalo this morning . RODNEY We ? PEALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. He went to the Iroquois in Buffalo . I had all the bill-boards in the neighborhood plastered thick  --  and 48-sheet stands along the streets to the Union Station . From the time the old man got in until he got out , he could n't look anywhere without seeing 13 Soap . I even found out the number of his room and had a small balloon floating 13 Soap streamers right outside his window . I took a page in all the Buffalo papers  --  bribed the hat boy to keep putting circulars in his hat every time he checked it , and sent him one of our new folders every mail . They have eight mails a day in Buffalo . I came back with him on the train and when he went into the washroom last night I had the porter say " Sorry , sir , we ai n't got no Thirteen Soap , but you ca n't hardly keep any on hand  --  it 's such grand , grand soap . " Rises and crosses to right p. 70 RODNEY Gee , that 's great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for to-day ? RODNEY I 've got a bully new advertising scheme . When you go into a barber shop where do you look ? PEALE At the manicure . RODNEY No , no at the ceiling  --  we 'll put ads on all the barbers ' ceilings . PEALE scornfully.Old stuff ! It 's been done  --  is that what you call a new scheme ? RODNEY Well , that was n't my big idea . Goes up-stage , sits in chair behind desk PEALE mockingly.No ? Well , what is your big idea ? RODNEY Plans for our new factory . PEALE Plans for what ? Have you gone dippy ? RODNEY Here they are . He produces large blue-printPretty real looking , are n't they ? PEALE You do n't mean you 've actually got some nut to build us a factory ? RODNEY No , no , they are for father . p. 71 PEALE Oh , yes , I must admit that is some idea . Takes blue-print RODNEY If he ever does drop in to make a deal I thought we ought to have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant . PEALE Plant is right . RODNEY And by the way , if we can , let it leak out that it 's the Ivory Soap people who are backing us with unlimited capital . PEALE The Ivory Soap people ? RODNEY Sure , father 's always hated ' em in business . His oldest friend , though , is John Clark , one of the big bugs in Ivory Soap . Clark 's got a son , Ellery , that father dislikes because he 's such a success in business  --  always held him up to me as a model son to pattern by . It 'd make father wild if he thought that old Clark was going to back us ; Ivory 's Soap 's the only bunch he 's never been able to lick . Rises and goes down right PEALE goes down left.Then that scheme ought to be good for a great rise out of father . RODNEY Say , by the way , I put over a corker on him this morning : I arranged for a parade of sandwich-men up and down in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office . p. 72 PEALE Oh , we 're bound to land him sooner or later , keeping after him the way we have . RODNEY Funny , though , nobody 's tried to buy any soap from us yet . PEALE Well , it takes time to create a demand . These 200 cakes of pink castile you bought looked swell in our old rose wrappers , did n't they ? RODNEY Say , where 's Miss Grayson ? Have you seen her to-day ? PEALE No , and it 's after eleven . RODNEY I 'll bet she was here before either of us  --  she always is . By George , is n't she a corker ? PEALE indifferently.Oh , she 's all right . Takes pad and pencil from pocket and sits in arm-chair left RODNEY All right ! ? Why , the girls you read about do n't mean anything compared to Mary . She 's got Juliet beat a mile . Every time I think of her I want to yell or do some darn fool thing , and every time I see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just want to walk around after her all the rest of my life and say " Are you comfortable , my love ? Are you happy ? If there is anything on the wide earth you want , let me get it for you , Mary . " What a wonderful name that is  --  just like her , simple and honest and beautiful ! Mary ! p. 73 PEALE reflectively.If we could only land one hard wallop on father after that Buffalo business ! RODNEY indignantly.Did n't you hear what I said ? PEALE Not a word . RODNEY I was talking about Mary . PEALE I know you were . That 's why I did n't listen . MARY enters from door upper right with Mss. case . Hangs up hat , then goes to desk , sitting back of it center GRAYSON Good-morning . RODNEY to MARY.Ah , you 're here  --  now everything 's all right , it 's a great world . GRAYSON Do n't be silly ; this is a business office . RODNEY By George , Mary  --  GRAYSON Miss Grayson ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply stunning ! You 're twice as pretty to-day as you were yesterday , and to-morrow you 'll be  --  PEALE Hey , hey , change the record or put on a soft needle ! GRAYSON to PEALE.Quite right  --  in business hours , only business . Takes list of assets and liabilities from case p. 74 RODNEY But you are the prettiest thing  --  GRAYSON Never mind that  --  you listen to me . This firm 's broke . RODNEY That we ca n't be  --  PEALE It must be some mistake in the books  --  GRAYSON Is it ? I was surprised myself when I balanced our accounts this morning . I have here a statement of our assets and liabilities . We owe $22,818.09 . PEALE What 's the 9 cents for ? RODNEY What are our assets ? GRAYSON $133.13 . RODNEY That 's quite a showing for a month . GRAYSON Mr. McChesney , the advertising man , was here this morning , and he wo n't wait any longer for his money . RODNEY But we paid him $5,000 . GRAYSON looking at statement.Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it to-day he 'll put you out of business . PEALE That 's the trouble of dealing with business men . They 're so particular about being paid . Now , you take a lot of actors  --  GRAYSON But what about McChesney ? p. 75 RODNEY Yes , what are we going to do when McChesney comes here to-day for money  --  cash ? PEALE Well , we do n't do any more business with him . GRAYSON No , I guess we wo n't . PEALE Well , do n't you worry , old son , we 'll fix father somehow . Nobody can stop good advertising . Why , I met a little fellow on the train last night . He gets $50,000 a year just for writing ads . He says a good trademark is 70% of the battle , and we 've got the best trademark I ever heard of . GRAYSON You think we ought to keep on advertising ? PEALE Sure , if we can get credit . RODNEY I suppose we might as well owe forty thousand as twenty . PEALE Absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good trademark , and ours is a bird . RODNEY By George , that 's true , we simply have got to keep going . We 'll manage somehow . GRAYSON I like to hear you say that . PEALE Now you 're talking . We 'll conduct the greatest campaign since George W. Advertising was a young man . MISS BURKE entering with one letter from door upper right.Here 's the morning mail . RODNEY takes letter , returns front of desk , MISS BURKE exits right p. 76 PEALE Pretty heavy mail . Coming down left of RODNEY GRAYSON I 'll bet it 's another bill . Coming down right of RODNEY RODNEY Hurrah ! Hurrah ! It 's from the Countess . GRAYSON What does she say ? PEALE grabbing letter , and looking at it. Oh , French stuff . RODNEY She says she was delayed abroad , but that she 's due to-day on the Imperator or Rotter or whatever you call it , this morning , and that she 's coming to see us at eleven . GRAYSON It 's half-past eleven now . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Countess , she is still a woman : give her time . GRAYSON Does she say anything about the $15,000 ? RODNEY No . PEALE Well , I 've got a hunch everything 's going to be all right , or she would n't have written us at all . RODNEY Her $15,000 'll keep us going for quite a while . MISS BURKE entering from door upper right.Mr . McChesney is here to see you . p. 77 GRAYSON The advertising man . Goes to typewriter desk , and pounds on it MISS BURKE He seems very angry , too . RODNEY Tell him I 'm out . Goes to chair behind desk and sits MCCHESNEY entering from door upper right.Thought I 'd come right in instead of waiting to have her tell me you were out . Going to RODNEY MISS BURKE exits RODNEY genially.Why , hello , Mr. McChesney . PEALE trying to shake hands.How are you , Mac ? MCCHESNEY throwing him off.You may be in the soap business , but cut out the soft soap with me . Where 's my money ? Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is  --  MCCHESNEY That means you have n't . RODNEY Well , you see  --  MCCHESNEY That does n't go with me . Do you think you can put me off ? You can bet your blooming liabilities you ca n't . I think this whole concern is bunk and I 'm going after you good  --  p. 78 RODNEY I do n't care for that kind of loud talk . Drop it . PEALE Drop it . MCCHESNEY surprised.What ? PEALE He said , drop it . RODNEY It 's simply that I have n't had time to examine your bill in detail . This afternoon , however , I  --  MCCHESNEY I 've heard that before . Now , see here , Mr. Martin  --  your father 's an honest man : he wo n't stand for his son not paying me my money . I 'll see him now . He starts for door RODNEY Wait a minute , wait a minute . I 'll give you a check for $2500 on account . I presume that will be satisfactory . MCCHESNEY taken aback.Why , yes  --  sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not a cent of that fifty thousand dollars we appropriated for our October advertising campaign is to go to him . PEALE Absolutely . MCCHESNEY Now , Mr. Martin , I 'll admit I 'm hasty tempered . I 'm sorry I made a mistake , but a contract is a contract and  --  RODNEY Here 's your check . Good-day. p. 79 MCCHESNEY But , Mr. Martin  --  RODNEY Show Mr. McChesney out . PEALE goes to MCCHESNEY , takes his arm and leads him to door upper right.Come on , Mac  --  this way to the elevator . DelightedWatch your step . Mr. MCCHESNEY exits RODNEY gleefully.Well , I fixed him , did n't I ? GRAYSON rises and goes to RODNEY.No , you 've only got us into more difficulty . You know , there 's no money in the bank . RODNEY But the check wo n't go through the clearing-house until tomorrow morning and by then we 'll have the $15,000 from the Countess . PEALE But where is the Countess ? GRAYSON I 'll go telephone now to see if the Imperator 's docked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MISS BURKE entering.Mr . Ellery Clark to see you . RODNEY How I hate that fellow ! PEALE What 've you ever done to him ? p. 80 RODNEY Nothing . I wish I could . That 's the fellow I told you about . John Clark 's pride . PEALE Oh , yes , the son of Ivory Soap . Let 's have a peek at him ? MISS BURKE Yes , sir . She exits PEALE I never saw a model son before . GRAYSON she starts down right.Oh , Rodney , find out how Ellery 's doing in business , will you ? RODNEY Oh , I suppose so . MARY exits door lower right PEALE crosses to arm-chair left. You 're spoiling that girl . She used to be a good business woman . Now half the time , instead of using her brains she just sits and looks at you as if you were some marvellous antique work of art . Sits ELLERY enters door upper right ELLERY Hello , Rodney , mind if I come in ? RODNEY I 'm very busy to-day , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must take a lot of time to get up your advertisements . PEALE rises , goes to ELLERY and offers hand.You like ' em ? I write ' em ! My name 's Peale ! Goes back to chair left . Sits p. 81 ELLERY turning from him , bored.How do you do ? Sits in arm-chair right RODNEY What is it , Mr. Clark ? ELLERY You see , it 's like this , old top . I 've been having rather a time with father lately  --  silly old man  --  insisted on the absurd idea of my going into business . Beastly bore . RODNEY But you wanted to do that ? ELLERY I should say not . RODNEY But I thought you loved work ? ELLERY It 's a preposterous idea  --  men of intelligence go in for the professions . I paint . PEALE half aside.You look it ! RODNEY I 'd heard you were a model son . ELLERY But I do n't consider it a compliment to be a success in business  --  think of all the blighters who are . PEALE Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your success every day  --  most irritating . You see , of course he 's sore , because I never bothered much about business . Oh , I have tackled a thing or two . But luck was always against me . It just happened it did n't work out right . Not my fault , you understand ? p. 82 PEALE You could n't be to blame . ELLERY Of course , if I ever devoted myself to business ! But , after all , when you know you can do a thing you want to , why bother to do it , if it bores you ? PEALE Yes , life is a damn nuisance . ELLERY sighing.And father has been so offensive lately , I 've decided to give a little time to business and make a success of it . I can , you know . RODNEY Indeed ? PEALE Seems simple . ELLERY Oh , rather . I have it all figured out . For my scheme I 've got to raise seventy-five hundred dollars , and I wanted to talk to you about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need $10,000 , and I 've only got $2500 . RODNEY and PEALE exchange looks and walk over to ELLERY , one on each side of him RODNEY Ellery , why do you want to go into the automobile business ? It 's dangerous  --  unsafe  --  PEALE The risk 's tremendous . RODNEY Ellery , our families are old friends . Now , if you really want to show your father you 're a money-maker , why do n't you buy some shares in our company ? p. 83 ELLERY I do n't care much about the idea of being in the soap business  --  rather vulgar . RODNEY But you do n't have to be in the business . PEALE Absolutely not . RODNEY It 's a very simple proposition . All you do is invest and then sit still and deposit your checks when we pay dividends . ELLERY I say , that sounds a bit better . RODNEY We 're not letting the general public in  --  but it 'd be such a joke on your father for you to make money . ELLERY Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mighty glad I had sense enough to go in with you . RODNEY Yes , would n't he ? ELLERY But is it a safe investment ? RODNEY Why , we 'd guarantee you against loss from our assets . PEALE Yes , from our assets . ELLERY That sounds rather ripping . But what would I get for my twenty-five hundred ? PEALE A receipt . ELLERY I know , I know , but what interest in the business ? p. 84 RODNEY Two and one-half per cent . ELLERY I say , is that much ? RODNEY Think what two and a half per cent in the steel trust would mean . PEALE And more people use soap than steel . ELLERY wisely.Is n't steel dearer ? RODNEY It 's quantity that counts . PEALE Four cakes a year to every person in this country would represent an annual output of 400,000,000 cakes  --  and think of all the babies who 'll be born next year . They 'll all have to be washed . ELLERY Very true , very true . What is the annual birth-rate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , Peale ? PEALE There 's one born every minute . ELLERY I fancy that 's true . PEALE You can bet it is . RODNEY Now , what do you say , Ellery , about investing in our company ? ELLERY after a long pause , rises and shakes hands with RODNEY.I 'll do it . PEALE God 's in His Heaven , all 's right with the world ! Crosses left p. 85 RODNEY Have you the money with you ? ELLERY Why , no . PEALE Then you 'll send us a check to-day ? ELLERY I do n't get the money until next week . RODNEY Why not ? ELLERY Father did n't promise it to me till next Monday . PEALE Well , ask him for it now . ELLERY Oh , I 'm afraid I ca n't . He 's out of town . RODNEY We ca n't agree to hold the matter open until next Monday . Goes to chair behind desk and sits PEALE No , not till way next Monday . Why do n't you telephone him ? ELLERY Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get him  --  I find him considerably easier to talk to on the ' phone . I can always ring off . PEALE Come this way  --  it 'll be quieter for you if he 's noisy . Goes to ELLERY , takes his arm , and leads him to door lower right GRAYSON enters door lower right.Oh , how do you do , Mr. Clark ? ELLERY Oh , how do you do ? They shake hands p. 86 PEALE pushing him out.Never mind the social chatter . Ellery , you do n't mind my calling you Ellery  --  do you , Ellery ? To her You see , Ellery has work to do . Exit ELLERY . MARY goes to leftIf that 's a model son , thank God I was born a black sheep ! RODNEY to MARY.Has the Imperator docked ? GRAYSON Three hours ago . PEALE Then I 'll bet the Countess has been hit by a taxi ! Drinks GRAYSON Oh , Rodney , did you find out how well Ellery 's doing ? RODNEY Oh , great ! Has n't made a cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 'd be glad to hear that . PEALE Oh , where is our wandering Countess ? Crosses to left MISS BURKE entering.The Countess de Boureen . PEALE By golly , she enters on the cue . RODNEY We 're saved now . GRAYSON Oh , I do hope so . p. 87 RODNEY Get her right in here , quick . MISS BURKE exits ELLERY sticking his head in at door.How do you use this ' phone ? I 've never run a switchboard ! GRAYSON Oh , I 'll come show you . Crosses to right ELLERY Oh , thank you . I 'm not much at mechanical problems . He exits RODNEY to MARY as she goes.And get his father for him ; it may mean $2,500 more for us . PEALE runs to door right shouting to MARY.Do anything : hold his hand  --  kiss him ! She exits . To RODNEYDo you need an interpreter for the Countess ? RODNEY as he speaks , goes over and pulls down a shade on which is painted an advertisement in French.I can understand anything she says about money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the grandest sensation I know . Crosses to left MISS BURKE announcing.The Countess de Bowreen . COUNTESS sweeps in . RODNEY delighted . Goes to her and kisses her hand p. 88 RODNEY Ah , bonjour  --  bonjour . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Bonjour  --  bonjour . RODNEY pointing to window shade.Regardez . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Ah , magnifique , superbe , superbe ! Je suis dsole d ' tre si en retard , mais c'est tris compliqu la douane . Coming down in front of desk RODNEY Not at all . Going to her PEALE Not at all . Going to her COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN threatening.Vous avez resu ma lettre ? RODNEY Letter ? Yes I got your letter . PEALE leaning forward eagerly to her. Oh , you little life-saver . RODNEY to her.Mon manager , you remember ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Je suis enchante de vous revoir , PEALE bows very low RODNEY Kiss her hand  --  it 's French stuff . PEALE kisses her hand p. 89 PEALE She looks like money  --  ask her  --  ask her . RODNEY nervously.You have the money ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say yes , say yes . RODNEY Vous avez argent ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Oui , oui , j'ai l'argent . PEALE What does she say ? RODNEY She says yes . PEALE Shall I kiss her ? RODNEY Do you want to spoil everything ? Do n't kiss her till we get the money . The money with you ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Eh ? RODNEY Argent avec vous ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Oui , j'ai l'argent ici . Opening bag and taking out check PEALE It 's real . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN C'est un cheque de Morgan Harjes pour cent mille francs . RODNEY looking at it.Draft for $20,000 in full payment for French rights of the 13 Soap . p. 90 COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Je vous donnerai ce chque pour vingt mille dollars , mais comme Je ne vous dois que cinq mille , vous pourrez me donner votre chque pour cinq mille . Cela finira notre affaire . PEALE Slip it to me , kid , slip it to me . I 'm dying on my feet . Takes check from RODNEY RODNEY She says she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only owes us $15,000 , we must give her back our check for $5,000 . PEALE That seems simple , give her the check . RODNEY But we have n't any money in the bank . Suppose we get her check cashed first . Then we can pay her . PEALE Sure , great ! I 'll go right over to the bank to get it certified . COUNTESS takes check from PEALE and tears it upWhat 's the matter with you ? What 's the matter ? COUNTESS is smiling RODNEY She 's crazy  --  COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Ah mais non , l'affaire c'est fini maintenant  --  PEALE Talk French to her . RODNEY Pourquoi tear it up  --  pourquoi  --  pourquoi ? p. 91 COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Gee , but you 're funny ! RODNEY She spoke English ! She 's a fake . RODNEY and PEALE stare at her speechless , PEALE pointing toward the draft PEALE The draft was phoney , too . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN smiling.Sure it was . PEALE But what 's the idea , kid ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN sits on desk.You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check , but as long as you have n't any money , your check 's no good , so you 've busted up my whole scheme . PEALE But why pick on us ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN I did n't start out to : you wished it on yourselves . I came to trim your father . You remember , I wanted to see him , but I looked so soft you thought you 'd grab me off and sell me the French agency of your Thirteen Soap . I did n't think your father could be as big a boob as you were , so I changed my plans . Do you get me ? PEALE Yes , I get you and now I 'm going to get the cops to get you .

" A pauseSend for the cops and I 'll blow the whole thing to the papers . A pauseWell , I guess we 're quits . If you had any money I 'd ask for a piece of change to keep me quiet , but as it is , I ca n't waste my time . RODNEY rises. You 're not French at all ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN I was educated over there  --  immense , was n't I ? You never tumbled at all . p. 93 PEALE rises.But why the foreign stuff ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Well , I can talk good French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODNEY You wo n't say anything now ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN No , I do n't hit a fellow when he 's down .

We will just have to get that $2,500 from Ellery , RODNEY What 's happened to Ellery ? Let 's find him . They start for door right PEALE If he falls down on us  --  ELLERY entering.Can I see you a moment ? RODNEY I should say you could . PEALE You seem very beastly pleased , Ellery . ELLERY Oh , I am . RODNEY Then everything 's all right about father ? p. 94 ELLERY Oh , yes , so to speak  --  in a way . RODNEY Ah ? PEALE suddenly suspicious.What do you mean  --  so to speak , in a way ? ELLERY Well , I could n't reach the old man on the ' phone , and that did make matters so much easier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . PEALE Why could n't you reach him ? ELLERY smiling happily.Why , he 's on his yacht somewhere on the Sound  --  he wo n't be home till Monday , so I ca n't possibly get the money for you to-day . RODNEY and PEALE walk up-stage whils the COUNTESS drops her handkerchief . ELLERY picks it up and smiles back delightedly at her . MARY enters from door lower right GRAYSON Look out . McChesney 's coming back here  --  I just saw him across the street . PEALE Try and keep him out . GRAYSON I 'll do my best . She exits door upper right RODNEY Ellery , you 'll have to go  --  we 've got a big job on our hands . Au revoir , Countess . p. 95 COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Au revoir , Monsieur .

COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Au revoir , Mr. Martin  --  Turning to RODNEYVous tes trop aimable . Je vous remercie beaucoup de votre politesse . Au revoir  --  Goes to PEALE  --  in undertoneSo long , kid , call me up sometime . And then , chattering a stream of German to ELLERY , they exit door left RODNEY closes door after COUNTESS exits.Well , I 've got to hand it to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and McChesney 's on his way here with that phoney check . Goes to his chair behind desk PEALE I can see Sing-Sing from here . Goes to chair left corner , sits quickly McCHESNEY bursts in , followed by MARY MCCHESNEY No , I wo n't wait . You 're two swindlers . I 've just come from the bank . Your check 's no good . p. 97 RODNEY No good ! That 's impossible . PEALE Absolutely . MCCHESNEY You have n't any money in the bank . RODNEY It must be some mistake on the part of our cashier . MCCHESNEY Yes it is  --  ask him . RODNEY He 's at lunch . MCCHESNEY I 'm going to the sheriff now , and unless you make the check good at my office in an hour , I 'm going to cancel your advertising , cover up your billboards and send you both to jail , and that goes . He exits GRAYSON Ca n't you pay him ? RODNEY With what ? GRAYSON What happened to the Countess ? Did n't she give you the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five thousand dollars . GRAYSON What ? RODNEY She 's a fake . GRAYSON The swindler ! And the man from the Edison Company is here to say that unless they get some money at once they 'll cut off the current from all our signs , and the agent of the landlord is waiting for the rent . He seems very suspicious and wants to be paid for last month right away . What can I say to them ? RODNEY shakes his head p. 98 PEALE I do n't know . GRAYSON Oh , please send for your father and give in . RODNEY No . GRAYSON You know I want you to succeed , but there 's no use fighting odds like these  --  you have n't any money , you 're way in debt , and you must n't be disgraced . Please send for your father . I 'm sure he 'll help you . RODNEY I wonder if I 'd better ? What do you think , Peale ? PEALE I do n't know . GRAYSON Do telephone him right away . Crosses to door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the landlord , or they 'll be in here . To PEALEWhat can I say to them ? PEALE I do n't know . GRAYSON Oh , I 'll say you 're both out . She exits door lower right PEALE That 'll be a new one . RODNEY Do you happen to know the sheriff ? PEALE Not yet . I 'd like to have a pull enough to get a cell with a southern exposure . RODNEY What are we going to do ? p. 99 PEALE I do n't know . RODNEY What are you here for ? PEALE I know , but I ca n't think . MISS BURKE entering.Mr . Cyrus Martin to see you . PEALE and RODNEY . Who ? MISS BURKE Mr. Cyrus Martin . RODNEY Have him wait . PEALE Have him what ? Rises and goes to RODNEY RODNEY Just a minute till I think . When I ring , show him in . MISS BURKE Yes , sir . She exits PEALE He must be here to make a deal . Our scheme worked  --  we 've put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But father 's no fool . We 've got to be very careful . How 'll we handle it ? I 'm not used to putting it over on father . PEALE Do n't forget the factory and the Ivory Soap people and the plans , and get busy . You know . He makes motions and brings letter-file from rack and throws contents on deskThat rubber-stamp stuff . p. 100 RODNEY But is n't this playing it rather low down on father ? PEALE Oh , do n't get cold feet now ! RODNEY We really have n't anything to sell him . PEALE Yes , we have  --  a trademark . You know it 's good , so do I. We only need your father to back us and we 'll make a lot of money for him in spite of himself . RODNEY I guess that 's true . PEALE Sure it is , and anyhow all 's fair in love and business . ELLERY coming in at private door left.Oh , I beg pardon , but I was so fascinated at meeting the Countess , I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellery . He goes over and pulls down two window shades on which are painted ads of 13 Soap PEALE giving him gloves.No , ca n't ever see you again , Ellery . Here 's your cane . Now , hurry , Ellery . He starts to lead him to door ELLERY The Countess is perfectly delightful  --  RODNEY suddenly goes to ELLERY.Hold on , hold on , Ellery , can you wait in there five minutes ? p. 101 ELLERY pausing.But the Countess is downstairs in a taxi . RODNEY Oh , she 'll wait for you , and charge the taxi to Mr. Peale . He 'll be right in and explain everything to you . PEALE Oh , yes , I 'll explain . ELLERY I do n't want to detain the Countess too long . Hate to keep a lady waiting  --  all that sort of thing . You know what women are . He exits left PEALE Now , what is it , what do you want that gink for ? RODNEY Do n't you see ? PEALE No , I 'm near-sighted . RODNEY He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some important message from old John Clark to us about a merger , and when father begins to wabble , have Ellery come in with the message . That 'll send father kerflop to the map . PEALE going.Master ! Great , great , I get you . I 'll fix Ellery . This is your father 's Waterloo . At doorAs soon as I 've taught Ellery 's his lesson I 'll be right back . I 'll tell him when we ring the bell twice , to bust in with his little recitation . RODNEY But do n't let him get on to our game . p. 102 PEALE He could n't get on to anything but a weighing machine . He goes out left RODNEY pushes the buzzer and then takes up the ' phone , keeping his eye on the door . In a moment CYRUS MARTIN enters RODNEY No , much obliged , but we ca n't consider it . No stock for sale  --  it 's quite out of the question . Good-bye . Ringing off and then pretending to be surprised , turns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son . RODNEY RODNEY gets very busy with papers and rubber-stamp.Sit down , wo n't you ? Be with you in just a minute . CYRUS drily.Thanks . RODNEY very busy again with filing papers and opening and closing drawers . MARTIN looks at him in astonishment RODNEY Have a cigar ? He abstractedly passes him a box CYRUS Thanks  --  He bites off end and lights it , and as he does so , RODNEY again gets busy with similar businessSurprised to see me , I suppose ? RODNEY Not a bit . He starts signing a contract . MARTIN , who has risen , attempts to glance at it , and as he does so , RODNEY calmly turns it over and blots it . MARTIN turns awayThere , that 's done ! Now , father , what can I do for you ? p. 103 CYRUS Well , my boy  --  I just dropped in for a social call . The fact is , I 've rather missed you . RODNEY I 've missed you too , father . CYRUS abruptly.Thought I 'd have a look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm-chair right RODNEY Fine  --  fine  --  everything 's breezing right along . Of course , I 'm always glad to see you , but right now , father I 'm pretty busy , so you 'll excuse me if  --  He gets busy again with rubber-stamp CYRUS with a certain sarcasm.Well , if you can spare the time , I 'd like a little business talk with you , Rodney . RODNEY Certainly , in just a minute . Gets busy with papers . Pushes the buzzer PEALE entering.Oh , excuse me . RODNEY That 's all right , come right in . Father , you remember Mr. Peale  --  Peale , my father  --  PEALE Indeed yes , I recall very well  --  CYRUS gruffly cutting him off.How are you ? p. 104 PEALE sitting in chair left.A bit tired  --  just back from Buffalo where I 've been conducting a big campaign . CYRUS Then it is to you I should address myself ? RODNEY Either or both of us . CYRUS rises and goes to desk.Then both of you listen to me . You 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense ? PEALE weakly.Yes , what ? CYRUS This morning there was a parade of sandwich-men in front of my house for two hours . I had to have them arrested . I got to the office to find another bunch . It annoys me . RODNEY I 'm sorry , father . CYRUS You 're trying to make a fool of me . I open a letter . It 's a circular for 13 Soap . I open my newspaper  --  you have a page ad . I look out of the window  --  there 's a billboard  --  I take a train , the damned porter apologizes because he 's all out of 13 Soap . RODNEY Well , of course , all that proves how wonderful our publicity is . CYRUS grimly.You 're a grand young bluff , my son . p. 105 RODNEY Why , father , what do you mean ? CYRUS I 'll tell you exactly what I mean : I 've let you ramble on to see just how far you would go , but you 've been spending a lot of money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy your business to get rid of you . Well , I 'm not going to . Now what have you got to say to that ? Eh  --  eh ? PEALE rises quickly.Nothing  --  absolutely nothing . Sits RODNEY quickly.But I have a lot to say . We may not have a big business now , but we have got a trade-mark , the catchiest trade-mark ever invented for soap . We 're a growing concern . Just because our advertising annoys you , you must n't think it 's valueless . Why , it 's so good that capital is chasing us : our money is practically unlimited . Is that a fair statement , Peale ? PEALE dazed at RODNEY 'S bluff.Very fair  --  very fair indeed  --  CYRUS Bluff , son , bluff ! RODNEY Not at all . And since you 're so skeptical , father , I do n't mind letting you see the plans for our new factory . Takes plans from desk CYRUS New factory ? p. 106 RODNEY Yes , father  --  these are the offices , this is Miss Grayson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is mine . CYRUS Well , are n't you going to make any soap ? RODNEY Right here , where our capacity will be  --  CYRUS Who 's putting up the money ? RODNEY reprovingly.Now , father , you can not expect me to divulge a business secret to you , a rival manufacturer . PEALE Oh , why not tell him , he is your father ? RODNEY Well , Peale , if you really think it is wise ? PEALE Oh , yes , I think it 's quite wise . RODNEY It 's the Ivory Soap people . CYRUS at once impressed and annoyed.The Ivory Soap people ? PEALE rises and goes to desk . Rubbing it in.Yes , the Ivory Soap people . CYRUS You mean John Clark ? RODNEY Yes . PEALE Absolutely . MARTIN turns and reflectively walks up-stage . PEALE very obviously picks up push-button and pushes buzzer twice ; it rings off left . There is a pause , and then in a moment , ELLERY enters p. 107 ELLERY Oh , excuse me . I did n't know your father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PEALE the same.Come right in . ELLERY How do you do , Mr. Martin ? CYRUS gruffly.How are you , Ellery ? ELLERY Well , I really ca n't wait any longer . The party downstairs in the taxi  --  you follow me ? PEALE Yes , Ellery , you told us that  --  ELLERY Well , good-bye , then . RODNEY Was that all you came in to say ? ELLERY remembering.Oh , yes , of course . If you 'll keep it open until Monday I 'll get the money for you then . RODNEY But we ca n't wait till Monday . ELLERY But Mr. Peale told me  --  PEALE interrupting quickly.We 'll see what we can do , but just now , Ellery , we 're very much occupied . He has him by the arm p. 108 RODNEY Oh , just a minute : you 'd better give your father back the plans  --  say they 're quite satisfactory . Gives plans to PEALE ELLERY What plans ? PEALE Do n't you know ? ELLERY No . PEALE That 's too bad . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find business very confusing . He exits PEALE as he comes back.Ellery talks too much . RODNEY He is very indiscreet  --  if it had been anybody but father he 'd have given our whole plan away . CYRUS What 's he doing here  --  acting for his father ? PEALE Absolutely . CYRUS You 're not going to take him in  --  that pin-head ? Why , he did n't even seem to know what he was trying to get at . PEALE No , he did n't , did he ? RODNEY But after all , he does represent Ivory Soap . PEALE Great soap , Ivory ! Over 99 per cent . pure . Sits in arm-chair left p. 109 CYRUS grunting.Ivory Soap ? He walks up and down while RODNEY and PEALE exchange gleeful glances . After a considerable pauseWell , thinking things over , why should you and I fight ? RODNEY You began it , father . CYRUS Quite true , and therefore I should be the one to call it off . Now , son , here 's the idea : I 'd rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't matter much . In your way , while I do n't endorse that kind of publicity , I suppose you boys think your sensational ads are good . PEALE rising.Thank you , sir . CYRUS Not at all . To RODNEYAnd if you 're going to have a backer , would n't I be better than the Ivory Soap people ? RODNEY After all , blood is thicker than business . What do you suggest ? CYRUS Suppose I buy you out  --  including your trade-mark and goodwill ? PEALE Oh , you have our goodwill now , sir . Rises and bows very profusely , then sits RODNEY reflectively.Buying us out might be expensive for you , father . p. 110 CYRUS Oh , I guess it wo n't take all the money I 've got . What 's your proposition ? RODNEY What 's yours ? CYRUS Well , I 'll give you $50,000 for your business as it stands . RODNEY But we do n't want to give up our business . I like business . PEALE grandly.We wish to continue in our chosen profession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition ? RODNEY It 's a wonderful autumn , is n't it ? These crisp cold bracing mornings . CYRUS Well , I hardly thought you 'd grab at that . What will you take ? RODNEY rising quickly.One hundred thousand dollars cash , you assume all the contracts and obligations of this company , give us 40% of the profits , a contract for me at $20,000 a year ; for Miss Grayson at $10,000 , PEALE coughs  --  and another for Mr. Peale at the same figure . CYRUS Done . Shakes hands with RODNEY PEALE and RODNEY exchange looks and shake hands RODNEY I congratulate you , father . p. 111 CYRUS You need n't . Your trademark might appeal to a lot of suprstitious idiots , but as a business proposition I do n't think much of it . But now I 'll show old John Clark he ca n't but into my family affairs or get Ellery mixed up with my boy 's business . RODNEY Yes , father , we 'd much rather have you than Ellery . PEALE Oh , much rather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CYRUS Yes ? RODNEY going to her.That 's for me , father . To MISS BURKEWhat is it ? MISS BURKE The agent for the landlord says he 's got to see you immediately . RODNEY motioning her to be quiet.I 'll be right out . To MARTIN , very nervouslyYou see , father , we 're thinking of taking larger offices . Come , Peale . We 'll be right back , father . PEALE Yes , father , we 'll be right back . They hurriedly exit CYRUS stands there watching them proudly . MISS GRAYSON enters door lower right.Hello , Miss Grayson , it 's mighty good to see you again  --  I  --  p. 112 GRAYSON Oh , Mr. Martin , I 'm so glad Rodney finally sent for you . CYRUS surprised.Sent for me ? Goes in front of desk GRAYSON Have you talked to him ? CYRUS Oh , yes , he just went out for a minute to see the agent of the landlord  --  GRAYSON Oh , then he told you about that ? Goes to him CYRUS puzzled.Yes , he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he was n't ashamed to tell you the truth . CYRUS Oh , Rodney always was a truthful lad . GRAYSON Oh , I 'm so happy you 've settled with him ! You have settled , have n't you ? Goes to arm-chair right CYRUS Yes , sure . GRAYSON Oh , good . Is n't it wonderful for him ? Very sweetlyJust think ! Without you he could n't have lasted out the day . Crossing down in front of desk CYRUS Could n't have lasted out the day , ha , ha ! Then our little scheme to put Rodney on his feet did n't work ? p. 113 GRAYSON But everything 's all right now . You 're going to help him  --  CYRUS Everything 's great now  --  Knocked off his feet , then recovering himself Oh , by the way , in our negotiations the one thing that Rodney did n't fully go into was the nature of the assets . GRAYSON The assets ! They must have made even you laugh . Why , we have n't any ! She laughs CYRUS trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , there was a report on the Street to-day that the Ivory Soap people were going to make a deal with Rodney  --  build him a factory  --  GRAYSON innocently.Oh , there 's nothing in that . CYRUS Are you sure ? As I got here , I thought I saw Ellery Clark leaving . GRAYSON Oh , he did n't come here on business : Ellery came to borrow some money from Rodney  --  is n't that funny ? CYRUS Oh , yes , very funny  --  but the plans ? GRAYSON Rodney showed you some plans ? He must have been joking ! CYRUS changing his whole manner.The young scoundrel ! Starts to go up-stage p. 114 GRAYSON What ! CYRUS stops.Thank you , Miss Grayson , for telling me . Do you know what he tried to do to me ? Hold me up for a hundred thousand dollars , make me think Ivory Soap was backing him , too  --  and but for you , he 'd have succeeded . GRAYSON What have I done ? CYRUS You saved me a lot of money and kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Starts for door upper right GRAYSON You mean at last he 'd succeeded in getting you to back him ? CYRUS At last ! Coming to her , lays hat on deskSo that was his scheme all the time , was it ? He did n't go into business on the level , but just for my benefit ? And you were helping him . Well , he can thank you again for having failed . GRAYSON It 's all my fault . CYRUS Yes , it is , from the start . You got up the plan of my pretending to put him out of the house  --  GRAYSON Oh , but I tell you , you must help him . CYRUS Help him yourself . You 've got $5,000 . GRAYSON But I gave it to him . p. 115 CYRUS My son took money from you ? GRAYSON He did n't know  --  I pretended it was from a friend . CYRUS Well , you got him in ; now you can get him out . GRAYSON But your bet  --  you bet $30,000 with John Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , if Ellery 's trying to borrow money from Rodney it looks like an even break  --  and anyhow I 'd lose the bet twice over rather than have my son think he could make a fool of his father . GRAYSON But he is a good business man : he 'd make you proud of him . You do n't know how hard he 's worked , how fine he 's been ; he 's simply wonderful . If he could keep on a little longer , I know he 'd succeed . If you 'll just help him , he 'll make money . You 'll see he will . CYRUS Of course , you want him to make money . You 're thinking of that percentage contract with me . GRAYSON I 'm not ! Oh , I 'm not ! I ca n't see him fail . Listen : I 'll try to give you back what you 've given me  --  I do n't care anything about the contract . I 'll tear it up now if you 'll just help him . CYRUS By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! GRAYSON proudly.Yes , I am  --  now . But that does n't matter . We 've got to save him  --  save his business . p. 116 CYRUS I wo n't give him a nickel . Good-bye ! Starts to go GRAYSON But you ca n't go like this : he 'll be disgraced ! He 's in debt . CYRUS Let him get out of it  --  it 'll do him good . I 've been a sentimental fool . I 've made it all too easy for him . Coming down right GRAYSON But that 's your fault , too . CYRUS Yes it is , and I do n't propose to repeat the error . He 's lied to me all the way through . We 'll let him face the truth ; now we 'll see what he 's made of . RODNEY and PEALE enter RODNEY coming in.Well , we 're going to move . Goes to desk and sits PEALE Yes , nice chap , that fellow . Coming down right RODNEY Well , Mary , have you heard about our deal ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arm-chair left RODNEY back of desk.Off ! p. 117 PEALE Off ! Goes up-stage to window CYRUS Yes , off . RODNEY But , why  --  why ? CYRUS Because you took me for a bigger fool than I am . My own son ca n't do that to me . I 've found out now that you 're broke . GRAYSON Oh , Mr. Martin ! CYRUS stopping her. No ! To RODNEYAnd all the time you were lying to me about the Ivory Soap people and the factory they were going to put up . You thought you could make an ass of me  --  get the best of me , did you ? Well , you ca n't . I 'm finished with you and your 13 Soap . You 've got a swelled head , you 're a smart alec , you 're a complete fake , you 're a cheat , young man  --  RODNEY in utter dejection.I guess you 're right . CYRUS with satisfaction.Ah ! RODNEY I did try to be smart . I was stuck on myself . I thought business was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fake . This whole thing never seemed real  --  it was just fun  --  like a game ; but I 've waked up , and now it 's serious . I tried to get the best of you , but I 'll take my licking . I do n't want any charity : I know what 's coming to me and I 'll take my medicine . p. 118 CYRUS relenting a little.Well , maybe I 've said a little too much  --  RODNEY No , it 's all true . CYRUS But , see here , I do n't want you disgraced  --  I  --  RODNEY You told me never to come back to you for a nickel , and I wo n't . I told you , too , that I would n't snivel  --  well , I 'm not going to . Good-bye , father  --  CYRUS Now , see here  --  RODNEY Please , father , it 's up to me and nobody else , to get out of this . Please go . He holds out his hand CYRUS gently.Good-bye , son . He shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEALE coming down to RODNEY.Now , see here , little boss  --  RODNEY Peale , I 'm sorry , but you 're fired . PEALE coming over and putting hand on his shoulder.Say , little boss , you ca n't fire me . I 'm just going to stick around , whatever happens . MARY touches PEALE on the arm and motions him to go out . He nods understandingly and exits upper right . MARY comes to RODNEY p. 119 GRAYSON Oh , Rodney , Rodney , it was all my fault . Your father had no idea of the truth  --  I did n't understand ; I thought you sent for him to help you . I told him about our company . I did it all  --  betrayed you . RODNEY But you did n't mean to : it 's all right , Mary . GRAYSON You forgive me ? RODNEY Why , of course : I love you . GRAYSON Oh , Rodney , I 'm so sorry . RODNEY changing completely . Rises.But if father thinks just because he laced it into me I 'm licked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake but , by George , I wo n't be any longer . Goes down right GRAYSON You 're really going on ? Goes down left RODNEY When I 've got you , you bet I am . Say , do you really think a long speech from father and no money to work with are enough to stop me ? No , sir ; what father said got me for a minute , but I 'm not a quitter , and I 'll prove it . There must be something of father in me : I ca n't be such a pin-head as I look . I 'll get out of this mess the best way I can , and then I 'll shine shoes or sell peanuts . I 'll start at the bottom instead of finishing there . I 'll make money  --  I 'll  --  p. 120 GRAYSON Oh , Rodney , Rodney , now I am proud of you ! She kisses him unexpectedly and heartily RODNEY overjoyed.What ! That 's the first time you ever really kissed me  --  all by yourself  --  like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You bet I do . She kisses him again and they clinch as PEALE enters excitedly , coming down right PEALE entering.Say , I did n't mean to interrupt ! RODNEY still with MARY in his arms.Nothing in the world can interrupt me  --  What is it ? PEALE A telegram . It 's the first we ever received , and  --  I was afraid to open it . MARY , taking it , looks at it nervously GRAYSON What awful thing can it be ? Goes in front of desk RODNEY Gee , I wonder what it says ? Crosses to her PEALE Read it . Read it . Crosses to her GRAYSON having opened it . " Rodney Martin , President 13 Soap Company , 226 Broadway "  --  p. 121 PEALE Go on , we know the address  --  GRAYSON " Ship at once , collect , 50,000 cakes 13 Soap . Marshall Field , Chicago . " RODNEY Somebody really wants to buy some soap ! PEALE I do n't believe it . GRAYSON handing RODNEY the telegram.But here it is . RODNEY reading.Fifty thousand cakes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've begun ! We 're actually going to sell some soap . RODNEY The tide 's turned  --  did n't I tell you advertising pays ? We 'll sweep the country  --  Europe  --  Asia  --  Africa ! Go in with father ? Not for a million dollars ! Starts up-stage PEALE I 'll wire Marshall Field right away . Starts for door upper right RODNEY Go ahead . GRAYSON suddenly.Great Heavens ! PEALE What is it ? RODNEY What 's happened ? GRAYSON That order is no good . p. 122 PEALE What ! Coming down right RODNEY Why ? Coming down left GRAYSON We ca n't fill it : we 've never made any soap . Start . Stand staring at each other aghast RODNEY What 'll we do ? PEALE Let 's think . They sit staring straight ahead RODNEY sits in chair left . MARY sits on table . PEALE sits in chair right RODNEY slowly.We must get some soap . PEALE slowly.Yes , I thought of that . GRAYSON slowly.Where can we get it ? PEALE From a soap factory ! GRAYSON slowly.But they all belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't know about this Marshall Field order  --  maybe we could buy some soap before he 'd have a chance to stop them selling to us ? PEAL and MARY rise p. 123 PEALE Great idea  --  let 's get busy . GRAYSON How ? RODNEY Where 's the ' phone book ? She grabs red classified directory from deskWe 'll call up two or three of his branch offices . He has hurriedly begun turning over pages , as PEALE on one side and MARY on the other , help himSkins , skates , shirts  --  where 's soap ? GRAYSON over his shoulder.Skylights , skates , slides  --  PEALE the same.Smelters , smoke-stacks , snuff . RODNEY Ah , here it is ! Soap manufacturers  --  Skimming down page276 Broad  --  here 's one of father 's factories . PEALE I 've got one , too  --  374 Schuyler . GRAYSON So have I : 480 Audubon . They drop book and each dashes to a ' phone . As they give the number of ' phone , curtain . During two curtains , till they finish lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schuyler  --  and hurry , sweetie  --  p. 124 RODNEY holding wire.It 'll have to be Old Rose . PEALE Castile is the cheapest . GRAYSON Order small cakes . RODNEY Hello , is this the Martin Soap Company  --  we want to get some soap  --  pink castile  --  small cakes  --  40 or 50,000 cakes immediate delivery  --  what 's the price ? GRAYSON Hello , 480 Audubon . I want to find out if I can buy a lot of soap right away  --  Old Rose  --  castile  --  50,000 cakes ; we want it this afternoon . PEALE Hello , son , I want to buy a lot of soap : 50,000 cakes  --  got to have some of it to-day  --  smallest size castile cakes you keep . If you have n't Old Rose  --  pink 'll do . Who am I ? None of your business . And as all three are talking together violently in their separate ' phones , @x SCENE .  --  The scene is the same as that of ACT I , except that it is five o'clock in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , right . Before him is a pile of evening papers and some unopened letters . As the curtain rises he opens one , displaying to the audience on its back page a page-advertisement of 13 Soap . In a moment he turns over to others , gives an annoyed exclamation and tosses it aside . He picks up one of the letters , opens it , gives an angry grunt , mutters disgustedly " 13 Soap " , and throws it into the waste basket JOHNSON entering door upper left.Miss Grayson is here to see you , sir  --  CYRUS a bit surprised.Miss Grayson ? Well , show her in . JOHNSON Very good , sir . He exits . MARTIN opens another paper , again sees an advertisement of 13 Soap and with considerable irritation sweeps the whole pile off the desk as JOHNSON enters , followed by MARYMiss Grayson . JOHNSON exits GRAYSON How do you do , Mr. Martin ? CYRUS Come to get your job back , I suppose ? p. 126 GRAYSON No , sir . CYRUS Well , you can have it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . CYRUS Oh , Rodney sent you to plead for him ? GRAYSON No , sir . CYRUS Then , what are you here for ? GRAYSON To make you a business proposition . CYRUS Why does n't Rodney make it himself ? GRAYSON He does n't know I 'm here . CYRUS That 's something in his favor : ca n't see much use in women tying up in men 's business . JOHNSON entering.Mr . Rodney Martin and Ambrose Peale . CYRUS Oh , the whole firm ! Send ' em in , Johnson . JOHNSON Very good , sir . He exits RODNEY and PEALE enter RODNEY Hello , father . Crosses to table PEALE How do you do , sir ? Coming down left MARTIN grunts to them both p. 127 RODNEY seeing MARY.Mary , what on earth are you doing here ? GRAYSON I came to tell your father about Marshall Field 's order . RODNEY That 's why we 're here , too . PEALE Absolutely . CYRUS Let me tell you right now , I wo n't back any fake company . RODNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've actually sold some soap . GRAYSON Fifty thousand cakes . RODNEY To Marshall Field . CYRUS Then why did you send ' em only five thousand cakes ? RODNEY Because after we 'd got that much from one of your branch factories you shut off our supply . PEALE And we could n't get any more soap anywhere . GRAYSON accusingly.And you knew it very well . Crossing to right side of MR . MARTIN RODNEY We 've still got 45,000 cakes to deliver , if we can get ' em from you . Why let all that money get out of the family ? It 's a business proposition . p. 128 CYRUS No , it is n't . Do n't fool yourself : I sent that telegram . RODNEY What telegram ? CYRUS The telegram from Marshall Field 's ordering the 50,000 cakes . GRAYSON You sent it ? CYRUS That day at the office you were pretty game , son , and to tell the truth , I felt so sorry for you , I kind of had to do something , so I sent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too ? Sits on sofa GRAYSON But what did you do it for ? CYRUS Well , I figured an order like that would stall off your creditors , and then I had fixed it with one of our factories to let you have 5,000 cakes at three cents a cake . I knew it would mean some ready cash for you from Marshall Field  --  PEALE But how did you square Marshall Field ? CYRUS Oh , I just wired ' em I 'd be responsible , and , say  --  Turning to RODNEY , who risesyou had a nerve to charge ' em sixty cents a cake  --  and I had to pay the bill ! That shipment cost me $3,000 for $150 worth of soap . PEALE laughsThat is n't funny , young man . p. 129 RODNEY No , it is n't : I thought we 'd really made good , and all the time it was you behind us  --  CYRUS You see , my boy , even if you did nearly trim me , I 've got a sort of sneaking fondness for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no market for dollar soap . RODNEY But how do you know ? CYRUS I had a letter from Marshall Field a few days ago asking me what to do with the soap . They had n't sold a cake . I told ' em to dump it in the Chicago River ; it might help to clean it up . RODNEY But you did n't give our advertising a chance . PEALE We only finished a great big advertising campaign in Chicago two days ago . RODNEY I know the soap 'll make good  --  with that trade-mark . CYRUS If your trade-mark was so marvelous , somebody besides your poor old father would have bought your soap . PEALE Oh , what 's the use ? He does n't believe in advertising ! CYRUS Oh , yes , I do : sound , conservative advertising , but not the crazy , sensational stuff you go in for . GRAYSON Oh , you 're just mad because the soap trust did n't think of 13 Soap itself . p. 130 CYRUS Why , we would n't touch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your goods will advertise you  --  that 's always been our policy . RODNEY I 'm sorry , father , but you are old-fashioned to knock the modern way of advertising . Why , do you know , the National Biscuit Company was on the verge of failing until they hit on the title , Uneeda Biscuit ? GRAYSON And since then , they have had over four hundred lawsuits to protect it . RODNEY Their trade-mark made ' em . They value that trade-mark now at six million dollars . PEALE Great stuff . Turning to MARTIN  --  and Spearmint Gum just as a trade-mark is worth seven millions . RODNEY And the Fairbanks people count their trade-mark , The Gold Dust Twins , at $10,000,000 . GRAYSON Ever hear of the Gillette Safety Razor ? CYRUS I use it myself . GRAYSON Tell him about it , Rodney . RODNEY It costs you five dollars . Do n't you know there 's a mighty good safety razor for a quarter , and dozens at a dollar , but you use the Gillette because Gillette was there first ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its trade-mark. p. 131 GRAYSON with gesture.Advertising . RODNEY and PEALE with gestureAbsolutely . PEALE Ivory Soap in the magazines alone used $450,000 worth of space in 1913  --  and at three cents a cake wholesale , that represents 15,000,000 cakes for magazine advertising alone . CYRUS I do n't believe it . PEALE Yes , and a lot of other guys did n't believe that iron ships would float or that machines heavier than air would fly , or that you could talk to ' Frisco on a wire or send a message across the Atlantic without a wire . Pardon me , sir , but you want to get on to yourself . RODNEY Yes , father , you certainly do . GRAYSON And you 'd better hurry up . CYRUS You 've got a fine lot of theories , but what have they done for those 5,000 cakes of 13 Soap out at Marshall Field 's ? PEALE Why , we have n't really spent enough money advertising . RODNEY That 's true . Every time the American Tobacco Company puts out a new cigarette they start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose they are a lot of boobs ? p. 132 RODNEY And think what other firms spend ! I 've gone into this thing , father  --  GRAYSON Yes , Rodney , let 's show him our list . RODNEY Sure , it 's an absolutely accurate list of what some of the big advertisers spent in the thirty-one leading magazines last year . Eastman Kodak , $400,000 . Postum Coffee , $125,000 , Arrow Collars , $400,000 , Melachrino Cigarettes , $100,000 , Welch 's Grape Juice , $100,000 . PEALE Grape Juice , my friend ! GRAYSON Uneeda Biscuit , $150,000 . Spearmint Gum , $140,000 . CYRUS That 's enough . RODNEY I 've only just begun . Grape Nuts , $228,000 . GRAYSON Colgate 's Dental Cream , $230,000 . PEALE Campbell 's Soups , $186,000 . GRAYSON Kellogg 's Toasted Cornflakes , $200,000 . RODNEY Quaker Oats , $367,000 , and these are only a few . You ca n't see how it pays , but you do know that it must pay or they would n't do it . GRAYSON Does that mean anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that those thirty-one magazines have only about 10,000,000 readers ? p. 133 RODNEY And that there are a hundred million people in this country . Why just to appeal to one-tenth of the population , fifty million dollars was spent in magazines last year , and each year people are getting better educated  --  more people are wanting to read . It wo n't be long before there are 25,000,000 people buying magazines , and you can reach all of them by advertising  --  get a new market , a new population to deal with . Think what national advertising is accomplishing ! It sells automobiles , vacuum cleaners , talking machines , rubber heels , kodaks , washing machines , foods , clothes , shoes , paints , houses , plumbing , electric irons , fireless cookers  --  mostly to a lot of people who 'd never even hear of ' em if it were n't for advertisements . PEALE But nowadays it is n't only people who have stoves to sell or tooth-brushes , that are spending money on publicity . Banks are advertising for money , nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and churches for congregations , and you sit there thinking it does n't pay to advertise . GRAYSON Six hundred and sixteen million dollars were spent last year in magazines and newspapers , billboards and electric signs . RODNEY Bringing education and comfort and fun and luxury to the people of the United States . It 's romance , father , the romance of printing-presses , of steel rails , of the wireless , of trains and competition , the romance of modern business , and it 's all built on advertising . Advertising is the biggest thing in this country , and it 's only just begun . p. 134 CYRUS after a pause.Why did n't you boys go into the advertising business ? You seem to know something about that ? PEALE fairly tearing his hair.Oh , what 's the use ! He 's the old school  --  we 're new blood . Coming to left of center RODNEY with enthusiasm.Youth has got it on old age . GRAYSON coming down between PEALE and RODNEY.You bet it has ! CYRUS When you boys get through talking and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see me : I 'll show you an old business that has a lot of money that is n't radical and manages to keep going without wasting a fortune in fool advertising . RODNEY Then you wo n't let us get any soap . CYRUS Risk my business reputation on a silly scheme like Dollar Soap ? I should say not ! PEALE Oh , come on . What 's the use of talking to a man whose brain is deaf ? Exeunt door upper left , keeping in step , single-file CYRUS rises and comes to center.Say when you get a new line of patter , come around . I like to hear you . Dollar Soap ! p. 135 JOHNSON enters.I beg pardon , a gentleman to see you , sir . JOHNSON hands MARTIN a card on silver tray CYRUS " Mr. Charles Bronson . " What does he want ? JOHNSON He says he 's from Marshall Field . CYRUS Oh , a kick , I suppose ? Send him in . JOHNSON Yes , sir . He exits Enter BRONSON BRONSON inquiringly.Mr . Martin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am here in reference to the 13 Soap . CYRUS Be seated . Well , what about it ? Sits in chair left of table BRONSON sits in chair right of desk.While , of course , we understand that the 13 Soap is made by your son , Mr. Rodney Martin , at the same time as you wired us you would be responsible for that order , Marshall Field felt that I should first see you in the matter . CYRUS Humph ! BRONSON We realize , of course , that you are backing your son  --  p. 136 CYRUS gruffly.Well , why should n't I back him ? BRONSON Of course , of course . That is why we 'd like to place our order through you . CYRUS amazed.Place your what ? BRONSON Through some error we received only 5,000 cakes , instead of 50,000 but that 's all gone . CYRUS All gone ? What happened to it ? BRONSON We 've sold it . CYRUS Sold it ? BRONSON Yes , and we want the balance of the original order you were kind enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can get . CYRUS But only the other day I had a letter from Marshall Field saying they had n't sold a cake . BRONSON laughing. I know , I know . We felt at first that of course there could be no popular market for a dollar soap ; we were n't as far-sighted as you were . MARTIN clears his throatBut of course , when those extraordinary advertisements appeared , so different from your usual conservative publicity , the sales began immediately ! We sold the 5,000 cakes in two days . p. 137 CYRUS And the advertising did it ? BRONSON Of course , what else ? Now we want to handle your goods exclusively in the west  --  with extensive immediate deliveries . Can that be arranged ? CYRUS It ought to be . What do you offer ? BRONSON I dare say we would contract for a quarter of a million cakes of soap . CYRUS amazed.A quarter of a million ! BRONSON misunderstanding him.Of course we might do a little better if we could settle the matter at once . CYRUS I should have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to go see him ? CYRUS rising.Not at all  --  not at all . I 'll attend to it . BRONSON But we thought that you would have full power . CYRUS As a matter of courtesy I should like to talk things over with my own boy  --  BRONSON But you control the product ? CYRUS Bronson , you can trust me to handle this thing . p. 138 BRONSON Of course , of course . When can I see you again ? CYRUS In half an hour . BRONSON Very well . I 've some matters to attend to . I 'll be back in half an hour . Going to door upper leftIt 's a wonderful soap , Mr. Martin . CYRUS dryly.Oh , wonderful . BRONSON See you in half an hour . BRONSON exits CYRUS Wonderful soap  --  plain pink castile . I 've got to get in on this . He goes to ' phone1313 Bryant . Hello , is this the 13 Soap Company ? JOHNSON enters.Oh , beg pardon , sir , but  --  CYRUS Just a minute . Is Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . Good-bye . Johnson , call up my son 's office every ten minutes and let me know the minute he comes in . Do n't tell ' em who 's calling . Crosses to right JOHNSON Yes , sir . CYRUS And when Mr. Bronson comes back , be sure to have him wait for me . JOHNSON Yes , sir . There 's a lady to see you , sir . She speaks English now . p. 139 CYRUS She does , eh ? That 's unusual , is n't it ? JOHNSON I mean , sir , when she was here two months ago she could only talk French . CYRUS Indeed ! Well , I 'm not interested in the languages she speaks . Who is she , and what does she want ? JOHNSON She wishes to see you about the French right of the 13 Soap . CYRUS The what ? JOHNSON The French rights . CYRUS Great Scott ! Send her right in . JOHNSON Yes , sir . The Countess de Bowreen . He exits COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN enters.How do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN I am the Countess de Beaurien . Your son have told you of me ! CYRUS No . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN I bet he have not . He is a cheat  --  he trick me . CYRUS Now , my dear lady  --  COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Attendez , you listen to me : two months ago there in that very room , I buy the French rights for the 13 Soap . I pay him 15,000 dollar and now I can not get any soap . p. 140 CYRUS You will have to see my son . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN But I have seen him , and he give me no satisfaction . If I can not get any soap , I must have my money , one or the other , or I put him in the jail . He is a cheat . I have here ze contract . I sue him in the court . CYRUS My dear lady , you must n't feel that way . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Feel ! Ah , mon dieu  --  I trick no one , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ je vous dis que je suis honnte , trs honnte dans mes affaires . Monsieur votre fils m'a donn le contrat , et j'insiste qu'il est trs malhonnte . Je n'ai pas l'habitude d ' tre si maltrait , monsieur , et je rpte que je ferai tout mon possible d'obtenir les quinze mille dollars que me dot Monsieur votre fils , et s'il ne me les donne pas , je le poursuivrai sans cesse . Comprenez-vous , Monsieur ? She takes the contract from him CYRUS But I do n't understand French . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Pardon , Monsieur , always I am excited I speak the French . But ! If you love your son , you pay me back , or else he go to jail . What you say ? CYRUS But $15,000 is a lot of money . p. 141 COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Yes . But it is more to me than it is to you . You pay me , or he go to prison . Now what you say ? JOHNSON enters CYRUS What is it ? JOHNSON I beg pardon , a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Bronson ? JOHNSON No , sir . JOHNSON hands him card CYRUS By George , just the man I want to see ! Show him right in . Hold on , hold on . Now , Duchess , if you do n't mind , just step in this room a minute . Indicating room lower right COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN No , no , I do not like that room : I have been there before . CYRUS Here is a nice room . Points to room lower leftYou will find it very comfortable . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Very well , I wait . Crosses to leftBut in fifteen minutes if I do not get the 15,000 dollar , I go to my lawyers , and your son  --  poof ! he is done . Talking in French as she exits CYRUS to JOHNSON.Did you get my son 's office ? p. 142 JOHNSON Yes , sir  --  he has n't come in . CYRUS If you reach him while Mr. Peale 's here do n't mention Rodney 's name ; just call him " that party . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits PEALE enters door upper left CYRUS Now , see here , young man ! PEALE Now , one moment , Mr. Martin . I just want to say that I am a man of few words  --  that this is n't advertising , it 's personal . I know you do n't like me . CYRUS Why do you say that ? PEALE Because I 'm a pretty wise gink . CYRUS Well , you are a bit  --  PEALE Fresh ! Well , I guess that 's right , too . But that 's me  --  I 'm not your style . Here 's the idea : your son has been immense to me . Great kid , and it struck me the reason you would n't back him was because I was mixed up in his business . So I just came to say if that 's the situation , why I 'm out , that 's all . You go ahead with him alone . CYRUS You 're not a partner ? PEALE I should say not . I 'm just a hired hand . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of guy who 'd do that . p. 143 CYRUS Then you have n't power to sign , to make a deal ? PEALE I should say not . Why , he and Miss Grayson do all the signing . If I could have signed contracts , I 'd have spent a million dollars in advertising . And believe me , you ought to back him , because , honest , Mr. Martin , it 's a great scheme  --  the 13 Soap , on the level , if it 's handled right and the publicity end is  --  CYRUS Now do n't get started on advertising . PEALE That 's right , too . Well , I guess that 's all . I wanted to tell you how I stood about Rodney . That 's off my chest , so good afternoon . Starts to go CYRUS Wait a minute . What did you boys mean by trimming that poor Countess on the French rights ? PEALE Jumping Jupiter ; has she been here ? CYRUS She 's here now . PEALE What did she come to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail for fraud unless I made good that $15,000 . I 've got to pay her  --  ca n't see the boy disgraced . PEALE Say , if you 'd like to save that $15,000 , I 'll fix it for you . CYRUS But she 's got a contract . p. 144 PEALE I 'll get it for you cheap . Pardon me , sir , but I know how to handle dames like her . CYRUS Mr. Peale , I like you . Slaps him on shoulder PEALE Huh ! CYRUS Have a cigar ? PEALE crosses right . He takes it as JOHNSON enters JOHNSON I just telephoned that party , he is at his office now . CYRUS Good , good . Peale , I 've got to go out on an important soap deal . He starts to go , then goes to PEALEOh , by George , I nearly forgot . There 's another matter I must attend to first . Peale , you 'll find the Countess in there . Do the best you can  --  we 'll settle the details when I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This cigar 's great company . CYRUS Good cigar , eh ? PEALE Corker . CYRUS Johnson , send over half a dozen boxes of these cigars to Mr. Peale 's house . He 'll give you the address .

PEALE walks over to the window and looks out at the 13 Soap signs PEALE the telephone rings . PEALE looks at it , it rings again , he goes over to desk and raises it.Yes , Sweetie  --  this is the garage . How long does it take to go to Coney Island ? How in hell do I know ? Business of changing money and watch to different pockets . Goes to door left , and opens itCountess de Bull Run . He goes into some fake FrenchDe juis  --  de joie  --  politesse noblesse oblige .

COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN What do you think ? PEALE See here , now , if you 're aiming to trim the old man , I wo n't stand for it . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Ambrose , do me a favor . PEALE What is it ? p. 146 COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Do n't tell old Martin what I tried to do to you boys . He 's the kind that would put me in jail . I 'll be on the level . I did come here to try to trim him , but I 'll cut it out . Honest , I will . Oh , Ambrose , I do n't like being a grafter . I 've had to do a lot of things I did n't want to . You do n't know how hard it is for girls like me . I never had a show . I ran away from home when I was a kid . I 've been pretty much up against it . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and queer me ? PEALE Nix , nix  --  COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Give me a chance to be on the square . It ai n't easy for a girl to fight it out all by herself when she 's all alone : no money  --  no friends and you got to live  --  live on five a week . You got a lot for a good time , have n't you ? God , I 've been lonely sometimes ; you 've got to be pretty smart to steer straight  --  but I 've done it , I 've done it , I 've done it . She breaks down and sits on chair right of desk PEALE kindly.Now , see here , Countess  --  He pats her on back  --  do n't do that  --  do n't , do n't  --  She is sobbing a littleOh , quit it . A pauseKeep it for some poor boob who 'll fall for it . p. 147 COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN tearfully.Oh , Ambrose , do n't talk like that  --  PEALE Say , honest , it 's foolish wasting it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radiant smile . Rises.Well , it 's always worth trying once . PEALE genially.Sure it is . Why , you had me winging for a minute , but when you pulled that wheeze about " I 've done it " , three times in succession , I knew it was phoney . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN But , honest , I was on the level about old Martin . PEALE Nix , nix , you came here to trim him for the $15,000 on the French rights . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Gosh , have you seen him ? PEALE Yes , he left me here to settle it . Where 's the contract ? Come on  --  gim me  --  gim me  --  COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN You mean you 've been on all the time ? PEALE Sure . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN And you let me sit there and emote all over the place . PEALE Gim me  --  gim me  --  p. 148 COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Oh , I suppose I 've got to . Oh , I 'm sick of soap anyhow . 13 may be a lucky hunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . PEALE And now , my little hearts of lettuce , this concludes your portion of the evening 's entertainment . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN But at that , do n't give me away , will you ? PEALE I like you , you 've got brains . Most chickens are just chickens . COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN You are 18-karat , kid . MARY , followed by RODNEY , enters hurriedly and sees PEALE RODNEY Oh , have you seen father ? Is he here ? PEALE I 'm waiting for him now . GRAYSON It 's most important . PEALE You remember the Countess ? All bow embarrassed . Pause COMTESSE DE BEAURIEN Well , I guess I 'm not wanted , so I 'll trot . I 'll trot . Goes to door upper leftSo long , you 13 Soap suds . Exits GRAYSON Where is father ? PEALE Yes , what 's the excitement ? p. 149 GRAYSON Just after we got to the office there was a letter from Macy 's RODNEY Ordering 10,000 cakes of 13 Soap . GRAYSON Now what do you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going down right RODNEY They say our advertising 's wonderful and has created such a demand they want to handle the soap in town . Goes around table down right PEALE wonderingly.Then all the things we said to your father are really true ? Goes up center GRAYSON Of course they are . RODNEY protesting.Now , see here , old man  --  PEALE Gosh ! Coming down in front of table RODNEY You see , when I show father this letter from Macy 's he 's got to admit we 've won out , and supply us with soap . GRAYSON Is n't it a shame that you ca n't get soap from anybody but him ? RODNEY He certainly has got the soap business tied up tight . p. 150 PEALE Yes , if he busted , the whole world would go dirty . GRAYSON Suppose he 's still stubborn and wo n't help you ? What 'll you do ? RODNEY Oh , I 'll just have to plod along . PEALE Do n't plod  --  gallop , son  --  gallop  --  gallop . RODNEY You 're a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peele , I 'd like you awfully .

BRONSON Why , you seem surprised  --  GRAYSON Oh , no  --  not a bit . RODNEY Oh , not a bit . PEALE  --  You mean people are actually coming into the store and buying it ? BRONSON At a dollar a cake . MARY and RODNEY take arm-chair from left of table and place it in center of stage RODNEY and MARY . Have a chair ? PEALE Give me your hat ! Takes hat and fans himself GRAYSON It was those page advertisements in Chicago that did it . PEALE Absolutely . BRONSON Extraordinary advertisements they were , too .

It 's an amazing soap . p. 153 RODNEY It 's more than that  --  PEALE Absolutely . BRONSON Do you control the company yourself ? RODNEY Oh , entirely . BRONSON Then I can deal with you . RODNEY With us  --  all of us . BRONSON We would be glad to contract now for 250,000 cakes . PEALE just flops into chairWith deliveries to begin next week . GRAYSON Our capacity just at present is limited . RODNEY Yes , we have so many orders on hand . BRONSON Naturally , but how much soap can you deliver now ? RODNEY I do n't quite know . To MARYDo you ? GRAYSON Not quite . To PEALEDo you ? PEALE Not quite . BRONSON Well , under the circumstances , what can we do ? GRAYSON That 's the question . PEALE What 's the answer ? Rises . A pause p. 154 RODNEY Here 's an idea : in view of our pressing orders , would you consider for the moment paying us merely for the use of our trade-mark without any soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PEALE You would ? BRONSON Your trade-mark is of course your biggest asset . RODNEY Yes , of course . BRONSON You would naturally give us your formula ? PEALE Yes , if we still have that cook-book . BRONSON I beg pardon ? PEALE Nothing , nothing . Have a cigar ? RODNEY You can have the formula . BRONSON With a license from you to use the title , we could probably arrange to have the soap manufactured by Cyrus Martin of the soap trust . RODNEY Oh , you think you could  --  ? GRAYSON How much would you be willing to pay us for the trade-mark ? BRONSON I should have to call up our Chicago office , but I think I can safely say we would be prepared to offer you at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . p. 155 PEALE gasping.Indeed ! BRONSON Can I have an option at that figure ? GRAYSON No ! PEALE Yes ! Together RODNEY Yes  --  GRAYSON loudly.No ! RODNEY No ! PEALE No , but I hate to say it . BRONSON But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RODNEY Why not , Mary ? PEALE Yes , why not , Mary ? GRAYSON Had n't we better discuss the matter a little more fully first among ourselves ? BRONSON Perhaps I could wait somewhere for a few minutes while you talk things over ? GRAYSON opening door left. Yes , do , please  --  in the library . BRONSON I am very glad to have met you . RODNEY Not half as glad  --  PEALE Not half so glad  --  p. 156 GRAYSON  --  not half as glad as we are to have met you . PEALE No , not half as much ! BRONSON exits left lower door RODNEY Why not give him an option at a quarter of a million ? PEALE Yes , why not ? For the love of gee whiz , tell us that ! GRAYSON Because maybe we can get more money than that out of your father . JOHNSON enters with letter , and crosses to table right RODNEY Mary , you are a wonder . PEALE Gosh , I wish you were going to marry me ! GRAYSON Johnson , oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHNSON I beg pardon , Miss ? GRAYSON Will you do me a favor ? JOHNSON Why , yes , Miss . GRAYSON When Mr. Martin comes back , do n't tell him that Rodney and Mr. Peale are here , or Bronson , either ; say I 'm alone . JOHNSON Yes , Miss , but Mr. Martin just drove up in his car , he 'll be here directly  --  GRAYSON Hurry up , then , tell him I 'm here , waiting for him . JOHNSON exits p. 157 RODNEY But I do n't understand ? PEALE Neither do I. GRAYSON I do . I 've got a great idea . You two boys go into that room , indicating lower rightand stay there . When I ring this buzzer twice , you call me on this ' phone  --  there 's a switch in there  --  and never mind what I say . Hurry now , both of you . RODNEY But what 's your plan ? GRAYSON I 'm going to try to make a deal with your father . PEALE Well , I 'll slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You tell him that I 've got that contract . He 'll understand . RODNEY But I do n't know what any of this is about ? PEALE Neither do I. Come on , she 's got more brains than both of us . They exit right MARY settles herself in chair left of desk , as MARTIN enters CYRUS Hello , Miss Grayson , this is a pleasant surprise . Where is Rodney ? GRAYSON That does n't matter . I 'm here . CYRUS Where 's that  --  that  --  Mr.  --  ? GRAYSON Mr. Peale  --  oh , Mr. Peale 's gone back to the office  --  but he told me to tell you that he 'd got that contract  --  p. 158 CYRUS Great , great ! He 's a smart boy . GRAYSON We are all smart  --  it 's a smart firm . We just got a letter from Macy 's for 10,000 cakes of 13 Soap , and this time you did n't send a telegram  --  CYRUS Macy 's , eh ? Well , well . Now , I 'll be frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got to help . You started this scheme . Now finish it up . GRAYSON What 's changed you all of a sudden ? CYRUS Well , Macy 's , for one thing . That shows sensational advertising does pay . Those boys are right . I 've been too conservative , but anyhow I 've got the whip hand : Rodney ca n't get his soap for Macy 's except from me , and if I 'm going to furnish three-cent soap that he sells wholesale for sixty cents , I 'm going to be in on the profits . Any young man who can do that is just bound to have me for a partner whether he wants me or not . What do you say , Miss Grayson ? GRAYSON I 'll do all I can for Rodney . CYRUS You have authority to close the deal ? GRAYSON Absolutely . CYRUS Good . Now , what 's your proposition ? Sits GRAYSON Five hundred thousand dollars cash . p. 159 CYRUS rising.What ! GRAYSON calmly.Sit down . That is n't all : we get fifty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factory and give Rodney $50,000 a year . Peale , $30,000 , and me $20,000 . CYRUS As my son once observed what a lovely autumn we 're having ! He leans back and lights a cigar . As he does so , MARY pushes the buzzer twice . N.B. The audience must hear this buzzer . Almost instantly the ' phone rings . MARY quickly takes ' phone GRAYSON Shall I answer it ? CYRUS Go ahead  --  say I 'm out . GRAYSON in ' phone.Oh , hello  --  To MARTINIt 's for me . Hello , Rodney  --  you 've seen Bronson ? CYRUS sitting up.Bronson ? GRAYSON in ' phone.He did ? Why , that 's a splendid offer . I hardly dared think Marshall Field would be so generous . CYRUS promptly . Rises.I 'll accept your proposition , Miss Grayson . GRAYSON Wait . In ' phoneHave you closed with Bronson yet ? p. 160 CYRUS What 's he say ? GRAYSON Oh , you have n't ? CYRUS Good . GRAYSON No , I think you 'd better come right up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , let me talk to him . He reaches for ' phone GRAYSON quickly.Oh , hello , hello . She jiggles ' phoneOh , dear , we 've been cut off . Still , it does n't matter ; it 's all settled now . CYRUS That 's splendid , Miss Grayson . I 'm mighty grateful to you . GRAYSON nervously.Shall we sign a memorandum now ? CYRUS Sure  --  sure  --  just the rough details . GRAYSON Sure , never put off till tomorrow what you can sign to-day . CYRUS he crosses to table right , sits and makes memoranda . Writing.Fifty-one per cent .  --  Rodney  --  fifty thousand . And what 's that young man 's name again  --  Spiel  --  ? GRAYSON Peale . CYRUS That certainly is one hell of a name  --  thirty thousand  --  Grayson twenty thousand . There . To MARYYou sign here . p. 161 GRAYSON No , you sign first . MARTIN grunts and signsNow I 'll sign for Rodney . She does so gleefully CYRUS That 's great . Rises and goes left GRAYSON You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've a big surprise for you . Rodney 's not at the office  --  he 's in there . CYRUS What do you mean ? GRAYSON Only that I thought I 'd handle you less sentimentally than he would . You see , once before I spoiled Rodney 's plan . This time I thought I ought to fix it up for him . Opening doorRodney  --  Ambrose . CYRUS Say , what is all this ? RODNEY and PEALE enter RODNEY Hello , father ! GRAYSON Rodney , it 's all settled . Your father has gone in with us . I 've the contract . RODNEY Then we can get some soap ! CYRUS All you want . RODNEY Then I do n't care what the arrangement is  --  now that we can make good  --  twenty per cent . of the profits , and any old salary . p. 162 CYRUS Twenty per cent. ! Why , she buncoed me out of fifty-one percent . and half a million down . PEALE gasping.Half a million ! RODNEY to MARY.You did ? Mary , you are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of my contract with you , you now owe me ten per cent . of what Rodney has made : $50,000 . RODNEY What contract ? PEALE I do n't get you . CYRUS So that 's why you held me up , eh ? Just to get your ten per cent . Say , young lady , I 've got a lot of other money that you are overlooking . RODNEY Father , what do you mean ? CYRUS to RODNEY.I 'll tell you what I mean . She got engaged to you to make you go to work  --  she only left me to keep you on the job because I promised her ten per cent . of what you earned . All the time that she 's been pretending she would marry you , she 's been making use of you . Goes to right of table to sign check RODNEY Mary , you did this to me ? p. 163 PEALE I do n't believe it . GRAYSON to MARTIN.You owe me fifty thousand dollars  --  can I have the check , please ? CYRUS Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for good . GRAYSON Certainly . CYRUS I 'm disappointed to think you 'd treat my boy like this . GRAYSON What 's the difference ? If I 'd really loved him , you 'd have objected to his marrying only a typewriter . CYRUS Objected ! If you 'd been on the level I 'd have been proud to have you for my daughter . Handling check to RODNEY RODNEY gleefully.Hurrah , Mary , it 's all right ! PEALE I do n't get you . CYRUS What is this  --  a joke ? Rises RODNEY Certainly it is : you two put up a joke on me , and Mary and I thought we 'd put up one for you . Mary told me about that fool contract weeks ago . CYRUS You mean you 're going to marry her ? RODNEY Certainly not . p. 164 PEALE Now see here  --  CYRUS Why are n't you going to marry her ? RODNEY Because we were married this morning , and we thought before we told you of our marriage we 'd get her percentage for a wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to MARY GRAYSON And it 's bigger than we ever hoped for . CYRUS By George , you boys were right : I am an old fool . Anyhow , I 'll win that bet from old John Clark . GRAYSON And now for Bronson . Goes to door left lowerOh , Mr. Bronson ? CYRUS You boys know Bronson ? GRAYSON Oh , yes , we had a long talk , with him , right in this room , about a proposition from Marshall Field  --  Enter BRONSON BRONSON crosses to MARTIN , SR . Mr. Martin  --  Mr. Peale . RODNEY to BRONSON.Now you talk to father . GRAYSON Yes , you talk to him , father . PEALE Yes , father , you talk to him . p. 165 BRONSON to RODNEY .
