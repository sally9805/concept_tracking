txt From his cell in the Tombs , which he is soon to leave for another and more dreary one in the little death houae at Sing Sing , Charles Becker , the former Lieutenant of Police , issued a statement yesterday in which he reerred to the verdict against him as nothing more nor less than " legal butchery . " Becker fully realizes that his condition is as desperate as it well could be , and in many respects he has become very dejected . In a conversation with a friend , susequent to his conviction , he remarked bitterly that every chance had been denied him . " Even a dog , " he said , " would have had a better Show than was given to me . " Becker gave out his statement ) through his brother John , who was among the first to visit him yesterday morning . This is what John Becker said his convicted brother had to say : " All you can do is to emphasize that my conviction is nothing but a legal butchery . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , That is *2,000 more than I ever pos-1 sessed or ever will possess . This could have been proven had I taken the ; stand and told my story to the jury.1 I will say that I have very little left , and that wo n't last long . " I see the purpose of putting out these false reports . No consideration is shown eiter to Mrs. Becker or to myself in this matter . I do n't expect any now , and I wo n't be surprised if I am marched straight from the court- , room on Wednes lay to Sing Sifig , and that despite the fact that I am supposed to be entitled to ten days after sentence . That 's all a part of the railroading of Becker . " Dreads Transfer to Sing Sing . Becker appears crushed , and the ordeal that awaits him in the death chamber at Sing Sing constantly works on his mind . He dreads the long months he will be in the death chamber more than anything else connected with his sentence , except the mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transfer to Sing Sing that he uttered the words " Even a dog would have had a better show " than was given to him . Soon ** Becker left the Tombs DI/ .3 . Becker , the wife of the prisoner , arrived there , and was taken immediately to Cell 112 , occupied by her husband . Mrs. Becker appeared to be in much better health than on Friday . She talked with her husband through the bars of his cell , but did not remain with him long . Mrs. Becker had no statement to make on leaving the Tombs , while her husband returned without answers the notes sent to him by reporters requesting interviews , In the meantime Becker 's lawyers have already begun Work on the appeal that is to be taken to the Court of Appeals , asking for a reversal of the verdict of Wednesday night and a new trial for the condemned man . John F. and John W. Hart , Becker 's lawyers , were in consultation yesterday afternoon , and their intention is to expedite the anpeal proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the stories that it might be a year before the 1Court of Appeals could act were erroneous , and it was possible that the appeal would be settled one way or the other I within half that time . Shapiro a State 's Witness ? Great as is the mental anguish of Becker , , it is as nothing compared to the mental condition of " Gyp the Blood , " " Lefty Louie , " " Whitey " Lewis , and " Dago Frank , " the four gunmen awaiting trial for the actual murder of Herman Rosenthal . These gangsters , have at last come to a full realization that the electric chair may be their end , jand with the realization has come a great fear . It was rumored yesterday that one or all of the gunmen were willing to turn State 's evidence in the last desperate effort to save themselves from the death penalty . One story that was current was that District Attorney Whitman might consider permitting one of the fotia to turn State 's evidence for the purpose of cornetiora.ting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by the-murderers , will tell on the . stand ' when the , . gunmen are brought to the bar . Color was given to this story , by- the fact that Aaron J. Levy , who is counsel for Shapiro , had a conference with Assistant District Attorney Frank Moss yesterday day morning . Mr. Moss declined to say what he and Mr. Levy had talked about , but denied that Shapiro had confessed to anything in addition to what he had already stated on the stand during Becker 's trial , and added that no stipulation of immunity had been granted to Mr. Levy 's client . The impression grows stronger , however , that when the time does come Shapiro will come forward as the identifier of the men charged with the actual killing of Rosenthal . Gunmen 's Defense . While the gunmen were cringing in their cells ex-City Magistrate Charles F. Wahle , their counsel , was busy preparing their cases for trial . Despite the gloomy indications , H. L. Kringel , who is Mr. Wahle 's law partner and who will assist him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good defense and that reports that One or more of them was considering turning State 's evidence was untrue in every detail . " There will be no confession from , any of these men , " said Mr. Kringel , " and the story that they are in mortal fear and all that is utter rot . They are still confident and when the time comes they will present a defense that will surprise a lot of people . I am not prepared to say what the defense will be , but I can assure you that it will be a good one . Then the story that these four boys remained awake to hear the Becker verdict is untrue . They were all sound asleep when the verdict was rendered and , did not know anything about it until yesterday morning at 5 o'clock when they awoke . " " Will the defense of the gunmen be an alibi ? " Mr. Kringel was asked . " Sorry , but I can not answer that question , " he replied . Mr. Kringel said that it had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , although he seemed to think the first man would be " Whitey " Lewis or " Lefty Loule . ' ! It is not known when jacob A. Reich , who prefers to be known as " Jack Sul- ' livan , will be placed on trial , but the indications are that he will be the last one . Sullivan 's friends are exerting themselves in his behalf and his is the one case in which Mr. Whitman will find his greatest trouble in securing a conviction , according to those familiar with the crime and all its ramifications . Sullivan 's defense will be that he was not at the shooting and that the first he knew of it was when he saw Rosenthal 's body in front of the Hotel Metropole . Becker is receiving with every mail many letters , some from cranks and a few from women . In some of them the writers refer to him as a martyr . as the victim of a plot , and so on One letter received yesterday was a perfumed affair and contained several pressed violets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose , " Bridgey " Webber . and Harry Vallon , the informers whose testimony more than anything else convicted Becker . are waiting for their release , but it is doubtful If any of them save Schepps , anticipates with arty degree of pleasure the release from confinement . The men will be guarded when set free and every effort will be made by the authorities to protect them from the vengeance of the gangster friends of the men now waiting trial for murder in the Tombs .
