THOUGH it was in 1513 that Ponce de Leon came sailing from Puerto Rico to find the waters of youth , it was not till i565 that the terrible , the cruel ( yet no more responsibly cruel or terrible than a tiger ) Pedro Menendez de Aviles came in sight of those sands , and fell upon the weak-minded , fever-wasted Huguenots whom he found in possession and captured and slaughtered these heretics , and put Spain and God in keeping of their own . again . The tale need hardly be repeated here ; once for all the pious , pitiless Pedro has told it for himself to his king , the pious , pitiless Philip , in a letter found among the colonial archives at Seville and included among other curious documents in The Unknown History of Our Country , as it is entitled by the lady of St. Augustine who compiled it . The Lutherans , as Menendez , like all the Spaniards of his time , called the Huguenots , were by the laws and usage of the time illegally there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Christian to destroy them . He was much concerned besides in saving the souls of the savages from these Lutherans who had the gift of insinuating affection for themselves among the Indians along with their heretical instruction . There is something wonderful in the moral security of the murderer 's account of his crime , which was not a private or personal murder so much as a political act duly avenged on the Spaniards by the French , when their turn came . For the present the French were miserably officered ; they were spent by hunger and sickness ; the winds and waves were leagued with the Spaniards against them ; and they gave themselves up to Menendez , as he had fairly stipulated , without any promise ofmercy . Then he took them out from their comrades ' sight by tens till he had put them all to death , except a few who proved to be of the true faith just in time , and other few who were such excellent artificers that their skill could not be spared by the captors who spared their lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by Menendez worthy of an hidalgo who was born in Granada and who knew how a gentleman should behave in such a matter . He had their hands bound , and led them aside , and then , to spare their feelings , he had them stabbed in the hack . There was bloodshed of this sort or that pretty well everywhere along these white sands , but death had so long died out of the dead that one day when we motored down Anastasia Island to a point where there had been a battle , we lunched on the table stretched under the trees of a pleasant farm , and used a half-petrified skull to keep down our Japanese paper table - spread without molestation from its terrible memories . It does not sound very pleasant , but we were no more aware of the petrifaction 's human quality than it was of ours , and in the farm-yard near by the peachtrees kept on with their leisurely blossoming as if there had never been slaughter of French or Spaniards in the shade where we ate our sandwiches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drained our thermos-bottles of their coffee . In fact , after the Spaniards were with comparatively little wanton bloodshed secure in their hold of Florida , life at St. Augustine went on in the paternal terms which the obedient children of their fatherly kings found kindly enough . During those three hundred years , one Philip followed another from the Second till the Fourth , and St. Augustine drowsed under their rule till some successor of them ceded it to the British in exchange for Cuba , which the British had somehow ( it does not matter how ) come by . Meanwhile , as the papers from the Sevillian archives testify , the bond between the prince and his far-off subjects was close if not tender . When any of them was in trouble he wrote to the king ; a priest who fancied himself wronged in his duties or privileges wrote ; the families of old soldiers wrote , dunning for their pensions ; any one who had a grievance against any other , or a pull of his own , wrote to the king . Sometimes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps he did not personally read all those letters . When , in due course , his faithful lieges began to build him that beautiful fort of San Marco they wrote so pressingly and constantly for money that the kings made its cost their joke . One Philip said he thought they must have now got it so high that he ought to see its bastions from Madrid ; another asked if they were making its curtains of solid silver . By that time , from one cause or another , the royal funds had begun to run low ; the English buccaneers had long since learned to tap them at their sources in the galleons bringing the gold and silver ingots up the Spanish Main from South America . When the authorities of St. Augustine had got the lofty bastions of San Marco finally tip and the solid-silver curtains down , General Oglethorpe , who had meanwhile settled Georgia , marched a force of Englishmen through the forests and morasses to Anastasia and sat down before the stronghold , and began to bombard it . But in their season there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island and they bit his sick and homesick soldiers fearfully . Still he held on , and he might have reduced the stronghold and the starving population of three thousand civilian refugees within its walls if one day a relief of Spanish ships had not come sailing up from Havana . Then the British general struck his tents and led his bitten and baffled forces home through the forests and morasses . San Marco has never been attacked since , for when our revolution broke out , Florida did not join the other colonies in their revolt against the British , who remained peaceably enough in possessiontill they ceded the province back to Spain . Then the old city resumed its slumbers in her keeping , till Spain in her turn ceded Florida , with its Seminole War , to the United States , when the name of the fort was changed , fatuously enough , from San Marco to Fort Marion , in honor of a hero whose side Florida had not taken in our revolt . It is devoted now mainly to rousing and allaying the curiosity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in their lives realize what a past they had no part in was like . In this way it serves the best possible use , but otherwise it is employed as the scene of rehearsals for the more populous events of the picture-plays . On a single occasion last year a company of three hundred combatants ? white and black , men , women , and children , hired overnight for the purposeth ronged the noble place and repelled each other in an invasion by the Japanese , with a constant explosion of old-fashioned musketry which sounded like the detonations of the unmuffled motors of a fleet of such boats as infest all our inland or coastwise waters . These , no longer in the force of former years , make themselves heard over the still waters of the bay at St. Augustine any especially fine evening , when they madden the echoes with their infernal racketing . No longer as in their former years , I say , but they are still in such force as to keep frightened away the sail-boats which used to flock there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . Otherwise the bay is not crowded with any sort of craft : a few yachts of houseboat model ; the little steamers which ply between St. Augustine and Daytona , the Fishing craft which bring the inexhaustible oysters and their multifarious finny kindred to the excellent fish-market ; and , on stated days , the great , swelling sternwheel steamboat arriving from Jacksonville as from the Western rivers of sixty years ago formed the pleasure and business of the port ; though I must not forget the two gasolene packets running to the North beaches , at hours which it took them the whole of January to ascertain and specify . Otherwise the port offered a good reproduction of the two centuries of calm which it must have enjoyed during the Spanish rule ; to be sure there was now the rattling of the trolley-car over the extortionate toll - bridge to the island which could not have been heard then , or even imagined . I like to fancy that time as one of entire peacefulness for all not of the New Religion who after the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time lingers yet in a few half-dozen old coquina houses standing flush upon the streets . One of them stood next to our own , covered , roof and wall , with ivy and with roses and yellow bignonia flowers , where Prince Murat , the Bonapartist heir of the Neapolitan throne , lived and died in a long , unmolested exile . We found it a charmingly simple interior , much like that of the little house so lately owned and occupied by a gentle , elderly Spanish lady who received us like friends upon fit introduction , but had to keep her street door locked against the tourists apt to make themselves at home by walking in without ceremony . The door was overhung by a true Spanish balcony , and behind the house reposed an old garden of trees and flowers and vegetables , with the only staircase of the house climbing the outer wall from it . The gentle lady was proud of the age of her house , which she held as great as that of the oldest house in St. Augustine in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivalry between oldest houses in St. Augustine , but after making friends with her we would admit no competition . We always looked for her in the quaint garden as we passed , and we were always hoping to go into it again , when one day suddenly , as such things seem to come to one in St. Augustine , we heard that she was dead of pneumonia . By chance also we saw her funeral starting from the cathedral , and then , keeping our own course , we fell in behind the sad train by another chance , and followed till it left us to keep its way to the and and sandy new cemetery of her church . 1'he old Spanish cemetery , now disused , lies far away on the edge of the marshes to the northwest , where it was sweet one morning to find it basking in the sun , under its wilding cedars , in the keeping of the cows which made it theirpasturage . When I wandered a little way among its forgotten and neglected graves , I found no name Spanisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been Spanisher names ; I only say 1 did not happen on them then , though later , following the wandering cow-paths , I did find such a name as , say , Lopez . But at the worst the old Spanish cemetery is not so all misnamed as the old Huguenot burialground , where no Huguenot was ever buried , and where you can not read a solitary name of French accent or denomination . The Old Religion , as distinguished from the New Religion which the Huguenots professed , is the faith which now perhaps not unfitly prevails in St. Augustine , but there is a great variety in the Protestant faiths , let alone that difference of white and black which is of such marked emphasis that I do not suppose any one could get to heaven from a church where he was not properly segregated . The colored churches , divided from the white , are again divided by such a nice distinction , for example , as Methodist Episcopal and African Methodist Episcopal . Many of the colored people , however , are broadly Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the white . When the king of Spain ceded Florida to the king of England , late in the eighteenth century , the Spanish inhabitants of St. Augustine largely , if not mostly , went away to Cuba , but their religion continued in the primacy which it still enjoys . The cathedral fronting the Plaza from the north is not the cathedral of former days , but a dignified reproduction of the cathedral devoured by the flames which in St. Augustine seem to have a peculiar appetite for the older edifices . One steps into it from the twentieth century and finds oneself in the serious silence which is the same in all the temples of that faith , and which one might almost persuade oneself was a religious emotion and not the esthetic impression it really is . It makes one wish for the moment that one were of the Old Religion , and this was the effect with me when I woke in the morning and heard the nuns ' sweet voices rising in their matins over the gardens of the girls ' school across the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound and sight of that place , and one felt something of an unmerited consecration from it ; when one met two of those kind sisters , who always came and went in twos , one gladly stepped from the narrow footway of St. George Street , and gave way to them with a sense of unmerited blessing from the sight of them . The figure of St. Joseph looked down , at first glance rather apparitionally , from an upper window across the flowers , and seemed to bless them in the benediction not withheld from the shrill hilarity of the girl children and the undergraduates romping at their noonday games in the open galleries . One night we went to a dramatic performance in the school given by a sisterhood of young people from the outside under the nuns ' auspices , with blameless dances and instructive mythological tableaux . When we would not wait for the play which was to follow these we were stayed by one of the girl pupils and entreated to remain ; the play was going to be the best thing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remain . Such spare incidents were the most salient events of our sojourn , which I could easily pretend was full of much more startling experiences . St. Augustine is indeed the setting of almost any most dramatic fact , as the companies of movieplayers , rehearsing their pantomimes everywhere , so recurrently testified . No week passed without the encounter of these genial fellow-creatures dismounting from motors at this picturesque point or that , or delaying in them to darken an eye , or redden a lip or cheek , or pull a bodice into shape , before alighting to take part in the drama . I talk as if there were no men in these affairs , but there were plenty , preferably villains , like brigands or smugglers or savages , with consoling cowboys or American cavalrymen for the rescue of ladies in extremity . Seeing the films so much in formation , we naturally went a great deal to see them ultimated in the movietheaters , where we found them nearly all bad . In this I do not suppose that they differed from the movie-drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theywere less offensive as they were more romantic ; when they tried to be realistic they illustrated the life of crime in the East , and of violence in the West . There was very little comedy , but one night , in the representation of a medieval action , an involuntary stroke of burlesque varied the poetry of the love interest when the mechanical piano , which had been set to the music of the tango , continued that deplorable strain while the funeral of a nun slowly paced through the garden of the convent to the chapel . The general vulgarity and worse seemed the more pity because the theaters were always well filled not only with prouder visitors from the great hotels , and the friendly roomers from everywhere , but with nice - looking townspeople , who had brought their children with them when they had not let them come alone . The children seemed about at most hours of their parents ' waking , and , as in Italy and Spain , one saw little ones of tender age sharing their pleasures of the public places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paths of the Plaza , or hung upon the railing of the alligator 's bath-tub , and admired his secular repose ; now and then one fell asleep at its mother 's knee , and I thought the whole usage homelike and kindly , however not perfectly wise . It was at least part of the native life , which the tourist life so much overran ; and yet that tourist life was genial , too . It went and came in conversible enjoyment of the place , from its various lodgings and from the delicatessen shops where it inexpensively fed . As the season advanced it thickened upon the WWII , and the dwellers up and down the more convenient streets were adventurously besought to share their houses with the roomers . We ourselves were not exempt from their entreaties , and I do not yet quite know how we escaped having one mother in Israel for a paying guest ; she sat down at her own suggestion to argue the matter with us , and I thought really she had much of the logic on her side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich glow from the mass of the live-oak logs burning on our hearth , and I did not blame her ; rather do I blame myself , and shall always blame , for not asking in to that genial warmth the little frail old dame who arrived one cold day on our veranda to offer her pathetically hum hle stock of needles and pins for our purchase . I then thought it enough to buy a quarter 's worth of pins , and did not think , insensate that I was , to ask her indoors to warm herself at our fire . She was from Michigan , she said , and that Florida day must have been mockingly bitter to her . She faded into the afternoon chill , and left me , when I realized it , to suffer for my sin of omission with vain thoughts of pursuing her , and bringing her back and offering her tea and toast and whatever instant refreshments I could imagine . While I am about owning this unavailing regret , I may as well remember how I one day bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , who proved , on the testimony of our colored maid , a widow trying to work the bit of farm her husband 's death had left her , and whom I ought to have bought a load of fat pine from every day , but I did not think to order even another load , and so never saw her again . This also lies heavy on my soul , but I thank Heaven we bought all the tumblers of delicious guava jelly which a little neighbor girl offered us ; and since we did this I wish she had seemed needier than she probably was . Not many people came to us with things to sell , but we soon began getting boxes of delicious strawberries from the farm-wife whom once we found working in her own field , and we never ceased buying them as long as they lasted . It was a quaint place , of wooden Gothic , holding its own against age , and charming the air with an effect of personal history . She led us over it , and invited us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished , as I now tell the reader . A lady not otherwise of our acquaintance accompanied us on her own incentive , as by mere force of habit , and said she always liked to visit that house , it was so picturesque . Very little of the country life showed itself about the town , and when it did it was mostly colored ; there was one white orange-farmer who came at first with his fruit , and then , on our question VOL . CXXXIV. ? No. 804. - 111of the sweetness of his tangerines , promptly ceased to come . But there is a famous orange grove northward of the city where the tangerines are better , and you may be shown on a ladder plucking them from the tree , if you are of a mind to be so photographed . It is perhaps a little too conscious , but the orchard is not the less sincere for that , and you may see there the preparation which the orange-growers of northern Florida have provided against frost ever since the Great Freeze : pots and pans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit against the inclemency of the skies . When the spring began to thicken in leaf and blossom upon our vernal world , the perfume of the orange flowers struck through the air a quarter of a mile off and involved us in its dense sweetness as we drove by on our often way " Round the Horn . As is well known , the orangetrees are always flowering and fruiting together , but it may not be so well known that in St. Augustine they have infected the peach-trees with their habit . When we arrived the first week of January these were already trying the temperature with a bud here and there , and when we left in the second week of April , they were still tentatively blowing , as the New England country folks say , while their earlier ventures were rewarded with half-grown peaches . There was never that passionate flush of bloom which makes the peach-tree a thing of unspeakable beauty at the North ; with the whole season from Christmas to Easter for its work , it felt no hurry here . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nondescript fruit called a loquat in Bermuda , and in St. Augustine a Japanese plum , which began with no perceptible flower , and slowly yellowed and mellowed to the hand of predatory boyhood , though that might have had it for the asking in any dooryard . In the first days of April the mulberries were black enough to he eaten by the black boys . We made no account of roses and violets ; but the poinsettia seemed to merit attention by keeping its fire-red spikes on till they dropped at the coming of spring , and left the bougainvillea to take up the talc . That famous orange orchard which we must not leave behind yet , is admirable for the avenues first of palms , and then of live-oaks which form its approach ; the oaks stretch their writhing limbs across the driveway , and put a still weirder disposition on from their hearsing with long plumes of Spanish moss , in perhaps the least endearing appeal of nature to human nature . Half an acre from the stooping trunks the branches reach far out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hairy with the hideous gray of the parasite , which waves funerally in the air . It is said to be finally the death of the tree , but there is here and there one which escapes its throttling grip , and especially we knew one which in a neglected garden spread itself abroad over half an acre of ground . Always it was a pleasure to drive by that vast oak , as it was a pleasure to drive under the oaks which border the long Avenue San Marco on the way to the road Round the Horn . Last year it seemed to have been ravaged by some sort of insect , but it was putting out its gray-green leaves anew , with the wateroak in young verdure bulking freshly and refreshingly beside it . The drive Round the Horn is the most characteristic of the drives about St. Augustine , and is more comprehensive of the general interest than any other . The bridge which you presently cross gives one of the fairest prospects of the city , with its Andalusian towers and roofs , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shell road winding through the reaches and expanses of palmetto scrub , among the stems of the rather spindling pines . The scrub is the wonder and the terror of the local landscape , and , so far as I know , the whole Floridian landscape . Of all the vegetable enemies of man it seems the most inexorable . You may cut it , or burn its fans down to the roots ; it bides its time , and after a brief season of sparse grass , which the cows eat in default of other herbage , the scrub renews its hold upon the nether regions , and must be dug up , fiber by fiber , before the meager soil can be freed from it for such crops as will grow in it . More crops will grow in what looks like mere sand than you would imagine , or the Northern farmeror gardener could hope , to harvest from it . if you transplant the young trees from among the scrub , they willingly flourish , when encouraged with a little water , into columnar palmettoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drive to the beautiful woodland called Lewis 's Point , after a philanthropist whose public and private beneficences at St. Augustine form a Tolstoyan romance . But this is not the place to tell the story which , as your colored driver murmurs it , lends its poetry to your course through the winding ways of the natural park , with their outlooks upon the still waters of the bays and bayous around . You need not otherwise believe all that your driver says , especially all he says of the serpents which frequent these groves and climb the vines of the scuppernong to share its fruit with the colored boys competing for the grapes . Like these boys , the snake which loves the fruit most is black , and sometimes in the imagination of the driver is of as lofty reach as the vine itself . ? Candor obliges me to say that although we saw scuppernong vines in abundance , we never saw any snakes on them , black or of any other color ; but once in driving home from the Point in the cool of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in leash by the man who had caught it . The loathly worm was quite torpid from the cold , and lay a gray , clayey length that showed the whole pattern of its checkered design , with its rattles a full yard away from its deadly fangs . We did not stay to ask how or where it had been taken , but hurried by through the early dusk which the Southern twilight had suddenly lapsed into after our visit to the vineyard where a German family makes a fine , fruity old port " from the berries of the scuppernong . These grow , anomalously enough , the size of small plums , in loose clusters of three or four , and are of the flavor of our Concord grapes , but do not transport so well as the wine , and probably would not ripen in the North . The name had always a charm for me from its musical enumeration in that pleasant rhyme of Longfellow 's renowning our Catawba beyond all other native , and some alien vintages ; and I now satisfied my wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roofed . But it has never the soft insinuation of vines better known to literature , and before the leaves come to hide them in the spring , it is covered with spiky twigs instead of the delicate , clinging tendrils of other grapes . The spreading trellises here were of no great spread , and were presently lost in an orchard of oranges and other fruit trees , all ordered with a neatness very alien to the sloven farming of the country about , but much in keep-ing with the young Bavarian sisters , with their long braids and smooth masses of dark hair , who came out to show us the place . They came out of a new-built house of Northern pattern ? first to save us from the misgivings of their dogs ; and last ? their widowed mother and older sister being in town ? the capable little women led us to the barn where the bottles and barrels of the scuppernong were stored . When I proposed to buy a bottle of the wine , they wished me to taste a glass of it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our colored driver ( a very mildly coffee-colored driver ) to join in the test , so that he was able to add his voice in favor of the vintage from a whole tumblerful . The drive from the farm through the forest solitude back to the highway was haunted by the sad or savage black faces starting up before us as in the woodland road , and was not cheered by the lamps in the windows of the moldering hamlet of Moultrie . Ruin seemed to have grown upon the place since we had seen it an hour before , and a decay at once eerie and ramshackle invested the forsaken villa on rising ground beyond the estuary where the little oysters mustered their serried ranks in the ebb-tide of the muddy flats . This villa could never have been very impressive itself , but the massive stone posts of the gateways approaching it were of even undue grandeur ; otherwise the unpainted wood of the local architecture , which had never known dignity nor beauty , was of that repulsive forlornness which seems characteristic of the Southern farm or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has once been cleared of all that man has builded for the shelter ' of hislove or pride , there is sometimes a charm in the utter effacement . One day of another year another driver carried us by a place where he said he used to bring a lady from the North whose family i home it had once been , and where , beyond the squalor of a negro suburb , an opening in the scrub-pine and palmetto stretched a wilding lawn under gray live-oaks and shining magnolias growing apart from one another as if from inten-tion rather than by accident . It was so fit a place for the mansion which had once stood there in the stately keeping of the slave-holding past that one must look twice to make sure that the vanished home was not haunting the scene . The Northern lady who frequented it was only far off akin to those who had once dwelt there , and it did not seem that her visits were the efFect of family piety ; but she came and came as long as she remained in St. Augustine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained in reach of the beautiful , wistful spot . As for the allure of St. Augustine itself , it was largely that of all small cities not densely built over their area , and it kept the tradition of a country town in dooryards with flowers , and back yards with homely vegetables , and here and there a vacant lot where the sweet corn and the pea vines flourished , not remote from the centers of commerce and fashion which , as I have said , do not intermit their business or pleasure on Sundays . I liked driving in the outlying streets which had once hoped to be avenues , but when Palm Beach and Miami had taken the hope of allwinter resort from St. Augustine had i given it up ( not in desperation so much as in resignation ) and become gently weed-grown and grass-grown roadways . Where the tops of the wayside oaks or cedars arched together overhead , they were of a gloom that was very pleasant , and where the colonnading and arcading ceased , it was still a pensive pleasure to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild-grown , of houses that had quite ceased trying to be the winter homes of well-todo Northern invalids , and were now either for sale outright , or were putting off the inevitable hour by offering furnished rooms to let . Every point of the winning city had its moment of charm , and I did not yield a fonder allegiance to the great Ponce de Leon when that hostelry gathered a rich sunset in its clustering palms , and lifted its roofs and towers above them in the lingering afterglow , than to the Plaza of a sunny morning when my home-towners ranged themselves with their home-papers on the benching in the checkered shade , or then , when the full moon sailed above the campanile of the cathedral , and the alligator dreamed in his fountain , and the old Spanish markethouse tried to remember which of the home-towners it was that heat at checkers during the long games of the forenoon . It was fine also when the swift twilight fled before the dusk over the waters that.stretched between St. Augustine and St. Anastasia ; but no finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were driven to choose , I should favor a mild Sunday forenoon on the road crossing from farther St. George Street over the water-gate that keeps the estuary of Maria Sanchez full , independently of the changing . tide . It is then a smooth , motionless mirror , where the distant towers and roofs of the city glass themselves with a certain delicate beauty of line and color , and let you imagine them in whatever story of the city 's past you like . I myself like some idyllic passage of it not too weighted down with fact , and not above sympathy with such homely effects as the reedy pastures of the shore , and the rather shabby cows grazing there in the keeping of colored mothers past more active cares . If you are for a more romantic outlook , you are welcome to the long expanse of the southward savannah . fenced along the horizon by the shadowy walls of woodland . But I think we shall come together in our pleasure of the river 's name , called after whatever Spanish maid or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall like it better , and find it the sweeter on our tongues for being her surname as well as her Christian name . Matron or maid , Senora or Senorita , it would not be more endearing if it were of the oldest Spanish derivation than if it were of that Minorcan originwhich lends to the history of St. Augustine the pathos of a people cruelly injured . The children of this people have multiplied and prospered in the friendly air of the place for more than a hundred years , now , since an alien governor rescued them from a wrong which an alien oppressor had done them . Under their name and with them many poor Greeks and Italians were lured from Minorca when the islanders were brought to Florida by the Englishman who promised them home and country in his employ , and after he had got them to his lands practically enslaved them . They seem to have been something like our colonial Redemptioners in the terms of their emigration , but when they found themselves doomed lifelong to work out the price of their transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them who had heard of English law stole away to St. Augustine , and asked the English governor if they could be held against their will , without land or wages ; and the governor answered , with what roar of disclaimer the reader chooses to imagine , Certainly not ! Then their Moses went back to them , and led them up out of their bondage at New Smyrna to St. Augustine and left their English tyrant with the machinery of his indigo farms to rust and ruin . Ever since they have been an admirably industrious element in their city of refuge , and honored for their virtues . But it is said that they keep to themselves away from their kind neighbors , irreparably wounded in their pride by the conditions of their past sufferings . For my own part I would like to believe that all that beauty and grace which I liked to attribute to the blood of the race dominant in the city for three hundred years , had come down to our day through these deeply wronged Minor-cans ; and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly , upon the sunny picture of St. Augustine which remains in my remembrance . Other shadows there were , as there are in all the memories of life . Sometimes the butcher would not send home the meat in time , or the sort of meat that was ordered ; sometimes the grocer would not send anything at any time , until he was prodded over the telephone ; but in the end we did not starve , and meanwhile we continued in the hope that the boys carrying baskets before them on their bicycles were coming to us with them . Otherwise our days went by in a summer succession the whole winter through , but if now and then a day was unseasonably wintry , we justly blamed our native North for it . I have tried , faithfully if not successfully , to give some notion of the place and its resources for the exile who hai merely come away to escape care , and I hope I have not exaggerated them . I have confessed that the drives were not so many as / could wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take , and our excursions in suburb or beyond always offered some interesting spectacle or experience . There would be a house , left unoccupied by its owner for the winter , which we would occupy for the moment at a merely nominal rent ; there was a certain ship 's carpenter whom we liked to see building a small yacht in his back yard , remote from any of the surrounding waters ; and in a garden beside a house not otherwise memorable there was the passion of a half-grown kitten for a hen which , as the cat rubbed against the scandalized and indignant fowl , afforded a spectacle of unrequited affection that might well have been studied for a painting on the cover of a popular magazine ; there were wide , wilding spaces which the prosperity of former years had meant for house-lots , and there were others where houses had once stood , and then fallen away , leaving flowery tangles of bushes and briers behind them . But the great charm of the town was in the town itself , and chiefly characteristic of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it followed the Maria Sanchez away in cottages or bungalows of divers ideals to the border of the far-reaching southward savannah , or led northward beyond the Plaza , was somehow more Old World in effect ; Ilan other thoroughfares of the town . There were not merely the shopswhere everything you wanted or did not want was offered you but there was here and there a Spanish house , sometimes tottering with age , but in one instance at least keeping its ancient state of coquina walls flush with the street and with a stretch of garden beside it , and on the street beyond it the appealing ruin of like houses left by the last fire . Somewhat early in the season , the old thoroughfare entered into a generous commercial rivalry with King Street , and equipped itself with colored electric lamps strung overhead in gay strands from side to side . By night or by day , with its little shops and its cracking walls , and people walking up and down its middle among the vehicles , it was very , very SouthEuropean . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest magazines , or deny the claim of your home-paper wherever your home was in the Middle West . Promptly , twenty-four hours late , there were not only the New York papers , but the Chicago , the Cleveland , the Cincinnati papers , with news which had kept quite fresh on the long way south . But , above all , St. George Street was the directest way to the old fort San Marco , and to the city gates which remain another monument of the Spanish will to be fair as well as strong . Our great architect McKim could not find a nobler suggestion for his Harvard gates than these gave , and one who goes to Cambridge may imagine from them the chief ornament of St. Augustine . They are indeed only the pillars of the gates , with a bit of the ancient wall beside each , and how the fortification was continued from them I never could quite realize , or whether in palmetto logs or coquina walls . The old embankment which once stretched away on either side was long ago leveled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like of it . You can not imagine too much of St. Augustine anywhere within its vanished walls , or in the characteristic landscape , where it lies a vision of unique appeal in our commonplace American world
