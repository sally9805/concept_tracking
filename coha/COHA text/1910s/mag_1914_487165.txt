Tile Everyman Encyclopaedia . Edited by Andrew Boyle . New York : E. P. Dutton &; Co . Vols. $6 net . The editor of this encyclopaedia puts forward no extravagant claim . Knight 's Encyclopudia , a useful work in its generation , nearly seventy years ago , has served , if not as a basis , at least as a guide for the present one , but even where the general treatment has been followed the editor justly says that it would be difficult to recognize , in the process of altering and amending , any obligation to the original source . A comparison of a number of articles with the corresponding ones in the parent work discloses no resemblance , even in cases where a partial transfer might have seemed permissible . Everyman 's Encyclopaedia is thus substantially a new work , written and compiled  --  as we must assume in the absence of names of contributors  --  by Mr. Andrew Boyle and a staff of assistants . The appearance of the new Britannica and the New International Encyclopedia must have made such a task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be said , have evidently been employed , as far as the important articles are concerned . The main problem was how to build up , within the compass of twelve small-sized volumes of about 640 pages each , a serviceable Anglo-American encyclopedia ; that is to say , haw to establish the proper relation between British and American topics . So excellent a work as Chambers 's did not succeed in the effort to graft American subjects upon the British stem , and , of course , no encyclopaedia in any other language will satisfy the American reader . Meyer 's " Kleines Konversation-Lexikon , " admirable neutral ground as it is for scientific , technological , and various other subjects , is too German to serve adequately either the British or the American reader able to consult its columns . Externally , Everyman 's is not unattractive , though there are no colored plates or other illustrations of the kind that delights the eye in Meyer or Brockhaus . Maps were excluded by the plan of the work , and we have only simple diagrams , old-fashioned woodcuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closely printed page . No fault can be found with the abbreviations employed . The work has , on the whole , been brought well down to date , events of the year 1914 figuring not infrequently . A regrettable feature of the plan of condensation is the omission , in the biographical articles , of the month and day of birth and death . Meyer , with only half the space at its disposal , gives us precise dates . Surely , an occasional exception might have been made in such cases as that of Alexander II , where we are curtly told : " He was assassinated in March . " As if to offset the saving in space ' in other directions , Everyman 's gives us the full string of Christian names wherever the subject had more than the one name by which he is generally known , thereby succeeding , not in establishing greater accuracy , but in obscuring the real name in not a few cases ; for , unlike other encyclopmdias that follow the same practice , no order is preserved in Everyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " first , followed by " Edward Leopold " ; under Wagner , we have " Richard " last , preceded by " Wilhelm " ; under Agassiz , we have " Louis " in the middle , flanked by " Jean " and " Rodolphe " ; while under Reuter we have " Heinrich Ludwig Christian , known as Fritz , " which last name is the only one by which Reuter is ever spoken of . If the number of good articles on important subjects were the only criterion of encyclopmdic excellence , high praise would have to be awarded to Everyman 's . Such summaries as are given under " Economics " ( nearly ten pages ) , " Great Britain " and " England " ( together twenty pages ) , " Greece " ( twelve pages ) , " Egypt " ( sixteen pages ) , and under headings relating to the natural sciences and to technological subjects , may challenge comparison with similar articles in the standard encyclopaedias . But the test of editorial capacity , in works of this kind , lies largely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects ; to harmonize , in accordance with one fixed standard , the important and the relatively unimportant ; above all , must the editor aim at accuracy in little as well as in big things . In other words , no encyclopaedia can dispense with the services of the ever-watchful , omniscient revising editor . Because Every-man 's has evidently not had the benefit of such- a supplementing and eliminating hand , it becomes the task of the reviewer to point out some of its defects . First and last , Everyman 's is an encyclopaedia for British readers , and only secondarily is it useful to Americans . It contains a very large number of articles on exclusively British topics , the American aspect of which has either been totally ignored or only very slightly touched upon Such a rticles , to mention only a few , are " Alien , " " Rank " ( in the army ) , " Salmon , " " Ships and Shipbuilding " ( thirteen pages ) , " Clergy , Discipline Act , 1892 " ; " Municipalities " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illegitimacy , " " Pensions , " " Merchant Shipping , " " Elections , " " National Insurance , " " Subway , " " Cycles and Cycling , " " Coach and Coaching , " and " Coast Protection . " The opportunity to treat peculiarly important American subjects has not been seized . There is , for instance , no article on Interstate Commerce . We are sometimes referred for the treatment of the American phase of a subject to articles under another head , and , at least in one con- ' spicuous instance , in vain . At the conclusion of the eleven-page article devoted to " Army , " there is this reference concerning the American army and navy : " See United States ? Army and Navy . " Such a heading does not exist in the article " United States , " and the entire subject is thus ignored . In itself , the article " United States " is fairly accurate and comprehensive , the portion devoted to American literature being better than the political part Saner judgment prevails in the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poe , with its rhapsodic overestimate of his genius . We have discovered , in articles dealing with American history , few such grotesque blunders as those contained in the biography of Conkling , where we read : " Garfield had defeated General Arthur in the Presidential elections , " . . . and " During the whole dispute C. had been favored with the whole-hearted support of the ex-President , Arthur . " Better things might have been expected of an encyclopaedia appealing to Americans than a one-page article on New York city ( London has twelve pages ) , which is too condensed to contain a mention of Bronx Park , but finds room for such unilluminating commonplaces as ? " New York city leads in literature in the United States , owing to the many large publishing houses which have been established . The monthly magazines are exceptionally good . iNiew York is noted also for its daily papers , " etc . A characteristic British touch occurs in the brief article on George Washington ( a column in length ) , where it is said of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a typical English gentleman . " Speaking generally , American biographies partake of the perfunctory character of nearly all the notices on modern subjects of whatever nationality . Men who have sprung into prominence in recent times , such as Bethmann-Hollweg , Arrhenius , Woodrow Wilson , are dispatched in a few words , but even celebrities of well-established reputation , such as Helmholtz and Humboldt , are treated altogether inadequately . Under Huxley , precisely as in the articles in Meyer and Brockhaus ( strange to say ) , there is no mention of either Darwin or evolution , and the notice in Everyman 's has a crowning blunder of its own , in crediting Huxley with the authorship of " The Origin of Species . " There is no historical grasp in the articles on Alexander von Battenberg , Bismarck , and Francis Joseph . Some of the statements therein are meaningless As bearing on the question of proportion , we may mention that Gustave Hem &; the present-day leader of French Socialists , has twice as much space as Rousseau ; that Hegel ( in obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets three times as much space as Helmholtz , that Coleridge has exactly as much space as Goethe and Shakespeare ( two and a half pages ) , and twice as much as Cervantes , that less than a page suffices for Isaac Newton , but that Ruskin requires more than a page , and Cecil Rhodes more than a page and a half . Rembrandt is dispatched in less than a column , but John Constable has nearly a page , almost as much as Raphael Adam Smith has to be content with less than half a column , but more than twice as much space is given to Thomas Cook &; Sons Much space is taken up by articles on newspapers and periodicals that might well have been spared . The Illustrated London News has two-thirds of a column ; the unrelieved eulogy of the , Saturday Review takes up nearly as much space ; under " Allgememe Zeitung " ( Augsburg , now Munich ) , we have a list of all the editors since 1798 . The New York Journal , " founded in 1733 as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saint Paul 's Cathedral is devoted nearly a column , and St. Paul 's School , London , is deemed worthy of a special article , but we have looked in vain for an article on St. Peter 's , or any other of the world-famous churches . It is easy to pick flaws due to defective proofreading in the best of encyclopaedias , but Everyman 's excels in a peculiar class of misspelled names . Gen. D'Aurelle de Pala-dines ( in the article " Franco-German War " ) figures as " D'Anselle de Paladines " , Anzengruber 's " Pfarrer von Kirchfeld " becomes " Pfarrer von Hirschfeld " ; the Baldwin Locomotive Works ( under the heading " Philadelphia " ) are transformed into " Galvin Locomotive Works , " and the Goncourt brothers ( article " France " ) appear as " Jules and Emile Goncourt . " Far worse is the repeated mention of the election of prominent Austrians to the Upper House of the Reichsrath ( as in the articles on Arneth and Count Anton Auersperg , misspelled Auersberg ) , and the statement that Auerbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hohenasperg ) . One of the worst blunders in the work occurs in the article on Vienna , which describes . conditions that ceased to exist fifty years ago The Ringstrasse has not yet come to life , and walls and fosses still surround the city . There are no articles on Bohm-Bawerk , on Diesel or the Diesel engine , or on Count Berchtold , or Benedetto Croce , to mention only a few glaring omissions Maria Montessori has no biography , though her system is referred to under " Idiocy . " Under the article " Astronomy " ( twelve pages ) there is no mention of Simon Newcomb ( except in the bibliography ) , though room has been found for H. G. Wells 's sentimental rhapsody of a Samurai . There is not invariable consistency as to the language in which titles of books , other than English , are given . Some titles appear in English translation , some as originally written . Friedrich Ruckert has , unaccountably , three French books to his credit . Inconsistency is also manifest in the alternation of " Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Graf " , thus we find " Mansfeld , Ernst Graf von " and " Mansfeld , Peter Ernest I , Count . " The transliteration of certain foreign names leaves much to be desired . Ignorance of the transliteration of Russian names leads to the gratuitous enumeration , after various Russian proper names , of current erroneous varieties of spelling which only mislead English readers . Thus , under " Mendeleeff " we read " Dmitri Ivanovich , or Ivanowitch , " and under " Turgeniev " we have , in a parenthesis , the perplexing choice of " Turguenev , Turgenev , or Turgenieff " With all its shortcomings , Everyman 's Encyclopmdia is distinctly a useful work of reference , though not useful alike to all classes of readers . CURRENT FICTION . Stories without Tears . By Barry Pain New York : Frederick A. Stokes Company Mr. Pain has sanity . He has , in fact , more than sanity ; he has intelligence , he has cultivation , and he has not a little humor . He is at his best in his stories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Chrisimissima , " and " The Celestial 's Editorship . " The simplicity of outlook , the slightness of hold , which make the other stories seem , on the whole , rather a waste of time , are a source of merit in these tales . The schoolboy of our American fiction is treated with undue seriousness ; something of Mr. Pain 's casual manner might do him good . For the rest ( except in the fables at the end , which are witty and , in a- measure , charming ) , Mr. Pain is rather an ingenious inventor of situations than a story-writer . His stories are refined minute farces , somewhat amusing for the moment , but altogether mechanical  --  and as unproductive of real laughter as they are of tears . ? A Child Went Forth .

There was a child went forth every day , And the first object he looked upon , that object he became , And that object became part of him for the day or a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching cycles of years These lines of Whitman 's serve as motto for a book of unusual quality . The American publishers give no information about the author or her work ; but from the evidence of these pages we surmise that she is a Hungarian who as a very young girl was sent to school in England , and that this is the story of her childhood in Hungary . Its charm is not easy to define  --  chiefly the effect , it may be , of its apparent artlessness Its exotic flavor seems to contribute little to that charm  --  far less than the sense of natural kinship with these people of the strange names and odd customs . The child-life recorded seems , in a way , quite unremarkable , and yet the chronicler , by virtue of her sincerity , contrives to make it altogether worthy of remark . Here is the old adventure of dreaming childhood in a waking world , the slow and painful adjustment of the newcomer to the rules of thumb by which the adult race lives It is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends in rank sentimentalism . The present little narrative is realistic in the best sense  --  faithful to the fact , but to the carefully chosen fact ; and animated by a perfectly healthy and unforced sentiment . In short , with all its appearance of slightness and artlessness , it is , in its way , a very genuine product of ( alas , how else shall we phrase it ? ) literary art . A reviewer in Punch laments that our knowledge of little Anna ends with her departure for England , that " we are not told which particular English school was favored with her patronage , nor how She got on there . " It is a singularly dull remark , since one of the chief merits of the little work is that it is so obviously complete in its own character  --  as a study of childhood . We have an Elsie Series al-ready ! Tales of Two Countries . By Maxim Gorky . New York : B. W. Huebsch . A sense for structural values and for form has never been the strong feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformly damaged his very short stories and sketches ? stories shorter , that is , than " Twenty-six Men - and a Girl " and the powerful " Chelkash . " The characters may be vividly done , and there may be a poetic feeling for nature , but dramatic outline is wanting , and the Pulse of action but fairly begins to beat before it is halted again . His longer narratives may be long-winded and monotonous , but realism can be exhibited at the length necessary to demonstrate spiritual insight , until character study and the stripping of vicious social environment sometimes reach astonishing force . Horrifying naturalism , human analysis without incident , can seldom be compressed effectively into ten pages . The present volume falls into two divisions . In the first there are a dozen thumb-nail vignettes of Italian scenes , unambitious and frankly objective ; most of them giving an impression of triviality , but some possessing reserve force . In the second are as many stories of Russian life , savage , satirical , and sardonic by turns . The writer here knows not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is only unfortunate that his tone of pessimism leads less frequently to direct sincerity than to a cynical toying with semi-allegorical ideas , as in " The Poet , " " The Writer , " " The Liberal . " The tone is the intellectual smartness of a man made mordant by observation of life rather than deeply moved by it . There can be few to whom the volume will not seem a falling off from " A Confession " or " The Spy . " Little Eve Edgarton . By Eleanor Hallowell Abbott New York ? The Century Co . The nice young chap at the summer resort announces a desperate conclusion  --  there is n't an interesting girl to be found nowadays outside of a magazine story . His elderly confidant retorts that if he thinks so , it is because he has n't known where to look for her ; smart dressing and a pretty face are not the signs by which you know an interesting woman . Thereupon , with all the impersonal benevolence of a pure theorist , he requisitions the services of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rehearsal of the humorous miseries of this enforced companionship , and the unfolding of the remarkable personality disguised in the little Edgarton girl 's colorless manner and shabby clothes . The singular thing about the poor dear , as we understand it , is that her unusualness is n't a matter of choice , but of having lived all her life at the mercy of a globe-trotting scientist of a father . Bored to extinction by an existence in which adventure has been daily fare , she ardently pines for the settled and the commonplace . Death and disaster by land or sea fail to stir her blood ( if - possible , she will save your life expertly , but quite perfunctorily ) ; what really rouses her is a rare culinary opportunity like that of making four hundred muffins for the hotel breakfast . She will obligingly discuss peat-bog fossils with you , but what she heartily prefers is to steal a while away from microscopes , specimens , and notes on all the ' ologies , and spend a quiet half-hour bringing her own paper-doll book up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce that , in spite of her heavy sartorial handicap , she finally wins her way into the sphere of fashionable conventionality from which she has heretofore lived in sorrowful exile ; also that the nice young chap recognizes with joy his interesting girl at last , although he has to be struck by lightning , and she to sustain an alarmingly severe crack on the cranium , before the author is able to lead them to so satisfactory a conclusion . Northrop . By Claude C. Washburn . York Duffield &; Co . This is an excellent example of a type of current fiction which possesses a number of good qualities , and which we might very well do without . It is the type of clever " workmanship , " well modelled and well chiselled , or at least well chased . But it is consciously clever ; in its most vivid or intense moments it never forgets to be sophisticated . Provincialism is its blackest beast of fear . If New York or London or Chicago serve for its earlier scenes , we may be sure it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the hero upon whose career we are called to hang in a well-bred way is pretty sure to be that spineless puppet , or puppy , with a Temperament , who , thanks largely to books of this sort , threatens to stand for the creative artist in. the popular fancy . The Gerald of this story is that puppy . It is not his fault , because his father has been it before him ; he is of pedigreed stock . The grandfather has barely emerged from shirtsleeves to the ownership of a big factory in a provincial Western city ; an honest , hard-working American , piteously aghast at the spectacle of his strange offspring The ineffectual father and his Parisian wife have died during Gerald 's boyhood , and the grandfather dies while he is at Harvard , leaving him everything , with the simple request that he " give America a chance " before , as it were , following his Gallic nose across the water . Gerald duly goes through the motions , but is too fastidious for this crude land ; and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amatory adventures abroad , he does return to it , he returns unchanged , still the puppy conceitedly and indecently whining for the moon . The trouble with him , from a robust reader 's point of view , is the trouble with all heroes of his kind . He is responsible to nothing but to his own self-titillated sensibilities ; there is no strength in him . Therefore , stories like this  --  it is odd how many of them there are  --  represent , with all their cleverness , a sad waste of energy . A hero is not a formula or a code of morals . Virtue in the little sense is neither here nor there with him ; but virtue in the big sense we must have from any human being who demands so much of us in the way of time and attention . Tom Jones has it , and Silas Lapham , and even Pendennis ; but not a mother 's son among the fecund tribe of Geralds . AN OVER-RATED STATESMAN . The Memoirs of Francesco Crzspi . Compiled from Crispi 's diary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vol . III , " International Problems . " New York : G. H. Doran Co. $3.50 net The third volume of Crispi 's so-called Memoirs covers chiefly the last decade of the nineteenth century . Crispi was hurled from office on March 3 , 1896 , as a result of the national indignation at the disaster in Abyssinia . He spent the remaining five years of his life sorting his papers , editing , expurgating , and destroying , so that they might eventually serve as his apologia to posterity . His nephew , who has edited them , goes farther and composes from them a panegyric pitched in a major key . The present reviewer , as he has indicated - in his comments on the earlier volumes , does not believe that it will ever be possible to whitewash Crispi . As time goes on , and the Crispian claque grows faint , the majority even of Radical Italians will perceive not only that Crispi left nothing of permanent value to Italy , but that , partly through his vanity and partly through his antipathies , he bequeathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years , from 1876 to 1896 , when he was the dominant figure in Italian politics , whether in office or not , corruption in its crudest and basest forms flourished unchecked . The central fact in Crispi 's foreign policy was that he substituted subservience to Germany for subservience to France . In the seventies that may have seemed Prudent , but during the last quarter of a century the Triple Alliance has been of doubtful value to Italy , until latterly it has proved actually harmful . Crispi was cunning , but his was the cunning of the Albanians , who devote their energy to vendettas , and he became the easy dupe of Bismarck 's more sophisticated craft He came away from his first visit to the Chancellor convinced that Germany would lavish her favors on Italy ; and yet , almost immediately after , Bismarck and Salisbury connived at the French occupation of Tunis  --  that act which enraged the Italians against the French , and has rankled to this day . It was Bismarck 's purpose by entangling the French as much as possible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the , German frontier , and also to infuriate the Italians against the French . He did both Hence the Triple Alliance . The present volume deals chiefly with postBismarckian diplomacy , but it shows Crispi still acting on Bismarckima lines . The topics taken up are Tripoli and France , the fortifications of Biserta , the troubles raised by the Irredentists with Austria , the friction between Italy and France from 1888 on , the Balkan question , and the crisis in European alliances during the last years of the century . Although Crispi 's acts in these various affairs are so dressed up as to make him appear the master in each case , when we ask for the results , we find mostly talk on his part and a victory for his opponents . The French built Biserta ; Crispi yielded - to the Austrian demands and muzzled the : Irredentists as far as he was able ; Crispi 's : financial war against France caused hard - times in Italy , which the German alliance , did not alleviate ; and his letters , speeches , and suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subsequent , development of that peninsula . Read between the lines , the flattering naessages he received from the German and Austrian Emperors and Chancellors simply mean that they knew he could not and would not break away from them , and they therefore never called his bluff . In one , case  --  in a petty quarrel with Portugal  --  he seems to have succeeded . We regret that his editor has been so intent on making Crispi out a master of international statecraft that he has omitted , ? or reduced to infinitesimal proportions , the cardinal facts in Crispi 's Administrations at - home . We looked for something authentic on the " Moral Question " episode , on the - bank scandals , on Crispi 's cowardice in continuing the war in Abyssinia which he pro-fessed to disapprove of , and on many other political and personal matters The nephew even fails to do justice to Crispi 's ruthless suppression of the agrarian insurrection in Sicily and on the mainland , although that suppression was the best proof that Crispi ever gave that he could act as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern Italian extremists that he persecuted them twenty years ago . This volume contains many interesting letters , or reports of conversations , which the expert will know how to use profitably But all the material lies under the suspicion of having been manipulated for a definite purpose , and no cautious historian would trust solely to it as his source of informa-tion . Whoever advertised Crispi as " the prince of all diplomats " must have either a febrile imagination or unfathomed igno-ranee . ROOSEVELT 'S ADVENTURES IN SOUTH AMERICA . Through the Brazilian Wilderness . By Theodore Roosevelt . Illustrated with photographs . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . $3.50 net . When Col. Roosevelt started on this expedition , which was to bisect South America from Buenos Ayres to the Amazon , it was with the intention of gathering mammals and birds for the American Museum . By the generous interest of the Brazilian Government , the reconnaissance was enlarged and became geographical and zoological in character . In any event we may be certain that the versatile mind of the author would not have confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this volume differs but slightly from Col. Roosevelt 's " African Game Trails , " the narrative being chronologically arranged , a consecutive account of each day 's happenings presented clearly , informally , and in great detail , with diversions  --  literary , historical , or zoological  --  whenever prompted by the stimulus of some pertinent event . The diction is the best that the author has ever put into a book of travel , and the slight philosophical touches are more virile , more thoughtful , than those in the African narrative . With less of sensational incident to surfeit the emotions , the events of the expedition have received calmer , more dispassionate treatment and consideration , and thus add very appreciably to the pleasure of the reader . Instead of the big-game hunter , we have here the chronicles of a naturalist in the best sense of the word . The first two months of the trip are passed over almost without comment . This period was devoted to a lecture tour through Brazil , the Argentine , and Chili , and was devoid of scientific note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ascent of the Paraguay the first stage in the continental voyage . From river to river the party travelled , always to the northward , passing at last over the highland wilderness , the low divide from which the waters flow southward into the Parafia or north towards the Amazon . This was the home of the Nhambiquaras  --  an isolated tribe , friendly but not servile , wearing neither clothing nor ornaments , hunting by day , lying down in the sand to sleep at night . Then came three weeks of dangerous voyaging down the Rio Duvida , Rio Roosevelt , or , as it has finally been called , Teodoro , before the Madeira was reached , and at last the Amazon . Six weeks of perilous labor were spent in navigating an almost endless succession of rapids ; five out of seven canoes were lost within the space of a month and a half , during which the party saw not a single human being ; one man was drowned , another was punished for insubordination , and retaliated by murder ; most of the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . So much for the distressing side . Besides the host of interesting notes recorded by the author on the wild creatures of the jungle , there is a list of over twenty-five hundred birds and five hundred mammals , which were collected , chiefly by Cherrie and Miller . With the expert geographic assistance of Col. Rondon , the River Teodoro was mapped for the first time throughout its length of fifteen hundred kilometres . A competent professional photographer would have added much to the value of the trip , although the pictures are as good as the usual snapshots taken on such expeditions . The maps , appendices , and index are a delight in their thoroughness and lucidity . A single paragraph of life on a small boat in the River of the Tapirs must suffice as a glimpse of the interesting per-sonnel : The trip was pleasant and interesting , although there was not much to do on the boat .

THE TEST OF STRATEGICAL THEORY . France and the Next War : A French View of Modern War . By Commandant J. Colin , of the French War School . Translated by Major L. H. R. Pope-Hennessy , D.S.O. New York : George H. Doran Co . This book is simply a reprint of the greater part of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French army , translated by Major Pope-Hennessy , of the British Service , and published by Hugh Rees , Ltd. , London , 1912 . Its title is not that given by the author to his book ; and save the legend " reprint in 1914 " on the reverse of the title-page , there is nothing to indicate that this is not a new work , and absolutely nothing to show that the " Transformations " of 1912 and this work are ( omissions apart ) one and the same thing . Inasmuch as both books are from the same English publishers ( for the American imprint is merely formal ) we must believe that there must be some motive , if not reason , in thus giving out a reprint without the slightest reference to its original appearance , and this motive , in our opinion , is suggested by the title that heads this notice . For who would not believe , on picking up the book , that it is the French pendant of von Bernhardi 's " Germany and the Next War , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously by the German protagonist ? But the two are as Wide apart as the poles , for whereas von Bernhardi is attempting to justify a certain course on the part of the German Empire , Major Colin , a member of the staff of the Ecole Superieure de Guerre at Paris , merely undertakes to set out the great principles of modern warfare . His book would be just as useful to the Germans as to the French ; von Bernhardi 's could find an application only at home . In view of these remarks , suggested by the ad captandum title of the publishers , what must we think of the assertion of the preface that " throughout Colin 's book there is an absence of the bombastic jingoism of the Bernhardi school " ? It is not a question of jingoism : the two books are simply not comparable , and no choice of title can make them so . Ever since 1875 the French have believed , and since the Agadir incident have been convinced , that Germany would attack them , sooner rather than later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction . Moreover , it is no breach of confidence , to-day , to say that the courses of the great French Staff School have had for their chief end the development of ways and means to achieve victory in the coming war . But of this spirit not a trace is perceptible in Major Colin 's book . It is a calmly scientific work , historical in its treatment , and especially interesting from its analysis of Napoleon 's conception ? of what successful war exacted of a general . Upon this and other matters we need not dwell , inasmuch as the book is already well known to students of the military art . But we can not forbear to glance for a moment at the chapter , War in the Twentieth Century , in order to compare some predictions therein made with actual occurrences in Europe . Thus ( p. 279 ) , " the immense armies mobilized nowadays will hardly be contained in the theatre of operations . In a Franco-German war , for example , if the troops were deployed between Longwy and Huninguen , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be three to the yard between Dunkirk and 1VIontheliard . . . . " This last ( we refer to the length and position of the line ) is practically what we have in the western theatre ; indeed , earlier in the book ( p. 139 ) , the author says , " We may anticipate a battle which will bring to grips 3,000,000 of men on a front of 150 to 250 miles . " The following principle ( p. 280 ) apparently has been found dangerous of application : " The general will hold large numbers of troops at his disposal in certain zones where he means to obtain success at any price by developing and repeating his attacks . He will denude other regions where no decision is being sought for , and he will see no great objection to giving way here and there to the enemy . " Apparently ( p. 140 ) this local yielding might be desirable : " A local success at a point in the front creates deadly difficulties for the victor . . . of two equal armies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would perhaps by its very success place itself in a most dangerous situation . " Here is a prediction fully verified : " The armies of the future , it seems , will be more like massive and heavy rollers crushing all that they pass over " ( p. 279 ) . Still another : railways " lend themselves to rapid movements , and allow of the transport of an army from one end of the theatre of operations to the other in a few days " ( p. 282 ) . And so , " they the Germans might , after having to all appearances piled up their troops and their efforts at one extremity of the theatre of operations , after having repeated their attacks and thus determined the concentration of our forces on one of their wings  --  they might , I say , suddenly bring their principal strength to bear on the opposite side . " Fortunately for France , this prediction has not come true ; the aeroplane is now a factor . In fact , air-scouting has put an end to guesswork in actual operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textbooks and treatises .
