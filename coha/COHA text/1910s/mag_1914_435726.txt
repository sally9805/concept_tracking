Went down to Casa Bianca to rouse the hands to action to-morrow , for we are to begin cutting Marshfield . I found the boy who blew himself up with gunpowder two days ago , in great suffering . Dress ! ed his face and hands , using a feather to cover them with oil . He is a distressing object . I gave orders that every man , woman , and child should be in the field early to-morrow , and promised to be down early myself . Sept. 23 . Just as I was getting into the wagon very early this morning , carrying linen rags and olive oil to dress Nero 's burns , and lunch for myself , and a few pears and things to give the hands , I saw a pitiful little black figure standing at the foot of the steps . It was Jonadab , the little black pockmarked pygmy who has been coming all summer to beg for kitchen scraps , and old garments , and anything I would or could give . He stutters fearfully . ' What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am in a great hurry to-day , so you must talk quick . ' After what seemed to me a long time VOL . H4- NO. 5 and many convulsions of his little frame , he shot out , ' Ma bery sick . ' E bad off , en ' e baig yu fuh cum . ' I told Jim to drive to his mother 's house , which I knew was not far off in the pine woods , but just how far I did not know , for though I had sent things to her constantly , I had never been to her house myself . The road was well-nigh impassable for the wagon , and Jim , being provoked at this interruption , drove very fast and , it seemed to me , recklessly . At last I said to him , ' Stop ; and I will walk the rest of the way with Jonadab . ' The pine forest shimmered and glittered in the slanting rays of the early morning sun . Every blade of grass was laden with dew diamonds , and the slippery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started on this diversion from my plans I was distinctly irritated at the delay caused by this extra drive of two miles . It seemed so all-important to me to get to Casa Bianca early ; for with the hands I have , six acres is as much as I can get cut in one day , and there are twenty-six acres in the field . And this is such a stormy season of the year . But as I walked through the solemn pines with the little shriveled gnome ahead of me to show the path , I heard the voice of God in the sough of the pines , and a change came over my spirit . The sense of hurry and impatience left me . Jonadab in a little while pointed through the pines , ' and I saw a little log cabin . In the doorway two atoms of black humanity were sitting very near together , and Jonadab volunteered the information that they were his little brother and his youngest sister . As they saw me they rose and disappeared into the house , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had a very unsteady pine table , two chairs , and three pots in the fireplace . I passed through this to the inner room , where on the floor lay a woman , terribly swollen , her eyes protruding from her head , her breath coming in quick , heavy sobs . She seemed unconscious . Two Negro women who had just come in stood beside her . One was her mother , with whom she had quarreled a year ago , and who had never come near her through her long months of suffering and illness , leaving her alone with her little children . But to-day , hearing from a neighbor that Abby was dying , she rushed in , too late to be of any use . i I knelt down on the dirty floor beside the sick woman , and tried to give her some milk and stimulant which I had brought . But her teeth were closed and refused to admit the spoon , and I realized that she was actually dying . Then I laid my hand on her clammy one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me ? ' There was no sign of comprehension or consciousness . I was very eager to make her hear , so I went on speaking very slowly and distinctly : ' I will take care of your two little boys and see that they never want . Do you understand ? I will take Jonadab and Rechab myself , and care for them . ' Then there was a slight quivering of the eyelids , a faint token of assent and satisfaction , before the stony stare of death returned . I prayed aloud with all my soul for the spirit which was struggling to leave its poor earthly tenement ; while the women moaned and swayed and ejaculated , ' Yes , Laud ; do , Laud , ' as the sentences of the prayer for the dying fell fervently on the still , hot air , and the groans of the dying woman were less loud . Then I sang , ? The women and children joined with their high , clear voices , and while they sang , ' Cover my defenseless head with the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn , and the immortal spirit took its flight and returned to God who gave it , and who is merciful and loving , and knows all the struggles , all the temptations. all the warping influences which had kept it from its highest possibilities . I talked with Rachael , the mother , who , now that the poor daughter was gone , spoke of her with loud and hysterical affection . When I offered io take the children she said that she , the grandmother , was the person to take them ; no one would do for them as she would and she could not think of giving them up to anybody . I was surprised , but pleased , at this her suddenly aroused maternal feeling , and acquiesced in it , saying , ' Very well , Rachael , I agree with you that you are the proper person to take care of the children , , and that no one can do it as well . I will provide everything that the toe I boys need , their food and clothing : just let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was full of excited neighbors , lamenting and ping on as though they had been ; tope friends of the poor deceased . l pro- mised to send what was needed for Abby 's laying out . ' They said the ' Clutch ' would provide the coffin , and attend to the funeral , for she was ' Ilabtist member , in full standin ' , en belonged to de sassiety , en dey was boon ' to bury urn . ' Having done the little I could , I left t he house of death , much exhausted and agitated , to return to the work-aday world outside . I drove home and told Chloe to send one of my gowns and two sheets to Rachael at once ; and then started on the twelve-mile drive to Casa Bianca . When I got there I had my saddle put on Mollie , and rode down the rice-field hanks to Marshfield . There were the gayly dressed women , laughing , singing , talking , as they cut down the golden heads with great dexterity ; laying them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tie tomorrow . The gay scene , which usually gate me so much pleasure , only saddened me now . The tragedy I had witnessed haunted me , and I wondered how in the eyes of the great Judge of all things my life would compare with that whose end I had seen . I reproached myself bitterly for never having visited her before . I had sent her supplies : food , clothing , and m forth , ? yes ; but that was not all . If I had only gone to see her and talk with her , I should not now be filled with self-condemnation . God forgive me for not giving her my time . What are all my occupations in comparison with helping a human soul ? My dear little niece went , I know , and read the Bible to her on Sunday afternoons , but I was always too busy ' or too tired ' to go . Woe is me ! lad so the long , blazing summer day wore on ? a clay of penance ? and the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rang in my ears : ? But Evil is wrought by want of thought , As well as want of heart . The above extract from my diary shows how Rab and Dab first came into my life . During the autumn I kept in touch with them , seeing them daily . I sent them food and clothing , and tried to see if Rachael was doing full justice to them . She was an excellent cook , and had been employed in that capacity by some ladies in the village . But as soon as she took the children she gave up her place , saying that she could not attend to the children and her work ; as the boys had two older sisters of twelve and fourteen , this was evidently not the real reason . Abby had been so helpless in her ill health with her large family , that some of the gentlemen of the neighborhood had secured for her a monthly allowance from the county , and though I had told Rachael I would see that this was continued for the children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place as cook , and consequently being self-supporting might prevent it , so she gave up her situation and lived on the provisions allowed the children , with the result that the little ones looked hungry and continued their stealing . The whole family had learned from infancy to go into the fields within their reach and grabble potatoes , to gather unripe corn for roasting ears , to catch every chicken and steal all the eggs which were not under lock and key . The two elder girls had been taken up , tried , and found guilty of theft before the poor mother 's death . Their only punishment had been to be kept in confinement until the crops were harvested . This rich lowland rice-planting region would be a paradise if people could live on their plantations all the year round ; but the Anglo-Saxon has always been susceptible to malarial fever , and in the early settlement of the country suffered much from it . After some years they found that by leaving their beautiful homes on the rivers with their luxuriant tropical growth during the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which is generally found a few miles inland from the rivers ) , they secured perfect health . With this knowledge the planters joined in selecting some high , sandy , well-drained spot in the original forest , and built lodges with big rooms and wide piazzas in large shady yards , and at the end of May they moved their families from the plantation and remained in the health-giving pines until the first heavy frost in November , when the little villages , so gay and populous all summer , were left silent and deserted during the winter . Peaceville is one of these hamlets of refuge from mosquitoes and malaria , and is only four miles from my plantation and winter home , Cherokee , and here I spend the hot months , driving back to the ricefields every day to look after the work . This year , when I left Peaceville early in . November , I established the orphans and their grandmother in one of the outbuildings in my yard , as it was much more comfortable than the little log but in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least once a week . I soon saw a change for the worse : they got thinner and thinner , with swollen faces and large stomachs like the famine pictures from India I was seeing in the illustrated papers . One bitter cold day in January , Elihu , who is the blackest of my retainers , being of such a rich shade that his mother always spoke of him as ' dal black nigger , ' a man whom I have helped out of every variety of trouble , and who has a feeble desire to help me in return , if it can be done with no effort beyond speech , came to tell me that he heard that Rachael was going to move to Gregory , the county seat eighteen miles away , on that day . spite of the cold , I ordered the buck board at once and drove out to so Rachael . I found the house in grew confusion , ? bedding tied up in hug ( bundles , boxes and trunks corded , ant Rachael in her Sunday best . Why , Rachael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , ma'am , I 'm goM ' to move to town . I got chillun dere to help me . ' I think that is a great mistake , Rachael . Here you have no house rent , you have all the wood you can burn without paying a cent , and your daugh ? ter lives very near you . If your sons are willing to help you , let them send you what they can spare ; it will go much further here . ' But Rachael had made up her mind and was not to be dissuaded . She was tired of the country , and was going to move to town . She had hired an ox ? wagon to take her to the river , where she would take the steamer . When I had tried every argument without avail , I said , ' Then I will take the boys with me . I am not willing for them to starve or spend their time in jail for stealing . ' Turning to the children , crouching over the fire , I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , after many convulsions , shot out , ' Yes , ' urn . ' Rechab was inside the huge fireplace behind the logs , squatting down ; an extraordinary-looking black shrimp . ' Rai ) , do you want to go with me ? ' Rab 's little black face was stolid and expressionless like some little old man 's . It was some time before he ' could be made to understand the situation , but when at last his grandmother pulled him out of the chimney , and cuffing him , said , ' Speak up , ho- , speak up , ' he grunted out , Tra , ' and nodded his head violently . Then I told Rachael that she must sign a paper giving up all claim to the children , to which she responded vociferously , " TaM ' no nuse for me to sign a paper , Miss Patience . You ' se welcome to the chillun . I'se heartily tired of dem ; dey ' s jes ' nachully bad chillun ; deys tek after dey pa , what was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tek ' em en welcome . ' Then the women assembled in the room to see Rachael 's departure , began to exclaim , ' My law , Aun ' Rachael , dem chillun sho ' is lucky . Miss Patience ' ull do de bes ' for dem po ' rudderless ting ' ; and so on . I called for the last shirts I had made the children , but these could not be found . Whether they were so securely packed up as to be out of reach , or whether Rachael had sold them , I never knew , for I lost patience and took the boys out to the buckboard in their rags . There my dainty little niece Mine , who was waiting for me , was filled with dismay at sight of them , and exclaimed , ' Aunt Patience , you are not going to take them now , with us ? ' ' Yes , they are coming now with us , ' I answered , in a voice of such determination that Aline said no more . In the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was taking home . I had the boys climb into the buckboard , covered them with the sacks , and drove off rapidly . In a little while a small voice made itself heard from behind : cold . ' I put Rab into one of the sacks , tied it round his neck securely , covered him with the others , and drove on . I shall never forget the consternation which took possession of the yard when I reached home . Jim , my good man-of-all-work , said nothing when I told him to help the children out and release Rab from the sack ; but as I led the two forlorn mites through the yard to the old wash-house , where there were two rooms , one occupied by Goody , the cook , I was aware of very black looks on all sides . I did not appear , however , to see them , but said to the cook , ' Goody , I put these children in this room next to you , and I beg you to give an eye to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I will look after them myself as much as possible , only at night give an ear to them . ' Goody , who was a very short , plump little figure , neat and tidy but very ugly , drew herself up to her full height , about four feet six inches , and said , Miss Patience , dem chillun is too duhty for lib in de room nex ' me . ' Yes , Goody , I know they arc terribly dirty , but we are going to try and make them different . You know the Good Father promises a special blessing to those who help the orphan , and I feel sure you will wish to get some of that blessing . ' Then I promptly left , having put the children on a bench by the fireplace , where I had Jim , on whose help I can always count , make a fire . And then Aline and I rushed upstairs , and soon the sewing-machine was in rapid operation . That day we cut and made a suit apiece for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night their old clothes could be burned . Besides this we made a mattress to fill with nice , clean straw for their bed , and got blankets and comforts for their bedding . When I called on Chloe to find the blankets I could best spare from the house , her aspect was truly appalling . Chloe had been the comfort of my life for years , having made it possible , by s ' her devotion and faithfulness , for me to live in the old home alone since my mother 's death , with no white person within a mile or two ; so that she had been a friend as well as servant . ThiS terrible innovation , however , was almost more than Chloe could bear with respectful equanimity . She looked so stolid and unsympathetic that I felt obliged to make a little speech somewhat like that I had made to Goody , about the blessing promised to those who care for the orphan , but Chloe answered with great dignity , ' Miss Patience , of course I 'm only a sarvant , en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tink ' t is a bery dangrus ting to barber furriners in yo ' ya 'd , en moreober , chillun ob a teefin ' fambly . I would n't say a wud if dey was we own people orphan , but I kyant undertek to tek keer ob no furrin chillun . ' There was a distinct note of rebellion in this speech , and I answered promptly , ' I have not asked you to take care of them , Chloe . I will do that . But I thought you would wish to share the promised blessing . I see , however , that you do not realize what a serious thing it is to reject a blessing . ' And passing on to the sewing-room , I worked with enthusiasm , stopping reluctantly for dinner , and by sundown everything was finished . Then we formed a procession : Jim ahead with a huge kettle of hot water , then Chloe with soap and towels , and Mine and I behind . The tub had already been put by the fire in the orphans ' room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbolic soap , their new nighties put on , and their old clothes burned . After this was clone , and the tub was removed , I had them kneel down and say the dear little child 's prayer which has helped so many children through so many dark nights : Then they got into their nice clean bed , and we left them . It took Aline and me days of hard sewing to complete the boys ' new outfit . Neither of us was accustomed to make boys ' clothes , and the want of patterns worried us a good deal ; and then the number of buttonholes seemed alarming ; but we invented some patterns not requiring so many . The second day after their arrival Chloe came in and said , ' Miss Patience , you got to be bery pertickler how you feed dese chillun . Ef you give dem much as dey want you ' 11 kill dem sho . ' ' Very well , Chloe , use your discretion about it . I leave their feeding to you . ' Yes , ma'am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy . I give dem dey dinner , and befo ' I start mid mine dey done dem own , and den dey look at mine so pitiful I ' bleege to give ' em mo ' , but Jim say ' t is dangrus to feed ' em too much . ' Jim told me that when he was eating his dinner one day , Rab , having finished his own , watched him with such greedy eyes that he said , ' Redid ) , you ai n't had enuff ? ' Rab answered , ' No sah , I ncber had me belly full in me life . ' Well , Rab , we 'll stall you . Pat 's what we 'll hab to do , Chloe . Dey 's been here ten days , and dere 's no danger now . We ' 11 stall dem . ' Chloe agreed , so the next day the plan was carried out . More dinner was cooked than usual , and the boys were given plate after plate until they said they had had enough , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and assured me that there would never in future be any trouble in satisfying them . I only heard of this after it was over , for I would have forbidden it as dangerous , never having heard of such a thing . I gave the elder , Dab , a little axe , and told him he could get the fallen branches of the oaks which covered the park in front of the house , and carr. ? , them to the kitchen for the stove . This he did with delight , bringing them in a cart made of a box on wooden wheels , Rab always trotting behind ; and after a while they lost their stolid look . It was a great relief to me to find that Chloe was thawing toward the outcasts . Jim was always good to them and gave all the help he could , for Jim had a boy of his own about the size of Jonadab and his heart was tender to them . It was not long before Goody announced that she was going : she could not stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was greatly shocked at this . She had been with me a long time , and was an excellent cook , clean , cheerful , honest , and willing until the arrival of the orphans . I talked with her , and told her they were already improving , and soon would be quite different . There was no use . Go she would . Her dignity was injured as well as her feelings . It was a great loss to me . She not only cooked , but looked after the poultry , and besides I had grown fond of the little old woman . Now Chloe had to cook and she was a splendid cook ; but she had left the kitchen on account of ill health , and I feared another breakdown if she undertook the cooking as well as the maid 's work . However , she was eager to do it , and I looked out for some one to take care of the poultry . Bonaparte told me that lie heard Cinthy was at a neighboring plantation , very poor , and he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a great help to her I told him to get her . So Cinthy came and took possession of the room Goody had left , next to the children . She was Only middle-aged , but she seemed very helpless and a little cracked . She was to get three dollars a month and her food . She had been very friendless and poor , and being what Chloe calls a Maus nigger , ' which means she had belonged to the same master , she was acceptable to the other servants . She was perfectly delighted to get the place , and never met me in the yard without making a deep courtesy , clasping her hands and looking up to heaven and making known her joy . ' Ai n't yo ' see , my Maussa always did tek keer of him people , en now ' e gone , but ' e ai n't furgit me . ' E sen " c chile for find me , en bring me home en tek keer of me . Yes , ' e send ' e chile for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was good to the children , and they were beginning to look happy , to my great satisfaction . One night when I went to hear their prayers Aline heard them singing , and motioned to me not to make a noise . The door was ajar , and we looked in . The two little boys were sitting on their wooden stools in front of a very bright lightwood fire , staring into it , swaying back and forth in time to the rhythm of the strange little hymn they were singing . ' It seemed to me wonderful that these little children , who appeared to be about six and four years old , should remember words and tune so well . Every Sunday afternoon I taught them a very easy little form of catechism used for very young children . When I asked Jonadab the first question , ' Who made you ? ' with violent contortions he shot out , ' My ma . ' Yes , ' I explained , hut God made your mother , and you and everything else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did He make you for ? ' Again Dab shot out a prompt answer , Fo ' work . ' The answer in the little book is , Tor his glory . ' I was puzzled how to combine the two ideas to reach his comprehension . Laborare est orare , and this little black mortal could only glorify his Maker by doing with all his heart his very small duties . After this I gave up using the regular catechism , and told them the wonderful story of the Creation and Redemption of the world in my own words , and they soon learned to tell it themselves with dramatic effect . That story of the whole garden being at the disposal of Adam and Eve , except the one tree whose fruit they were forbidden to touch , appealed strongly to their understanding , and when they told of the temptation they always said , ' Satan tu'n ' eself into a black snake , en ' e crawl up to Eve , en ' e say , " Eat un , ' e good , en ' e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um . ' I always allowed them to tell it to me in their own way , and being well acquainted with the black snake , they preferred it to the word serpent . I then taught them a simple hymn which they seemed to find very difficult , and then I let them sing one of their own little hymns , sperituals , ' the pigs call them ; and in this way I heard all they knew , and going at once to the piano , I tried to write them down in the keys in which the waifs sang them . . IV As soon as I had an opportunity I bought each of them a suit of ' store clothes . ' I got them for four and six years , but they were a little large . Still , the boys gloried in them and wore them on Sundays . Their joy was to take the little axe and cut and bring in load after load of the small dead limbs which make splendid hot fires , and they won their way into Chloe 's heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring they had become very merry , and the change in them from stolid indifference to intelligent interest in every thing , gave me great pleasure , There was one great trouble and distress as they grew happy and at home . The propensities I had hoped would disappear entirely with sufficient food and clothing began to peep ? : ) It . Not an egg could ever be got or the house . The boys watched the hens and knew their nests ; and they stole out early in the morning before any one was awake , took all the eggs into their room , ate some , laid some , and sold some to any one and for anything . Chloe 's utmost vigilance could not come Op with them . The second spring they were with us , Chloe had raised a number of broods of beautiful chickens to the size of partridges . Then they began to disappear rapidly . I said to Chloe , fear it is our cat . ' Chloe answered , " T is varmint , Miss Patience . Ef it was de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' se very watchful . But you kyant ketch varmint . Dey favors de daak . ' Doe evening Chloe had been to the garden about an eighth of a mile from the house to pick green peas . She had Icft Rab in charge of the yard , and she suddenly remembered that she had not locked her room door , so she returned earlier than was her wont . As she approached she saw Rab sitting on the kitchen steps where she had told him to slay , and her heart glowed as she said to herself , Rechab is sholy get-tin to be a sma't boy to tek keer of de ya 'd so good . ' He was shelling an ear of corn and the great crowds of little Plymouth Rocks were running over the steps and his knees , eager to get the corn as it fell . Woe 's heart stopped beating , for suddenly Rab made a dive , caught a chicken , seized it by the feet , swung it round rapidly , then cracked its neck with his teeth , and stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and seized him . Having caught him thus red-handed , she shook him and screamed , ' You wicked boy , I seen yo ' kill dat chicken . ' Rub tried to escape , but she held him , and made him take the little Warm body from his shirt . ' lint yo ' shame to ac ' so awful , Rab ? I trus ' yo ' , and lef ' yo ' in charge of the ya 'd , en I ketch yo ' en see yo ' wid my own eye crack dat checken neck wid yo ' wicked teeth . Ai n't yo ' feared the debbil ' 11 come for yo ' dis minit en carry yo 'm straight to hell ? I feel um a-comin ' . Tell me de trufe befor " e get yo ' , boy . I do n't want yo ' for bu'n . ' Thus exhorted and adjured , terror seized Rab , and he cried , ' Awl ' Chloe , don ' let de debbil ketch me , en I 'll tell yo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , en I hide some under de grape-harbor , en I 'll sho ' yo ' de place of yo ' II save me from de debbil . ' He took her under the grape-arbor and to several places where he had the bodies hid . When Chloe told me , I was wretched , and my first thought was that she did not give the child enough to eat . But when I suggested this , Chloe was indignant , and said in an unnecessarily loud tone of voice that Jonadab and Rechab ate more than Jim and Ben the field hand and herself put together . ' An ' as fo ' yo ' , Miss Patience , Rechab eat mo ' in one day than yo ' eat in a week . Meat , en rice , en turnip , en greens , en tetta , en molasses , not to say all de aig , so dat I kyant no much as gi ' yo ' a biled aig fo ' yo ' breakfast . No , ma'am , Miss Patience , don " cuse me o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does stuff ' im . Lessen yo " lows me to give ' inn a good licken , Satan 's bound ' to carry dat chile off bodily . ' Up to this time I had insisted on moral suasion as the right method of dealing with the boys . In their old life they had been accustomed to beating and harsh words , and I wanted them to have a change in their experiences , and so I had shamed them for bad conduct and rewarded them for good conduct . Now , however , justice and Chloe demanded severity . Rechab had to suffer in his little black body for the evil deeds thereof , so I authorized Chloe to execute what she considered suitable punishment , knowing I could trust to her tender heart not to be too severe . Chloe 's method of administering the rod was unique . ' Now , Rab , ' she said , I goin ' to bag yo ' befo ' I lick yo ' . ' Rah cried aloud for mercy , but she was firm , and put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waist , and then proceeded with much noise and flourish to lay on a light switch . Rechab , however , made a great outcry , and promised volubly never to do so any more ; and certainly for a while he abstained from chicken slaughter . V That November I had gone to the State Fair and committed a great extravagance . I had bought a pair of beautiful white turkeys from the Vanderbilt farm at Biltmore . They cost what seemed an enormous price , but they were said to be hardy and to have a very domestic and contented turn of mind , never wandering far from home . My great difficulty in raising turkeys had been their roaming propensities . They would wander off to a distance and get caught by foxes and other varmint . But I had high hopes of raising a great many with this new variety . One day in May the poultry yard was in great excitement . Mrs. Vander had been sitting on twenty-five eggs for a month , and they were expected to hatch . Mr. Vander , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Chloe went to feed Mrs. V. that evening , she found twenty-four beauties in the nest . Her joy and pride were almost equal to Mr. V. 's . The little turkeys ? pee-pees , as Chloe called them ? were only two weeks old when the time came to move to the pine land for the summer , so the dear little roly-poly yellow things were put in a basket and taken out tenderly in the buckboard , while Mrs. V. was made comfortable in a small coop and followed with the other poultry in the wagon . I had had a new house built for the distinguished family , all wired so that no harm could befall them , and vet they would have plenty of fresh air , and they were very happy when they found themselves together in such delightful quarters after the trials of the move . As soon as we had settled down after the move I sent Jonadab to school , there being one in the little pine-land hamlet of Peaceville , under the auspices of the church , and kept by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mother still beautiful , showing her Greek descent in her perfect features and exquisite skin ; both so refined , so thorough and conscientious , ? they certainly were as near saints as mortal women ever get to be . She had been an heiress , and had married a wealthy rice-planter , but had been left after the war with nothing but her land , of which she could make no use without money to pay for labor . No one will ever know what privations she went through with her children after her husband 's death , for she never made any moan , and brought up her children to do without , smilingly . What a power it gives when one has learned to do without ! For twenty-five cents a month for each child they gave up their whole time and strength to guiding the little dusky minds in the path of learning . They returned the quarter Jonadab carried , saying it would give them pleasure to teach him without pay , and his days of joy began . At an early hour every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white shirt , and his blue denim school-bag on his shoulder , he traveled to school , a broad grin on his black face . I had feared that the strange hesitation and convulsion of his speech would make him a very trying pupil , but the good ladies sent excellent reports of him . He was very attentive and docile , and learned quickly . I thought Rechab was too young and mischievous to go to school , and so he made things lively at home . As soon as Jonadab returned and sat down to study his lessons , Rab sat beside him , and Dab taught him the spelling orally , so that Rab could spell apparently just as well as Dab , only he knew not a single letter . During the summer I went to the mountains to visit a sister , and things went on very satisfactorily . I had Jim write me a weekly letter telling all that went on at the plantation and in the yard , and he reported everything as serene until the autumn , when Chloe announced in a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little V. 's , and in a delicate way hinted that their death had not been a natural one , but accused no one . I knew from the mysterious tone of the letter that something was very wrong , and when I got home the tale was told . Rechab had chased and killed Mr. Vander , and caught the little ones and either eaten or sold them . Mrs. Vander had been wounded , but Chloe had nursed her back to health . It was a sad outcome of my experiment in improved stock , and I was at a loss what to do , but finally I concluded to appear ignorant of Rab 's evil deeds during my absence . The boys were quite well and much grown . They seemed delighted to see me hack , as were all the servants and the Negroes on the plantation . The first week in November the move from the pine land back to the river , that bete noire of life on a rice-plantation , was accomplished . Cinthy , who had been left in the yard alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the household . She had the yard raked very clean , no weeds , no dead leaves anywhere ; so I presented her with a calico frock and a new pair of shoes , and her cup of joy seemed overflowing . I wanted her to try on the shoes at once so that if they did not fit I could exchange them . I had got the number she told me she wore , ? threes ; but the vanity of giving a number which is entirely too small is very common among the Negroes , and I wanted to see for myself if these fitted . But Cinthy refused to try them on , saying , ' To-night I gwine wash me foot , en I 'll try de sho ' on to-morrow when me foot clean . ' The next morning as I sat at the breakfast-table , Chloe came in to say that Cinthy did not feel so well . ' I was much surprised , for she had seemed so well and so gay the day before . Is she in bed , Chloe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I lef ' urn de sit by de fire , but ' e say ' e ai n't feel so good . ' I poured out and sweetened heavily a cup of coffee and took it out at once to Cinthy 's room . I knocked , but getting no answer pushed the door open and went in . Cinthy was saying her prayers , kneeling by the bed ; so I sat down on the little bench by the fire , and set the cup of coffee on the hearth . After a few minutes , thinking she had fallen asleep , I went to her and laid my hand gently on her shoulder . To my horror , the whole figure shook just as though I had touched a doll . Cinthy was dead ! It was a dreadful shock . By her side were the new shoes yet untried . The bed was tidily made up , the room swept , and everything around was neat and commonplace , but the mighty dignity of Death had entered the poor room , and there was a great pathos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees to hear the Master 's summons . Simple , unlearned Cinthy had been called up higher . She knew the great secret of the hereafter . I called Chloe , who almost fainted when I told her . I called Bonaparte , my head man and carpenter , and sent Jim for the doctor ; but there was nothing to be done . It was heart disease of which no one had any suspicion . I sent down to Cinthy 's son , who lived in Gregory , and her friends were notified and they assembled promptly and sang sperituals ' and recounted Cinthy 's virtues , which they all seemed now to appreciate . The son , who owned his house and lot in town , a horse and buggy and pair of oxen , had never thought of providing his mother with the smallest comfort while she lived . Now , however , he paid her his tribute of tears . I had Bonaparte make a coffin , buying all the necessary things at the neighboring country store ; and as I could get nothing that looked nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oak tree , and pinked out yards and yards of white trimming , which was greatly admired . I cut a deep scallop , and then a cluster of holes in it , which gave a very fine effect . It was a relief to sit out under the canopy of Heaven and have this mechanical occupation while I recovered from the shock and agitation . I had given Chloe a nice outfit from my own things for the laying-out , ' and a large bow of black ribbon for Cinthy 's neck . All of these little adornments of the empty shell mean so much to Negroes , and I knew I could in no other way do as much for the limited faithful creature . The simple funeral took place the next day with much circumstance , and its wild minor music , so descriptive of death as a terror , brought to my memory the many nights when as a child I had covered my head with the bed clothing to keep from my ears that heart-breaking wail ; and even now , as the last rites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love so well , some of the same feeling crept upon me , and it was hard to realize that ' Death is swallowed up in Victory , ' that it is truly only the Gate to Life . Beside her parents and grandparents Cinthy was laid to rest . Then came the disposal of her ting . ' The son said , magnanimously , that he wanted nothing , so Chloe proceeded to distribute the little treasures among the few friends who had been kind to Cintlw when she was in need , before I found her , and ' brought her home , ' as she always said . It was very little , ? a cooking pot , a spider , a tub , her bedding , and clothing , including the new calico dress ; but they were much prized by the recipients . No one wanted her little bedstead , a neat little home-made frame ; but Cinthy thought a great deal of it for it was made of ' Indian Pride . ' she said . I had this put out in the orchard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told Jim he must take the boys to sleep in his house for a while till the sense of emptiness in the next room had passed away ; so he invited them but Jonadab refused , saying they ( lid not want to leave their room ; and they slept next to the empty room without one thought of fear , and after a month begged me to let them move into Onthy 's room , which had been scoured and whitewashed . I consented , and they moved in and seemed delighted with their new quarters . During this winter Jonadab continued to go to school , though it gnu him a walk of eight miles and I thought it was too far for such a little fellow . lie was anxious to go , however , and insisted that it was not too far , and proccd that he was right by growing in health and strength all winter . He brought my mail with him every day from the post-office , which was just opposite his schoolhouse in Peaceville. lle had a hoop from a barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance in very short time , and apparently without fatigue . Rah wanted to go too , but I would not consent , and he spent his time getting bresh ' with the little axe and the little cart . He still indulged his great fondness for eggs , but was willing to divide now , and brought some to the house .
