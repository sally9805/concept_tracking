txt Commenting on the sea fight off Jutland , The Daily Chronicle 's naval correspondent says this morning ; " We must assume that some enterprise was in hand by the British fleet . " possibly the grand fleet was making a sweep through the North Sea , but of that there is no evidence . More probably there was a desire to test the German position . " We can hardly suppose that the battle cruiser and other squadrons were intending to enter the Baltic . ' The battle cruiser squadron , which suffered heavily and which the press bureau describes as a fleet , bore the brunt of the fighting with some cruisers . The light cruisers would be the Black Prince and Warrior of the Duke of Edinburgh class and the Defence of the Minotaur class , all three of which have been sunk . They were supporting four fast battleships . " The German official mentions the Marlborough of the Queen Elizabeth class as having been . injured by a'tornedo . All these ships were evidently acting in concert . " The force engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruisers , other cruisers , light cruisers , destroyers and , according to the German statement , submarines . " It is no light thing to lose that noble battle cruiser , the Queen Mary , and two other battle cruisers of the Invincible class , the Invincible herself , which was in the Falklands Isles battle , and the Indefatigable . " We do not know , but it is possible that Sir David Beatty wax in command . with his flag on the Lion , though that ship it not mentioned . He is an officer of great experience and tried service , but presumably his senior officer would have his flag on one of the battleships . " We have , happily , according to the official statement , lost no battleship , but six vessels are unaccounted for . Prestimably these are destroyers additional to the list of those-which are officially stated to have been lost . The Tipperary , which nas gone down , was a new flotilla leader of 1.850 tons , and doubtless it was her flotilla that was engaged . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether by gunfire , submarine , or mine . We carried the war to the enemy 's side of the North Sea and he onserved cautious tactics in withdrawing before a superior force . " The Germans have suffered also , as was to be expected . The battleship Pommern was sunk by our destroyers in a night attack . She was a predreadnought , dating from 11107 , and was the same ship which was torpedoed without being sunk in the Baltic on July 2 , 1915 . " There is some evidence that their battle cruiser squadron suffered . According to our official statement , at least one battle cruiser has been destroyed and another damaged . They lost another small cruiser additional to the Wiesbaden , as well as many destroyers . " The German official statement , as might have been expected , does not tell the whole tale of their losses , but they were neFx their own waters and had a naval base approach , being protected by mine fields behind them . ? ' There is no reason for alarm at what has occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own work in its own way . Unhappily , we have lost many brave officers and men and that is a reflection more serious than that caused by the loss of the vessels which have gone down in action . " The Daily News naval correspondent says : , The British official statement menItions that four ' fast battleships ' were engaged . The only vessels answering this description are those of the Queen Elizabeth type , of which five are known to be in service . These , in addition to the named ship , are the Barham , Warsprite , Valiant , and Malay . ' The Germans declare that the Warsprite was destroyed . There is nothing in our own official statement to indicate that she was even damaged . " The Marlborough , which the GerI mans claim to have damaged by a torpedo , is one of the secondary flagships of the main fleet and is last shown in the navy list as flying the flag of Vice Admiral Sir Cecil Burney . " The Morning Post 's naval correspondent writes : " The official account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no accurate idea of the tactics employed can be gathered from it , and ' speculation on the subject is undesirable . The main outline of operations seems to be as follows : The action took place off the coast of Jutland , according to the German version . off the west coast between the Skager-rak and 1-lorn 's Reef , which lies some twenty miles due west of Esbjerg . ' " Therefore , it would appear that the German battle fleet came out from Wilhelmshaven and not from Kiel through the Shagerrak . The strength of the enemy is not stated . but it can safely be assumed the main high seas fleet was present , including all the elements of a fleet of battleships . battle cruisers , light cruisers , and destroyers . " The strength of the British force Is not stated , but we know there were present the battle cruiser squadron , four battle ships , some armored cruisers , a number of light cruisers , and a force of destroyers . ti was this fleet that first engaged the German high seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means the weather was thick and range of vision perhaps not more than six miles . Therefore the action was fought at short range in which both the main and secondary armaments were brought to bear .
