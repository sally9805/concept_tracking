If it is true that the spirit of the genuine statesman always " wrestles with to-morrow , " President Wilson will not long let his mind dwell upon the election , with whatever satisfaction he is entitled to contemplate the result . A difficult future lies before him . Unsettled problems will allow him no repose . These relate partly to international complications . The Mexican question still looms threateningly . Our relations with Germany may any day be put to the touch by a mad submarine . These are lurking foreign perils which it will require Mr. Wilson 's utmost wariness to skirt . Even more important , it may prove , will be the domestic matters pressing for his attention . The great sweep of Western States into the Democratic party may create expectations and arouse demands similar to those which attended the vast uprush of democracy that bore Andrew Jackson into the Presidency . Many fear an era of radical legislation . The country will watch to see whether President Wilson , having now a personal prestige equal to Jackson 's , will not display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer be any room for the play of merely political motives in Mr. Wilson 's action . The cup of his ambition is running over . Nothing is left for him but to give all he has to his country during the new term of power that the people have conferred upon him . To speak definitely of what may reasonably be asked of the President , we think the hope is general that he will take steps to strengthen his Cabinet . It is not necessary to mention names . Some portfolios are held by men notoriously lacking in dignity and ability . The President will begin his second term fettered by no partisan obligations . He is in debt to no boss . The way will be open to him to proceed to a strengthening of the whole governmental service . Nor can the President be blind to the need of building up the Democratic party , of preparing for the future when the is gone . " First voters " in large numbers flocked this year to the Wilson standard . Ought not a special effort to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh blood , to kindle young aspirations , and so to plan for a strong succession and for stability ? The Nation does not desire to pour laudation over the President-elect . It cherishes no illusions about him . But we believe in his high ability , and we are sure that it will be matched by high opportunity . That he- will seek to rise to its full measure we do not question . That way lies his surest road to secure remembrance and to further expressions of gratitude and trust from his countrymen . All that is demanded is that Woodrow Wilson now give the nation his best . And his best is very good . Mr. Fairbanks , in his somewhat premature telegram of congratulation to Mr. Hughes on election night , spoke of the Republican party as now happily " reunited . " But in California , at least , if Republicans and Progressives are sitting at the same table , it is mainly for the purpose of throwing the convenient crockery at each other 's heads . By the attacks of the Republican leaders upon Gov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old feud is reopened with the old political ferocity . Nor is outside comment wanting upon the surprising overturn in California . The Chicago Tribune elegantly declares it " the champion boob State of the American republic " ; and thinks the ? prospect good that " some day California may have a Japanese Governor . " But all this is , of course , only after-election soreness wearing itself off . We shall not long hear recriminations of this kind . The one great political fact behind it all , however , stands secure . It is no more clear in California than it is in Kansas and Ohio . The attempted alliance of Republicans and Progressives ? solely for the sake of beating Wilson  --  was an insincere and unholy alliance which could not possibly endure . Like the old farmer who believed in special Providences  --  when he wanted to  --  there are some who have faith in the people only when the people agree with them . It pains one to meet Republicans who have lost their trust in democracy . It was such a sudden loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the most sublime confidence in the good sense of the American people . At ten they were clapping each other on the back and saying that , after all , when an issue was got squarely before the voters of this country , there was no doubt of the decision being what it ought to be . By eleven and twelve o'clock they were renewing their faith in democracy and ordering liquids sufficient for baptism in that faith . Now we submit that the infallible oracle of Justice at midnight of Tuesday could not have become the besotted electorate of Wednesday morning . We ca n't have it both ways . Our own opinion is that the Republicans who swore by all the gods on Tuesday night to trust the people were bound by that oath for at least one year . After that , we will let them off just in time , perhaps , for a Republican victory . The Women 's Party is confident that it was of marked aid to Hughes in a number of Middle and Far Western States ; but there is no proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptible part in the result . If in Oregon the women increased the Republican lead , in central and northern California they were reported three to one for Wilson . If in northern Illinois they voted with the men for Hughes , in southern Illinois they voted the Democratic ticket . The indications are that Wyoming , Colorado , Utah , Washington , Arizona , and other States voted for Wilson by majorities in which the women voters played their due part . And it is also plain that there was less of a labor issue than many Democrats hoped . Buffalo , with its almost two-score thousand railway workers , gave Hughes a majority ; the " labor vote " in New York city and Rochester was very disappointing , and Democrats vainly expected it to carry Cook County in Illinois for them . Every bit of evidence that the American electorate does not vote according to group antagonisms is good to come upon . The large majority for Hughes in Illinois does not conceal the fact that he ran behind the State ticket , and that Illinois was sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plurality is placed at about 175,000 , Lowden 's plurality at 120,000 , but women vote for President and not for Governor . The Republicans estimate that the women are responsible for 40 per cent , of Hughes 's plurality , and if we consider it fair to deduct this 40 per cent. , his total is reduced to 105,000 , or about 15,000 less than Lowden received . If to Low-den 's plurality we add the number of votes he would have had if women had voted for him as they did for Hughes , the disparity between the Presidential and Gubernatorial totals would be greater still . In Wisconsin , on the other hand , Philipp has to be content with a plurality that does not quite equal Hughes 's . The extent to which Hughes lagged behind the State ticket in Illinois is not so great as in Iowa , where Harding had expected a plurality of about 125,000 , compared with Hughes 's 65,000 ; nor is it so great as in most States west of the Mississippi . It can not be explained on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger proportions than the men 's , for the fairly complete returns from Chicago show the women splitting their votes between Hughes and Wilson much as the men did . The more reasonable explanation is that , as farther West , there were many Progressive men who were willing to vote for the Republican candidate for Governor , but unwilling to vote for Hughes . In Wisconsin it is possible that Progressives satisfied their radical tendencies in giving La Follette a greater majority than Hughes received . A woman in Congress ! That marks a political revolution indeed , and it will help to assuage for the woman suffragists their bitter disappointment in their certain defeat in both South Dakota and West Virginia . Presumably , Congress will gain by Miss Ran-kin 's appearance , but for her it will doubtless be a great ordeal to be the first woman to appear in one of the greatest Parliaments in the world . The fact that she is the first woman to receive such an honor will surely help her over the embarrassments of her position . If she smokes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not fit her in , do the best we can , with some of the cloakroom habits and manners . The Clerk , of course , will stumble over the " Miss " as he calls the roll , and the visitors to the galleries will first of all look for " that girl from Montana , " with the feminine part casting a very critical eye over her attire . But , after all , the world has moved so rapidly that she will be but a nine days ' wonder . There will be nothing like the prejudice and bad manners for her to encounter which were the lot of the women pioneers in the fields of medicine and law and politics . In the discussion of party alignments in the newly elected Congress it is just possible that people may overlook the fact that that Congress will not meet until December , 1917 . For a full year Mr. Wilson is at liberty to go on with the development of his policies secure in the Congressional majority he has had up till now . The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come into play for a year makes futile much of the speculation and much of the anxiety displayed with regard to a single Congressional vote here or there . Mere accident , in a group of 435 men , may in the course of a year make and unmake majorities . But what is not accident is Woodrow Wilson . In the course of a year the President 's policies may be depended upon to shape out of the present chaos andflux in the opposition ranks a sufficient reinforcement to make Congress a workable body for most purposes of importance . It is rather idle to wonder what will happen when 215 Democrats meet 215 Republicans in the House of Representatives a year from now . By that time , many things may happen in Republican circles , in and out of Congress . News of the European war is again printed on the first page of American newspapers . The Presidential election had driven it off for nearly a week . Its reappearance is an outward sign of the inward shifting of chief interest . We in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle and slaughter going on abroad . But we could not be so long . The appeal of the great conflict , the horror of it , must break through any other preoccupation for the time being . Besides , we can not rest secure in our aloofness . The position to which our Government is committed in the matter of submarine warfare is such that any day may see President Wilson called upon to act . But we now have one great advantage in all this affair . No incident that may occur , no course of policy that may be adopted , will be seized upon and distorted in a partisan spirit . The big questions will have a chance of being discussed on their merits . This will be true also of our difficulties with Mexico . When our treaty with Nicaragua was drafted , granting that nation $3,000,000 in return for the right to construct a Nicaraguan canal and a ninety-nine-year lease of certain islands and a coastal naval base , the objections of Nicaragua 's neighbors were met by Senate amendment declaring the treaty not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states . " That this did not satisfy the objections was shown by the prompt report that Costa Rica had sued Nicaragua in the Central American Court of Justice , because of infringement of her rights . The difficulties of our position are now recalled by the American Peace Society 's plea that we submit the controversy over the treaty to this Court for adjustment  --  a plea accompanied with the statement that the opposition of Salvador , Costa Rica , and Honduras is so warm that it threatens to ruin all the foundations laid for Central American union . The right of the United States to keep clear of the Court is undoubted . As formed by treaty in Washington nine years ago , it required only that disputes among the five Central Americanstates should be submitted to it . It may well be that the tribunal which has never considered questions of great moment , and has hardly had the prestige in Central America to give its verdicts sure acceptance , is not a body before which the Amerman treaty can be advantageously " adjusted . " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costa Rican-Nicaraguan suit , the opportunity would be an excellent one for the United States to explain fully that the treaty is meant to be advantageous , not disadvantageous , to all Central America . Like many other observers , both friendly and unfriendly to the idea of government ownership of railways , Mr. Ivy Lee sees in recent developments a strong drift towards it . One point referred to in his address at Boston is worth more attention than is usually given to it  --  namely , that our railway development is as yet very in. complete , a striking fact mentioned by Mr. Lee being that there is only one double-track railway west of the Missouri River . The aspect of this which Mr. Lee touched upon as bearing on the subject of government ownership is that " our future national development would be inevitably retarded by the red-tape , bureaucracy , and lack of ' punch ' incident to all Government effort " : but there is another aspect of it that strikes us as even more important . Local demands , sectional claims and rivalries , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense , constant , and pervasive as to make our past experiences in log-rolling and pork-barrels seem a trifling matter . When people point to government ownership of railways in Europe as showing the way to us , they forget the difference that is made by three essential factors  --  the vastly greater significance of transportational questions to the ambitious and growing communities of our great young country , the generous additions that are still to be made to our railway facilities , and the thoroughly popular character of our governmental organization . No hidden motives have been attributed to Henry Ford in the establishment of the five-dollar minimum wage for women a month ago . But the possible basis for one is revealed in the by no means startling assertion that the wage will have a discouraging effect upon matrimony . Remarks one of Mr. Ford 's 1,500 women employees , a stenographer , to the Survey : How do I like it ? Well , we girls have watched each morning the porter polishing up the handle of the big front door as we came to work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and polish brass for Mr. Nord it paid so much better than typewriting . This money has been coming to us . But , of course , Mr. Ford really does n't like to employ women . He says he ca n't build up an organization with them  --  they marry and quit work . I 'll think twice before I marry now , Though ? I like my job too well to lose it . And 3 certainly wo n't marry a man making only $30 a week . I can hardly support myself on that . The facts in the case will be plain to those who think uncharitably of Mr. Ford . Having raised the wage of the men to five dollars , the natural sequel was that many previously unable to do so married  --  newspapers have published the general number . The women employees were among those sought as wives , and the only remedy was to make their wage sufficient to lessen the temptation . The complaint that it Is difficult to build up a lasting office organization with women is common , but Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often to be sought . Pictures of the cotton mill as an ogre devouring fresh childhood do not appeal to the sense of justice of South Carolinians . Some of the considerations creditable to the mills are summarized by the Columbia Record in an issue celebrating the fact that the annual value of the cotton manufactures of the State has surpassed $90,000,000 : When the cotton mills were started , there was an impoverished people , an impoverished soil , an impoverished agriculture . The renters were producing a " bumble-bee cotton " which had just about enough lint for six acres to produce a bale . At that time cottonseed had no value . . . . The mills not only relieved the strain upon the tenant farmer , but the farms immediately around the mills were encouraged to produce poultry , meat , and vegetables for the market . . . . The mills gave an impetus to a new kind of agriculture by demanding a better kind of cotton for their spindles . Staple and fibre have been improved , and the value thereby greatly enhanced . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , when every countryside had its cabins of the Illiterate and half-starved , and those of today . Of course , other factors have played a part in improving matters . But it also asserts that employers are too humane and wise , employees too independent , to permit many abuses within the factories . The mills are spending large sums ? $1,000,000 a year ? In the improvement of living and working conditions . South Carolina has a well-enforced child-labor law ; it Should stir some of her neighbors to learn that since its passage " comment upon the fact that there were idle men in mill villages " living on their children 's wages has ceased . Does fire prevention prevent , or is the campaign without effect upon a hopelessly careless people ? So authoritative a body as the National Board of Fire Underwriters announces that there is excellent reason for being gratified over the progress of the last year or so . New York city had a thousand fires less in 1915 than in 1914 , with a decrease in losses of more than $2,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents less than had been known before . The same story comes from Chicago , while Boston 's metropolitan district reports for three successive Juries 1,337 alarms , 935 alarms , and 605 alarms . The reduction in Cincinnati is so large-20 per cent . in the number of fires and nearly 50 per cent . in losses  --  that one feels with special force the inconclusiveness of comparisons covering so short a period . Milwaukee , however , has done about as well . All these cities have paid special attention to fire prevention . The task remaining to be done is indicated by the statement that last year saw the enormous total of nearly $40,000,000 in the single item of dwelling-house fires in this country , of which amount more than $6,000,000 was directly traceable to defective chimneys and flues , " a cause which could have been ascertained and corrected . " Medical education in America will score another big advance in the establishment at Chicago of a medical school of the first order , through the addition , just announced , of a grant of $2,000,000 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources already existing in connection with the University of Chicago and the Rush Medical College . The latter institution , which , in recent years , has been conducted in cooperation with the University of Chicago , will be completely absorbed in the new medical school , the value of whose entire endowment  --  productive funds , buildings , and equipment  --  is estimated at $11,000,000 . The requirements for entrance are to be substantially the same as those adopted by the Johns Hopkins Medical School when it was opened , a quarter of a century ago . Those requirements were so very much higher than any theretofore exacted in American medical schools that the faculty expected only a very small attendance ; but the response from the beginning proved to be so hearty as to strain the facilities of the school . The standards of American medical education have been enormously raised , since then , all along the line ; and this new move at Chicago will greatly reinforce the movement , already strong , to put American medical education on a level with that of the foremost countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country suffering from the increased cost of living to an extent as great as that experienced in the United States . In the six months between July and December , 1914 , the cost of a weekly family budget of some thirty staple foods rose from $7.42 to $8.13 , though part of this rise was perhaps due to seasonal differences . The cost of food in 1915 was reckoned 13 per cent . greater than five years before  --  and this throughout the Dominion as a whole , not in the cities alone . The cost of fuel and lighting was but 4 per cent . greater than in 1910 , but in many manufactured goods there were again phenomenal rises . The predominating influence the Department naturally finds to be the war , and it points out the compensating stimulation of the high prices upon industry and trade . Not only did the war make necessary production in many lines never before thought of , but it made profitable production that was not necessary and that had been attempted in quieter times with unsatisfactory results . War is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixing prices than ever before . The short crop of 1914 was of secondary importance in raising prices , the large crop of 1915 did not reduce them to anything like normal levels . However much she grumbles at higher living costs , Canada can not but reflect that the war rescued her from a depression accentuated by the reaction from " boom " times . Among casualties of the war is listed compulsory Greek at Cambridge  --  and it is a casualty that causes grief in England . The University Senate has been empowered to remit the study in the case of men who have served six months , and it is mournfully agreed that the accidental breach in the wall can never be made quite strong again . Ox- , ford , too , has shown signs of weakening , in spite of the presence of Murray as Regius Professor , in spite of the quatrain of a generation ago : Her sons oblivious of concessions weak , Undaunted guard the minimum of Greek , Flaunting in front of spurious B A. 's Three books of Xenophon or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like De Quincey , enter thinking of some obscure text of the " Parmenides , " must be rare . Scholars are consoling themselves over Cambridge , if we may believe a London weekly , with the thought that students are told : " If you can not read the Iliad , you can act it . " The pleasure of putting this into Greek verse might have compensated Porson for the blow the step would have struck him . AMERICA AND WORLD PEACE . It was a notable coincidence that the same day which established the reelection of Woodrow Wilson should have brought a convert to the idea of a new world order in the person of the German Chancellor . Let us take Bethmann-Hollweg 's pronouncement in favor of a league of peace at its minimum valuation . Let us give full weight to the reservations and conditions in Germany 's readiness " to enter a league of peace which will restrain the perturbator of peace . " It still remains true that the German Chancellor gives notice that he is shaken in the old and evil faith of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international relations : If at , and after , the end of the war the world will only become fully conscious of the horrifying destruction of life and property , then through the whole of humanity there will ring out a cry for peaceful arrangements and understandings which , as far as they are within human power , will prevent the return of such a monstrous catastrophe . This cry will be so powerful and so justified that it must lead to some result . Who is the craven and mollycoddle that so gives himself to millennial dreams ? It is the War Lord himself . Is he absolutely sincere ? It does not matter for the moment . It is enough that the voice of the Hohenzollern , through the mouth of a Prime Minister , should make acknowledgment of the fact that the world and the soul of man can not be quite the same after the great war , that it should give recognition to the destruction of ancient fetiches and to the stirring of new longings for escape from the old , fatal dogmas of world statecraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe to yield to a force beyond his control , the reality of that force is confessed , Everywhere else statesmen have recognized it ; in neutral Europe ; men like Grey and Bryce in England ; and in this country , where the idea of a league for the enforcement of peace is sweeping on victoriously . Only one man of eminence has failed to seize the meaning of the new time , and he , curiously enough , is the one man in America supposed to be endowed with a genius for gauging public sentiment . Everybody is a mollycoddle to-day except Mr. Roosevelt . Among the soft-fibred " pacifists " now stand the Kaiser , Earl Grey , Mr. Taft , Mr. Wilson . Only for the Colonel has there been no lesson and no change in a world catastrophe which has torn up the ideas and ideals of men by the roots . He has gone careering up and down the country with the same old palaver about war and justice as if a war in which every one of a dozen nations is fighting for justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sounding the same old cry about armaments as the only guarantee of peace in face of the astounding spectacle which super-armed Europe offers . He has revelled in the ancient slogans of national honor and national manhood , and has remained blind to the fact that men who have not lost their manhood , men Who would not hesitate to give their lives for the national honor , have yet learned to scrutinize and appraise the phrase for which they are asked to sacrifice themselves and work woe on others . To Mr. Roosevelt the war in Europe might as well have been a border foray in Afghanistan . The prospect of this nation of a hundred million plunging into the war and so making the bedlam of the world unanimous , is seemingly no more to him than any other little adventure into Haiti , or Samoa , or Patagonia . When I was President , says Mr. Roosevelt , I frightened the Kaiser out of Venezuela ; why did n't Mr. Wilson frighten him out of Belgium ? The man who speaks so is not only blind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind to what is going on around him . That change which Mr. Roosevelt has failed to discover in his countrymen , Woodrow Wilson has recognized from the beginning . Coward , poltroon , white feather , and " too proud to fight " have been flung at the man to whom the West has risen with loyal enthusiasm . The man over whom the bouncing patriots of Wall Street hung their heads in shame has been approved against them by the white-livered citizens of Wyoming and Montana , by the decrepit manhood of Arizona and New Mexico , by the cattlemen and sheep herders and lumber-jacks and farmers who have grown slothful and cowardly with easy living . We know the answer for Colorado and Kansas , of course . Secure against the horrors of invasion , the people of the Plains and the Rockies have refused to consider anything but their own selfish comfort . But what of Washington and California , against whom Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Hearst have been leading the battle fleets of Japan ? Whatof Arizona and New Mexico , which have seen war much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is the voice of bitter judgment from commonwealths writhing in the shame of our violated national dignity ? Those Commonwealths have spoken . Take the map of the United States and trace on it the itinerary of Mr. Roosevelt 's flaming gospel : the line will mark the course of the heavy Wilson majorities . For Wilson had seen what Mr. Roosevelt had closed his eyes to  --  that the same region which was formerly stirred by Mr. Roosevelt 's new nationalism is now abrim with the currents of a new world feeling . Fortunate for the honor and prestige of America that in the settlement of the new world order , that for the role which America is bound to play after the catastrophe of half a thousand years , the country 's guidance will be in the hands of a man whose eyes look into the promise of the future and not into the fears and jealousies and vanities of the past . ONE WAY OF ELECTING PRESI-DENTS . " One of the first duties of Congress when it reassembles , " says the New York World , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment of the Constitution to substitute a direct vote of the people for the Electoral College in the election of a President of the United States . " The proposal that the choice of President should be made to turn on the direct result of a count of voters throughout the Union always comes to the fore after a close election . And In the minds of many , the peril presented by the delivery of a big block of Presidential Electors to one candidate or the other turning on the count of a few score of votes in a handful of belated districts is merely an aggravation of an evil which they regard as in itself intolerable . Thus an indignant letter-writer in one of the papers , who happened to labor under the impression that Hughes had a half-million plurality over Wilson in the popular vote , exclaims : " If this be a Government of the people by the people , our system of counting the votes for the Presidency is a farce  --  for a President may be seated when only a minority of the people want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the passing of a Constitutional amendment to substitute a direct popular vote for the present system of electing the President will not be one of " the first duties " that Congress .
