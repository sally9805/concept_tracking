S o m e-times I wonder if I am not really sea Morel for ire . So far as I know there are not more than half a dozen people in all Chicago who know the facts . The story is not one to excite sympathy . But I am beginning to feel sorry for myself , and that , I know , is a dangerous frame of mind . What I really want is a job that will pay wages enough to support my wife and famil , v. AM a middle aged ? bo- okkeeper and otlice 1 man . All my adult life I have lived behind a set of ledgers. 1 am rather short in ttsture .

But it is harder for her than it has over been for eie. ; ' I would feel better about it it once she would complain . - ? - NOW that ms story would be more interesting it I could confess that 1 had lost money gambling and stole to make up the losses ; people would feel sorry for me if I bad been a drunkard and wasted hundreds in saloons ; even if it had been a case of another woman , there would be to *good many people something dashing and sensational about my fall . There is n't any INC lying about it . I am a commonplace little man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full blooded vices. 1 do n't drink , I have serer played a game of cards for money ' r bet on the races , and always I have been what is called faithful to my wife . Except that for two years I stole money almost every week , 1 have lived a perfectly respectable and colorless life . All oar neighbors look on us as respectable and well to do people in our small way . OSLY the other morning . I was standingg out on the porch about 7 o'clock wondering whether there was any way out of my present difficulties when the man who lives next door started out for his work . He is a bookkeeper , too . " Well , John , " he said , " I wish I was Ale to retire like you have . " And 1 smiled back at him . " I 'm get ting tired of loafing , " I said .

Every week for eighteen years we put away n11 we could spare from my pay envelope In the sayitigs bank . It took us that long to pas for the little house we still occupy . DOTI ' my wife and I came from a " small town . Our families had always gone to church , awl after we came to the city we keut up out " church connection . Ws go to church now regularly twice on every Sunday , vs we always have . And the children go to Sunday school . My wife is one of the offizers of the Ladies ' Aid society . I think it would be very hard work to make our Pastor or any one of the elders of our church believe that I have been a Wet The worst of it is that I have n't any good excuse or reason for taking the money . I ? ould n't even tell where it went to , how it *IX spent . If there had been a long and serious illness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any one thing I can put my hand on and say " That is why I took the cash . " WORKED for the same firm for a good ninny years and tip to a few months ago . They were good employers . I started at $20 a week as the assistant bookkeeper . When the head bookkeeper was n't in the office I acted as cashier and paid out and received money . A lot of cash went through that office every day and it never even occurred tome to take any of it . I was living within my salary in the first place ; my wife was economical and saving ; I was a church member in good standing and honesty bad been always drilled into me . When we bought the little house my salary had been raised to $27 a week , mighty good wages for the work I was doing as wages go . I have n't any complaint to make on that score . I did n't steal because I was ground down by a heartless employer . Well , we paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money we had eared . The children were getting big . The girl was in the high school . I had been holding my job ten years and not once had I ever even conceived the idea of taking a cent of the firm 's money . I was now head bookkeeper and cashier . The firm trusted me . I was not even under bond . O NE day I was an even $100 short . I had no money in the bank just then from which I could make good the shortage . I was almost certain , anyhow , that I had overpaid a certain man in that amount and I really expected that he would come back and repay the money as soon as he discovered the mistake . I fixed the books to hide the shortage . The man did n't Come back . I did n't know how to get my hands on a hundred dollars . A couple of weeks went by . I let the falsification of the books stand . The firm never discovered it or suspected anything . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was practically all spent on the family . It dribbled through my fingers in amounts , I could not tell how . I took my wife to the theater now and then and once or twice we had supper downtown together . I told her I had had a raise in salary . The girl had a couple of new dresses . It all went in little fooliah , extravagant ways like that . A T the end of two years ' pretty steady stealing I woke up one morning and decided to stop . The firm still suspected nothing . For the next whole year I did not steal a cent . But my hope of gradually paying back the $2,000 I bad taken was not realized . We were still putting a little money in the bank , bat I could n't I use that without telling my wife the truth . That I finally decided to do . I told her all about it one morning before I went to the office . She sat very still and white and heard me through without interrupting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " and now I 'm going down and tell the same story to the boss . I do n't know whether I 'll be back tonight or not . " " We 'll put a mortgage on the house and raree the money to pay them back , John , " she said , " and perhaps they 'll forgive you and give you a chance to make good . Whatever happens , I 'll stick by you . " The boss seemed to be madder because I had been able to deceive him successfully so long than for any other reason . He was willing to let me pay back the money and agreed not to proaecpte . But he said that , of course , he could n't think of keeping me in his employ . Pr HAT was three months ago , and is about all of my story . We mortgaged the house for $1,800 and paid the balance out of the money we had in the savings bank . Since then I have not been able to get any work . Twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when I told the man the truth about what I bad done he turned me down . My weak foot prevents me from doing bard manual labor . The only thing I know anything about is keeping books . I have learned my lesson . Our money is all gone , We are still keeping up appearances at the house , and neither the neighbors nor the children suspect that anything is wrong . I think that for their sake , at least , I might be given one chance to make good . This is the story of a real man . No .. body is going to identify him , however , from this telling of it . But the important facts are just as stated . And he wants a job and a chance . INQUIRY ON WOMAN 'S DEATH . Coroner to Investigate Alleged Beating of Patient at State Hospital for the Insane .
