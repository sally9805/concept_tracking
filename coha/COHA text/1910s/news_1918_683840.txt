txt Chairman Hurley of the Shipping Board performed a national service when he set before the public in his address at the National Marine League dinner the facts of our shipping progresS and showed that we have now under construction more shipbuilding yards and ways . than are possessed by any other nation . Rev. Dr. Charles A. Eaton who spoke later and who is doing a great work in bringing the church of national patriotism to the men of the shipyards said that Mr. Hurley was not really up-to-date .. Eaton had just come from the yards of the Submarine Boat Co. and said they had 18 keels laid there instead of 15 , but the keels were going down so fast on the new shipways now that nobody could be expected to keep track of them . Mr. Eaton said he hung his head in shame for his country when he read the criticism of the newspapers leveled at the work in building the shipyards at Hog Island where the mercury for days was 17 degrees below zero and men could labor only 15 minutes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may yet be ashamed of all the criticisms leveled at the Liberty motor , or may be proud of them if they have helped to improve and to speed up the motor . Upon the entrance of this country into the war , the Allies brought to Washington the plans for all the foreign motors and asked that the United States manufacture in quantity anything we might select . It was naturally assumed that our factories would soon be turning out the foreign machines in quantity , hutour inquiry at Washington concerning this matter has brought forth the following : " Foreign motors are largely hand work and can not be made in quantity production unde  --  the American system . Look at a foreign motor car . It is full of machinery . Then look within an American car . It is full of simplicity .

The Packard was an eight-cylinder and the Liberty motor is a twelve . The speed in design can seen from the fact that the Packard people spent a half million dollars and several years and then got only a basis for the present motor . The Liberty motor will be turning out in quantity in a very few weeks . " It need not be assumed that we have not been at work on machine tools , models , dies , etc .. even though we have been adjusting and improving various parts .
