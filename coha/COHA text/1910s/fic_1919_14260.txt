THE SCENE is laid in the so-called dining-room of one of those forlorn hostelries of the great Plains , which goes by the name of Mace 's Good Hope Road-house , a derisive title evidently intended to signify the traveler 's hope of early escape from its desiccated hospitality . This room is sometimes reluctantly frequented by a rare guest , usually a passenger on his way via auto stage , to some place else , whom delays en route have reduced to this last extremity of lodging for the night . The room is a kind of lumber yard of disused cheap hotel furniture . Nothing can be drearier . Most of this junk is heaped along the left ( stage ) wall , and it has a settled look of confusion which the processes of gradual decay will , apparently , never disturb . Tables tip crazily against the plaster of the greasy wall . Chairs upturned on these , project thin legs , like the bones of desert places , toward a ceiling fantastically stained . One table smaller than the rest , sees occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has about it three chairs reasonably intact . A pack of cards and several dirty glasses adorn the top . A stairway rises along the right wall , beginning at the rear , and attaining to a rickety landing , supported by a single post of doubtful strength , to which is affixed a glass lamp in a bracket . ( Inasmuch as the stairway is turned away from the audience , those who ascend are completely hidden until their heads top the last riser . ) At the right front , between the landing and the proscenium , a door ( now shut ) leads to the Bar , the one spot of brightness in this lump , the shining crack at its sill bespeaking the good cheer beyond . And that crack is the only illumination to this morgue of defunct appetites , for the moonlight , which enters by way of a small window at the right , is rather an obscuration , inasmuch as it heightens the barren mystery of the room 's entombing shadows . Double doors center of rear wall lead to the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much for the melancholy set . From the Bar percolates the lubricated melodiousness of the few regular customers who constitute the population of Fever Flat , with the exception of three worn-out women folks , two haggard cows and three hundred or so variegated dogs . The female element are to home , the dogs , astray and astir , with lamentable choruses . Sounds from the Bar , samples only . A JOLLY SOUL hoarsely . Pitch into her , boys ! Tune up your gullets ! With quavering pathos . " She was born in old Kentucky "  --  p. 3 ANOTHER SUCH with peeve . Aw , shet up , that 's moldy ! Giv 's that Tennessee warble , Hank ! HANK rather rich and fine . " When your heart was mine , true love , And your head lay on my breast , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You could make me believe &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the falling of your armThat the sun rose up in the west  --  " There is a momentary pause , filled in by  --  A VOICE Y'oughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hank . MACE as if misanthrope . Aw , women  --  During the laugh that follows , an auto horn blares outside and a bright shaft is visible through the rear windows . VOICES Stage 's come ! Stage 's come ! There are sounds indicating the rapid evacuation of the Bar , and a moment later one of the rear doors is jerked open and the Stage Driver enters , dragging in two heavy suitcases which he deposits near the small table with appropriate grunts , meanwhile encouraging the passengers to enter . STAGE DRIVER Uh ! perty lumpy bags  --  come in , folks , come in ! Seems like you might be carryin ' all your b'longings . The two passengers enter ; the man , quickly , nervously , almost furtively ; the woman , with that weariness which ignores everything except its own condition. p. 4 STAGE DRIVER Come in and set , lady ; do n't be skeered . Looks a little spooky , but Hank 'll have a glim fer ye in two shakes . Places a chair for her . Here , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking around at the drear surroundings . ' S fer ' s yer able . LON I thought the stage went through to Hollow Eye to-night ? STAGE DRIVER Well , sir , she do , but this time she do n't . I 've been havin ' to run ten miles on low already and I jest do n't dast take her across that thirty miles of sand the way she is . She 'll drink water like a thusty hoss and like as not lay down and die on us half way out . Then where 'd we be ? No sir ; you folks 'll just have to camp here at Fever Flat till I kin do a tinkerin ' job to-morrow mornin ' . So I 'll step into the Bar and tell Hank you 're here . At the door to the Bar . Hank 'll do the best he kin fer ye . He 's a squ'ar man . Good-night to ye ! Goes out , leaving the door half open . LON briefly . Good-night . Looking about . What a hole ! Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all stand just the way it was . He goes to the open door at the rear and stares at the naked moonlit buttes . Them hills gits my goat . They 're nothin ' but blitherin skeletons , and this bunch of shacks they call Fever Flat looks like no more'n a damn bone yard to me . Shutting the door . Ugh ! it 's cold in here . Feel like I was sittin ' on my own grave 's edge . p. 5 PADIE scarcely raising her head , and speaking with no emotion , in a dead dry voice . You did n't use to be so pernickety , when you was punchin ' on the range , Lon . LON waspishly . And you did n't use to look like a hag , neither , Padie . PADIE with a momentary flash . Drink 's poisoning your tongue , too . LON viciously . Who 's drinking ? Cai n't I take a thimbleful now'n then without all this jawin ' ? PADIE You ai n't takin ' thimblefuls . You 're just soakin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep on . ' n then , what 'll I do ? Resuming her air of weary indifference . Not that I care so much what you do with yourself  --  or what becomes of me . Nothing matters . LON petulent and aggrieved . There you go , actin ' abused . How ' bout my rights ' n pleasures ? Ai n't got none , I s'pose . PADIE Oh , shut up , you make me sick . Hank enters ; a ruddy , vigorous , young man , strangely out of place among all this rubbish . He wears a barkeeper 's apron and speaks cordially. p. 6 HANK Howdyedo , folks ! Howdye do ! well , this is a kinda rough lay-out fer you-all . Y'see the Stage is due here at five , and stops fer grub , then makes Hollow Eye by about nine , but here ' t is pulls out watchhalf an hour of midnight an ' I s'pose you ai n't et , yet , eh ? Lights the glass lamp . PADIE Thanks . We 've had sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly . Wet . Padie shrugs indifferently , and fixes her hair . As she turns toward Hank , the light for the first time falls full on his face . Padie stares fixedly at him , and half rises , with a little cry . LON with a quick , startled glance at Hank , speaks to her in a sharp , threatening voice . Padie ! Sit down ! Are you gittin ' plumb loco drivin ' out so late in autymobiles ? To Hank , apologetically . You kinda flustered us , mister , cause you have a little the look a friend of ourn that died suddint . Mournful case . Pardner o'mine . No , you 're not much like . He was tall , heavy-built and lighter complected . Must a been consid'ble older , too . PADIE almost in a whisper . No. p. 7 LON Older , I say . My wife 's kinda wrought up by this here little spell of travelin ' . HANK sympathetically . Oh , you 're not used to it , eh ? PADIE slowly and deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word into a burdenyears . LON impatiently . That is , off'n on , m'dear . Only off'n on . PADIE monotonously . All the time . HANK trying to be a little jocose to break the oppressive atmosphere . Should think you might hanker after yer own nest , lady . PADIE rising rudely . Well , just keep your thoughts ! HANK completely abashed . Yes , ma'am . Your room is just at the top of the landin ' . I 'll make ye a light . He hustles away upstairs to cover his embarrassment , taking the suitcases with him . LON irritably . You 're always tryin ' to belittle me in public . Is that any way fer a wife to act ? I wanta know . p. 8 PADIE What do you always lie so fer ? LON with rising voice . That 's my business . I 'll do as I damn please . and do n't you go too fer , crossin ' me . I wo n't stand it . Some day I 'll up , an  --  PADIE contemptuously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , wife-beater . Lon raises his hand as though to strike her , but lets it fall as Hank reappears on the landing . HANK Excuse me , m'am . Have you your own towels by you ? Ourn is pretty scaly . It 's been so long since we 've had in women folks , at least , ladies . PADIE moving toward the stair . Thanks , we have some . Lon to Padie as Hank , hidden from audience , descends . LON You might as well be decent , Padie . You ai n't got none other but me . PADIE bitterly . Yes , you 've took me from'em . We 've been trapsin and trapsin till I 'm plumb sick . Yes , I 'm  --  Her voice breaks and she runs blindly toward the stair , almost into the arms of Hank , which further increases his consternation . HANK holding her off . Stidy , stidy . There 's the ladder , m'am . Ca n't I fetch you somethin ' ? Toddy ? Padie shakes her head , runs up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly fashion . Women folks is cur'us , cur'us . LON surlily . Take my advice and keep free from ' em . HANK It was a woman did fer my brother . LON with increased interest . Oh , you 've got a brother , eh ? HANK simply . Had . LON Where is he ? HANK Down at Laguna Madre , Arizony . LON leaning forward and gripping the edge of the table . Ranchin ' ? HANK Buried . LON haltingly . How  --  what were you saying  --  about a woman ? HANK A woman done fer him . That 's what they said , I do n't know . I did n't git there fer a long time . There was a mix-up . LON Well , well . That 's strange . HANK eagerly . I s'pose you heard of it ? It was in all the papers . It even got as fer as Denver . LON No , I do n't remember . But I 've read of similar cases . p. 10 HANK You 've been to Arizony , I s'pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around them parts , but never Arizony . HANK ' Tai n't what you 'd call a perty country , but it 's mighty satisfyin ' . Too blame cold up here . LON Why do n't you move ? HANK I 'm agoin ' to , but you see my brothr had half interest in this here tavern and there was some litigation about it . Case 's just finished . I been here three years , ever since he went . But I 'm pullin ' my stakes , you bet . I would n't be buried here ! Would you ? LON dryly . I 'd rather not . HANK So she took me fer a friend that 'd croaked , eh ? That 's cur'us . LON Eh ? What 's that ? Who ? HANK Your wife . LON Oh , yes . Well , he was a good ten years older . And dark-complected . HANK Thought you said he was light . LON Mebbe I did . Well , he mought have been a trifle lighten'n you , but then , size him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fergit him . Bring us a bottle of your best  --  and see that the glass is clean . p. 11 HANK To be sure . Goes out . Lon sits with his head between his hands , brooding . The voice of Hank rises from the Bar , rendering the second verse of the Tennessee " warble . " HANK in the Bar.There 's many a girl can go all round aboutAnd hear the small birds sing.And many a girl that stays at home alone , And rocks the cradle and spins . As the song ends , the door at the rear opens soundlessly , revealing the vast expanse of moonlit plains and desolate buttes . Lon shivers and turns up his coat collar , finally facing about to discover the cause of the chill . Observing the open door , he goes to it , closes and locks it , the click of the key being distinctly audible . He then returns and sits as before , and again the song comes . HANK in the Bar.There 's many a star shall jangle in the west ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will light upon the manFor treating a poor girl so . Now both of the double doors swing open , without sound . Lon shivers , then , looking over his shoulder , suddenly gets up , glares about him and makes hastily for the door to the Bar , where he almost collides with Hank entering with bottle and glass .. p. 12 HANK Here , mister , I was just comin ' . LON What the devil 's the matter with your doors ? HANK Them ? Oh , the lock 's no good . When the wind 's southwest they fly right open . Got to be wedged with a shingle . He goes over to the doors , slams them shut , picks up a shingle from the floor and inserts firmly between them . LON relieved . H 'm . Well , that 's all right . HANK Now it 's blame cur'us the way old places gits . You 'll hear these floor boards creak at times like as if som'un was sneakin ' over ' em b'ar-foot . Feller told me once it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I reckon knowinglythere 's more goes on around than we give credit fer . Hank dusts off the table and puts bottle and glass down . Lon seizes them eagerly and begins drinking . LON after a couple of glasses . You mean  --  spirits ? HANK Well , I du n no as you 'd call ' em that . But it 's a fact , there 's more liquor goes over the Bar than gits paid for . ' Tai n't stole either . It just goes . As old Pete Gunderson used to say , " I 'm a hell of a th'usty p'uson , and when I croak I 'll be a hell of a th'usty spirit . " I sometimes wonder  --  Padie appears above , in a loose dressing sack , her hair hanging in a great wavy mass , and holding a pitcher. p. 13 PADIE , LON Please fetch some water . LON not moving . I do n't dast go out in the night . I 've caught a kind of chill from to-day 's drive . HANK going up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She comes down to meet him and the two are momentarily hidden from the audience . Lon continues to drink steadily , pouring down one glass after another . Hank reappears , treading with a certain gayety , and goes out rear , whistling the Tennessee " warble " . PADIE leaning out of the shadow of the stairway toward her husband . Ai n't you comin ' up soon , Lon ? LON ignoring the query . Scarcely no resemblance whatever . PADIE with sudden fierceness . You lie ! She ascends to the top of the landing . Outside a pump cranks dismally . PADIE relenting a little . You 'll be seein ' things , Lon , if you keep it up . LON rising , perfectly steady . Mind your business . Wish to hell I had a newspaper . He goes out through the door to the Bar , while Padie runs a comb reflectively through the exuberant tumult of her dark hair . Hank enters and stops a moment , half blinded by the light , then looks up , and shading his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your eyes , mister ? HANK daringly . It 's you , ma'am , are blinding them . He runs up the stairs with the pitcher . PADIE bending toward him as he comes near the top steps . You 'd better reach it to me . Maybe the landing 'll not hold the two of us . HANK It 'll hold two that have such light hearts as we . PADIE Ah , you do n't know mine , mister . HANK reaching her the pitcher . There , the clumsy mut I am ! Spillt the cold water on your pretty bare toes ! As she leans over to take the pitcher her hair falls suddenly about his head , almost covering his face . PADIE drawing it back , with a deft twirl . I 've most smothered you ! HANK I would n't want a sweeter death . PADIE looking down into his eyes . Indeed , you 're the picture of  --  an old lover of mine . HANK I 'd rather be the picture of the new . He makes as if to clasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his shoulder and pushes him gently back. p. 15 PADIE You 've been very kind to a wanderer  --  from Arizony . Do n't spoil it . Good-night ! HANK turning about , mutters . Good-night . He clatters loudly down the stairs as Lon renters , studying a newspaper . Lon seats himself , still absorbed . Hank favors him with a glare of positive hatred . HANK with a sneer . All fixed fer the night , eh ? LON grunting . G'night . HANK Well , I hope you like this country better'n Arizony . LON starting out of the news . The hell you say ! HANK Your wife was wishing herself back there . LON settling back to his paper and bottle . Well , that 's where she come from . I do n't . Women allus want what they ai n't got . HANK retiring.When your heart was mine , ture love , And your head lay on my breast , He goes out , closing the door . You could make me believe by the falling of your armThat the sun rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stanza , the double doors swing wide as before , revealing a Figure standing motionless outside , bathed in moonlight . At the same time the flame in the glass lamp begins to flicker and wane . Lon holds the paper closer to his face , finally almost buries his nose in it , as if conscious of the Presence , but stubbornly resolved to ignore it . The Figure moves , and as it crosses the threshold the feeble light expires . Lon , however , still sits , as if absorbed in the newspaper pretending to sip from the glass . The Figure in a thin mocking voice , echoes the song of the other , standing just behind Lon 's chair. p. 16 GHOST a thin echo.You could make me believe by the falling of your armThat the sun rose up in the west .  --  Lon picks up the soiled pack of cards from the table and begins to shuffle them mechanically , nor does he once turn toward the apparition . LON in a hoarse whisper . And what'r you doin ' here ? The Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of Lon 's . He is dressed in the western style , that is , without style , corduroys , heavy boots , flannel shirt . In fact , he looks almost natural . But there is a curious dark mark in the center of his forehead  --  or is it a round , dark hole ? LON petulantly . Cai n't you stay where you was put  --  with a heap o ' rocks on top o ' ye ? GHOST thinly ironical . Ca n't seem to give up the old habits , y ' know . LON tickly , tossing the pack down . What 's the hell 's a corpse got to do with habits ? GHOST unmoved . You pore fool , you 'll learn when you come over . LON huskily . Come over  --  wh'ar ? p. 17 GHOST significantly . Where I am . Sings in a quavering voice . There 's many a girl can go all round aboutAnd hear the small birds sing  --  LON snarling . Dry up on them corpse tunes o ' yourn , Harvey Mace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You recognize your old friend and pardner , do you , Lon Purdy ? LON sullenly . I knowed you 'd come . GHOST triumphantly . And you believe in me , eh ? Well , that 's good , too . LON stubbornly . Believe ? Well ! I knowed I 'd be scein ' things soon , what with the booze . I knowed it 'd be the snakes or you . Padie told me I 'd be seein ' things . GHOST maliciously . So you believe in her , anyway . Well , how 's Padie  --  and the children ? LON You know damn well we ai n't had none . GHOST What , no children ! How unfortunate ! The house of love not to be graced with fruit sterile , sterile . LON belligerently . Er you referrin ' to me ? p. 18 GHOST To your spiritual union only , my friend . Physically , I know , nothing was wanting for a perfect match ,  --  female form divine to mate with big blond beast . A race of superpeople ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You allus had a lot of talky-talk . That 's what made a hit with Padie , before , before  --  GHOST Before the Other Man came along and cut us both out . Sings . And many a girl that stays at home aloneAnd rocks the cradle and spins . GHOST reflectively . Yes , I 'm afraid we both stood up pretty poorly alongside him . I had the words , the brain , the idea . I could charm her , tantalize her , quicken her mind , arouse her imagination . That 's why I cut you out with her . LON sneeringly . Gab ! GHOST yes , gab . It was one better to her than mere brute  --  guts ! You personified strength . You did n't have nerves enough to be afraid of anything . You had endurance , cheek , deviltry , and a kind of raw good nature . These took with the gay , immature girl she was , until I came . You had  --  Guts ; I had  --  Gab . LON And the Other Feller ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? GHOST He was a full man . His personality exuded from him like incense . It wrapped and enfolded you and warmed you , and yet it was not a grain feminine , but deeply , proudly masculine . You tolerated him , I  --  loved him . I had the fine passion for Padie , but when I first saw the two of them together I knew she was his , or with a keen , stern look at Lonought to be and she has been , always . LON jumping to his feet , and knocking over his chair . You lie like hell ! She 's mine ! She 's been mine all these three years ! I won her and I own her ! What little of love she ever had fer you or him is buried down in Laguna Madre with the bones of both of ye ! And all hell ca n't take her from me ! GHOST rising tall and pale . He kin , and he 's done it ! You thought you 'd got her . But he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her heart ever since they took the rope from his neck and pronounced him legally dead , and justice vindicated , and laid him away in the desert . All that time since , he 's belonged to her . When you laid by her side nights , it was his arm she felt about her waist , not yours ; his breath was on her cheek , and his heart was beating against hers . Oh you poor , poor fool ! p. 20 LON throwing his glass straight at the ghost . You lyin ' pup ! GHOST bursting into a gale of eerie laughter . Ha ! ha ! ha ! you poor fool ! Now you believe in me ! Lon whips out his revolver and aims at the ghost , then slowly returns it to the holster , as he realizes the futility of the move . GHOST Go on , my boy ! Let 's have another one here . He points to the dark hole in his forehead . Lon , wiping his own face with the back of his hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table . GHOST Another one , just like the last  --  for your friend and pardner . He stresses the words with intense irony . Do you remember the last time you pulled that trick ? What a foxy one it was ! How astutely palnned ! Planned , my friend . I remember when we two went up the canyon together , just such a shining night as this , I asked you why you had borrowed  --  the Other Man 's horse , and you said , yours was a little lame . Oh ! excellent dissembler ! Most crafty of liars ! You stole that horse . You stole that horse to put a rope around the Other Man 's neck ! You knew the pinto was shod different from any pony in those parts . You knew where they 'd track him to , when they found the job you 'd done . Then we sat down to smokes and cards . And I remember the curious glitter in your eyes . I was dealing . The Ghost shuffles the cards on the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut ! Lon mechanically obeys. p. 21 GHOST dealing . And after several hands , you brought up the subject of Padie . And I told you I was out of the race  --  and that you 'd better get out too , because the best man already had her . And then  --  and then I sensed you were going to draw , and when I had my gun out , it was empty . Clever boy ! You had it fixed right . And so you plugged me square . And the moon and stars went out for me and I dropped into the black gulf . Lon throwing his hand down , buries his face in his hands , groaning . GHOST pitilessly . You left me with my face to the stars for the coyotes to find . Then , very coolly , you turned the Other Man 's horse toward home and sent him off cracking . And you jumped to a pion log that led off to a ledge of lava where your footprints would n't show . And you turned up in half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually where the Other Man was . You knew , you devil ! You knew they 'd never get an alibi from him for that night , ' cause  --  Padie was with him . Padie had her dear arms about his neck while you , clever dog ! were out fixing to put a rope there . And you done it , too ! Won her ? Yes , you did  --  like hell ! After the trial was all over , and the dead buried , me and him , you passed a dirty whisper around town about her , and then married her , to save her good name . That 's how you won her . There is an immense silence , broken only by the heavy breathing of Lon , which comes in rattling gasps. p. 22 GHOST sings.There 's many a star shall jangle in the west , There 's many a leaf below , There 's many a damn that will light upon the manFor treating a poor girl so . GHOST But I ai n't forgot all you done for me . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come  --  to settle too  --  LON staggering up . No ! I do n't believe in you ! You 're nothin ' at all ! There ai n't no  --  Lon sways and catches at the table ; as he swings around , the figure of Another stands outside the door , a tall figure with something white twisted about its neck . Lon with a cry of horror puts out his arms as if to ward off the apparition and backs slowly toward the left wall . GHOST coming toward him . Murderer ! betrayer ! We 've come to settle ! LON screaming . No ! no ! no ! I do n't believe  --  He falls , and the pile of rubbishy furniture topples over on to him with a crash . The two apparitions vanish . The door to the bar is flung open and Hank leaps in , at the same moment that Padie appears above , whitely clad . PADIE Lon ! Lon ! What 's the matter ? p. 23 HANK going toward the pile of stuff . Go back ! It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and drags it out , as Padie , with a long cry , flies down the stairs . He feels the breast quickly and rises before Padie reaches the table . HANK I 'm afraid he 's done for . PADIE drawing a deep quivering breath . Oh . HANK He must ' a ' fell . PADIE I knew  --  drink 'd do fer him . HANK Did you  --  love him  --  so much ? PADIE very low . Once  --  a little . With sudden , fierce joy . I do n't care ! Now  --  I kin  --  live ! HANK looking out over the desert where the dawn begins to show
