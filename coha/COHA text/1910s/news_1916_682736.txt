txt An audience of 8,000 persons in the Armory here tonight cheered an attack by Charles E. Hughes on the Adamson eight-hour law . This somewha ' allayed the apprehensions of the Republican leaders that the nominee 's attitude toward the legislation in favor of the railroad brotherhoods would prove unpopular in this great industrial section . The fears of the leaders had been sharpened by the disturbing experience of the candidate earlier in the day at Toledo , when men in the Willys-Overland automobile factory whom he was addressing heckled him , asked him about the Danbury hat decision by the United States Supreme Court , in which he participated as a Justice , shouted at him derisively , and cheered for President Wilson . Labor Criticisms Disturbing . The evidence of a more or less concerted effort on the part of some of the representatives of organized labor to embarrass the campaign tour of Mr. Hughes that appeared today gave the Republican leaders much concern , as they had been unable to figure out how the heavy labor vote in Ohio , one of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tod* , at stops along the line on the way to Cleveland , Mr. Hughes was challenged several times to discuss his part as a member of the United States Supreme Court in the Danbury hat case decision . Seine of the leaders . who feel that the labor union men as a whole do not understand the facts in this regard and know only that a fine of $250,000 was imposed on the workmen responsible for the boycott , are hoping that the nominee will take up this question , which , in some sections at least . has been developed into an important issue . It was hinted today that a wellorganized movement had been set on foot by some of the labor leaders in conjunction with the Democrats to emphasize this decision in a manner calculated to advance the Interests of President Wilson . The accusation has been made . although not publicly by any representative leader , that there have been developments which would indicate that Samuel Gonmers , President of the American Federation of Labor , may have been appealed to . I The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street parade in Indianapolis . The question , " How about the Danbury hatters ? " was shouted at the Hughes train early this morning at one of the stops . The climax came at a meeting at the plant of the Willys-Overland automobile factory at Toledo at noon , when a , group of perhaps fifty labor union men shouted the challenge repeatedly and coupled it with applause for President Wilson . Mr. Hughes disregarded the interruption . Later it was explained that he did not know that the Danbury hat case was being mentioned by the workMen and thought that they were shouting about the Adamson eight-hour bill . First Openly Discordant Note . While the campaign in this State has not been so well organized as in Indiana and there has been a slump in the matter of both crowds and enthusiasm , the outburst at the automobile factory was the first incident which might be called an openly discordant note . There was a difference of opinion as to the importance of the affair , but it did cause some worry among the Republican leaders , inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been much discussion about the effect the attack , by Mr. Hughes on the eight-hour law would have . These leaders say they are convinced all will go well if Mr. Hughes can get before the voters , in a manner which they will grasp fully , his analysis of the legislation , and also make it clear that he is not opposed to the principle of the eighthour day . They believe his views are correct and feel that the union men can beconvinced . The danger lies , they think , in the difficulty of getting the complete case of the Republican nominee before these voters . The scene at the Willys-Overland factory was taken as a good test of the fighting capacity of Mr. Hughes . The nominee went to the factorir-in the belief that he would be heckled , but determined to continue his attack upon the Adamson law without regard to the conditions that he would face . Mr. Hughes , in an automobile , reached the factory ten minutes before noon . As the whistle blew at noon men in overalls , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed from the shops , with half an hour at their disposal before work was to be resumed . There are about 18,000 persons employed at the plant , and about 2.000 grouped ' themselves about the truck from which Mr. Hughes was to speak . The windows of all the nettr-by shops were filled , and many persons climbed telegraph poles to obtain a vantage point . There were some cheers for Wilson , which were answered by cheers for Hughes . Met with Derisive Shouts . The candidate had to struggle against a failing vbice , but , with a grim smile , ho went ahead with his contention that he was a friend of labor and pictured the conditions under which he hoped Men might live . Then he came to the Adarnson bill . " With respect to this recent bill that was passed oy Congress , " he said , " I : . am not opposed to the principle of the , eight-hour day , That was not an eighthour bill at all . " . ? Mr. Hughes labeled the Adamson legislation as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , I am not opposed to an increase in wages , " he said . " That is a question to be considered . " There were derisive shouts , but with a smile the candidate went on to critt- ' cise the " rule of farce , " There was some applause , and now and then a shout for President Wilson , Mostly from men in the factory windows . Some one in the crowd asked " If you worked hi the Overland factory would you join the union ' : " That would depend on the facts in the case , " retorted Mr. Hughes . " I do not know the conditions in the Overland . I have no opposition to organized label* , as I have already shown you . What I would do in any ease would be to examine the facts and see what was for the best interests of labor in the particular case . Now , my friends , I can not talk to you at length , but I want You to know that the ambition that I have is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were yells of derision and shouts for Wilson . It was then that the little group shouted : How about the Danbury hatters , Mr. Hughes ? How about the hatters ? " It was this outburst which , it was explained later , Mr. Hughes thought concerned the Adamson bill . " ** friends over there , " the stenoggraphic report of his remarks show he said , " have not heard what I just said . If you will tell them what Is have said about the Adamson bill , I think they will find their questions have been answered . " ? As the address was closed there was applause for Mr. Hughes and shouts for President Wilson as the men , their time for luncheon up , scattered to their shops . Mr. Hughes continued his attack upon the Adamson bill at a meeting in the Valentine Theatre in Toledo . He charged that if the bill had been intended to be an eight-hour bill there would have been attached a penalty against employing men for longer than that time except in emergency . Referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was decided only after a careful examination of the facts and had nothing in common with the Adamson legislation , as held by the Administration , Mr. Hughes took this fling at the President : " I regret that an argument of that description has been made . I regard such an argument as very extraordinary . It seemed to indicate a lack of very clear understanding with respect to the functions of the legislator or of Congress and the functions of our court . That is something new in American Government , " Challenge to Administration . In his speech at the Armory here Mr. Hughes challenged President Wilson to answer the charge that he sent John Lind. his confidential representative , to Mexico early in 1014 with definite instructions that General Huerta must be eliminated as head of the provisional government , even if the active interference of the United States should be required to accomplish that purpose . Reading from a slip of paper which he said bore authentic instructions to that effect , which Mr. bind was authorized to repeat to the Minister of another foreign power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain for the Administration to reply . He said he had heard of a vague statement in a leading Democratic organ published in New York City that an answer might be made , but none had come . I challenge the Administration to deny that that authorization was given , " he shouted . Mr. Hughes coupled this attack with a high tribute to Myron T. Herrick , exAmbassador to France . who is the Republican candidate for United States Senator in Ohio . He said the removal of Mr. Herrick from his position In France in the midst of the European war was " of the first importance to the country " and would ' ever remain a blot upon the present Administration . " Mr. Hughes worked himself up to a high pitch of earnestness on these issues , and forgetful. of the warnings of his physician that overexertion of his voice might mean serious trouble which would incapacitate him for some time , he seized the occasion again to declare his independence of special privilege and boss domination . After Picturing himself as contented as a Justice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this nomination to pass out favors to any Set of.men . I am forthe  --  American People . ' . Eight-Hour Surrender " Shocking : , The armory meeting was eordial . It was the best meeting the nominee had had in Ohio . Encouraging cheers were heard when the speaker made this ret -- erence to the Adamson , Eight-Hour bill : In its portent , in the precedent it sets , in the surrender involved , it is the most shocking thitig that has happened in my memory in public life . " He declared that the passage of the Adamson bill , which involved placing the rule of force above - the rule of reason , - was the great fundamental issue of - the campaign . The reception which his utterances on the subject met In ? this . manufacturing city was accepted as proof by the Republican leaders that if Mr. Hughes could get his views on the matter clearly before the people , he would turn the legislation Into a boomerang which would Injure the President . The organization of the campaign in Ohio was on a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indiana , and the tour suffered in consequence . There was a fairly large crowd at the railroad station here tonight , however , and the armory was filled to Capacity . But there was missing the tenseness pf feeling found In Indiana , due some of the leaders say , to the fact that Ohio never got into full swing until the last two weeks of a Presidential campaign . in his armory . speech Mr. Hughes pledged himself to give the country the service of its best men as diplomats if elected . He then paid this tribute to Mr. Herrick , who presided at the g meetin , and in criticism of his removal said : " That is not the way to advance American interests . Nobody in Europe could understand it . I venture to say that no one great nation except our own Would think of doing anything of that sort . " Wilson and Mexico . In leading up to his challenge to President Wilson in the John /And matter Mr. Hughes said that only the other day a statement had come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very clear statement of the principle that should govern the country in dealing with smaller republics . " It says , referring to Mexico , " said Mr. Hughes , " that we have professed to believe that every nation , every people has the right to order its own institutions as It will , and we must live up to that profession in our actions in absolute good faith . That Is the principle . I deeply regret that that principle was not followed . " Mr. Hughes then read the instructions he said were given to Lind that Muerta must be put out and that " other means adequate to the purpose will be resorted to ' if domestic means failed . He continued : " That is a declaration of a personal war upon litterta to be carried to the conclusion of elimination , despite the statements that we have mace and the representations that we were to recognize the sovereignty of Mexico and not attempt to interfere in the conduct of her affairs . " Now , I referred to this the other night and a leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong supporter of the Administration , at once inquired I through its representatives whether or not that etatcment would be denied . According to the report in this newspaper it was said that the charge " ilia be answered , by the Secretary of War , perhaps . or by the Secretary of the Navy . It did not say that it would be denied . It made the ambiguous statement that it would be answered . " Whether in Mexico or anywhere else we should make no progress until it is understood that the foundation stone of every policy in the future must be that the lives and the property of American citizens will be protected . " Besides Toledo and Cleveland . Mr. Hughes made speeches today at Findlay , Dowling Green , Port Clinton , Sandusky and Elyria . Ile will leave early tomorrow morning for Pittsburgh , and will speak at Akron and Canton on the way .
