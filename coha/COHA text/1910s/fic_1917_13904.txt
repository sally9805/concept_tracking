SCENE  --  The seamen 's forecastle . On the right above the bunks three or four portholes covered with black cloth can be seen . On the floor near the doorway is a pail with a tin dipper . A lantern in the middle of the floor , turned down very low , throws a dim light around the place . Five men , Scotty , Ivan , Swanson , Smitty and Paul , are in their bunks apparently asleep . It is about ten minutes of twelve on a night in the fall of the year 1915 . Smitty turns slowly in his bunk and , leaning out over the side , looks from one to another of the men as if to assure himself that they are asleep . Then he climbs carefully out of his bunk and stands in the middle of the forecastle fully dressed , but in his stocking feet , glancing around him suspiciously . Reassured , he leans down and cautiously pulls out a suit-case from under the bunks in front of him . Just at this moment Davis appears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . He stops short when he sees Smitty . A puzzled expression comes over his face , followed by one of suspicion , and he retreats farther back in the alleyway , where he can watch Smitty without being seen . All the latter 's movements indicate a fear of discovery . He takes out a small bunch of keys and unlocks the suit-case , making a slight noise as he does so . Scotty wakes up and peers at him over the side of the bunk . Smitty opens the suit-case and takes out a small black tin box , carefully places this under his mattress , shoves the suit-case back under the bunk , climbs into his bunk again and closes his eyes . Davis enters the forecastle , places the coffee-pot beside the lantern , and goes from one to the other of the sleepers and shakes them vigorously , saying to each in a low voice : Near eight bells , Scotty . Arise and shine , Swanson . Eight bells , Ivan . Smitty yawns loudly with a great pretense of having been dead asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their bunks , stretching and gaping , and commence to pull on their shoes . They go one by one to the cupboard near the open door , take out their cups and spoons , and sit down together on the benches . The coffee-pot is passed around . They munch their biscuits and sip their coffee in dull silence . ) DAVIS  --  ( suddenly jumping to his feet  --  nervously ) Where 's that air comin ' from ? ( All are startled and look at him wonderingly. ) p. 3 SWANSON  --  ( a squat , surly-faced Swede  --  grumpily ) What air ? I do n't feel nothing . DAVIS  --  ( excitedly ) I kin feel it  --  a draft . ( He stands on the bench and looks around  --  suddenly exploding ) Damn fool square-head ! ( He leans over the upper bunk in which Paul is sleeping and slams the porthole shut . ) I got a good notion to report him . Serve him bloody well right ! What 's the use o ' blindin ' the ports when that thick-head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( yawning  --  too sleepy to be aroused by anything  --  carelessly ) Dey do n't see what little light go out yust one port . SCOTTY  --  ( protesting ) Dinna be a loon , Swanson ! D'ye no ken the dangerr o ' showin ' a licht wi ' a pack o ' submarrines lyin ' aboot ? IVAN  --  ( shaking his shaggy ox-like head in an emphatic affirmative ) Dot 's right , Scotty . I do n't li-ike blow up , no , by devil ! SMITTY  --  ( his manner slightly contemptuous ) I do n't think there 's much danger of meeting any of their submarines , not until we get into the War Zone , at any rate . p. 4 DAVIS  --  ( He and Scotty look at Smitty suspiciously  --  harshly ) You do n't , eh ? ( He lowers his voice and speaks slowly . ) Well , we 're in the war zone right this minit if you wants to know . ( The effect of this speech is instantaneous . All sit bolt upright on their benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , Davis ? DAVIS  --  ( angrily ) ' Cos Drisc heard the First send the Third below to wake the skipper when we fetched the zone  --  bout five bells , it was . Now whata y ' got to say ? SMITTY  --  ( conciliatingly ) Oh , I was n't doubting your word , Davis ; but you know they 're not pasting up bulletins to let the crew know when the zone is reached  --  especially on ammunition ships like this . IVAN  --  ( decidedly ) I do n't li-ike dees voyage . Next time I ship on windjammer Boston to River Plate , load with wood only so it float , by golly ! SWANSON  --  ( fretfully ) I hope British navy blow ' em to hell , those submarines , py damn ! SCOTTY  --  ( looking at Smitty , who is staring at the doorway in a dream , his chin on his hands  --  meaningly ) It is no the submarrines only we 've to fear , I 'm thinkin ' . p. 5 DAVIS  --  ( assenting eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean the mines ? SCOTTY  --  I wasna thinkin ' o ' mines eitherr . DAVIS  --  There 's many a good ship blown up and at the bottom of the sea , what never hit no mine or torpedo . SCOTTY  --  Did ye neverr read of the Gerrman spies and the dirrty work they 're doin ' all the war ? ( He and Davis both glance at Smitty , who is deep in thought and is not listening to the conversation . ) DAVIS  --  An ' the clever way they fool you ! SWANSON  --  Sure ; I read it in paper many time . DAVIS  --  Well  --  ( he is about to speak but hesitates and finishes lamely ) you got to watch out , that 's all I says . IVAN  --  ( drinking the last of his coffee and slamming his fist on the bench explosively ) I tell you dis rotten coffee give me belly-ache , yes ! ( They all look at him in amused disgust . ) SCOTTY  --  ( sardonically ) Dinna fret about it , Ivan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain in your middle . ( Jack enters . He is a young American with a tough , good-natured face . He wears dungarees and a heavy jersey. ) p. 6 JACK  --  Eight bells , fellers . IVAN  --  ( stupidly ) I do n't hear bell ring . JACK  --  No , and yuh wo n't hear any ring , yuh boob  --  ( lowering his voice unconsciously ) now we 're in the war zone . SWANSON  --  ( anxiously ) Is the boats all ready ? JACK  --  Sure ; we can lower ' em in a second . DAVIS  --  A lot o ' good the boats 'll do , with us loaded deep with all kinds o ' dynamite and stuff the like o ' that ! If a torpedo hits this hooker we 'll all be in hell b'fore you could wink your eye . JACK  --  They ai n't goin ' to hit us , see ? That 's my dope . Whose wheel is it ? IVAN  --  ( sullenly ) My wheel . ( He lumbers out . ) JACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tink . ( He follows Ivan . ) JACK  --  ( scornfully ) A hell of a lot of use keepin ' a lookout ! We could n't run away or fight if we wanted to . ( to Scotty and Smitty ) Better look up the bo'sun or the Fourth , you two , and let ' em see you 're awake . ( Scotty goes to the doorway and turns to wait for Smitty , who is still in the same position , head on hands , seemingly unconscious of everything . Jack slaps him roughly on the shoulder and he comes to with a start . ) Aft and report , Duke ! What 's the matter with yuh  --  in a dope dream ? ( Smitty goes out after Scotty without answering . Jack looks after him with a frown . ) He 's a queer guy . I ca n't figger him out . p. 7 DAVIS  --  Nor no one else . ( lowering his voice  --  meaningly ) An ' he 's liable to turn out queerer than any of us think if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'yuh mean ? ( They are interrupted by the entrance of Driscoll and Cocky . ) COCKY  --  ( protestingly ) Blimey if I do n't fink I 'll put in this ' ere watch ahtside on deck . ( He and Driscoll go over and get their cups . ) I dow n't want to be caught in this ' ole if they ' its us . ( He pours out coffee . ) DRISCOLL  --  ( pouring his ) Divil a bit ut wud matther where ye arre . Ye 'd be blown to smithereens b'fore ye cud say your name . ( He sits down , overturning as he does so the untouched cup of coffee which Smitty had forgotten and left on the bench . They all jump nervously as the tin cup hits the floor with a bang . Driscoll flies into an unreasonable rage . ) Who 's the dirty scut left this cup where a man ' ud sit on ut ? DAVIS  --  It 's Smitty 's . DRISCOLL  --  ( kicking the cup across the forecastle ) Does he think he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away loike the rist av us ? If he does I 'm the bye 'll beat that noshun out av his head . p. 8 COCKY  --  Be the airs ' e puts on you 'd think ' e was the Prince of Wales . Wot 's ' e doin ' on a ship , I arsks yer ? ' E ai n't now good as a sailor , is ' e ?  --  dawdlin ' abaht on deck like a chicken wiv ' is ' ead cut orf ! JACK  --  ( good-naturedly ) Aw , the Duke 's all right . S'posin ' he did ferget his cup  --  what 's the diff ? ( He picks up the cup and puts it away  --  with a grin ) This war zone stuff 's got yer goat , Drisc  --  and yours too , Cocky  --  and I ai n't cheerin ' much fur it myself , neither . COCKY  --  ( with a sigh ) Blimey , it ai n't no bleedin ' joke , yer first trip , to know as there 's a ship full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , as you might say , if we gets ' it be a torpedo or mine . ( with sudden savagery ) Calls they-selves ' uman bein 's , too ! Blarsted ' Uns ! DRISCOLL  --  ( gloomily ) ' T is me last trip in the bloody zone , God help me . The divil take their twenty-foive percent bonus  --  and be drowned like a rat in a trap in the bargain , maybe . DAVIS  --  Would n't be so bad if she was n't carryin ' ammunition . Them 's the kind the subs is layin ' for . DRISCOLL  --  ( irritably ) Fur the love av hivin , do n't be talkin ' about ut . I 'm sick wid thinkin ' and jumpin ' at iviry bit av a noise . ( There is a pause during which they all stare gloomily at the floor. ) p. 9 JACK  --  Hey , Davis , what was you sayin ' about Smitty when they come in ? DAVIS  --  ( with a great air of mystery ) I 'll tell you in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's comin ' back . ( impressively ) You wo n't be callin ' him all right when you hears what I seen with my own eyes . ( He adds with an air of satisfaction ) An ' you wo n't be feelin ' no safer , neither . ( They all look at him with puzzled glances full of a vague apprehension . ) DRISCOLL  --  God blarst ut ! ( He fills his pipe and lights it . The others , with an air of remembering something they had forgotten , do the same . Scotty enters . ) SCOTTY  --  ( in awed tones ) Mon , but it 's clear outside the nicht ! Like day . DAVIS  --  ( in low tones ) Where 's Smitty , Scotty ? SCOTTY  --  Out on the hatch starin ' at the moon like a mon half-daft . DAVIS  --  Kin you see him from the doorway ? SCOTTY  --  ( goes to doorway and carefully peeks out ) Aye ; he 's still there . p. 10 DAVIS  --  Keep your eyes on him for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys and I do n't want him walkin ' in in the middle of it . Give a shout if he starts this way . SCOTTY  --  ( with suppressed excitement ) Aye , I 'll watch him . And I 've somethin ' myself to tell aboot his Lordship . DRISCOLL  --  ( impatiently ) Out wid ut ! You 're talkin ' more than a pair av auld women wud be standin ' in the road , and gittin ' no further along . DAVIS  --  Listen ! You ' member when I went to git the coffee , Jack ? JACK  --  Sure , I do . DAVIS  --  Well , I brings it down here same as usual and got as far as the door there when I sees him . JACK  --  Smitty ? DAVIS  --  Yes , Smitty ! He was standin ' in the middle of the fo'c's'tle there ( pointing ) lookin ' around sneakin ' - like at Ivan and Swanson and the rest ' s if he wants to make certain they 're asleep . ( He pauses significantly , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nervously dividing his attention between Smitty on the hatch outside and Davis 's story , fairly bursting to break in with his own revelations. ) p. 11 JACK  --  ( impatiently ) What of it ? DAVIS  --  Listen ! He was standin ' right there  --  ( pointing again ) in his stockin ' feet  --  no shoes on , mind , so he would n't make no noise ! JACK  --  ( spitting disgustedly ) Aw ! DAVIS  --  ( not heeding the interruption ) I seen right away somethin ' on the queer was up so I slides back into the alleyway where I kin see him but he ca n't see me . After he makes sure they 're all asleep he goes in under the bunks there  --  bein ' careful not to raise a noise , mind !  --  an ' takes out his bag there . ( By this time everyone , Jack included , is listening breathlessly to his story . ) Then he fishes in his pocket an ' takes out a bunch o ' keys an ' kneels down beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to keep silent longer ) Mon , did n't I see him do that same thing wi ' these two eyes . ' T was just that moment I woke and spied him . DAVIS  --  ( surprised , and a bit nettled to have to share his story with anyone ) Oh , you seen him , too , eh ? ( to the others ) Then Scotty kin tell you if I 'm lyin ' or not . p. 12 DRISCOLL  --  An ' what did he do whin he 'd the bag opened ? DAVIS  --  he bends down and reaches out his hand sort o ' scared-like , like it was somethin ' dang'rous he was after , an ' feels round in under his duds  --  hidden in under his duds an ' wrapped up in ' em , it was  --  an ' he brings out a black iron box ! COCKY  --  ( looking around him with a frightened glance ) Gawd blimey ! ( The others likewise betray their uneasiness , shuffling their feet nervously . ) DAVIS  --  Ai n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm tellin ' ye ' ! DAVIS  --  ( to the others with an air of satisfaction ) There you are ! ( lowering his voice ) An ' then what d' you suppose he did ? Sneaks to his bunk an ' slips the black box in under his mattress  --  in under his mattress , mind !  --  JACK  --  And it 's there now ? DAVIS  --  Course it is ! ( Jack starts toward Smitty 's bunk . Driscoll grabs him by the arm . ) DRISCOLL  --  Do n't be touchin ' ut , Jack ! p. 13 JACK  --  You need n't worry . I ai n't goin ' to touch it . ( He pulls up Smitty 's mattress and looks down . The others stare at him , holding their breaths . He turns to them , trying hard to assume a careless tone . ) It 's there , aw right . COCKY  --  ( miserably upset ) I 'm gointer ' op it aht on deck . ( He gets up but Driscoll pulls him down again . Cocky protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ' ere . DRISCOLL  --  ( scornfully ) Are ye frightened , ye toad ? ' T is a hell av a thing fur grown men to be shiverin ' loike childer at a bit av a black box . ( scratching his head in uneasy perplexity ) Still , ut 's damn queer , the looks av ut . DAVIS  --  ( sarcastically ) A bit of a black box , eh ? How big d' you think them  --  ( he hesitates )  --  things has to be  --  big as this fo'c's'tle ? JACK  --  ( in a voice meant to be reassuring ) Aw , hell ! I 'll bet it ai n't nothin ' but some coin he 's saved he 's got locked up in there . DAVIS  --  ( scornfully ) That 's likely , ai n't it ? Then why does he act so s'picious ? He 's been on ship near two year , ai n't he ? He knows damn well there ai n't no thiefs in this fo'c's'tle , do n't he ? An ' you know ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money when he came on board an ' he ai n't saved none since . Do n't you ? ( Jack does n't answer . ) Listen ! D' you know what he done after he put that thing in under his mattress ?  --  an ' Scotty 'll tell you if I ai n't speakin ' truth . He looks round to see if anyone 's woke up  --  p. 14 SCOTTY  --  I clapped my eyes shut when he turned round . DAVIS  --  An ' then he crawls into his bunk an ' shuts his eyes , pretendin ' he was asleep , mind ! SCOTTY  --  Aye , I could see him . DAVIS  --  An ' when I goes to call him , I do n't even shake him . I just says , " Eight bells , Smitty , " in a'most a whisper-like , an ' up he get yawnin ' an ' stretchin ' fit to kill hisself ' s if he 'd been dead asleep . JACK  --  Gawd blimey ! DRISCOLL  --  ( shaking his head ) Ut looks bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) An ' now I come to think of it , there 's the porthole . How 'd it come to git open , tell me that ? I know 'd well Paul never opened it . Ai n't he grumblin ' about bein ' cold all the time ? SCOTTY  --  The mon that opened it meant no good to this ship , whoever he was . JACK  --  ( sourly ) What porthole ? What 're yuh talkin ' about ? DAVIS  --  ( pointing over Paul 's bunk ) There . It was open when I come in . I felt the cold air on my neck an ' shut it . It would'a been clear 's a lighthouse to any sub that was watchin '  --  an ' we s'posed to have all the ports blinded ! Who 'd do a dirty trick like that ? It was n't none of us , nor Scotty here , nor Swanson , nor Ivan . Who would it be , then ? p. 15 COCKY  --  ( angrily ) Must 's been ' is bloody Lordship . DAVIS  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . They does it like that by winkin ' a light . Ai n't you read how they gets caught doin ' it in London an ' on the coast ? COCKY  --  ( firmly convinced now ) An ' wots ' e doin ' aht alone on the ' atch  --  keepin ' ' isself clear of us like ' e was afraid ? DRISCOLL  --  Kape your eye on him , Scotty . SCOTTY  --  There 's no a move oot o ' him . JACK  --  ( in irritated perplexity ) But , hell , ai n't he an Englishman ? What 'd he wanta  --  DAVIS  --  English ? How d'we know he 's English ? Cos he talks it ? That ai n't no proof . Ai n't you read in the papers how all them German spies they been catchin ' in England has been livin ' there for ten , often as not twenty years , an ' talks English as good 's anyone ? An ' look here , ai n't you noticed he do n't talk natural ? He talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He do n't talk exactly like a toff , does he , Cocky ? COCKY  --  Not like any toff as I ever met up wiv . DAVIS  --  No ; an ' ' e do n't talk it like us , that 's certain . An ' he do n't look English . An ' what d'we know about him when you come to look at it ? Nothin ' ! He ai n't ever said where he comes from or why . all we knows is he ships on here in London ' bout a year b'fore the war starts , as an A. B.  --  stole his papers most lik'ly  --  when he do n't know how to box the compass , hardly . Ai n't that queer in itself ? An ' was he ever open with us like a good shipmate ? No ; he 's always had that sly air about him ' s if he was hidin ' somethin ' . p. 16 DRISCOLL  --  ( slapping his thigh  --  angrily ) Divil take me if I do n't think ye have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Lettin ' on be ' is silly airs , and all , ' e 's the son of a blarsted earl or somethink ! DAVIS  --  An ' the name he calls hisself  --  Smith ! I 'd risk a quid of my next pay day that his real name is Schmidt , if the truth was known . JACK  --  ( evidently fighting against his own conviction ) Aw , say , you guys give me a pain ! What 'd they want puttin ' a spy on this old tub for ? DAVIS  --  ( shaking his head sagely ) They 're deep ones , an ' there 's a lot o ' things a sailor 'll see in the ports he puts in ought to be useful to ' em . An ' if he kin signal to ' em an ' they blows us up it 's one ship less , ai n't it ? ( lowering his voice and indicating Smitty 's bunk ) Or if he blows us up hisself . SCOTTY  --  ( in alarmed tones ) Hush , mon ! Here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits down . A thick silence settles over the forecastle . The men look from one to another with uneasy glances . Smitty enters and sits down beside his bunk . He is seemingly unaware of the dark glances of suspicion directed at him from all sides . He slides his hand back stealthily over his mattress and his fingers move , evidently feeling to make sure the box is still there . The others follow this movement carefully with quick looks out of the corners of their eyes . Their attitudes grow tense as if they were about to spring at him . Satisfied the box is safe , Smitty draws his hand away slowly and utters a sigh of relief. ) p. 17 SMITTY  --  ( in a casual tone which to them sounds sinister ) It 's a good light night for the subs if there 's any about . ( For a moment he sits staring in front of him . Finally he seems to sense the hostile atmosphere of the forecastle and looks from one to the other of the men in surprise . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression and gets up and walks out of the doorway . There is silence for a moment after his departure and then a storm of excited talk breaks loose . ) DAVIS  --  Did you see him feelin ' if it was there ? COCKY  --  ' E ai n't arf a sly one wiv ' is talk of submarines , Gawd blind ' im ! SCOTTY  --  Did ye see the sneakin ' looks he gave us ? DRISCOLL  --  If ivir I saw black shame on a man 's face ' t was on his whin he sat there ! JACK  --  ( thoroughly convinced at last ) He looked bad to me . He 's a crook , aw right . DAVIS  --  ( excitedly ) What 'll we do ? We gotter do somethin ' quick or  --  ( He is interrupted by the sound of something hitting against the port side of the forecastle with a dull , heavy thud . The men start to their feet in wild-eyed terror and turn as if they were going to rush for the deck . They stand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intently. ) p. 18 JACK  --  ( with a sickly smile ) Hell ! It 's on'y a piece of drift-wood or a floatin ' log . ( He sits down again . ) DAVIS  --  ( sarcastically ) Or a mine that did n't go off  --  that time  --  or a piece o ' wreckage from some ship they 've sent to Davy Jones . COCKY  --  ( mopping his brow with a trembling hand ) Blimey ! ( He sinks back weakly on a bench . ) DRISCOLL  --  ( furiously ) God blarst ut ! No man at all cud be puttin ' up wid the loike av this  --  an ' I 'm not wan to be fearin ' anything or any man in the worrld 'll stand up to me face to face ; but this divil 's trickery in the darrk  --  ( He starts for Smitty 's bunk . ) I 'll throw ut out wan av the portholes an ' be done wid ut . ( He reaches toward the mattress . ) SCOTTY  --  ( grabbing his arm  --  wildly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey with it , Drisc . I knows what to do . Bring the bucket o ' water here , Jack , will you ? ( Jack gets it and brings it over to Davis . ) An ' you , Scotty , see if he 's back on the hatch . p. 19 SCOTTY  --  ( cautiously peering out ) Aye , he 's sittin ' there the noo . DAVIS  --  Sing out if he makes a move . Lift up the mattress , Drisc  --  careful now ! ( Driscoll does so with infinite caution . ) Take it out , Jack  --  careful  --  do n't shake it now , for Christ 's sake ! Here  --  put it in the water  --  easy ! There , that 's fixed it ! ( They all sit down with great sighs of relief . ) The water 'll git in and spoil it . DRISCOLL  --  ( slapping Davis on the back ) Good wurrk for ye , Davis , ye scut ! ( He spits on his hands aggressively . ) An ' now what 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belligerently ) Guv ' im a shove in the marf and ' eave ' im over the side ! DAVIS  --  An ' serve him right ! JACK  --  Aw , say , give him a chance . Yuh ca n't prove nothin ' till yuh find out what 's in there . DRISCOLL  --  ( heatedly ) Is ut more proof ye 'd be needin ' afther what we 've seen an ' heard ? Then listen to me  --  an ' ut 's Driscoll talkin '  --  if there 's divilment in that box an ' we see plain ' t was his plan to murrdher his own shipmates that have served him fair  --  ( He raises his fist . ) I 'll choke his rotten heart out wid me own hands , an ' over the side wid him , and one man missin'in the mornin ' . p. 20 DAVIS  --  An ' no one the wiser . He 's the balmy kind what commits suicide . COCKY  --  They ' angs spies ashore . JACK  --  ( resentfully ) If he 's done what yuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for yuh ? DRISCOLL  --  ( looking down at the box ) How 'll we be openin' ' this , I wonder ? SCOTTY  --  ( from the doorway  --  warningly ) He 's standin ' up . DAVIS  --  We 'll take his keys away from him when he comes in . Quick , Drisc ! You an ' Jack get beside the door and grab him . ( They get on either side of the door . Davis snatches a small coil of rope from one of the upper bunks . ) This 'll do for me an ' Scotty to tie him . SCOTTY  --  He 's turnin 's this way  --  he 's comin ' ! ( He moves away from the door . ) DAVIS  --  Stand by to lend a hand , Cocky . COCKY  --  Righto . ( As Smitty enters the forecastle he is seized roughly from both sides , and his arms pinned behind him . At first he struggles fiercely , but seeing the uselessness of this , he finally stands calmly and allows Davis and Scotty to tie up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have finished  --  with cold contempt ) If this is your idea of a joke I 'll have to confess it 's a bit too thick for me to enjoy . COCKY  --  ( angrily ) Shut yer marf , ' ear ! DRISCOLL  --  ( roughly ) Ye 'll find ut 's no joke , me bucko , b'fore we 're done wid you . ( to Scotty ) Kape your eye peeled , Scotty , and sing out if anyone 's comin ' . ( Scotty resumes his post at the door . ) SMITTY  --  ( with the same icy contempt ) If you 'd be good enough to explain  --  DRISCOLL  --  ( furiously ) Explain , is ut ? ' T is you 'll do the explainin '  --  an ' damn quick , or we 'll know the reason why . ( to Jack and Davis ) Bring him here , now . ( They push Smitty over to the bucket . ) Look here , ye murrdherin ' swab . D' you see ut ? ( Smitty looks down with an expression of amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( with a sneer ) Look at him ! S'prised , ai n't you ?

SMITTY  --  ( trying to restrain his growing rage ) What  --  what do you mean ? That 's only  --  How dare  --  what are you doing with my private belongings ? COCKY  --  ( sarcastically ) Ho yus ! Private b'longings ! DRISCOLL  --  ( shouting ) What is ut , ye swine ? Will you tell us to our faces ? What 's in ut ? SMITTY  --  ( biting his lips  --  holding himself in check with a great effort ) Nothing but  --  That 's my business . You 'll please attend to your own . DRISCOLL  --  Oho , ut is , is ut ?

( to Jack and Davis ) Take his keys away from him an ' we 'll see if there 's one 'll open ut , maybe . ( They start in searching Smitty , who tries to resist and kicks out at the bucket . Driscoll leaps forward and helps them push him away . ) Try to kick ut over , would ye ? Did ye see him then ? Tryin ' to murrdher us all , the scut ! Take that pail out av his way , Cocky . ( Smitty struggles with all of his strength and keeps them busy for a few seconds . As Cocky grabs the pail Smitty makes a final effort and , lunging forward , kicks again at the bucket but only succeeds in hitting Cocky on the shin . Cocky immediately sets down the pail with a bang and , clutching his knee in both hands , starts hopping around the forecastle , groaning and swearing. ) p. 23 COCKY  --  Ooow ! Gawd strike me pink ! Kicked me , ' e did ! Bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching Smitty , who has given up the fight and is pushed back against the wall near the doorway with Jack and Davis holding him on either side  --  wrathfully , at the top of his lungs ) Kick me , will yer ? I 'll show yer what for , yer bleedin ' sneak ! ( He draws back his fist . Driscoll pushes him to one side . ) DRISCOLL  --  Shut your mouth ! D' you want to wake the whole ship ? ( Cocky grumbles and retires to a bench , nursing his sore shin . ) JACK  --  ( taking a small bunch of keys from Smitty 's pocket ) Here yuh are , Drisc . DRISCOLL  --  ( taking them ) We 'll soon be knowin ' . ( He takes the pail and sits down , placing it on the floor between his feet . Smitty again tries to break loose but he is too tired and is easily held back against the wall . ) SMITTY  --  ( breathing heavily and very pale ) Cowards ! JACK  --  ( with a growl ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't git yuh nothin ' . p. 24 DRISCOLL  --  ( looking at the lock on the box in the water and then scrutinizing the keys in his hand ) This 'll be ut , I 'm thinkin ' . ( He selects one and gingerly reaches his hand in the water . ) SMITTY  --  ( his face grown livid  --  chokingly ) Do n't you open that box , Driscoll . If you do , so help me God , I 'll kill you if I have to hang for it . DRISCOLL  --  ( pausing  --  his hand in the water ) Whin I open this box I 'll not be the wan to be kilt , me sonny bye ! I 'm no dirty spy . SMITTY  --  ( his voice trembling with rage . His eyes are fixed on Driscoll 's hand . ) Spy ? What are you talking about ? I only put that box there so I could get it quick in case we were torpedoed . Are you all mad ? Do you think I 'm  --  ( chokingly ) You stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand over Smitty 's mouth . ) DAVIS  --  That 'll be enough from you ! ( Driscoll takes the dripping box from the water and starts to fit in the key . Smitty springs forward furiously , almost escaping from their grasp , and drags them after him half-way across the forecastle. ) p. 25 DRISCOLL  --  Hold him , ye divils ! ( He puts the box back in the water and jumps to their aid . Cocky hovers on the outskirts of the battle , mindful of the kick he received . ) SMITTY  --  ( raging ) Cowards ! Damn you ! Rotten curs ! ( He is thrown to the floor and held there . ) Cowards ! Cowards ! DRISCOLL  --  I 'll shut your dirty mouth for you . ( He goes to his bunk and pulls out a big wad of waste and comes back to Smitty . ) SMITTY  --  Cowards ! Cowards ! DRISCOLL  --  ( with no gentle hand slaps the waste over Smitty 's mouth ) That 'll teach you to be misnamin ' a man , ye sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands him one and he ties it tightly around Smitty 's head over the waste . ) That 'll fix your gab . Stand him up , now , and tie his feet , too , so he 'll not be movin ' . ( They do so and leave him with his back against the wall near Scotty . Then they all sit down beside Driscoll , who again lifts the box out of the water and sets it carefully on his knees . He picks out the key , then hesitates , looking from one to the other uncertainly . ) We 'd best be takin ' this to the skipper , d' you think , maybe ? p. 26 JACK  --  ( irritably ) To hell with the Old Man . This is our game and we c'n play it without no help . COCKY  --  Now bleedin ' horficers , I say ! DAVIS  --  They 'd only be takin ' all the credit and makin ' heroes of theyselves . DRISCOLL  --  ( boldly ) Here goes , thin ! ( He slowly turns the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He carefully pushes the cover back on its hinges and looks at what he sees inside with an expression of puzzled astonishment . The others crowd up close . Even Scotty leaves his post to take a look . ) What is ut , Davis ? DAVIS  --  ( mystified ) Looks funny , do n't it ? Somethin ' square tied up in a rubber bag . Maybe it 's dynamite  --  or somethin '  --  you ca n't never tell . JACK  --  Aw , it ai n't got no works so it ai n't no bomb , I 'll bet . DAVIS  --  ( dubiously ) They makes them all kinds , they do . JACK  --  Open it up , Drisc . DAVIS  --  Careful now ! ( Driscoll takes a black rubber bag resembling a large tobacco pouch from the box and unties the string which is wound tightly around the top . He opens it and takes out a small packet of letters also tied up with string . He turns these over in his hands and looks at the others questioningly. ) p. 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( slapping Davis on the back ) Yuh 're a hell of a Sherlock Holmes , ai n't yuh ? Letters from his best girl too , I 'll bet . Let 's turn the Duke loose , what d'yuh say ? ( He starts to get up . ) DAVIS  --  ( fixing him with a withering look ) Do n't be so damn smart , Jack . Letters , you says , ' s if there never was no harm in ' em . How d' you s'pose spies gets their orders and sends back what they finds out if it ai n't by letters and such things ? There 's many a letter is worser'n any bomb . COCKY  --  Righto ! They ai n't as innercent as they looks , I 'll take me oath , when you read ' em . ( pointing at Smitty ) Not ' is Lordship 's letters ; not be no means ! JACK  --  ( sitting down again ) Well , read ' em and find out . ( Driscoll commences untying the packet . There is a muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( triumphantly ) There ! Listen to him ! Look at him tryin ' to git loose ! Ai n't that proof enough ? He knows well we 're findin ' him out . Listen to me ! Love letters , you says , jack , ' s if they could n't harm nothin ' . Listen ! I was readin ' in some magazine in New York on'y two weeks back how some German spy in Paris was writin ' love letters to some woman spy in Switzerland who sent ' em on to Berlin , Germany . To read ' em you would n't s'pect nothin '  --  just mush and all . ( impressively ) But they had a way o ' doin ' it  --  a damn sneakin ' way . They had a piece o ' plain paper with pieces cut out of it an ' when they puts it on top o ' the letter they sees on'y the words what tells them what they wants to know . An ' the Frenchies gets beat in a fight all on account o ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blimey ! They ai n't ' arf smart bleeders ! DAVIS  --  ( seeing his audience is again all with him ) An ' even if these letters of his do sound all right they may have what they calls a code . You ca n't never tell . ( to Driscoll , who has finished untying the packet ) Read one of ' em , Drisc . My eyes is weak . DRISCOLL  --  ( takes the first one out of its envelope and bends down to the lantern with it . He turns up the wick to give him a better light . ) I 'm no hand to be readin ' but I 'll try ut . ( Again there is a muffled groan from Smitty as he strains at his bonds . ) DAVIS  --  ( gloatingly ) Listen to him ! He knows . Go ahead , Drisc ! DRISCOLL  --  ( his brow furrowed with concentration ) Ut begins : Dearest Man  --  ( His eyes travel down the page . ) An ' thin there 's a lot av blarney tellin ' him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' school  --  an ' how she hopes he 'll settle down to rale worrk an ' not be skylarkin ' around now that she 's away loike he used to before she met up wid him  --  and ut ends : " I love you betther than anythin ' in the worrld . You know that , do n't you , dear ? But b'fore I can agree to live out my life wid you , you must prove to me that the black shadow  --  I wo n't menshun uts hateful name but you know what I mean  --  which might wreck both our lives , does not exist for you . You can do that , ca n't you , dear ? Do n't you see you must for my sake ? " ( He pauses for a moment  --  then adds gruffly ) Uts signed : " Edith . " ( At the sound of the name Smitty , who has stood tensely with his eyes shut as if he were undergoing torture during the reading , makes a muffled sound like a sob and half turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sympathetically ) Hell ! What 's the use of readin ' that stuff even if  --  DAVIS  --  ( interrupting him sharply ) Wait ! Where 's that letter from , Drisc ? DRISCOLL  --  There 's no address on the top av ut . DAVIS  --  ( meaningly ) What 'd I tell you ? Look at the postmark , Drisc ,  --  on the envelope . DRISCOLL  --  The name that 's written is Sidney Davidson , wan hundred an '  --  DAVIS  --  Never mind that . O ' course it 's a false name . Look at the postmark . DRISCOLL  --  There 's a furrin stamp on ut by the looks av ut . The mark 's blurred so it 's hard to read . ( He spells it out laboriously . ) B-e-r  --  the nixt is an l , I think  --  i  --  an ' an n . DAVIS  --  ( excitedly ) Berlin ! What did I tell you ? I knew them letters was from Germany . COCKY  --  ( shaking his fist in Smitty 's direction ) Rotten ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last fact had utterly condemned him in their eyes. ) p. 30 DAVIS  --  Give me the letter , Drisc . Maybe I kin make somethin ' out of it . ( Driscoll hands the letter to him . ) You go through the others , Drisc , and sing out if you sees anythin ' queer . ( He bends over the first letter as if he were determined to figure out its secret meaning . Jack , Cocky and Scotty look over his shoulder with eager curiosity . Driscoll takes out some of the other letters , running his eyes quickly down the pages . He looks curiously over at Smitty from time to time , and sighs frequently with a puzzled frown . ) DAVIS  --  ( disappointedly ) I gotter give it up . It 's too deep for me , but we 'll turn ' em over to the perlice when we docks at Liverpool to look through . This one I got was written a year before the war started , anyway . Find anythin ' in yours , Drisc ? DRISCOLL  --  They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blarney , an ' how her singin ' is doin ' , and the great things the Dutch teacher says about her voice , an ' how glad she is that her Sidney bye is worrkin ' harrd an ' makin ' a man av himself for her sake . ( Smitty turns his face completely to the wall . ) DAVIS  --  ( disgustedly ) If we on'y had the code ! DRISCOLL  --  ( taking up the bottom letter ) Hullo ! Here 's wan addressed to this ship  --  s. s . Glencairn , ut says  --  whin we was in Cape Town sivin months ago  --  ( looking at the postmark ) Ut 's from London . p. 31 DAVIS  --  ( eagerly ) Read it ! ( There is another choking groan from Smitty . ) DRISCOLL  --  ( reads slowly  --  his voice becomes lower and lower as he goes on ) Ut begins wid simply the name Sidney Davidson  --  no dearest or sweetheart to this wan . " Ut is only from your chance meetin ' wid Harry  --  whin you were drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So you have run away to sea loike the coward you are because you knew I had found out the truth  --  the truth you have covered over with your mean little lies all the time I was away in Berlin and blindly trusted you . Very well , you have chosen . You have shown that your drunkenness means more to you than any love or faith av mine . I am sorry  --  for I loved you , Sidney Davidson  --  but this is the end . I lave you  --  the mem'ries ; an ' if ut is any satisfaction to you I lave you the real-i-zation that you have wrecked my loife as you have wrecked your own . My one remainin ' hope is that nivir in God 's worrld will I ivir see your face again . Good-by . Edith . " ( As he finishes there is a deep silence , broken only by Smitty 's muffled sobbing . The men can not look at each other . Driscoll holds the rubber bag limply in his hand and some small white object falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mechanically Driscoll leans over and picks it up , and looks at it wonderingly. ) p. 32 DAVIS  --  ( in a dull voice ) What 's that ? DRISCOLL  --  ( slowly ) A bit av a dired-up flower . ( He drops it into the bag and gathers up the letters and puts them back . He replaces the bag in the box , and locks it and puts it back under Smitty 's mattress . The others follow him with their eyes . He steps softly over to Smitty and cuts the ropes about his arms and ankles with his sheath knife , and unties the handkerchief over the gag . Smitty does not turn around but covers his face with his hands and leans his head against the wall . His shoulders continue to heave spasmodically but he makes no further sound . ) DRISCOLL  --  ( stalks back to the others  --  there is a moment of silence , in which each man is in agony with the hopelessness of finding a word he can say  --  then Driscoll explodes ) God stiffen us , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ av sleep ? ( They all start as if awakening from a bad dream and gratefully crawl into their bunks , shoes and all , turning their faces to the wall , and pulling their blankets up over their shoulders . Scotty tiptoes past Smitty out into the darkness . Driscoll turns down the light and crawls into his bunk as The Curtain Falls )
