WE are accustomed to think of the tropics as the home of birds of graceful forms and brilliant plumage ; but North America can boast of many birds that will compare not unfavorably with some of their lustrous cousins of the equatorial regions . There are in this country many birds of beauty which have long been a theme of song and story , and some of the best known are illustrated here . THE BLUE JAY " A bird so beautiful as the blue jay must be very rare now in your : ountry , " said a titled Englishman to a friend of mine who was traveling in the " tight little island . " The blue jay , though unprotected by law in many states , and considered fair game for the gunner , is still a common bird over a great part of North America . Everywhere the jays have a bad name . The blue jay in particular is looked upon as a noisy , quarrelsome rascal ; but he is a gay bucaneer withal , and so handsome that his faults are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . If he sometimes steals corn and robs the nests of little birds , still he is a premium caterpillar hunter . A single family of jays . it is said , destroy a million caterpillars in a season ; but the jay 's good qualities are not well known , and he is hunted by mankind without mercy , escaping only by his ready wits . The jay is normally a forest bird , his home the somber pines ; but he quickly adapts himself to circumstances , and places his nest anywhere for safety . The nest is built largely of twigs : but in laying its foundation the knowing bird is not content with picking up the fragile , half-rotten sticks of the forest floor , but works with might and main . using both billand feet , to break strong dead twigs from the limb of some standing tree , and on this foundation the nest is placed . When the eggs are laid the noisy jay becomes silent and discreet . He does not advertise his home with staccato cries , like the robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , and hops from limb to limb round the trunk , watching on all sides , perhaps to see if the coast is clear , but going higher all the while , until he has climbed his spiral stairway , and reached the nest on which his partner sits awaiting the morsel he politely tenders her . The screams of the jay are harsh , yet musical . His voice has the timbre of a trumpet , ? a cold , clear , metallic sound , ? and his call to arms  | quickly arouses the whole eager clan . Now they have found a drowsy owl in a thick pine top . The woods ring again with their trumpet chorus , and blue flashes to blue as they converge to the attack . Here they come from all directions . Fuss and feathers indeed ! In the excitement of the affray they lose their habitual caution , and you expect to see the noisy mob annihilate the little gray owl ; but after half an hour of ceaseless clamor and attack hardly a feather of the drowsy one seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but sits in the midst of the clamor with his head sunk between his shoulders , apparently somnolent . The onset consists mainly of bluff and bluster ? and he knows it . Next their arch enemy , the sharp-shinned hawk , is the object of their enmity , and he sometimes suffers them to mob him with impunity ; but let them not venture to provoke the little pirate too far , for then , with a sudden rush , he strikes one of the mocking crew and bears him to the ground , when , although the stricken victim fights to the last gasp , the hearts of his companions turn to water and they fly screaming away . Theirs is only mob courage , after all , and a stout heart soon daunts them . The brilliant jay takes the very best care of his precious skin ; yet he will fight for his helpless young , and in defense of them becomes invincible . Jays are sociable creatures and fond of their companions . There is a story told of one that became blind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his solicitous cornpanions . Few people who know the blue jay and its common cries even suspect that as a songbird it is secretly a brilliant performer . Commonly it imitates the scream of the redshouldered hawk so closely - that only the trained ear can detect the difference , and it has a remarkable faculty of imitating many other birds . Let none despise the musical powers of the jay ; for certain individuals are greatly gifted , and the only reason this is not more generally known is that our modest performer warbles  | as softly as " any sucking dove " and apparently sings when he believes no one is near . I have heard its supreme vocal effort only a few times , and it was no mean performance . Jays , like crows , are fond of hearing their own voices . When the frost has opened the chestnut burs they are supremely happy . With a hole in a tree or a cavity behind a strip of bark to fill with nuts or corn , the prudent jay lays up a store of provisions against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , as autumn wanes , the call of the jay seems to take on a sadder tone , like the plaint of some forest elf wandering sadly ' mid falling leaves and mourning the decay of the season . THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE When Alexander Wilson , the " Father of American Ornithology , " described and figured the firebird , hangbird , or golden robin of our fathers , he called it the Baltimore oriole . A tradition still lingers in Maryland to the effect that George Calvert , the first Lord Baltimore , who wrote the charter for what is now Maryland , discouraged by the trials and rigors of his Newfoundland colony , visited Virginia in 1628 , where he found flocks of orioles , and was so cheered by their song and beauty that he adopted their colors , orange and black , for his own . As he took the oriole 's colors , the oriole later took his name . Elegant in form , beautiful in plumage , and a fine singer , the Baltimore bird has always been a favorite , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its swinging nest is one of the finest specimens of bird architecture , and is commonly hung from the drooping branch of a great elm overhanging farmhouse or village street . In  | May the happy , mated pair begin their domicile , looping strings , strands , or hair over the pendent branchlets , each one fastened from twig to twig in the form of a swing . Both birds bring material , and the female works the material together until a pouch is formed to contain the nest lining . In some cases the nest is roofed over until a long , deep , gourd-shaped bag is formed , with a small entrance hole in one side . In the Gulf States the pouch is sometimes built of Spanish moss in loose , open fashion ; but in the North it is woven firmly and the nest is warmly lined . Usually the little home swings high , safe from the attacks of predatory animals , a veritable castle in the air . Some kindly people hang upon shrub or fence a stock of colored yarns for the orioles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest . Once I found a black nest built almost entirely of horsehair . The mother bird exhibits extreme devotion to her newly hatched young . In one case she remained on the nest and defended them until the limb was sawed off and the nest taken into a house . Through the spring and summer days the wild , free notes of the oriole ring out among the elms of the countryside . Usually they are recognizable by their peculiar quality ; but a particularly talented performer now and then appears . Last year near my home a gifted bird rang the changes constantly on C , E , and G major in several different combinations extending over an entire octave . The notes rang like a bugle call . As with most brilliantly plumaged birds , the male is far more brightly colored than the female , and as in other species the plumage grows brighter and more perfect for three or more years . An old male 's breast sometimes shows a deep , rich , luminous orange that rivals the bright scarlet of the tanger . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for it continually destroys caterpillars , weevils ,  | and many injurious beetles , and it does little harm to any crop . So we see the oriole is useful as well as ornamental . THE CEDAR WAXWING At any season , in almost any part of the country , you may see a flock of curious little birds flying in easy , slightly undulating fashion to alight compactly on some nearby tree . You have made the acquaintance of the cedar waxwing , a hardy bird , which winters in the Northern States in many localities where it can feed on the berries of the red cedar or Virginia juniper . Hence its name . The waxwing is not a bird of brilliant plumage . It is rather quakerlike in garb ; but , though a trifle odd and peculiar , its appearance is extremely elegant and refined , giving the bird an air of distinction . Its principal charm lies in its graceful shape and its silky plumage , with its marvelous melting browns and drabs , changing insensibly from one lovely tint to another . On this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yellow are tastefully disposed like the trimmings of a garment . No painting can do justice to the satiny sheen and texture of its feathers and soft blending of the different colors . No other family of birds has similar waxlike appendages at the ends of the quills . They look like bits of bright red sealing wax , and science has not discovered their use . Probably they are more ornamental than useful . This bird of beauty has an unenviable reputation . It is a irrepressible little gormand . A fruit grower told me that individuals ate of his cherries until so satiated that they fell from the tree and could be taken in the hand , and Audubon says that birds of this species , kept in confinement , dined so heartily upon apples that they died of suffocation . The waxwing is a well known enemy of the cherry grower . Its digestion  | is so rapid that fruit has passed its entire digestive tract in less than half an hour . The greater part of the fruit it eats , however , is valueless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on insects known as destructive pests , it is ranked as one of the birds beneficial to agriculture . It feeds on cankerworms , caterpillars , elm-leaf beetles , potato beetles , grasshoppers , crickets , moths , bugs , bark lice , and scale insects . Like some other plump and well fed personages , the waxwing is good natured , happy , affectionate , and blessed generally with a good disposition . It is fond of good company , and is very considerate of its companions . Sometimes a little group may be observed resting together in a row , billing and caressing . If one of them secures a tempting morsel , like a luscious cherry or a plump insect , he may be seen to pass it on to his neighbor , which in turn presents it to the next , until it has passed up and down the line more than once , before it is accepted . " So , " says Dr. Coues , " they lead their idle , uneventful lives , these debonair birds , ? sociable but not domestic , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scrape , very reliable diners out , and fond of showing off their dressy topknots , on which so much of their mind is fixed . " THE SCARLET TANAGER No other North American bird can compare with the male scarlet tanager in massed brilliance of pure color . He flashes through the light green leaves of early spring like a brand of tropical flame , his encrimsoned body contrasting sharp1v with wings and tail as black as night , a common bird , vet so rarely seen by most people that the sight makes a lasting impression upon the mind . It is May . In the deep woods of oak and chestnut we hear a clear , warbling whistle , a trifle strident in parts , sounding somewhat like a hoarse robin 's song . Follow the song , and you may find the singer , but not at once , as our  | bird is a ventriloquist . His song rings here and there , now near . now far , while the listener vainly cranes his neck in search of the musician , who sits quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So people have come to believe that the tanager is a rare bird ; while in reality it is common in the woods , especially during the spring migration . When the song is hushed you may sometimes find the bird by startling him with a sudden noise , a shout , or a loud clapping of the hands . Then the alarm note chip-churr , often repeated , may lead you to him or to his modestly colored mate . The tanager is not confined altogether to the woods , and at times nests in the orchards . The nest is rather loosely built , and is set on the branch of a tree from five to fifty feet from the ground . Our black-winged redbird is very devoted to its young , and will sometimes risk its life in their defense . A little one that had fallen from a nest was picked up and taken to a farmhouse half a mile away ; but its parents found it there and contrived to feed it through the bars of its cage . The tanager loves to dwell within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself the guardian of these trees . It feeds constantly on the insects of the oak and chestnut , and very few of these pests escape its sharp and roving eye . I have seen a tanager take in a short time every caterpillar from a shrub that had swarmed with them . Its beauty , song , and usefulness should endear the tanager to all mankind . THE SNOWY HERON It was one of the privileges of my early days , during an expedition to Florida , to see much of the wonderful flora and fauna of that semitropical peninsula before the woodman 's ax , the hunter 's gun , and the  | fisherman 's net had robbed the lands and waters of much of their luxuriant - life . In those days flocks of snowy herons and egrets gladdened the eye throughout a large part of the Gulf States . Late one afternoon , as I lay concealed beneath the roots of a large mangrove , , a flock of snowy herons alighted about a dark and sunken pool before me , and there , within from ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strutted about , displaying their raised crests and lovely , spraylike plumes against the background of the black and slimy ooze . Snowy white , immaculate , they passed and repassed one another , bowing and turning as they swept about exhibiting their stately beauties ; for it was the mating season . I never expect to see the like again ; for the curse of the feather trade has fallen like a blight upon all plume birds , and where millions once inhabited a great part of our country , from the Atlantic to the Pacific , now only a few diminishing colonies remain . The snowy heron or lesser egret is the smaller of the white egrets of America . It is a useful bird ; for , notwithstanding the fact that , like all herons , it feeds to some extent on fish and frogs , grasshoppers , cutworms and other injurious insects enter largely into its bill of fare . During most of the year it is a plain , plumeless white heron ; but in the mating season it bears on its back the beautiful sprays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white birds gather in colonies in some more or less inaccessible swamp and build their loosely constructed nests ,  | usually in bushes or trees . Each nesting female lays three to five bluish eggs , and hatches them by the heat of her body . When the eggs have hatched and the parent birds are employed in feeding their crying young , the plume hunter sees his opportunity . The plumes are now at their best , and the fond parents , caring for their little ones , fearlessly expose themselves to the aim of the vandal hidden in the undergrowth beneath their nests . He shoots the parents , leaves the young to starve in the nests ? and thus My Lady gets her plumes . The ever-diminishing hosts of the egrets in every land rapidly are nearing extinction . The few pitiful remnants in the United States are guarded mainly by wardens employed by the Audubon societies . Nevertheless , the sad story of the egrets may yet have a brighter sequel . It remained for Edward A. McIlhenny of Louisiana to show how these birds may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the heronries in his neighborhood , he saved a few of the starving young . which he kept in a cage near his house . He fed them well , and when they were fully fledged , he liberated them . They flew away . The next spring they returned , mated , and built their nests in the trees near a little pool where stood their old home , the cage . The birds increased in numbers year by year , and now there are thousands of egrets , perfectly tame , well protected , and nesting on Mr. McIlhenny 's grounds within sight of his factory . It is to be hoped that , with the protection of law , it may be possible again to restock the country with these graceful and useful creatures . THE WOOD DUCK Peerless in beauty among waterfowl of the world stands our wood duck . Dame Nature has turned out few more beautiful creatures . The changing lusters of its wondrous plumage , flashing in the sunlight , are the despair of the artist and a delight to all eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tints , and many a changing iridescence robe the lovely bird , until it appears a feast and riot of color among the reflections of the limpid forest pools in which it proudly sails , like an exquisitely proportioned little barge decorated with the gems of the Orient . The wood duck was formerly the most abundant waterfowl in many wooded regions of North America , from the southern forests of Canada to the Gulf of Mexico . Audubon saw them in flocks of hundreds . Dr. Hatch , writing of Minnesota in the last quarter of the nineteenth century , says that in the spring they came like the rains of the tropics , and poured in until every pool in the woodlands was deluged by them . In Ohio they were killed by wagonloads fifty years ago . Even in eastern Massachusetts they were so plentiful that old hunters still living tell of the  | killing of fifty or sixty by one man in a morning . With the coming of the white man this duck adapted its habits to the changing conditions , and often built its nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elm above a farmhouse door . Nesting from time immemorial in hollow trees , it was always at home in the woods , and it still pursues its devious flight among the branches of the forest as easily as a passenger pigeon . The nest is warmly lined with down and feathers , with which the mother bird , when leaving , covers the eggs to keep life in them while she is away Returning , she flies directly and unerringly into the entrance of her little home , striking upon the feathers of her breast and landing so lightly as never to injure her cherished treasures . When the little ones have hatched and dried their natal down , they seek the water . Accounts vary as to how they get there . Some observers claim to have seen the young riding to the water on the back of the flying mother ; others aver that she carries them one by one in her bill ; others that she takes them with her feet ; and still others claim to have seen her push them out of the nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or leaves below , and were then led to the water . If the nesting tree overhangs the flood , the downy ones launch into the air and , spreading their little wings and feet , drop upon the surface . It is probable that the procedure varies ; but this much seems sure , ? the young are often taken to the water in the bill of the parent ; for many people have seen it . The wood duck feeds mainly on water plants and woodland products , such as acorns , chestnuts , and beech nuts , or on insects , tadpoles , and other small forms of aquatic life . Beautiful , interesting , harmless , and useful , it deserves a better fate than extermination at the hands of man .  |
