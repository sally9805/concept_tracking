txt District Attorney Fredericks to-day recounted the story of how the agreement for pleas of guilty from both the in the Los Angeles dynamiting cases was effected . In his blunt manner he told how advances had been made to him by the defense , first through Larry Sullivan , a detective employed by the defense , as early as last July , to have the prosecu. tion accept a plea of guilty from J. B. IiicNamara if the State would consent to allow J. J. to go free . This offer , Capt . Fredericks declared , had been repeated at different times by both Chief Counsel Clarence S. Darrow and his associate , Le Compte Davis , on the same terms , but that he had steadfastly refused . " Because , " he declared , " I knew I had the goods on these men and that i could convict both of them and they knew it , and they both knew that I knew it . Therefore their ruesses were as good as mine ? if either of the defendants wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea of guilty . I steadfastly refused to consider any terms hut my own , and when ' Darrow and Davis found that I would consider absolutely no other they took the only chance they had ? an unconditional plea of guilty on the part of both the defendants . " Following the District Attorney's-steftet went Clarence S. Darrow , chief of counsel for the defense , summed up the sudden pleas of guilty as follows : " No motive of any sort entered into the disposition of the cases except the welfare of the men accused of murder . " Steffens 's Part in It . That Lincoln Steffens , the writer , who to-day said he was the man who had effected the compromise ending in the pleas of guilty , was merely a go-betewert for Darrow and some of Cant . Fredericks 's friends in the closing hours of the negotiations to induce the District Attorney to allow J. J. to save his neck at the expense of his brother 's life , was a statement also made by the District Attorney . When the proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , it , was the same old proposition put up to hint by Darrow many times before , and he rejected it without further consideration. , They told him , he said , that for the benefit of society he should accept the propcsftion of Mr. Darrow to hang J. B. MCNrmara and let J. J. go free . Capt . Fredericks said he replied that ' he ' was not running society ; ' that as District Attorney , his duty was to prosecute the defendants in the dynamiting case and convict them if he could  --  and he believed he could . Nothing short of an unconditional plea of guilty from both men , he said , would be considered by the District Attorney 's office . Some of the " downtown " friends seen by Steffens , said Capt . Fredericks , had decided to make an appeal in person to him against the advice and wishes of the others seen by Steffens , and when friend ' ly members of the committee ' phoned , the District Attorney their business , the ' Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the unbidden ' emissaries to call them off ; that their mission would be fruitless . " I have had nothing to do with Lin.coin Steffens , " he added , " nor do I personally know that he had any connection with the ease . I have never taked with him . Beginning of Negotiations . " The offer of J. B. to plead guilty was made to me by persons interested in the defense as far back as the middle of the Summer , provided I would dismiss the case against J. J. . I refused to consider it . " Four weeks ago Davis and I talked about It in the courtroom , and we were a bit ' too loud about it . so that the court Paused and we quit . That afternoon Darrow came up and made the same offer in person . I refused it again . I told him that we had ' the goods ' on his clients and they must both plead guilty or we would proceed with the trial . " ' Well , if you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I replied that I would never change my mind about it . He saw and knew that I was in earnest . In fact , this same offer has been open to us ever since last July . Larry Sullivan , a detective employed by the defense , was the first to approach me with the propo2 sition . I always have refused to consider it . " Ten days ago Darrow and I had another talk over It . Nothing came of this interview . Next Darrow and Lincoln Steffens got together and tried to fix it up , They went to some of the prominent People downtown to get them to see me , to try and induce me to accept the plea of guilty from J. B. if I would let . Ttz J. go . They interested these prominent citizensand subsequently they called me into conference with them and put the matter up to me . I refused , as I had before refused . Steffens simply acted as a ' go . between " for Darrow and my friends . His Friends Intervene . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not urged me to accept the Darrow propos ! . tion . They simply put it up to me , ' They did not try to influence me ' one way or the other at that time . They had S typewritten statement of the proposition , - and ' when I read it I saw that it was the same old proposition put to me by DarJ'ow . I turned , it down . Then my friendssiime of them  --  urged me to accept the - terms on the ground that it would be best for society . I told them I was not responsible for society  --  that I had the ? goods ' on these ' prisoners and that did not propose to lie down ' on it for a ' , moment . I told them that nothing short . of ; the plea of guilty from both prisoners Would stop the trial . " After this conference I called into another conference a number of gentlemen ' in-whose judgment I have confidence . and pyt it up to them  --  asked them if , in their ? jUdgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that I was ' the better judge of that ; that I should BO ahead as my conscience dictated , in illy OWn way . That was Wednesday . Certain of His Evidence . The next day Darrow and Davis had another conference with me about the matter . They made a last try to Kaye me accept their terms , but I told them that nothing but the plea of guilty from both men would be considered by this office . A7 : ; knew that I could convict these men , and that if I convicted them they would . hanged . Darrow and Davis both knew - that , and they knew that I knew it , and ' . they also knew that I knew they knew it . : Their guesses were as good as mine , and if : these men would save their necks they must use their own judgment . It was up ' to , them . the Wednesday meeting some gentlemen told me that some of the men in conference may come to you to get you to let one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and my informant told me that the others in the conference were against this visit to me for this purpose . I replied to my informant that if , he had any influence with these other friends they had better tell them to run along and mind their own business . " : " You personally do not defend anybody 's life ? " was asked . " I do not , " was the quick , sharp answer of the District Attorney . " I never did . I have not done the thing that the people downtown wanted me to do . I have done the thing that I wanted to do . - They wanted me to hang one and let the other go . " " ' Why ? " was asked . ? ? Nirhy , " repeated Capt . Fredericks , " I do- not know . " - As to Bert H. Franklin , the defense InVestigator arrested on a charge of bribery , District Attorney Fredericks said that the termination of the case might make a readjustment in counsel , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel for Franklin , Might be replaced by Le CoMpte Davis . James B. to Tell AU . " If they ask a. continuance on Monday they shall have it , " he said . ' He said he had not determined whether M. recommend clemency for the , but said that Tames B. would make a complete statement of the affair to the world . This statement , he said , might be given out the day of sentence , which is next Tnesday . Asked if it were true that ' the State bad obtained from prospective witnesses money supposed to have been given them . ' Such quantities that the total practically equated the amount of the re'Wards offered by the city , State , and county , in all about $.50,000 , Mr. Fredericks said it was " more or less true . " " When Detective Bums 's statement in ? Chicago that Schmidt and Kaplan might be arrested soon and others prosecuted  - -  for complicity in the destruction of Tho - 'Imes building was shown to District At , t011103r Fredericks he said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty parties . ** denied that the pleas of guilty en:tared by the had in any way precluded him from going ahead with the other cases . ? " Those pleas concern two persons , " he said . " They pleaded guilty and took .. their chances . There has Been no agreexrient to stop prosecution . " - That prosecutions would end by the : confessions , however , has been - the hope of counsel for the , and tacitly they have believed the State would lay down its arms . It was asserted by business men interested in bringing about a cessation of the MeNamara trial that Schmidt and Kaplan eventually would not be-brought to trial , and that The Times incident could be considered closed . Barrow 's Explanation . In a signed statement giving his verslim of the negotiations , Clarence S. Dar- ? raw , chief counsel for the , said : Believing as I did that the action taken would save the lives of the accused inen ' , - I*/iad no more tight to refuse it doctor would have to forbear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . al-r -- A ' ? committee of Los Angeles people abeginning work Nov. 20. made it possible accomplish the result . Their suggestions were brought to me first by Mr. Steffens on that day , and every day : thereafter as matters proceeded until the final determination , " How much their efforts had to do with the State attorney I can not tell but it was at their intercession that negotiations were begun by attorneys for . the . defense . I expected the final action every day after this movement was commenced , and it was taken the first minute that an understanding was reached . It was impossible to delay action beyond the time an understanding was reached on account of the imminent danger we were - in for two weeks of having the matter become public property , and thus making the end difficult to achieve . " Mr. Darrow was asked how the felt about the case . Well , " he replied , " they accepted their fate with resignation , but felt glad , . I think , that they had averted a possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney ' Darrow declared that as the parole laws covered these cases of the , John J. might be out after serving a brief term . As for James B. , with a , life imprisonment sentence , the situation would be more difficult . Mr. Darrow read the comments of labor leaders throughout the country on the pleas of guilty entered by the . He declared that labor leaders ( ' would understand in due course that the procedure yesterday was the only solution of'a vexious problem that had worried him for months . - Organized labor was not hurt , " he ? said , and the leaders would not be so bitter if they knew the facts . " Confessed to Save Others . - It is believed that Mr. Darrow meant - thAt compromise was much more ex ' tatielve than hitherto has been hinted ? namely , that the State of California had possession information that would alaVe involved other prominent persons and that the agreement to get the to plead guilty practically saves is score of indictments and prosecutions . Mr. Darrow was perturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the defendants innocent and that -. they had no advance information on the pleas . The impracticability of taking the labor leaders generally . into their confidence . it is thought , is one reason that was not done , though it is known that ' W. - Darrow sent messages to several prominent labor leaders a week ago urging them , to come here for a conference . " I never told Samuel Gompers , or anyone else , " he said. , " that J. B. Ai c.Naf mara was innocent . I have always be . - ? listred. however , that John J. had nothSng to do with The Times disaster , though - learned of his connection with the Llewellyn explosion . Whatever , informa .. ticin came to Mr. Gompers about the , ' Or innocence of the . , , probably came from the accused men ' A.laemselves. " - Attorney Darrow declared furthermore that he originally did not want to defend . - the but had been persuaded - =tondo : so by labor leaders . Even on learn : " lag of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in saving human life . Mr. Darrow does not believe in capital punishment . . Edward Nockols , Secretary of the Chi , . cagO Federation of Labor , who has been : in ; the city for two weeks , knew of the : isituation , with respect to the pleas , and Is ' aid to have accepted the solution of - yesterday as the only practicable one . Taken as a whole , the fear of further ' exposes during the trial is said to have , : cut . off its continuation , and it was hint-:ea-that at some future time labor men Would know the details . The business Men of the city who invited the move to end the trial , it was learned to-day , % : - would have been satisfied with the con ' fession of James B. . They thought that would be sufficient vindica.tien for the prosecution , but the State . ' ' officials insisted on I 's confession , too . James B. in Poor Health . One of the factors which is said to have entered strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Mo . Namara , the younger brother . Fears have ! been expressed by some who knew him ; personally that though he faces a life sentence his years are numbered . Carelessness in caring for his physical welfare is said to have weakened his health . John J. has admitted heretofore to friends that James-has not taken ' the best of care of himself . The possibility of an appearance of heart trouble i while the trial was in progress had been I discussed by his counsel . Once , when a . Juror was excused on account of illness , Attorney Darrow , it is recalled , suddenly exclaimed : " I hope nothing happens to James B. He does n't look well : " Attorney Scott for the defense to-day said that J. J. had been prevailed on to plead guilty to the minor charge in connection with the Llewellyn Iron Works explosion for the sake of saving his brother 's life . " Is n't it a fact , " he was asked , " that the entire framework of these confessions was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from death ? " ' No , " he answered , " ' it was each brother doing something for the other . James B. pleaded guilty to the , murder charge because it would ha waived against John J. The elder brother , John J. , in turn agreed to plead guilty to the Llewellyn indictment because the ultimatum was that he . too , must plead guilty to the conspiracy charge . If he had not James B. might have lost his life , for the State wanted pleas of guilty from both . " Judge Borth-vein ! Attitude . Pronouncement of sentence now is in the hands of Judge Walter Bordwell . The District Attorney can make recommendations , and usually they are accepted , but the court is by no means bound to impose the sentence suggested . Judge Bordwell would not talk for publication to-day in this connection , but it is said he favors life imprisonment for James B. and a few years for John J. The indictments against John J. for complicity in The Times disaster are expected to be quashed on motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said John J. himself did not direct the blowing up of The Times , while he has pleaded guilty to the charge of having caused the Llewellyn Iron Works explosion , in which no lives were lost . The minimum sentence for this offense , according to statute , is one year , and there is no maximum penalty fixed . Under the Penal Code Ortie F. will be sentenced , as he is expected to plead guilty to a similar charge of having wrecked the plant of the Llewellyn Iron Works . The passed the night with a heavy guard at their cell doors . Five armed men were stationed near them as they slept . An extra force patroled the street outside the jail , and no one was permitted to loiter in the vicinity . The maintained their cheerfulness to-day .. The prisoners told the jailors they were glad that the ordeal was over . Telegrams of various kinds began to pour in from friends expressing sympathy . Many believe that the offered- themselves as martyrs to a cause and became resigned to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good authority that John .1 . probably would tender his resignation as Secretary-Treasurer of the International Association of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers at once after sentence is pronounced upon him Tuesday . With regard to the disposition of unused funds for the defense little could be - learned to-day . A large part of the $190,000 in the fund is said to have been spent in preparing the case . A shortage of funds to carry on a vigorous defense was one of the factors that led to its quick conclusion . Confronted with the statement that labor leaders expected that much of this would be refunded , Attorney Darrow said that he could not see how it could be done . Money flies fast , very fast , " he said , " and in a. case like this it has wings . Of course the trial to date did n't cost much , but preparation for the handling of witnesses took much of . the fund . A good part has been spent , and an accounting will be had as to every detail . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been wondering for some time how we could ever get very far with the means at our disposal . " The total cost to the State thus far of the trial is estimated to be close to $200 , - 000 , and the abrupt ending of it is calculated to save the county nearly $1,000,00.3 . Los Angeles Views of Plea . Just how far the committee of business men which gathered in the hope of suggesting a way to settle the affair was influenced by the Gospel and religious principles which are supposes to have brought about the entire surrender of the assertions to-day varied from one extreme to the other . The Los Angeles Tribune featured the closing of the case as- having been brought about by the Gospel of Christ , presumably referring to the motives which moved the citizens ' committee to intercede . The Los Angeles Examiner announced that the defense crumbled as a result of the arrest of Bert Franklin on a charge of attempting to bribe a Prospective juror , while The Los Angeles Times , the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across its front page that the were forced to confess through absolute proof , and likewise dwelt at length on the theory that the Franklin affair was " too much for the defense . " The confessions were , received with much interest in labor circles here , and the Central Labor Council issued the following statement : The Central Labor Counsel of Los Angeles , in its relations to the case stands on its fundamental principles that it assumes in all the cases where the rights of the citizens are involved . It is against lawlessness and , disorder of any kind and stands for the uplift of society . When the were arrested and illegally deported from Indianapolis to Los Angeles , organized labor believed that it was a violation of law , and under the circumstances that a fair and ithpartial trial was impossible . Believing - in the innocence of all until proven guilty , it came to the aid of the accused with moral and financial help . Upon the guilt of an accused person being established , the Central Labor Counsel insists upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the Central Labor Council , declared in an interview : " The mere fact of a few men resorting to crime does not by any means make the whole movement wrong . We stand ready and willing as ever to assist in maintaining in every way possible law and order . " Roosevelt Congratulates Burns , Among the many telegrams received by those who have aided in the prosecution of the ? was the following telegram given out to-day by Detective Malcolm , a representative of W. J. Burns : W. J. Burns , District Attorney 's Office , Los Angeles , ' Cal. : All good American citizens feel that they owe you a debt of gratitude for your signal service to American citizenship . THEODORE ROOSEVELT . The relation of the case to the local political situation came in for a big share of discussion to-day . " I 'm afraid it means the defeat of Job Harriman , Socialist candidate , " said Attorney Darrow , " but it will not hurt the Socialist movement here . It will get stronger in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The incident happened at an unfortunate time , but if we had waited until later perhaps the arrangement-could not have been effected and lives might have been lost . " In Socialist circles leaders were not ready to admit that the confession of the had reduced the chances of Harriman , ' who also was . associate counsel for the two brothers . They declared they felt the  --  blow , but were prepared to pursue the fight to its end on Tuesday next , and entertained the ' hope that the people would not associate Harriman with the affair , inasmuch as he has not been active in it since he became the single opponent of Mayor George Alexander for re-election . The Los Angeles Record , an afternoon paper which has been supporting the Socialist candidate , issued extras to-day with headlines announcing that politics " figured in the case , " and that yesterday 's episode was framed to defeat Job Harriman.
