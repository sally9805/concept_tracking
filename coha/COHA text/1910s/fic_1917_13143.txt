The library in the ROOT home , the library of middle-western people who are an important family in their community , a university town , and who think of themselves as people of culture . It is a room which shows pride of family : on the rear wall are two large family portraits  --  one a Revolutionary soldier , the other a man of a later period . On the low book-cases , to both sides of door rear , and on the mantel , right , are miniatures and other old pictures . There is old furniture  --  mahogany recently done over : an easy chair near the fireplace , a divan left . A Winged Victory presides over one of the book-cases , a Burne Jones is hung . It is a warmly lighted , cheerful room  --  books and flowers about . At the rear is a door opening on the hall , at the left a door into another room . There is a corner window at the right . JHANSI and PEYTON are seated on the divan . MRS . ROOT is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JHANSI is dressed as a non-conformist , but attractively . PEYTON is a rather helpless young man , with a sense of humor that is itself rather helpless . MRS . ROOT I 'll see , Peyton , if your grandmother is n't ready to come down . She leaves them . JHANSI Springing up . It 's absurd that I should be here ! p. 3 ROOT I know , Jhansi , but just this once  --  as long as it means so much to mother , and does n't really hurt us . JHANSI But it does hurt me , Peyton . These walls stifle me . You come of people who have been walled in all their lives . It does n't cage you . But me  --  I am a gypsy ! Sometimes I feel them right behind me  --  all those wanderers , people who were never caught ; feel them behind me pushing me away from all this ! ROOT But not pushing you away from me , dear . You love me , Jhansi , in spite of my family ? JHANSI If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to this dreadful place ? A look about the comfortable room  --  and meet these dreadful people ? Forgive me for alluding to your home and family , Peyton , but I must not lose my honesty , you know . ROOT No , dear ; I do n't think you are losing it . And perhaps I 'd better not lose mine either . There 's one thing I have n't mentioned yet . Hesitates . Mr. Peyton is coming to dinner tonight . JHANSI Mr. Peyton . What Peyton ? ROOT Yes  --  that one . JHANSI And you ask me  --  standing for the things I do in this university  --  to sit down to dinner with the president of the board of regents ! p. 4 ROOT Mother 'd asked him before I knew it . JHANSI With scorn . Your uncle ! ROOT He 's not my uncle  --  he 's mother 's . And you see it 's partly on account of grandmother just getting back from California . He 's grandmother 's brother-in-law , you know . I suppose she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner with him  --  she 's done it so much . And then mother thought it would be nice for you to meet him . JHANSI Nice ! ROOT He 's pleasant at dinner . JHANSI Pleasant ! ROOT Mother 's a little worried about my position in the university . JHANSI It would be wonderful for you to lose your position in the university . ROOT Yes  --  wonderful . JHANSI And then you and I could walk forth free ! ROOT Free  --  but broke . JHANSI Peyton , you disappoint me . Just the fact that that man is coming to dinner changes you . ROOT Oh , no . But you are fortunately situated , Jhansi , having no people . It 's easier to be free when there 's nobody who minds . p. 5 JHANSI I am going ! ROOT Oh come now , dearest , you ca n't go when you 're expected for dinner . Nobody 's that free . JHANSI Dinner ! A dinner to celebrate our engagement ! It 's humiliating , Peyton . I should take you by the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . ROOT We will , Jhansi ; we will  --  in time . JHANSI We should go now . ROOT Think so ? Mother 's going to have turkey . JHANSI Better a dinner of berries and nuts  --  ! ROOT We 'll have berries  --  cranberries , and nuts , too . JHANSI Where is my coat ? ROOT Seizing her and kissing her . Some day , serene and unhampered , we 'll take to the open road  --  a road with berries and nuts . GRANDMOTHER PEYTON and MRS . ROOT are at the door . MRS . ROOT Mother , this is Peyton 's friend Miss Mason . One of our important students . GRANDMOTHER In her brittle way . Yes ? I never was a very important student myself . I did n't like to study . Because my family were professors , I suppose . p. 6 MRS . ROOT Peyton 's grandmother is a descendant of Gustave Phelps  --  one of the famous teachers of pioneer days . JHANSI Her head going up . I am a descendant of people who never taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish an article on Free Speech which must get to the Torch this evening . GRANDMOTHER Moving toward the big chair near the fire . Free Speech ? How amusing . ROOT You may be less amused some day , grandmother . JHANSI and PEYTON go into the other room . GRANDMOTHER That may be a free speech . I would n't call it a pleasant one . MRS . ROOT Sinking to the divan . Oh , he was speaking of the open road again  --  berries and nuts  --  ! GRANDMOTHER Beginning to knit . Berries and nuts ? Well , it sounds quite innocuous to me . Some of our young people are less simple in their tastes . MRS . ROOT In great distress . Mother , how would you like to see your grandson become a gypsy ? p. 7 GRANDMOTHER Peyton a gypsy ? You mean in a carnival ? MRS . ROOT No , not in a carnival ! In life . GRANDMOTHER But he is n't dark enough . MRS . ROOT And is that the only thing against it ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . GRANDMOTHER Well , my dear Clara , I have no doubt I will be a help to you  --  in time . This idea of Peyton becoming a gypsy is too startling for me to be a help instantly . In the first place , could he be ? You ca n't be anything you take it into your head to be  --  even if it is undesirable . And then , why should he be ? Does n't he still teach English right here in the university ? MRS . ROOT I do n't know how much longer he 'll teach it . He said the other day that American literature was a toddy with the stick left out . Saying that of the very thing he 's paid to teach ! It got in the papers and was denounced in an editorial on " Untrue Americans . " Peyton  --  a descendant of John Peyton of Valley Forge ! Indicates the Revolutionary portrait  --  denounced in an article on Untrue Americans ! And in one of those awful columns  --  those silly columns  --  they said maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is n't that . Peyton does n't drink  --  to speak of . It 's this girl . She 's the stick . And I tell you people do n't like it , mother . It 's not what we pay our professors for . Peyton used to be perfectly satisfied with civilization . But now he talks about society . Makes light remarks . p. 8 GRANDMOTHER I should say that was going out of his way to be disagreeable . What business has a professor of English to say anything about society ? It 's not in his department . MRS . ROOT I told Peyton he should be more systematic . GRANDMOTHER How did this gypsy get here ? MRS . ROOT She was brought up by a family named Mason . But it seems she was a gypsy child , who got lost or something , and those Masons took her in . I 'm sure it was very good of them , and it 's too bad they were n't able to make her more of a Christian . She is coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seem to think that because you 're outside society you have some superior information about it . GRANDMOTHER Well , do n't you think you 're needlessly disturbed ? In my day , a young man would be likely enough to fall in love with a good-looking gypsy , not very likely to marry her . MRS . ROOT Times have changed , mother . They marry them now . Both sigh . Of course , it 's very commendable of them . GRANDMOTHER Grimly . Oh , quite  --  commendable . MRS . ROOT I was brought up in university circles . I 'm interested in ideas . But sometimes I think there are too many ideas . p. 9 GRANDMOTHER An embarrassment of riches . So you have set out to civilize the young woman ? MRS . ROOT I 'd rather have her sit at my table than have my son leave some morning in a covered wagon ! GRANDMOTHER I wonder how it is about gypsies . About the children . I wonder if it 's as it is with the negroes . MRS . ROOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ?  --  if one of them should turn out to be a real gypsy and take to this open road . MRS . ROOT Covering her face . Oh ! GRANDMOTHER Quite likely they 'd do it by motor . MRS . ROOT Rising . Mother !  --  how can you say such dreadful things  --  and just when I have this trying dinner . Oh , I wish Bessie would come ! Goes to the window . She is a comfort to me . GRANDMOTHER Where is Bessie ? MRS . ROOT She 's away in the motor . Again shudders . Bessie feels dreadfully about her brother . She is trying to do something . She said it would be a surprise  --  a happy surprise . Someone heard in the hall . Perhaps this is Bessie . Enter Mr. PEYTON . Oh , it 's Uncle George . p. 10 PEYTON Early I know . Came to have a little visit with Elizabeth . Goes to GRANDMOTHER and shakes hands . How are you , young woman ? GRANDMOTHER My nerves seem to be stronger than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George ? PEYTON Oh , I 'm well . GRANDMOTHER But  --  ? PEYTON Responsibilities . GRANDMOTHER The bank ? PEYTON I 'd rather run ten banks than a tenth of a university You can control money . MRS . ROOT I 'm sorry , Uncle George , that Peyton should be adding to your worries . PEYTON What 's the matter with Peyton ? GRANDMOTHER Wild oats . PEYTON Well , I wish he 'd sow them in less intellectual fields . MRS . ROOT I am prepared to speak freely with you , Uncle George . The matter with Peyton is this girl . Well , they 're going to be married . Yes Answering his gesture of protestand I think it 's a good thing . She wo n't be in a position to say so much about freedom after she is married . p. 11 PEYTON But they say she 's a gypsy . MRS . ROOT She wo n't be a gypsy after she 's Peyton 's wife . She 'll be a married woman . PEYTON Yes , but in the meantime we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering how it would be about the children . MRS . ROOT Mother , please do n't be indelicate again . Pause . GRANDMOTHER Well , if there 's nothing else we may speak of , let 's talk about free speech . They 're writing a paper on it in there . PEYTON I do n't know what this university is coming to ! An institution of learning ! It is n't that I do n't believe in free speech . Every true American believes in free speech , but  --  Slight Pause . GRANDMOTHER With Emphasis . Certainly . PEYTON Ask them to come out here with their paper on free speech . I 'll be glad to give them the benefit of my experience . MRS . ROOT Yes , it will be delightful to all be together . She goes to get PEYTON and JHANSI. p. 12 GRANDMOTHER This girl does n't look to me like one who is thirsting for the benefit of another person 's experience . PEYTON She 's a bad influence . She 's leading our young people to criticise the society their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of ingratitude in the world . MRS . ROOT returns , followed by the two young people . MRS . ROOT I told Uncle George you were eager to bring him and Jhansi together . Jhansi , this is Mr. Peyton , who looks after the affairs of the university for you students . Of course you 've heard about Miss Mason , Uncle George , one of our  --  cleverest students . PEYTON Yes , we were speaking of Miss Mason 's cleverness just the other day  --  in board meeting . JHANSI And just the other day  --  at the student assembly  --  we were speaking of how you look after the affairs of the university for us . GRANDMOTHER I hope you both spoke affectionately . PEYTON Well , Peyton , very busy I take it . You 're adding to your duties , are n't you ? ROOT Not that I know of . PEYTON Your grandmother said something about a high falutin paper on free speech . p. 13 ROOT I suppose that 's an inherited tendency . You know one of my ancestors signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falutin name : " The Declaration of Independence " ! MRS . ROOT I wish Bessie would come ! PEYTON Do you think much about your ancestors , Peyton ? ROOT Not a great deal . PEYTON Peyton has some rather interesting ancestors , Miss Mason . There 's Captain John Peyton . That 's his picture . He helped win one of the battles which made this country possible  --  the country in which you are living . And a descendant of John Peyton  --  Richard Peyton Points out the picturegave the money which founded this university  --  the university in which you are now acquiring your education . JHANSI Lightly . Perhaps it would be quite as well if this university  --  and this country  --  never had existed . MRS . ROOT I do n't see why Bessie does n't come ! JHANSI Of course I look at it as an outsider . I am not a part of your society . PEYTON Peyton is . MRS . ROOT There 's Bessie ! Bessie rushes in. p. 14 BESSIE Grandmother ! Swiftly kissing her . How wonderful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEYTON Glad you got here , Bessie . Your mother has been looking for you . BESSIE A movement of greeting to JHANSI . Is n't it beautiful to all be together ? A real family party ! And now  --  we have a moment or two before dinner , mother ? MRS . ROOT The man who brought the turkey in from the country had a runaway , so it was a little late in arriving . BESSIE How fortunate ! Oh , it does seem that all things work together for the best . Mother , I have had a completely successful day ! GRANDMOTHER Where 've you been , Bessie ? BESSIE I 've been fifty miles to the north  --  in Baxter County . Does that mean anything to you , Jhansi ? JHANSI Not a thing . BESSIE Still breathlessly . Dear uncle , I hope you will understand what I am about to do . It might seem unrestrained  --  not in the best of taste , but it 's just because you stand for so much in Peyton 's life that I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ourselves . You knew that these two children were in love and going to be married . A bow from UNCLE GEORGE . You know  --  Jhansi dear , I may speak very freely , may I not ? p. 15 JHANSI I believe in free speech . BESSIE Yes  --  how dear of you . Jhansi has endured in proud silence a great grief . And now , dear child , because of the touching dignity with which you have stood outside and alone , it is a moment of special joyfulness to me when I can say  --  Welcome Within ! ROOT What are you talking about , Bessie ? BESSIE You must not stand outside society ! You belong within the gates . You are one of us ! JHANSI I 'm not BESSIE Dear child you are as respectable as we are . JHANSI Rising . I am not . BESSIE Of course , you ca n't grasp it in an instant . But I have looked it all up , dear . I have the proofs . ROOT Well it was n't your affair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love my brother . Jhansi dear , As one who tells tremendous good newsyour father was Henry Harrison , a milkman in the town of Sunny Center  --  an honorable and respected man . Your parents were married in the Baptist Church ! p. 16 JHANSI I deny it ! I deny this charge ! BESSIE Stepping to the hall . Dear Senator and MRS . Byrd , will you come now ? Enter STATE SENATOR BYRD and MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD , MRS . BYRD carrying a large book . BESSIE Jhansi dear , you are about to enter upon the happiest moment of your life , for State Senator Byrd , one of our law-making body , is a cousin of your dear dead mother . BYRD Aggie 's little girl ! He goes to JHANSI with outstretched hands . But AGGIE 'S little girl stands like a rock . BESSIE And here , Jhansi , is your cousin MRS . Byrd , who has come all this way to assure you you have a family . MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD Indeed you have ! There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . She 's your first cousin . We are second cousins . You may have some little family pride in knowing that I was last spring elected President of the Federated Clubs of Baxter County . Just last week I entertained the officers of all the clubs at our home  --  our new home , erected last year after your cousin Ephraim completed his first term in the upper house of the State Legislature . Your cousin Ephraim has been re-elected . He is on the Ways and Means Committee . p. 17 PEYTON Approaching SENATOR BYRD . I have heard of Senator Ephraim Byrd of the Ways and Means Committee . That was good work you fellows  --  They talk of this . MRS . ROOT And to think , Jhansi , that your cousin MRS . Byrd is a prominent clubwoman ! GRANDMOTHER After a look at JHANSI . Her cup runneth over . MRS . ROOT Is n't Bessie wonderful , mother ? How did you find it all out , Bessie ? BESSIE From clue to clue I worked my way to Sunny Center . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this for Jhansi . And so , I heard of an old minister who had been there years and years . I went to him and  --  he had married Jhansi 's father and mother ! Dearest child , your mother taught in his Sunday-School ! BYRD Oh , yes , Aggie loved the Baptist Sunday-School ! JHANSI It 's very strange that my mother  --  I am referring to MRS . Mason  --  never told me of this ! BESSIE But she never told you you were a gypsy , either , did she ? No ; she just wanted you to think you were their own child . And then I suppose you heard some foolish tale at school . p. 18 MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD You see Jhansi 's mother and father  --  her real ones  --  died of typhoid fever before she was two years old . They got it from the cows . Well , the Harrisons were friends of the Mason 's  --  they all worked together in the church  --  and so they took Jhansi , and soon after that they moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a busy world it is  --  particularly for people who have duties in their community . JHANSI I have n't accepted this story ! You ca n't prove it ! MRS . BYRD impressively hands her husband the book . BYRD " Iowa descendants of New England families . " MRS . ROOT Oh , yes ; that is one of the books in which our family is written up ! To PEYTON . My dearest boy , from my heart I congratulate you ! BYRD Pages fifty-seven to sixty-one  --  inclusive , are devoted , Jhansi , to our family . MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD My own family appears on page 113 . SENATOR BYRD holds the book out to JHANSI , who once more stands like a rock . UNCLE GEORGE steps forward to look at the book . PEYTON Oh , you are a descendant of Peter Byrd. p. 19 BYRD One of those dare-devils whose leg was shot under him at Bull Run . BESSIE You heard that , Jhansi ? MRS . ROOT A descendant of Peter Byrd !  --  whose leg was shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought here for , is it ? To have my character torn down  --  to ruin my reputation and threaten my integrity by seeking to muzzle me with a leg at Bull Run and set me down in the Baptist Sunday-School in a milk-wagon ! I see the purpose of it all . I understand the hostile motive behind all this  --  but I tell you it 's a lie . Something here Hand on hearttells me I am not respectable ! PEYTON Reaction . JHANSI I am Jhansi  --  Jhansi  --  a child of the gypsies ! I am a wanderer ! I am an outlaw ! MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD Yes , you are Jhansi . And did you ever stop to think how you came by that outlandish name ? JHANSI It has always assured me of my birthright . MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD Well , you 'd better look in your geography . You were named after a town in India where your mother 's missionary circle was helping to support a missionary . p. 20 BYRD Aggie was crazy about the missionaries . JHANSI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our engagement . ROOT No . N-o ; do n't do that . Stoutly . I love you for yourself alone  --  in spite of anything that may be true . But I must say Bessie  --  ! JHANSI Beginning to sob . I ca n't bear it . I ca n't bear it ! And to think that Peyton 's mother was an illegitimate child . MRS . ROOT Dazed . What 's that ? GRANDMOTHER Rising . Yes ; what is that ? MRS . ROOT Am I to understand  --  ? GRANDMOTHER Am I to be told  --  at my age  --  that I gave birth to an illegitimate child ? This is a surprise to me  --  and not a pleasant one ! ROOT To JHANSI . It would have been better not to have mentioned that . PEYTON This is reaction . I think perhaps we need a physician . JHANSI I do n't need a physician . Peyton certainly told me that his mother was an illegitimate child . Of course , Peyton , if you were just boasting about your family  --  say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peyton ? GRANDMOTHER Before he says anything , Bessie , you bring me that portfolio from the lower right-hand corner of my desk . Key in the upper left hand pigeon hole . Bessie goes . MRS . ROOT Peyton ! ROOT Why I did n't mean any harm , mother . I certainly did n't mean anything against you , or grandmother . Quite the contrary . I was just anxious that Jhansi should have a little respect for our family . It did n't seem to have a leg to stand on . JHANSI So you made it up  --  out of whole cloth ? ROOT No , not out of whole cloth . GRANDMOTHER Out of what cloth , then ? Kindly tell me , out of what cloth ? MRS . ROOT Peyton is not himself . ROOT Well , it just came into my head that it was possible . You see , grandmother , your having moved  --  I do wish you could see that I meant nothing against your character . Absolutely the contrary . But your having moved  --  GRANDMOTHER My having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State to Ohio at just that time  --  p. 22 GRANDMOTHER I always did like to travel . Is that anything against a person 's character ? ROOT I was claiming that you had character . GRANDMOTHER I 'll stick to my own , thank you . I 've had it quite a while and am used to it . But I 'd like to know right now what there is so immoral in moving from one state to another  --  even if you are going to have a baby ? JHANSI Raising her head . There is nothing immoral in anything . GRANDMOTHER Fiddlesticks . BESSIE hands her the folio . You found it , Bessie ? The key ? Here , Peyton ; come here . Opens portfolio , takes out a rolled paper . Happily preserved for this defense of my character in my old age , is my wedding certificate . MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD This is painful . With ostentatious tact she turns and looks at a print on the rear wall ; motions SENATOR BYRD to join her . GRANDMOTHER I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupid  --  cherub , perhaps it is  --  anyway , read aloud the figures you see . ROOT Sullenly. 1869. p. 23 GRANDMOTHER And here , in this other document , very fortunately at hand to meet the attacks of my only grandson upon my integrity , what do you read there ? ROOT Clara  --  aged six weeks . GRANDMOTHER And the date ? MRS . ROOT , BESSIE , UNCLE GEORGE , all listen a little anxiously . ROOT December , 1871 . A sigh of relief . GRANDMOTHER I trust now , Peyton , you will admit that a woman may move from one state to another without being dissolute . At this word MRS . ROOT is unable to bear more and hides her face in her handkerchief . PEYTON As one saving the situation . Genealogy is interesting . One is democratic , of course , but when there is behind one what there is behind us , Senator , it enhances one 's powers  --  responsibility  --  obligation . He has taken up the book and been running through the pages . Descendants of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ancestors . Read them . Perhaps then instead of tearing down you will have an impulse to build up . I commend this book to you young people for study . It will do you no harm to think a little of those worthy men from whom you come . Marks the place with a card and gives the book to PEYTON. p. 24 JHANSI Springing up . I shall waste no time thinking of the worthy men from whom I come ! If I am related to a law-maker  --  I owe it to my soul to become a law-breaker ! MRS . ROOT You see , Bessie , what you have done . JHANSI When I thought there was in me no taint of civilization , I could put up with your silly conventions , but if in a material sense I am part of your society , then I have a spiritual obligation to fulfil in leaving it ! Peyton , respectability threatens to wall us in and stifle us . Are you ready to walk from this house with me tonight , entering upon a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ? ROOT Why  --  certainly . MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD Well , if it comes to a matter of not caring to claim relationship , we certainly hesitated some time . Those Harrisons were not all they should be . JHANSI A note of hope in her voice . No ? MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD I said to Senator Byrd , now that the girl is marrying into one of the best families in the state  --  not that that influenced us especially , but I said , if she is trying to make something of herself , we must stand by her , and we will mention only pleasant things . We will not allude to what her grandfather did ! p. 25 JHANSI What did he do ? BYRD He burned down his neighbor 's house because that neighbor chased home his pigs . JHANSI Really ? Yes !  --  my grandfather would do that ! ROOT Were any of the family found in the charred remains ? BYRD The family , I believe , escaped . MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD But no thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure grandfather meant them to burn . Seizing book . I wonder if grandfather 's protest is recorded in this book ! MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD That book does not emphasize unfortunate occurrences . MRS . ROOT And how right it is ! One should think only of the good in human nature . ROOT Looking with JHANSI . What is this fine print at the bottom of the page ? MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD Hastily . That is not important . BYRD It is in fine print because it is not important . ROOT One of the descendants of Peter Byrd . To JHANSI . The leg at Bull Run , you know . He  --  p. 26 MRS . ROOT Peyton , remember that you are in your own house . ROOT " Unfaithful to the high office of treasurer of the Baxter County Cemetery Association . " JHANSI Gasping , then beaming . Why  --  why !  --  a grave robber ! Was he a near relative ? MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD I must say , Miss Root , that we did not come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient history ! MRS . ROOT No , MRS . Byrd , I quite agree with you that it is not necessary to go too far back in any family . GRANDMOTHER Neither necessary nor desirable . BESSIE Those early days must have been very trying . ROOT Jhansi ! The fine print of your family is thrilling . Here is a man  --  MRS . ROOT Peyton , stop reading from that tiresome and obsolete book . It is not hospitable . MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD Turn to your own family history and read a little fine print in it ! The other members of the PEYTON-ROOT family give each other startled , nervous glances . p. 27 ROOT Why what a lovely idea . Uncle has marked it for us . After looking . Fine print in our family ? MRS . STATE SENATOR BYRD It 's there . BESSIE Genealogy is so confusing . I never could understand it . MRS . ROOT And I do n't see why one should try to understand it . Live well in the present  --  that is sufficient . GRANDMOTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully edited . I 'm surprised it has sold . ROOT Snatching book from JHANSI . Jhansi ! do n't want to boast ! I hope I shall not become a snob . You too have a family  --  and they had their impulsive moments  --  but what was the most largely low-down thing a man of early days could do ? PEYTONS and ROOTS draw together anxiously ; the BYRDS wait complacently . As uncle has pointed out , Jhansi , I am a descendant of Captain John Peyton . But when you have a remote ancestor , you also have his less remote descendants  --  a fact sometimes overlooked . Well , Stuart Peyton  --  BESSIE Mother , I wonder if the turkey is n't ready now ? MRS . ROOT It 's time for it to be ready . She hurries out . p. 28 ROOT Stuart Peyton  --  " convicted of selling whiskey and firearms to the Indians . " Assumes an overbearing attitude . MRS .

ROOT Holding book out to UNCLE GEORGE . In thinking of these worthy men from whom I come ? Turns to the wall on which hang portraits of John and Richard Peyton . We do n't seem to have Stuart 's picture . Jhansi , I do n't know that we need to leave society . There seems little  --  crevices in these walls of respectability . p. 29 JHANSI And whenever we feel a bit stifled we can always find air through our family trees ! MRS .
