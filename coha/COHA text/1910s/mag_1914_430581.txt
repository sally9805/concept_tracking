THERE are countries on the map in which a woman 's attractiveness is measured by the pound ? the more there is of her , the better ? t the United States is not one of them . . As the rage for slimness grows apace , with apparently no limit in sight , the number , audacity , and unadulterated foolishness of the alleged obesity-cures and flesh-reducers keeps step with the demand . Some are merely picturesque and amusing ; some are dangerous ; all are misleading , and no little ingenuity is shown in presenting simple old-time frauds under new names and new auspices , with marvelous scientific explanations as to how they do the work , and new assurances of harmlessness and effectiveness . There is a strong conviction among substantial folk to the effect that if you want to change a condition , you must discover its cause and remove that . Why is one person fat and another thin ? Often the thinnest man eats the most . Many factors enter into the problem . Your nervous , high-strung , worrying woman will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , optimistic friend stores up as fat . The amount of exercise and food taken ? whether the tendency is to eat starchy , sweet foods or to choose lean meats , fruits , and vegetables  | ? and variations in completeness of digestion and assimilation all enter into the problem ; but these matters have no terrors for the vendor of a cure-all . Our whole mental and physical make-up and our habits of life , our nerves , our organs , and our ancestors , in mysterious conclave , decide whether we are to be fat or thin . And into this awe-inspiring assembly the advertised fat-reducer steps jauntily , with a cathartic in one hand and a washing-soda bath-powder in the other , turns loose much language , and guarantees to circumvent all untoward conditions . And thousands listen , and lose their money ? but not their superfluous fat . One feature of the advertising is particularly amusing , and shows a keen knowledge of human nature if not of physiology . Recognizing the discouraging effect it would have on sales to ask the jolly fat person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and all , in unanimous chorus , assure you that nothing of the sort is necessary . The modern proprietary medicinevendor puts no limitations upon his curealls ; the mistaken habits of life are to be enjoyed as before ? immunity is secured by taking the pill or powder offered . Let 's take a look at some of them ? a close look through the chemist 's eyes and see what all this talk is about . Some of the Fakes Consider " Get Slim , " introduced by one Jean Downs , of New York City . Our curiosity is roused to the highest pitch by being told all the things this remedy is not . It is not a medicine , not a laxative ; it is positively not injurious , no perspiring bath is necessary ( though the Get Slim bath-mixture will help ) , no dieting , no exercising --  " No change in your mode of living is required . " It is a pleasant , healthful drink , made from a combination of fruits ; it reduced , said Jean , eighteen pounds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain of mystery a bit at the corner , we are told in a burst of confidence that Jean has " made pies of every one of its ingredients . " We refused to guess ; we asked the chemist . " Citric acid , sugar , and a little pink dye , probably cochineal , " came back the answer . Pink lemonade has always been associated with side-shows and fat ladies ? and here it is again . Now , lemon juice is well enough , among other things , in combatting fat-forming tendencies , but if you take it " in any quantity , at any time , " as advised , there is apt to be trouble . And furthermore , citric acid artificially prepared is thought by many to have a very different effect from pure lemon juice . Long-continued overdosing with acids can not but derange the digestion . One correspondent wrote that symptoms of " great weakness , severe headache , and loss of control of muscles of the tongue " had followed a severe regime of dieting and taking copious drafts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless ; what could the matter be ? Plainly it was a case of acidosis ( acid intoxication ) , due to the accumulation of acid products in the body , acquired faster than they could be eliminated , and the patient became ill as well as slim ? a , result often following extreme measures , though they involve only taking too much of the harmless ingredients found in mother 's pies . You can in-tox-i-cate ( that means poison ) yourself with many foods and drugs besides alcohol , by using them improperly . You get a twelve days ' supply of this dyed citric acid for $r.00 . It is hard to figure out this , because " there is no prescribed dose , " but we would back a dozen lemons at thirty-five cents against this amount of " Get Slim . " Take one lemon a day in water , diet and exercise , and save the balance . The dye and the sugar are n't worth such a sum , and the circular is misleading , if not dangerous . A very elaborate and alluring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for seven dollars . Again you do not stint yourself in any way as to food , drink , or laziness . You just give up seven dollars , and " permanent slenderness " is yours . We looked into it . This is a threebarreled cure . It is rather pretentious , and having been betrayed by simplicity , we turned to the graceful pictures of Miss Kimball 's slender form with hope in our eyes . We sent the pink tablets , the brown tablets , and the powder to the test-tube man , and awaited his answer with bated breath . He seemed rather bored ; it did not strike him as being " distinctive and new , " as claimed , but rather old and commonplace . The brown tablet proved to be a timehonored cathartic of the aloin type ; the pink pills were a tonic and stomachic , consisting principally of red pepper , menthol , and bitter principles , probably from gentian  | or quassia . But the pith of the joke is the powder , consisting of soap , magnesium sulphate ( plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( familiarly known as washing-soda ) ? in other words , a strongly alkaline powder for cleansing the skin and opening the pores . It could have no more effect in " dissolving fat " and " reducing weight " than if it were applied to the floor . In fact , a really vigorous housecleaning session with a scrubbing-brush would be much more effective as a fleshreducer than spreading this paste on the body . The continuous physicking would produce the results , if any , in this case ; washing-soda and epsom salts externally applied will not dissolve fat so that it can be carried off by the liver , as is solemnly affirmed . The famous Marjorie Hamilton Quadruple Combination , discussed by the American Medical Association long since , and selling for from $15 to SI , according to how long you held off , was a similar type of fraud , Glauber 's salts and saltpeter being added to make the combination a " foursome . " Lured on by the promise that no purging , dieting , or drugging enter into the treatment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long walks , exercises , no liquids at meals , no white bread , pastry , or potatoes , and the application of the powder twice a day are all prescribed . Such a life might well take off a little flesh , but the quadruple alkaline bath-powder would have nothing to do with the case ? except to provide something definite to hand over in exchange for the money received . So attractive is this idea of simply " dissolving " the fat by external applications that bath-powders are widely sold with no pretense to any other treatment . We are at a loss to understand on what grounds this idea rests , or how the rumor ever started that alkalis could be absorbed through the skin and would dissolve fatty tissues . Long ago the melancholy Dane  | exclaimed , " 0 , that this too , too solid flesh would melt ! " ? This is all that we can find in song or story bearing on the subject . The desire seems to be the only foundation for the belief . There is not a gleam of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep-seated processes of assimilation and katabolism ? they can not be modified by smearing epsom salts and washing-soda on the skin or by putting them in the bath . Long-continued hot baths , by sweating and the general debilitating effect , might reduce weight a little , but the addition of alkalis to the water could not do so . The only real reason for the use of these salts is their cheapness and the ignorance of the buyer . Washing-soda at two pounds for five cents and epsom salts at a cent and a half a pound offer tempting profits when resold at a dollar a pound , or from S15 to $7 " a treatment . " Consider the following : Sel AmaigrissantClark 's ( Thinning-salts ) . Crystallized sodium carbonate ( i. e. , purified washing-soda ) . " Why be burdened with fat when Clark 's thinning-salts can help you reduce without special diet ? " " Sole manufacturers in this country for the celebrated French thinning-salts . " Sold for thirty cents a box ! Ten cents would cover the cost of production at the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a corrosive caustic that might dry out and make harsh the surface of the skin , but could not reach adipose tissue . Every Woman 's Flesh-Reducer . Epsom salts , washing-soda , camphor , and aluminum sulphate . The alum and the camphor intensify the drying and drawing effect on the skin , and add a little to the cost . Sells for eighty-nine cents a pound ; cost , at a liberal estimate , not more than ten cents , varying with the proportion of the different ingredients . Louisenbad Reduction-Salt . One dollar for a pound . Plain magnesium sulphate , worth a cent and a half . " These baths do not affect the heart or complexion . " This is true ; but when it comes to " toning the whole body , " we are unable to see it . This is another " remedy for obesity , without the use of drugs , diet , or exercise . " The useful lemon is again recommended to assist the bath in dissolving fat , and is the only effective part of the treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concentration of bath-salts such as are contained in the wonderful bath-springs of Europe , and that you are thus " bringing these famous baths to your own tub ! " " The solution of the salt is absorbed through the pores of the body , and then by going through the blood , acts upon the superfluous fat . " Intelligent epsom salts ! And marvelously active pores ! Just how much of one 's bath is absorbed by the body ? The thing is so absurd that it can not be seriously denied . And again we hear the siren plea , " You need not starve yourself , you need not . . . tire yourself with the exertion and monotony of physical exercises , you need not inconvenience yourself in any way , only use Louisenbad Reduction-Salt . " No , and if you have common sense , you need not pay a dollar for two cents ' worth of epsom salts , and work your imagination and patience overtime trying to believe that you are dissolving fatty tissue in a royal European bath ! Nikola . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace of salt was all that could be found to justify its claims to being a compound . Not content with " reducing flesh " and " making the skin like velvet , " it is announced that it is " recommended by leading physicians here and abroad as a preventive of gout , rheumatism , kidney trouble , and all forms of skin disease . " Audacity could go no farther than this . And yet we are assured that " with every post , letters of praise arrive . " What an unappreciated haven of refuge the soda-box is , to be sure -- a veritable medicine-chest , wasting its wonderful powers on the desert air of the kitchen ! All of this comes under the head of foolishness ; no harm done probably , but a fool and his money parted and his fat left intact ? though he may be " skinned " a little , literally as well as figuratively . There is a class of obesity-treatments , however , that is dangerous , depending , as they do , on the action of thyroid for their effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses it with the greatest caution . Its effects vary widely in different cases . The dosage must be carefully controlled ; it does reduce flesh in some special cases , and in others it does not ; and it destroys not only fatty tissues , but protein as well , so that the patient 's health and diet must be carefully watched . These little details do not worry the man with a cure-all , however . Humility is  | not among his kit of tools . He conceals the dangerous drug under a fancy name , such as Marmola , Rengo , or Kellogg 's Safe hatReducer , and urges it upon all who would get thin , regardless of the perils in volved The car thartic is even present and after an exposure of the dangers of giving thyroid in this miscellaneous way , it w a s dropped from the composition of at least one of these preparations ( Marmola ) , which continued , however , to make the same extreme claims ? including the loss of " a pound a d a y in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascara , which remained . Do n't believe anyone who tells you that you can reduce your weight with no injury to your health without dieting , exercise , and right living . If you want to take lemon juice , get it from the lemon ; do n't take it , dyed , out of a paper envelope . Rest assured that a manipulated lemon and a dose of physic is all you get for your money in most cases , and if you get more it is apt to be harmful . Do n't try to wash away your fat ? fat is not soluble in an alkaline bath . What shall you do , then ? Cut down the amounts of starchy foods and sweets ; increase the amounts of fruits , especially acid fruits , and succulent vegetables ( lettuce , spinach , string beans , tomatoes , etc. ) ; eat fowl and fish and lean meats ; avoid alcoholic drinks which stimulate the appetite and the diges tive apparatus ; and drink sparingly even of waterButter , cream , and other fats are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food slowly , keeping up the bully of food eaten , but de-creasing creasing the amount of nutrition by gradually substituting the less concentrated and less nutritious foods for the heavier ones . It is not necessary to starve . Supplement this treatment with exercise and cold baths , using laxative fruits in abundance ( apples , oranges , lemons , figs , prunes ) , and saline purges cautiously , if necessary . Not so attractive , perhaps , as doing just as you please and taking something out of a bottle , but much healthier and more satisfying in the end . Our legs are in a fair way to atrophy and drop off if the motor and " rush " and " lack of time " continue to relegate walking to a place among the lost arts . Overeating and under-exercising are the main causes of too much fat . Remove the causes , and keep them removed . If you are not willing to do this , accept the fat and be jolly about it , and enjoy yourself ; but do n't spoil your digestion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised obesity-cures . Better alive , fat and jolly , than svelte ? and dead !  |
