The uncertainty which still enwraps the technical right , under international law , to bombard from the sea unfortified coast towns is seen in the war dispatches . From Berlin on Saturday it was stated that , while the German Government feels that it is " entitled " to shell undefended towns , there is a difference of opinion about it in the Navy . Some officers think it is not to the honor of the fleet ; more believe that it is a mistaken policy . The net impression is that raids like last week 's upon the English coast will be repeated , if occasion offers . They certainly will not be headed off by the angry words which Winston Churchill , of the British Admiralty , applies to them . His attitude will , if anything , encourage the Germans to keep on raiding . And they may point out that , while he waspishly denounces the action of the German cruisers , he does not say that English warships will not do the same thing , if they get a chance . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on record against the German practice . In the instructions of the British delegates to the Hague Congress of 1907 we read . " The Government consider that the objection , on humanitarian grounds , to the bombardment of unfortified towns is too strong to justify a resort to that measure , even though it may be permissible under the abstract doctrines of international law . " This was a clear departure from the view held and proclaimed by the British Admiralty earlier . In the naval manoeuvres of 1888 , the " enemy squadron " was supposed to ravage the coast of Scotland . It was reported as destroying Greenock , " blowing down " Adrossan , and " shelling the fine marine residences and watering-places in the Vale of the Clyde . " Instant protest against such practices was made by T. E. Holland , professor of international law at Oxford . In a letter to the London Times he denounced ' them as " Naval Atrocities , " and declared it a most urgent question whether the British Navy was to be allowed to think that it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once provoked counter-protests from naval officers . One of them wrote to the Times that , in a great war , " not the slightest respect would be paid to old-fashioned treaties , protocols , or other diplomatic documents . " Here was the English version of the scrap of paper , Capt James of the fleet begged to inform Professor Holland that " the talk about international law is all nonsense . " These were only individualopinions . But a committee of admirals was appointed to report , among other questions , on " the feasibility and expediency of cruisers making raids on an enemy 's coasts and unprotected towns for the purpose of levying contributions . " Their conclusion was that " there can be no doubt about the feasibility of such operations " ; that they would surely be attempted by " any Power at war with Great Britain " ; and that " we know of no means more efficacious for raaking an enemy feel the pinch of war . " All these facts are set forth in Professor Holland 's " Letters on War and Neutrality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . His position in the matter of naval bombardment of unfortified towns was that International law did not prohibit it , but did restrict it . filItd he raised his voice most humanely and eloquently against the supposition that , because the rules of naval war , narrowly interpreted , might permit the doing of barbarous deeds , therefore barbarous deeds could be both done and exulted in . Professor Holland uttered one warning which comes home with special force at the present time . He affirmed that England ought to be told to what risks her seaboard towns might be exposed in time of war , and pointed out the folly of allowing , in " mimic warfare , " " any course of action which could be cited ' against us in case we should ever have to complain of similar action on the part of a real enemy . " To what purpose recall these things today ? For the purpose of pointing out that the " war party " in all countries is essentially the same . It has existed in Great Britain and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all it has had the same characteristics . reckoning everything in terms of powder and shot : impatience at restraint by any " sentimental " considerations ; eagerness to be always ready to " strike , " and to strike first ; a constant desire to make a whole people think night and day of preparations for war and conquest . But in our own country and , measurably , in England it has been held in abeyance . Compulsory military service has not been tolerated . The plans of war experts , who , if they had their way , would compel us to maintain a garrison in the planet Jupiter , and to sail battleships along the Milky Way , have been kept under control . To obey the law and ta live in peace has been thought better policy than to snap one 's fingers at treaties and plunge into war . The British Government has not been exempt from rash counsels by heady men whose thoughts are all of war . It has been stated on good authority that Winston Churchill was anxious to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was declared , but that the Cabinet - sat down hard on him . There are always preachers of might and ruthlessness . Every nation has its gospellers of blood and iron . But the nation that strives to keep its civilization unpoisoned will not ask what can be done , but what ought to be done , and even in war will have a decent respect for the opinion of mankind . THE WAR AND " ECONOMIC EXHAUS-TION . " The absence of any sensational readjustment in the world of investment capital , at a time when the temporary borrowings of the belligerent European states are being replaced by long-term war loans of wholly unprecedented magnitude , has been a subject of much comment . The entire episode is providing a new and remarkable study in economics an the grand scale  --  not less so , when so few of the seemingly unavoidable immediate economic consequences are happening as had been expected . Germany on September 19 offered a war loan of $1,100 , - 000,000 . It was offered at 971/2 , and bore interest of 5 per cent. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it is remembered how relatively high a rate the Empire has lately had to pay for loans , even in time of peace . It was oversubscribed in Germany . Dr. Helfferich , of the Deutsche Bank , in a monograph on this loan declared that " there is no parallel in history for our war loan , and it will be no easy matter for any country on the globe to equal it . " The Imperial loan was , in fact , greater by $275,000,000 than the famous French indemnity loan of 1872 , previously the largest single operation of the kind on record ; and the German loan was subscribed in Germany alone , whereas the whole financial world had a hand in the loan of 1872 . But the British Government 's answer to the Berlin bank director 's challenge was the successful offer , on November 17 , of a loan for $1,750,000,000 , or more than half as large again as the German operation The interest rate was 31/2 per cent . and the price 95 , which yielded the investor not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at present prices . And we are beginning to hear of another huge loan by Germany . That this huge displacement of capital , present and prospective , does not more seriously upset the investment market generally has been a matter of great surprise The immense facilities for credit established in all European markets under Government auspices , when the war broke out , explain this to some extent . No doubt , the real effects will be felt much later on  --  perhaps when the present facilities of " emergency credit " begin to be withdrawn . Possibly , also , it may be said that a successful billion-dollar or twobillion-dollar war loan , at a time when suspension of trade activity has released immense supplies of capital , is no more remarkable than the " flotation " of the billion-dollar Steel Corporation in 1901 , when promotion and investment were on a scale of feverish activity . But as the war goes on , the providing of the fifty-odd million dollars daily for the expenses of the combatants is sure to develop new and interesting precedents in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some light on the favorite theory of " economic exhaustion " as a result of war . Nothing can be more convincingly reasoned out as an inevitable consequence , yet nothing is harder to prove by historical precedent . We can , in fact , recall but one instance in the great wars of the past two centuries in which a combatant had to lay down its arms because of such exhaustion . But the Southern Confederacy of 1865 was in a position where the supplies of its armies were literally cut off by superior forces . Lee had lost access to his own country 's farms and storehouses . It was no longer a question even of money or credit , but of food . It must be frankly admitted that the present war is creating situations new to history , in this regard as in others . With Germany or France , for example , it is a case of withdrawing from production , for an indefinite period , the greater part of the able-bodied male citizenship , and turning them into consumers . And in Germany this happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside producing world . What is to be the end of that process ? The question is not , as with the Confederacy , what will happen to the army , but what will happen to the nation . It is doubtful if the question has ever been really tested in our time . Prof. Roland G. Usher , in the December Atlantic , has an ingenious theory . It is , that every German not in the ranks has been catalogued in advance by the Government , and is shifted by governmental mandate from one selected field of industry to another ; that production and consumption , supply and demand , are regulated by edict . Even the money supply , Professor Usher tells us , is of no consequence , because " paper credits " could be offered on security of " a great variety of credit values , " and " there would be plenty of real value because there would be plenty of work ; the Government would see to that . " These measures " seem to conform accurately to the experience of history . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact or planning by no citation of authority , clearly makes out on his own account something like a case for war as a blessing to industry , trade , finance , and credit . We are ourselves inclined to cling to the old and pretty thoroughly tested conception of war as an instrument purely of economic havoc . The confusing , in his argument , of drastic expedients to stave off instant ruin with expedients to establish orderly and permanent prosperity , is too plain to be mistaken . We doubt if even the General Staff has assumed quite as much as Professor Usher . A rather generally accepted German authority on the war problem begins his discussion of its economic aspects by admitting that the argument for economic breakdown , under the strain of maintaining armies on the present scale , has strong prima facie grounds . The result would be averted , he imagines , by releasing part of the fighting force , from time to time , for home production . That actual economic strength could be derived as a consequence of the war , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where both sides were inspired with equally strong moral purpose , success would come presumably to the belligerent " who can hold out financially longest . " On questions such as this , it will require courage for outsiders to dissent from the above remarks of Gen. von Bernhardt . UNHAPPY POLAND . The Partition of Poland , a century and a half ago , was long the favorite example , for American orators , of a great international crime . And until within a couple of decades , the interest of our people in Poland remained largely rhetorical and literary . Not till the Polish emigration to the United States assumed large proportions did we begin to think in a more vital way of the actual Poland of the present day . This feeling for a contemporary , breathing Polish people has , of course , been greatly quickened by the European war , yet even now it may be doubted if Americans have anything like an adequate realization of the unhappy plight of the Polish provinces of Russia , Austria , and Prussia . They are , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Few of us stop to reflect how the tide of battle has swept back and forth over the fields and towns of Russian Poland and of Galicia , with all the widespread suffering and destruction and horror which this has caused . We think of East Prussia as German , and set down the Russian invasion of it as a blow mainly felt at Berlin ; but the province contains a large Polish population , and it is of a sort in general not able to flee before the Cossacks , and so most exposed to the miseries of war . Indeed , those can not be far wrong who assert that the Poles are as fully deserving of commiseration as the Belgians . More than five hundred towns , chiefly occupied by Poles , are reported to have been destroyed in the course of the fighting which has surged back and forth . The distress of thousands of helpless civilians has so impressed their compatriots and sympathizing friends in this city that a Polish Relief Committee has been organized , with headquarters at 105 West 40th Street , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need which it is designed to meet is unquestionably great and piteous . One of the ghastly tragedies of the war is the way in which compulsory military service has forced Poles to fight against Poles . There are great numbers of them in the Russian army ; and perhaps as many more in the ranks of the Austrians and the Germans They have all , so far as known , done their military duty ; but it must add a bitterness to death for them to know that it is their own blood kindred whom they are , in many cases , compelled to fight . International law no longer permits a conqueror , like Napoleon , to force the troops of a beaten army to take service under his banner and possibly to lead them against their own countrymen . But virtually such a fate has befallen the Poles this year ; the far-off consequences of the breaking up and partition of their ancient kingdom having been to set them in unnatural battle array against each other . But what of Polish hopes growing out of the war ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close may see a reunited and autonomous , if not independent , Poland ? Up to the present , all that the Poles have to go upon is vague promises . Their friendship and support have been actively competed for . It was before the end of August that the Russian Grand Duke issued his manifesto and appeal His language to the Poles was that " the hour has struck " for fulfilling the " holy dream of your fathers . " " Let the boundaries cutting asunder the Polish people be effaced : let them unite under the sceptre of the Czar . " Under that sceptre Poland was to be born again , " free in religion , language , and self-government . " This was well fitted to stir Polish enthusiasm , but , after all , was there anything in it more solid and sure than in the proclamation of the German commanding general , von Morgen ? He caused it to be posted in the parts of Russian Poland invaded by German arms : " Arise and drive away with me those Russian barbarians who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , which shall now regain her political and religious liberty . This is the will of my mighty and gracious King . " No wonder that the Poles have doubted both these advances , and have been quietly organizing a new party which takes as its watchword , " We do not want to hear of Russia or of Austria or Germany . " We want only one thing  --  the Polish state without guardianship from Any side . " Georg Brandes , in the Day , declares that this is a political , impossibility . It is no time , in his opinion , to begin shouting PoIonia farce da 0 , That Poland should be able of herself to attain her freedom he holds to be out of the question . This may be so ; and yet when the final settlement is made after the war , the case of the Poles will plainly demand special consideration . The wonderful way in which , for a hundred and fifty years , though no longer a nation , they have kept alive their intense national spirit , refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again of their hopes in the midst even of the devastation which the war has brought upon them  --  all this must be allowed weight . If the war is to end in a brighter day for small nationalities , the just demands of Poland can not be wholly overlooked . THE RATE DECISION . Opinions still differ concerning the exact scope and effect of the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission , on Friday , in the matter of the petition of the railways to be allowed to establish higher freight charges . More time will doubtless be needed to balance detail against detail , and to arrive at an accurate estimate of what the result will mean to the railways in dollars and cents . It appears to be safe to say at once , however ? that the contentions of the roads have been virtually admitted by the Commission . It concedes theforce of their arguments , and does not seriously question their statistics and the inferences from them . They asked , roughly , for a 5 per cent . increase in freight rates , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities and certain routes , or combina tions of routes , of traffic . But the latter must have been expected . The net result is , we doubt not , as full a compliance on the part of the Commission with the reasonable requests of the railways as ? sensible railway managers could at any time have counted upon . And it should not be forgotten that a sound judgment of the decision will take into consideration more than the actual amount of increased railway revenue that may follow . This is important ; in some cases it may prove to be absolutely vital . Yet we believe that the few millions , more or less , which will soon be placed in the treasury of the companies , will not signify so much to their officers as will other aspects of the decision . The money to be had is one thing ; the moral effect of receiving permission to obtain the money is another and a larger thing . It is confidently to be expected that the credit as well as the income of the railways will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlarge equipment and spend more on maintenance , it is probable that they can now do so without such general recourse to short-term notes , at high rates of interest , as has lately been common . With more funds in sight , and with railway credit placed upon a broader and more secure basis  --  not the least part of it being the restored public confidence which We are almost sure to witness  --  it would seem that not alone the business which comes to the railways , but the business which comes from them , ought soon to wear brighter promise than for a long time back . In all these aspects of the matter , we may well look upon this decision as something like a landmark in railway finance . Upon the immediate effects of the rate decision , the attention of both the railways and the public will be for the time being fixed . This is inevitable , and it is proper . The Commission , itself was bound to pass upon the merits of the railway case as that stood at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the endeavor to foresee every consequence and to guard against every possible mischief , would have been unwise . We ca n't be always wondering what lies on the other side of the hill . A present emergency has to be met by the best light of the present , with the ultimates left to be dealt with as they arise . It was apparently in this spirit that the majority of the Interstate Commerce Commission acted . And the general approval which their decision has received , and , in our opinion , deserved , will only be heightened by a consideration of some of its indirect and far-reaching results . For one thing , we think it will go a long way towards raising the Interstate Commerce Commission itself in public esteem . There is no denying that it has been - out of favor for a long time back . Complaints about it have been as thick as blackberries . Nor have all of these been wanton . The most friendly critics have been compelled to protest againnst the Commission 's delays . If these have resulted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge to another form of dissatisfaction with the Commission . It has been described as a grab-all . It wants to inquire into everything , so it has been said , and to meddle with everything . Then there has been much outcry about its mixing up of functions . These are partly judicial , partly legislative . Latterly , it has employed a kind of prosecuting counsel , making it a sort of tribunal unknown elsewhere in the world . So the bitter argument has run , but we shall hear less of it for a time . The Commission has shown that it can be both prompt and fair in a case of great importance . Its personnel and its work will be less evil entreated . In a still broader way , one effect of the decision will be to make the people more hopeful about the whole question of government regulation of railways . It was a fateful experiment upon which this country entered with the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission . With its ups and downs we are not , here concerned . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its duties have not always seemed to be clear . But all along it at least represented an effort to bring a great public activity within a reasonable public control . And from that original purpose the country has not been swayed either by abuse of the Commission or by the appeals of Mr. Bryan and others to leave it behind as an outworn instrument and proceed to the ownership and operation of railways by the Government itself . Against so rash a flying to ills that we know not of , this latest decision by the Commission should be an added preventive . Americans will not believe that regulation is " played out . " In this exercise of the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission they will see proof of fairness to all the parties in interest , and of flexible adaptability to the changing needs of both railways and the public . ODDS AND ENDS ABOUT INCOMES . The main facts brought out by the returns of the income tax concerning the number of American incomes falling between specified limits were made public nearly two months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revenue , now before us in full , we look rather for gleanings that gratify or pique curiosity than for the broader facts that throw light on the distribution of wealth . However , there are some points that have interest , and which it may be worth while to mention . Of the fifty-two political divisions listed ? the forty-eight States , the District of Columbia , Alaska , Hawaii , and Porto Rico  --  there are thirty-six which show no individual incomes in the highest classification , while the remaining sixteen do show such incomes , ranging in number from 1 to 82 . The highest classification in the tables is , however , not that of incomes exceeding $1,000,000 , but of incomes exceeding $500,000 . The Government does state the total number of persons declaring incomes above $1 , - 000,000 , the aggregate of these-in the whole country being 44 ; a point that gave rise to much discussion and conjecture when first announced . But as to the incomes above $500,000 we now learn that one each is to be found in California , Delaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Maryland , New Jersey , and Rhode Island ; three each in Connecticut , Massachusetts , Missouri , and Ohio ; six in Michigan ; eleven in Pennsylvania ; thirteen in Illinois , and eighty-two in New York . Thus it appears that none of these big incomes are to be found in " the Solid South , " the only ones in what are generally thought of as Southern States being the two in Maryland and the three in Missouri , and that , exclusive of Minnesota and Missouri , there is , in the whole vast region west of the Mississippi River , only one solitary income of the kind , namely , the one in California . That of the whole array of the biggest incomes , 135 in number , as many as eighty-two ? very nearly five-eighths  --  should be found in the State of New York is not surprising . But it seems a little strange that Massachusetts should show only three , the same as Connecticut ; and even more strange that there should be only one more in Massachusetts , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its traditional great wealth , than in Maryland , with 1,300,000 inhabitants , no considerable city except Baltimore , and a level of wealth . apparently far below that of Massachusetts . The case of New Jersey might be thought even more surprising , were it not for the fact that the great army of Jersey commuters whose place of business is in this city were required to report from this city , the instructions erecting that returns be made from the individual 's " principal place of business . " But a study of the figures , going beyond these mere surface facts of the highest classification , and considering the lower classifications and the amounts collected , might bring out some very interesting peculiarities . And to what extent these peculiarities reflect the facts of wealth or income , and to what extent they turn on questions of conscientiousness in making returns , is an inquiry that might prove to justify careful examination . It is the desire of the Government to give no information as to the income-return of any particular person . But there are , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting game in this regard . One is reminded of the story of a Roman cardinal who , in a distinguished social gathering , was telling of his early experiences as a simple priest . His very first penitent , he said , confessed a murder to him . Presently there entered a great nobleman , who greeted the Cardinal with great entpressement , saying that he had remembered through all these years that he had been the first penitent the Cardinal had received . When the Government tells us that there is just one man in ' Vermont , say , or Delaware , who returns an income of over $500,000 ; and when , upon another page , we find the total receipts in that State from the 6 per cent . supertax on incomes above $500,000 , it is apt to be a pretty easy guess who the man is , and it is not at all a guess , but a certainty , what income he reported for taxation . And even the zeros , perforce , tell a tale not less interesting . Wherever there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able to say with certainty that this man or that man , supposed to be enormously wealthy , did not acknowledge an income of that magnitude Further than this , deponents say not ; but there is evidently here plenty of meat , both for the " Sunday " feature writer and for the solemn young worker for a Ph.D . The former might look up lists of multimillionaires , and point out who 's who  --  and still more who ought to be who  --  in the various States . And the latter , running his eye over the tables , would soon find his pencil itching to plot curves of correspondence between income and illiteracy , or what not , which , if they did not point a moral , might at least help to adorn a thesis .
