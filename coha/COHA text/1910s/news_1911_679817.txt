txt Officers of the Gas Workers ' Union , with power granted to them by a referendum vote to call out on strike at their discretion the 32,000 employes of the thirteen gas companies supplying New York City , sent out yesterday what in union labor circles is referred to as " the second conference call . " The call was addressed to George B. Cortelyou , President of the Consolidated Gas Company , which controls the thirteen companies . It reminded Mr. Cortelyou that he had ignored the first communication addressed to him and that the workingmen had waited a reasonable time to have their communication considered . It suggested that this second communication be considered at an early date . So far as could be learned , there is no intention on the part of Mr. Cortelyou to enter into correspondence with the committee purporting to represent his employes . At his office yesterday it was said that he was indisposed and had not reported for the day . At the office of the American Federation of Labor , 230 Fourth Avenue , General Organizer Wyatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting certain grievances before him on Nov. 20 , and was still waiting for an answer . " And not only that ? ' he said , " but I have been so certain that we could adjust this whole matter if once we could get into conference with a chance to talk things over that I have called up Mr. Cortelyou on the telephone many times . I have given my name each time to the Secretary , but have never been connected with Mr. Cortelyou 's office , nor has be called up when I have left my number and my name , in the hope that we could get on speaking terms . I dread such a strike as this that is surely coming , unless grievances are taken up , and the responsibility of handling the grievances , which the men feel keenly and with growing impatience , is a heavy one . No leader on earth can keep them at work more than a little while longer under the continued stubbornness of Mr. Cortelyou . " A suggestion was made that a strike involving the shutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard blow at the city 's poor and would be one that no citizen would be likely to forget fur many years . I know all that . " said Mr. Wyatt , " and that 's the only reason I am not announcing to you that a strike is on . beginning to-day , instead of announcing that a second appeal is being made to Mr. Cortelyou . " ' And if this appeal is ignored ? " " , Well , .  - -  then , we 'll send a third , perhaps , or maybe we will appeal to a number of representative citizens to hear our grievances and pass judgment upon them and to say as fair-minded men whether or not the door to the company 's office should be locked against us . Personally , I want to postpone the strike until every straw to cling to has been snapped off . " The crisis in the gasmaking industry has been growing for four months . The trouble started in the east side offices of the gas company . Their nett/ who attend to " complaints " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to adjust before noon . The rule was that no carfare should be furnished to the workers In this department unless the complaint required them to travel more than twenty blocks . The men allege that the company devised a way of getting around the carfare rule . altogether by handing each man a package of complaint cards , the first one of which would be nineteen blocks away -- -just within the twenty-block limit  --  and the rest would be outside of it . They contend that under the construction of the rule they obtain no carefare in such cases , and are sometimes compelled to carry on their backs over these long routes kits of tools and spare parts and coils of pipe weighing often from 50 to 100 pounds . Another complaint In which many of the men seemed to take special interest Is ' hat , in spite of rules under which they should obtain fairly high pay , they are constantly being " graded down " to lower rates . This is done , they say , by dismissing the high-grade men In one gas plant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , so that now men who have been making $3 a day are graded down to $2 a day and 51.75 a day . A somewhat similar complaint Is that when a man is discharged , often with no explanation as to cause . he is forced to work a day without wages at the new plant to which he applies " to show what he can do . " The men contend that this rule is an unnecessary cruelty , since the gas company coeld easily find out from its own records what quality of work the applicant has been doing . An appeal to the workers under the title of " The Season 's Greetings " was sent out yesterday from the Executive Committee , in whose hands the power to call the strike has been put . It tells how to join the union secretly , and warns those who do so that the company wilt strike them from the rolls if it finds them out . It is signed by Henry Kane , President of the Gas Workers ' Union No. 14,140 , and Cal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here are some of the points it emphasizes : The gas company aims to suppress the movement toward life and liberty : and also to prevent the employes from In any way sharing the enormous profits that are now pouring into its coffers . It promised to increase pay . to reduce hours in every class of labor and grant increased pay for overtime . low has it kept these promises ? Already it has fallen down on the agreement as to overtime . The gas company has hired thugs to keep the men who are promoting the Gas Workers ' Union from entering the works or even speaking to the employes . The company has commanded that the foreigners go before a priest and take oath that they do not and will not belong to a union . Are you a man or are you a slave ? If you are a man get busy and use your personal effort with every man with whom you work . No battle brig ever been won ex- ? cept through sacrifice : no capitalist ever got his money through honest labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lowest possible price . Of a group of strike organizers at a meeting in the American Federation of Labor 's headquarters yesterday afternoon six out of seven present had lost their places with the gas company because , as they allege , they were caught advocating that a union be formed . When asked for the reason the company gave they said it was " lack of work , . ' but that they knew this to be false , as other men took their places . They gave it as their belief that the company has decided upon a settled policy of " smashing the union " at any price , and that the issue will fail of peaceable settlement and become a finish fight for advantage . They refused to say how many of the 32,000 men in the gasmaking industry are in their union or how many they believe they can bring out on strike . The union . they said , is a new-style one for this city , in which all the men are brought together in a single organization , including the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indexers , the gasmakers. and the firemen . The gas company , it was learned from some workers who are not avowed union men . has offered to treat with employes as individuals and consider all grievances on their merits without meeting walking delegates as intermediaries .
