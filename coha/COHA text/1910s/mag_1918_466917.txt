NE of the most onerous forms of selfrestraint to the average American has been that which has had to do with food . How insistent we have been upon just what we wanted to eat ! How far out of our way we would go for pleasures of palate ! And how much we despised a dictated diet ! Men with the wisdom of seventy years submitted hardly more gracefully to suddenly imposed food restrictions , prompted , perhaps , by highest medical authority , than the American child who is denied dessert . There always has been food . Our supply has been of such variety and quantity that apples could rot and bread grow stale , yet there would be more to take their ? places , with cider and bread pudding , besides . Plenty to eat , plenty to drink ? it has been a happy time . One used to hear of how many pounds of beefsteak a certain man could eat at one meal . To be a large eater was to uphold tradition . Sometimes I think that the country would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war had not been preceded by this surfeit ? this boasting about the amount of food consumed , or rushing pell-mell to get it , strutting with weight , incessantly talking . about it and paying for it dearly ? a national worship of the smack of things ? and then had not suddenly turned to the other extreme , in which the food consumption of every man , woman , and child became a matter of national concern ? a frank , unselfish recognition of the principle that we must all cut down or even go without . The real awakening of the public to the actuality of the food problem dated from the moment American boys landed in France . The land still flowed with milk and honey , but when American troops began to move , an empty place appeared at the dinner-tables of the nation . Saying food for him seemed not only logical , but necessary , andprompted by the love of the family . Then carrying out the entire food program fur the sake of those who were fighting with him was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every progression in the food propaganda was a trial of the spirit , a test of how far we could reverse our ingrained attitude toward food and be content . Whoever heretofore would have thought of believing a shopkeeper when he held out something different from that asked for , and said , blandly , " Just as good " ? We believe , now , that some of the substitutes are just as good , that they contain all the vital properties of the more " fancy " article ; that others look exactly like the pre-war staple and will do ; and in still other cases we accept an entirely new line of food as a substitute . To adapt these changes to the family 's way of cooking and eating requires new skill . It is a game to produce the best from the materials available . Cooks vie with one another . The good Americans on the next block have dinners from war recipes , the ingredients of which I defy any one to name upon sight or taste of the finished product . The roasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious nuts and roots . ' The greens are familiar only in their greenness . The sugarless desserts have the flavor of the Orient , with honey and syrup and the bouquet of honeysuckle . War conservation has sent out many a culinary and epicurean explorer whose findings may never be lost when normal times come . Who can tell but that there are certain greens upon which corn-oil , peanut-oil , or even cotton-seedoil , exert an exotic influence bringing out a zest which olive-oil only seared ? So far the domestic oils seem only lubricators , but enough . . . the war must be won ! It must be won on oleomargarine , too , if necessary . " Oleo " before the war DINNER-TABLES was considered in disgrace , a poor , cheap , thin , good-for-nothing that nobody wanted . It has been spruced up , raised in price , and made popular , having taken on the final stage of complete rehabilitation , a change of name to appellations of aristocracy . At first , the household admitted that it seemed wiser to use " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " oleo " was placed on the dining-table by mistake , and the most fastidious member of the family ate plentifully of it , remarking that at Last the cook had obtained some good butter . And as Mrs. Jenkens , " who has been on the parlor floor for ten years , " said , before everybody , " As long as I have been assured that it comes from a cow , although not from the milk-producing part , it does very well . Although , of course , it never would have been served on the Jenkenses ' table where there was only country food . " What a difference between the attitudes of city and country toward food , and , consequently , toward food control . City people have eyes forever larger than their stomachs . They imagine tables loaded with fatness , always seeking , seldom finding ; for they eat " portions " of things , pieces doled out trimmed of all fragments . They are perpetually ready for more . Country families are surrounded by eatables , great piles of sameness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems , indeed , as if nature gave up nothing but green peas for weeks , or nothing but sweet corn for another spell , with long weeks of pork and pumpkins in the winter . If there is any time when a man 's hunger is tempered , it is when he is surfeited by the sight of the things . I do not say for a moment that the country man does not consume a larger quantity of food , but he certainly appraises it differently . He knows nothing of the pleasurable sensation of ordering a portion of fish and having it served with a cucumber relish , unannounced and gratis . Nor of the anticipation j when forced to hay just enough green vegetables " to serve six people " once , or perhaps twice , around . Exhalation to appreciate flavor in a tidbit is bosh to him , for he sniffs bushels and barrels of his garden truck when it is picked at sunrise , gets a decided whiff at dinnertime when he hangs his blue jumper on the kitchen wall , and finally makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's main dish . When war-time called for conservation and abstinence , country persons were in a mental condition exactly described by a latter-day poet . " No sugar ! It is inconceivable . We have always has sugar . " So have they always had white bread and cake ! Recently it was gray , and the good housekeepers were sad . Bread and cake that were off color were a disgrace to family traditions and unfit provender for weddings , funerals , and christenings , which , in spite of war , must have at least a little ceremonial cooking . Then there were the caravans of city persons , domestic scientists , who came to the slumbering villages , claiming to have the latest knowledge about canning and preserving , which they desired to impart to housekeepers who had stayed at home , making no pretense of other professions for generations . There was actual strife in one canning-kitchen , set up with sincere patriotic intention , between the home and visiting elements . When the " city people " were present , the others retired , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cooking . " Who 'd ever heerd . A thermometer ! My grandmother never used no thermometer to tell when her beans was cooked , and I guess I ai n't likely to come to being that dumb , neither ! " said one of the village housekeepers . It was due , no doubt , to country isolation that rural people sometimes thought they were the only group made to live up to the letter of the food regulations . For one thing , the difference in prices of some commodities incited such a presumption . Bananas , for instance , could be procured in the cities for twenty cents a dozen , and a penny each on the carts , while the country price rose to sixty cents . There was always some malicious wayfarer who came to town telling the great advantages in prices elsewhere ; and then traveled on , relating the marvelous conditions in the place he had just visited . Let us consider now the city 's reaction to self-governing food control . The city had its traditions to uphold . Business , pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , but upon different degrees and quantities of food . A fig For the sugar and wheat consumed for afternoon tea in the country ! A reversal of long custom , high comfort , business income ? the whole social cycle of a certain ring ? occurred when sugar and wheat were shut out of afternoon tea or four-o'clock coffee in cities . " No little cakes ! But , monsieur , we have always had little cakes with our tea . Impossible ! " " Oui , madame , but we are not allowed . Sorry . Will madame have something else ? some graham toast or icecream , maybe ? " How autocratic city persons have been ! They ordered the menu , an overloaded thing , and expected it carried out . And they were no less merciless of themselves , if the mistress were the cook with an apron tied over her dinner dress , and a tea-wagon for a waitress . A dinner had to meet the prescribed standards of long progression . Times have changed . Salad and dessert now are interchangeable ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no meat ; or only when there is no soup may the dessert be heavy . Intuition in adapting ingredients ? in other words , being a " born cook " ? helped the feminized tea-rooms to work out the food regulations with facility . These tidbit places are so numerous in this country now that , as one American recently remarked , " You step on them . " A pair of white curtains , a peacock or a kettle on a swinging sign , and you have a tea-room . If it were not for their everlastingly warped ideas of the size of a piece of pie , one might fear for the fate of the eating-houses that men call " regular places . " Nevertheless , the intimate , small shops have a hold and their quick adoption of war foods in their most palatable form won customers . Tea-rooms managed somehow to continue to manufacture their incomparable scones and white breads and still avoid using any wheat . Like rare house wives , their proprietors told no man that he was about to consume delicious cake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake first . It has become necessary to change the ingredients of a " perfect dish , " which was made in restaurant quantities to serve a thousand people and cooked in sections that would mature at midmorning and at every successive hour during the day ; so that it would taste the same as if the substitutions on account of war-time regulations had not been made . Anybody who has been the mistress or master of a fine home meal can appreciate something of the resultant state of mind of the restaurateurs and chefs . Restaurants capitalize flavor . " Johnny Duck 's , " on Long Island , is famous for the flavor of the ducks and their accompaniments . To go further , Long Island itself is known throughout a certain remote section of the country merely as a place where duck dinners abound . So to decree that there shall be less wheat , or none , possibly , in the ambrosial dressing within the cavernous ducks might mean the end of a perfect culinary career and commercial success . The situation had to be met scientifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question was , which would the public prefer ? higher prices and the same-sized portions , or less food and no changes in the established rates ? One course or the other had become necessary . The dear public was experimented upon . Here and there it arose to protest against smaller portions , and occasionally there was a murmur about the rise in prices . But business men soon found that there was no comparison between the deeply hurt feelings of the American public when served with less than a superabundance of food , and the slight sensation of having to pay a little more . To pay a high price and receive a liberal return ; that suited the big hungry eyes of the hard worker and cheerful spender . But to pay a medium price and receive a tidbit . Ah no ! Americans never stint when they have the money . No American man ever crossed Broadway with the intention of having a small good time . It is not his nature . After notice had been served upon the restaurants , the proprietors had to reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestations are concerned with food ? traditions , patriotism , religion ; loves , hates , greed and generosity ! A young man , prosperous and pleasant , came in with his best girl . " Lct us have a planked steak , rarer he said , proudly . This was the choicest , the most expensive dish in their cycle of menus . " Sorry , sir , but this is beefless day . Will you select something else ? " said the waiter . The young man frowned , and the servitor retreated , overcome by a scowling patron . In a moment he returned . " It is all right , sir . You may have it . " " Of course not ! " spoke up the American girl . " I could n't eat it . I like chicken better , anyway . Chicken , by all means . " The price of broiled chicken in this luxurious eating-place had been advanced , but the portions were as large and juicy as ever . Down in the sections of the city where money was more scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they ever were . But , alas ! the size of a dime 's worth had diminished . A slice of watermelon , compared with its forerunner before the war , was a mere sample . The bags of peanuts had shrunk to forlorn proportions . Two cents and three cents , the common tender of the old days , bought little when the picturesque portable ovens came around with their steaming green corn , baked apples , and cornucopias of boiled beans . The care of the grizzled venders in trying to observe the regulations was the glorification of the push-carts . The old men had an official air and an undercurrent of sincerity no less precious than the allegiance of the greatest chef . They belonged to the large company of underofficers of the great Hoover , commis-sioned to carry out his directions : The haughtiest subaltern of the Food Administration was serving on one bleak night at the counter in a railway station . Rich men , poor men , merchants , and chiefs were leaning on the rail , munching what Van . CXXXVIII. ? No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for therti . " Give me a ham sandwich and a cup of coffee , " sang out a banker in a hurry . The attendant was cold . He appeared not to understand a syllable of the order . " A ham sandwich and a . . . " began the customer again , only to be arrested by the fierceness of the look which spread over the countenance of the man behind the counter . Only chicken sandwiches were permissible that day . Chicken , chicken , chicken ! And his expression plainly said : " Poor imbecile ! Has n't your mother told you about the war ? ? It was a cruel weapon which the Federal authorities placed in the hands of waiters and Pullman dish-men , with which they could even more successfully cower and reform their humble servants , the hungry public . I take it from keen observation that not a corn muffin was served from New York to San Francisco but some dining-car dusky " angel " silently rejoiced over another sinner saved . Every little heavy muffin was proffered as an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , which long has been contending for the recognition of corn meal . Hear any Southern gentleman in New York tell how Northerners miss the delights of the true corn flavor because they do not know how to grind the kernels . Corn muffins are among the things that will have to he decided after the war ? whether they remain on sufferance in the North " valued for associations only , " or go south of Mason and Dixon 's line and stay there as the mascots of Southern cookery . Monarchical autocracy of waiters and shopkeepers was needed in this matter of persuading people to eat things they did not like . We have a national phenomenon of thousands of men and women who have grown up repeating that they " do n't like " this or that , although admitting that the food in question never had been tasted . " Ca n't eat , " " Do n't like , " and the old boardinghouse platitude , " I do n't eat thus and so , " are mainly psychological matters . In industries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war conditions made it necessary that he run his engine without gasolene . Bakers , for instance , were completely upset and put their chemists at work to study the problem of doing without wheat . Proprietors of delicatessen-shops were confronted with trying situations affecting mighty- things to them ? cold meats , sandwiches , and their hours of opening and closing . Anybody knows that half of the significance of a delicatessen is its traditional open-door at the time when all other food-shops are closed . Where are the delicatessens of yesteryear , the " automats " for lazy cooks ? Where the imported cheeses , all the old-country bolognas , and pale-gray and ruddy wursts ? Pickle-dishes and cans of tunny from the placid Pacific coast have taken their places . The Hohenzollern subjects mourn their loss and eat sausages from New England . Sunday night delicatessen supper , or " bag " supper , as East Side children often called it , has lost some of its flavors . In the old days before the war the top layer of the bag was covered with dessert of ice-cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The flavors have dwindled to vanilla and chocolate , with less sugar than ever . At the soda-fountains the little ice-cream towers of picturesque compositions , beginning with a banana and passing through five or six incarnations before the top cherry was reached , have been reduced in rank . Plain ice-cream itself has become neither ice nor cream , but a harsh substance , saponaceous and neutral , filled with particles like bits of broken glass placed there by the enemy . " What have we here ? " said a dignified old bachelor with a sweet tooth , as he slowly tasted his " sundx " minus the usual sweetness . " That 's the new rule of the Food Administration you 's biting into , Mr. Foggerty . They has changed hit again , " quickly answered Sambo , who has been serving at the " fountain " for years . Storekeepers sometimes had the impression that the rules were often changed . They made an adjustment , they said ; then came a revision almost directly after the original order . Some of them , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cringing housewives , allowed themselves to becoaxed into selling more wheat or more sugar , and then were caught redhanded . Dealers had more trouble with the sugar restrictions than with the regulation of any other commodity . Of course , the universal rule of wanting something unobtainable played its part ; nevertheless , the psychological effect of enforced abstinence was only tho culmination of a sugar lust . Gradually the country had been turning to sweets as substitutes for alcoholic drinks . Candy has been taking the place of whisky . Women experts , as well as manufacturers , experimented with other saccharine materials to pro-. duce sweets that would not offend against the sugar rules , and yet meet this demand . There is a great spirit of freedom and hilarious effrontery in American food signs . One wonders sometimes what the newly arrived foreigner really thinks about them . He sees an expanse of printing and color labeled , " Eat Corn Muffins and Win the War ! " ? to say nothing of the multitudinous tinned dinners , tomato catchup , and red-cheeked apples which Americans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , the foreigner knows little of America but that which he finds in the street . These signs which he sees while on his way to and from work to him are among the most obvious manifestations of American life . And we take it for granted that he will perceive that the true American spirit does not always take seriously some of the effusiveness of American advertising . Corn muffins will not win the war ; nor will spaghetti , chicken wings , chop suey , sauerkraut , or beer , with which foreigners are much more familiar . They have their tastes . We had ours . But they like their flavors better than we liked ours because we have borrowed with high satisfaction from the cookery of nearly every nation represented in the United States . Therefore , the advantage in food regulation was with Americans , for it was on home territory , where we had our old American ways to fall back upon if restrictions hampered our enjoyment of foreign foods . Foreigners had to accept our rules or go without . We take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of which has been clear to us . Thousands of the foreign-horn have accepted the gospel of food regulation merely upon faith in the word " America . " Many of them did not understand at all , and had few facilities for reversing their food customs . Yet they not only willingly complied with the material features of the requests , but attempted to adopt the spirit , at the same time retaining personal traditional memories . Cold mutton to an Englishman is a substantial symbol of a lifetime . The Irishman 's nose is keen for his pork and potatoes , and corned beef and cabbage . Just now there is a platter of home-made tomato paste sunning in the window of nearly every ? Italian tenement home . The Jewish people have their kosher chicken ; the Bohemians roast pork , sauerkraut , and dumplings ; Syrians their sweets and Americans a thick beefsteak with occasional side dishes from all the others . Our nature is to crave culinary adventures . Thus , in a small way , we show our heritage from many countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American food program as a potent factor in bringing about the ideal condition ? namely , " One flag , one language , one country .. . one food ! " As if this ever could be , except in some small absolute monarchy surrounded by a high wall ! Food regulation has been a great Americanizing agent , but its power has been not to condemn everybody who refused American beefsteak or Boston pork and beans , but to promote a spiritual unity in which every contributing group in American society made sacrifices for the same principle . Let us get down on the street . No more colorful and picturesque regime was ever instituted than this good regulation , affecting the home life of foreign-ers . The restrictions in the use of meat were a matter of no moment to the Jew , particularly to the orthodox Jew who never eats beefsteak or many of the other heavy meats . In fact , much of the food propaganda had to do with commodities unknown to foreign households . It seems hardly comprehensible that a Jewish family that had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what canned peas and string beans were , nor whether to eat them cold for dessert with sugar and milk or as a relish with vinegar . Many of the recipes of the food administration had to be translated into Yiddish by foreign experts , who also advised the administration regarding religious violations which the rules might entail . A Jewish mother buys no " seconds . " The food is of the best quality . She must have prime eggs , and then only the white-shelled ones . The higher prices restrict merely the quantity of her purchases to five cents ' worth of the best sweet butter , one egg , and a quarter of a pound of rice . One chicken wing , or a leg , is a common sale to the Jewish housewife . Due perhaps to the lack of household regularity , the neighborhood women were accustomed to trading at the grocer 's from early morning until nearly midnight . The regulations required thegrocers to close at eight o'clock , which was a blessing to neighborhood orderliness , and a physical relief to the shopkeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little grocer with his accounts chalked on the door , and a lift for every one who is down and out , is a bundle of philosophy . That a man can not pay seems to him no fault of his own ; and it never occurs to the proprietor to deny him what he needs . It was a hard day in the dark shop when the supply of rye bread with caraway seeds , the Jewish staple , began to feel the hand of the regulator , and customers wore a calamitous air . " Vy is there not no more bread ? Shall I tell you a hundred times already that they had to have it to yin the var ? Now vill you understand again ? " said the tired merchant , as he turned to put a limp salted fish on the scales for the next customer . There had been a tremendous change in the neighborhood within a year . It had been almost impossible to awaken an interest in substitutes and conservation . " We know how to feed our families , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiptoe with a desire for help . Their boys have gone away . Jewish mothers have formed organizations to promote food regulations with a spirit that has brought them into the sisterhood of many tongues with one message . When these women opened their hearts , those who came to them as missionaries of the Food Administration stepped back . No such economy and versatility as ordinarily practised in the foreign quarter had ever been heard of in the homes of the American women who went out to spread the new gospel . No lecture upon the discoveries in the garbage-can could apply to some foreign women , who know how to extract every particle of flavor from the very marrow in a bone . When the Italians received the conservation agents in their homes they showed the teachers new ways of using greens and salads , and the advantage of high flavoring . A light rub of garlic or a few dried mushrooms created an enticing aroma in the steaming pot . Their superb minestrone soup was a whole meal . Of course , their chief problem was due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $4 , coo , - coo worth a year . Washington sent out the new formula for wheat-conserving paste , and interpreters helped in making the adjustment . To cut down their meat consumption was little hardship , except , perhaps , to Italian laborers who swung the pickax . Italians are fond of small fish and , in lieu of sardines from their Sardinia , they have accepted those packed on our own coast and dressed with cotton-seed-oil instead of the incomparable olive-oil . Venders of Italian commodities held out this oil substitute with a hopeless look ; olive-oil had been indispensable . Down in the Armenian and Syrian quarter , Turks , Greeks , Armenians , and bands of roving gipsies are cramped into the low , overhanging brick buildings which were the real New York of a hundred years ago . A family of gipsies are sitting in a semicircle on the floor of a tenement , with fire in their eyes and gay laughter . The wrinkled hand of the cook stirs a great kettle filled with a traditional concoction . The room is flaming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , black hair , brassy eat-rings and bangles . The forest is there , and the crackling camp-fire near a brook ; the earth is soft and children are chasing the hares as they scamper across the encampment . But you and I do not see them . Our senses are not in tune with the overwhelming romance which makes the blue-painted , smirched , and chalked walls of a tumble-down building , sunless and airless , but a momentary displacement of the real , which is a camp home in the woods or on waysides . How prosaic to say " corn muffins ! " to these people ! And how wonderful for them to answer , " Ay , America , corn muffins ! " Ordinarily men and their families could live ten lives here without speaking or hearing the English language . The strings of food hung in the windows of strange streets are as queer to us as Damascus would be to a Rocky Mountain rail-splitter . How all this curious food ever got into the country , and kept coming year after year without being discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war , when the foreign populations were in a quandary as to how to obtain products from their old homes , manufactories were established in the United States to produce them . The Syrians , for instance , use a wheat food called kibbe as a staple diet . It was formerly made from Damascus wheat . A factory was obtained at Worcester , Massachusetts , where American wheat was cooked , dried , and then cracked to form the staple kernels used at nearly every meal . When the Syrian gentlemen talked about the Damascus wheat , no longer procurable , its flavor was reminiscently dear . " The large full grains have a greater sweetness and a more nutritious taste , " he said . To ask him to relinquish his memory of it would be equal to requesting New .. Englanders to banish thoughts of the gingerbread men , Thanksgiving Indian puddings , and pulled molasses candy . Syrians have such a sweet tooth that the regulations regarding sugar were a hardship , but they responded with a vim . Shipping restrictions imposed a complete change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods , as well as those of the Greeks , formerly had come from Europe . Olive-oil , nuts , flavors , fruits , kibbe , and lentils were constantly arriving . Syrians eat little beef , but think highly of these more delicate things , which seem almost like extras . Cornmeal before the war was as odd to them as their eternal chickpeas are to us . The most dramatic picture of the enforcement of the regulations lies in the heart of Chinatown . Sam Hop ? " he can no more do , " as one restaurant man said . No more " bamboo shoots extraordinary " ? No more honorable water chestnuts ? And Chinese mushrooms with dried oysters ? Some Chinese merchants have been forced to retire . The " august " War Trade Board has allowed so few of their staple commodities to come that there will soon hardly be a square meal left in Chinatown . A Chinese restaurant man , with the help of his son , who he says has a " big Merican head , " recently made out a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conservative and war-conditioned . The honorable board would allow but two items , the peanut-oil and the old tea , from the long list . Sam Hop says he caters to Americans ; they demand these things . Chinamen have been using little red mear , but mostly chicken and pork ; pork served as chicken , maybe , as well as suckling pig roasted supremely , a costly dish . So Chinatown had to do something to circumvent the American public . Proprietors decided to cut down the portions instead of increasing prices . The new ' policy they inaugurated one New-Year s night . All Chinatown remembers the American uproar . Therefore prices were increased , the servings left as usual , and night life under the lanterns was gay ! But there is gloom now . The reserve supply is about gone . Sam has turned himself almost inside out inventing substitutes ? flour made from water chestnuts and his own noodles made of rice flour for the chop suey . He appeared before the board with the startlingly pleasing information that he had cut . his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each cup of tea . He was told to make it one hereafter ; then , if complaints were made , to add molasses ! Molasses in a cup of tea celestial ! Chinamen had been importing their own sugar , in small brown cakes . The Food Administration commandeered it . Not being Orientals , they whacked and pounded the rocklike little cakes and , deciding that they had no use for them , they gave them back . Sam and the others thought it was a good joke . Foreign men and women have presented themselves to the food officials , answering summonses , who never had heard that a Food Administration existed ! In this class were some who otherwise might have been branded as enemy violators . In a sense , it was a man 's own fault if he did not know ; then , again , there were shopkeepers who labored , ate , and slept , seldom breaking the round . If there were alien enemies who hindered the Food Administration on genera ! principles , they were brought to notice by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ; and there were some sad undiscovered cases of good New England housewives who secretly filled their attics with forbidden food . . . their mouths with patriotic good English , and quaked only on Sunday when the preacher read that " stolen waters are sweet , and bread eaten in secret is pleasant " ? for him that wanteth understanding . And that Joseph became a food administrator who must be obeyed when he commandeered the surplus food in Egypt in the fat years to provide for the lean ones . It is unfair , however , to hold up to public view the half a dozen curmudgeons here and there , in the face of the overwhelming response to one of the greatest self-denials the country has made . Men and women , at extraordinary personal sacrifice , have given their services to the food work , and the results have shown it . When something is begun here , there is little question but that men will stand by and see it through . America has been aroused to a pitch that will go through fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive to-day to the work of the hour than any other country in the world , said a gentleman who has just completed a circumnavigator 's tour . But let us face the facts : Although we are composite , there is an overwhelming unity . And we have little of that geographical separation of dialect which makes such definite divisions in many countries . Every facility the country affords has been brought into play to spread the food gospel in the way that would bring it nearest home , emphasizing that it is not only for ourselves .
