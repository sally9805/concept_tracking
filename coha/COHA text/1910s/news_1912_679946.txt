txt After having passed a night in the Arizona penitentiary , I am convinced more than ever that such an experience was beneficial in enabling me to view prison life from the prisoners ' standpoint in some small measure , and I can recommend a trial of it to any public official whose duties require that he shall have intimate knowledge of such sociological principles as are of practical use in dealing with those whom Society has isolated in accordance with court decrees . To redate briefly the incidents that have remained in memory after my temporary incarceration . I was admitted to Cell 24 at 10 o'clock in the evening , and , in a few moments that were required in retiring , I became quite acquainted and also Interested in my cellmate , who was serving the latter part of a short term for burglary . It would be akin to a breach of confidence for me to repeat the substance of that conversation . Suffice it to say I round him very companionable and much like other men , not classed as convicts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my unusual surroundings , I slept soundly from about W:30 until 4 ocloc'k in the morning . As all the cells in the tiers are con nected by gratings , practically every sound in the great stone building was audible and doubtless some of those awoke me . I confess readily that in the dense darkness that preceded the dawn , the gloomy surroundings , the breathing of men in sleep , and the occasional clang of a door had a certain depressing effect that could hardly be dispelled by an effort of the will . Nevertheless . I was glad to experience it , for in del= so I was gaining that insight into prison life for which I had assumed my strange task . I was not sorry , however , when at five o'clock , the whistle blew , and served to bring MY prisoner friend tumbling out of his bunk on the opposite side of the cell . I turned out after him . We made our hasty toilet with the aid of the same wash basin , and when the 5:30 whistle blew , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell , which if it was not an ideal bedroom , was at least clean and sanitary . I fell down on prison discipline , however , during the next half hour . In forming in line to march to breakfast , I became separated from my cell mate and the man beside whom I found myself proved to be a life-termer . On the way to the dining hall I overheard some of the Metican prisoners say , with a nod of the head in my direction , " ' bueno patron , " which was interpreted by one of the guards as meaning " the good boss . " Although my prisoner companions in line were debarred from much speaking , the evident amusement and elation that my presence provided them was a very agreeable evidence that I was welcome In their midst . When we had taken our seats at the table , laden with prison fare , consisting of beans , hot bread , mush and black coffee , I was quite able to eat with relish , even though the food was more nutritous than appetizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in breach of discipline . One of the boys across the table from me had remarked in an undertone that a Governor had never eaten at those tables bfore , and I was replying in less guarded tones when one of the guards stepped up to me and tapped me on the shoulder with the admonishment : " Prisoners are not allowed to talk at meals . " Even the restraint of a prison atmosphere could not check the laugh that went around , and I had a feeling that " It was on me . " Such were the leading incidents of ny stay in prison , and while it would hardly be consistent in me as an Enlecutire to commend a period in a penitentiary to the public , yet I am sure that a voluntary term of a single night can harm nobody . It might , on the other hand , prove both interesting and instructive , and result in the advantage of knowing how It seems to ? toe In prison . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
