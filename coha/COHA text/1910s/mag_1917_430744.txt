A PARTY of young art students , one summer day , in the Scotch highlands , starting to descend a mountain , were cautioned to be quiet in their demeanor when they passed a man and a woman , seated alongside the path and sketching , about halfway down . The man was an English painter in water colors . The woman , his pupil , was Queen Victoria . The art of aquarelle , and an art of wide range it is , has , in fact , been cultivated for a much longer time and far more widely , abroad than here . In European countries , moreover , artists who take up water color devote themselves more exclusively to the medium than ours do . For with the latter it is apt to be a diversion , a side issue from their regular occupation of painting in oils . In Europe very many artists do water color and nothing else . Various large European art societies recognize this branch of art by having memberships " for water color . "  | Ignoring the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example ) are in water color , and accepting only what we understand as " color , " the so-called " tinted " drawings of the eighteenth century mark the early beginnings of the art . Even so , on the Continent , we could go back a century or two farther , if we were willing to accept tinted drawings that were made as studies or for the express purpose of being engraved . In any event , Europe has seen a regular development of the art , from the use of a single tint applied to part of a drawing for the purpose of heightening its effect , to the use of the full color scale . Therefore , it is not surprising to find museums abroad that can boast historical collections of water colors . How far back these go can be judged from the fact that J. M. W. Turner , who to our modern way of thinking seems almost like an old master , rounds off a period in aquarelle . We Americans can produce no such perspective , and if we have secured anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water color , it is due to the efforts of art-lovers who , realizing the charm of aquarelle , have made collections of water colors by American artists . Early American Water Colors In our comparatively brief art development the early illustrator , F. O. C. Darley , and the painters of the " Hudson River school , " like Casilear , Cropsey , McEntee , are " historic . " Their work , when found in a collection , always will form one of its interesting and important features . In fact , the work in water color of some men of that time in America is confined to a single specimen , and with most of them it was scant . A picture in aquarelle by one or another of them in some collection may have the added value of the unique . Indeed , to come down to a living man , the now famous Blakelock is said to have painted only one water color , " Going to the Ghost Dance . " Speaking in general terms , the distinction between oil and water  | pigments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Water color is a clear , sparkling medium of great charm . There are , however , opaque water pigments ? " body " colors ? like Chinese white . Among the diverse schools of aquarelle , one insists that the white surface of the paper shall come through for the highest lights , the other that these should be put in in white body color . Water color in " gouache " ( gwahsh ) consists in rendering all the pigments opaque by using with each a greater or less admixture of Chinese white . Each method has its staunch adherents and bitter opponents . But , in the end , its test lies in the results secured by the individual artist who practices it . It so happened that in November , 1916 , the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colors , for the first time since it was founded in the eighteenth century , exhibited , as a body , outside of its own galleries in London . This exhibition was held in the American Art Galleries , New York . John S. Sargent , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed a work to the exhibition . At the same time , the New York Water ColorClub was holding its exhibition . The show of the Royal Society , the Sargent picture in it , and the simultaneous exhibition of the Water Color Club , offered a capital opportunity to note the difference between the English and American method of aquarelle , and the difference between Sargent ? a unique figure ? and both . Elliott Daingerfield , a leading American artist , went over these differences with me , and their exposition is largely on his authority . English , Dutch and French Methods The English apply thin washes of color to dry paper . They superimpose wash on wash , almost never using opaque color , but quietly , gradually , and patiently building up their washes and then stippling the picture to a  | highly finished result , about which there is nothing impressionistic . That is the practice of water color which we associate with England , where it has been practised for many years . American water colorists have been interested in , and many have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dutch and the French . Water colors of the Dutch and French school are statements of first washes of color , not of washes superimposed , and they are painted on the spur of the moment . They are brilliant affairs , and the constant striving of the artist is to make the very wash itself a beautiful thing . To accomplish this , instead of painting on dry paper , like the English aquarellists , they soak their paper thoroughly , then allow a blotter to absorb the surplus water , and paint on the paper while still wet . The wash when it is applied to the wet paper is drawn into it and becomes , as it were , part of it , drying in and on it with a beautiful crispness . This gives brilliancy , dash and tone to the result . It was natural that Holland , with its moist climate , should seek for a moist effect in water color . To the efforts of Dutch artists to that end we owe the " tonal " water color of today , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as witness some of Mr. Henry B. Snell 's work , especially his ship , lately in the Alexander Humphreys collection , which is pushed as far as an oil painting could be . In this method , the paper being sopping wet , the colors sometimes are sponged in and out . And just as painters in oil will use cuttlefish bone to rub down parts of the painted surface in order to obtain desired effects , so , in the water color work of the Dutch and the French , the artist does not hesitate to use sandpaper to rub down the surface . He is working for quality . Whether he paints in wash , uses opaque color or even works entirely in gouache , is a matter of indifference to him , so long as he achieves the effect he is after . Look , for example , at  | the effective way Hopkinson Smith worked in gouache on gray paper . With white paper the Dutchman , as his paper begins to dry , lifts out the color here and there with a sponge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through with great brilliancy . Sargent apparently takes a dry paper , well ' stretched . So wizardlike is his skill in drawing that a few touches of his pencil suffice to place the subject . Then come clear , beautiful , transparent washes . He can accomplish a woman 's fair hand resting on the filmiest of robes in the fewest possible touches and with the simplest washes , so colossal is the brilliancy of his technical achievement in water color . I think he uses a thy surface . But he flows his washes with such skill and rapidity that they behave just as he wants them to . Three Great American Artists The development of the English school was one of many years . The English school has its traditions , to which it clings tenaciously . Even the Dutch and French methods were the result of evolution . But in America things happen suddenly ; and it was suddenly that there burst upon us the water colors of three American artists ? James McNeill Whistler , Winslow Homer , and John S. Sargent . The three are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water color was incidental , but of supreme beauty . Winslow Homer , one of the most ruthlessly powerful painters in oils that ever lived , fairly revelled in the brilliancy and fluency of the gentler medium , and the same is true of Sargent . Thus , as in many other things with us , there was no long and painful preparation and development toward a climax ; it came suddenly , at once . Before these men were born , let alone heard o ? , there was water color painting ( and good water color painting ) by American artists , But it occurred irregularly . There was no sequence in it , nothing that inclined toward special method or development . Some artist who had succeeded as an oil painter would amuse himself with some work in water color . Usually it  | turned out surprisingly well . But the American public lent itself , as it still lends itself chiefly to oils , so to oils the artist promptly returned . Indispensable in a collection of American water colors is an example by the most famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the more to be prized when found , because Whistler water colors are not numerous . One of his biographers , T. R. Way , says pertinently that , as is true of every medium he used , his work in water color bears the strong impress of his personality , and , slight as some of it appears to be , the " butterfly " signature is never really necessary as a means of identification . It is signed all ' over , and if in the case of any picture purporting to be a Whistler it is found necessary to look for the butterfly before all doubt is removed , it is quite certain that the work , if genuine , is not one of his masterpieces . The reference in Way 's comment to the butterfly refers to Whistler 's use of that graceful insect in place of a name signature to his works . It is a symbol of the extreme lightness and delicacy of his technique . The manner in which he usually " conventionalizes " this symbol indicates that it was suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the W ? not unlike wings in conformation ? and such , indeed , is said to have been its actual derivation . Not only is it not necessary in Whistler 's " Maud Reading in a Hammock , " to cite one of his aquarelles , to look for the butterfly , but in addition to its being there and beautifully placed , the little aquareile has the artist 's genius all over it ? from top to bottom , side to side . It is a picture of one of his favorite models , and the hammock is said to be swung on a balcony in Venice . The girl is reading . The thing is a mere " note , " a sketch , even a trifle , if you say so ? but how airy , even to the poise of the head with its concentrated thought on the book . A most deft and buoyant performance ! The hammock hangs still , but one senses that it would swing to and fro at a touch from the girl 's foot upon the floor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main splash of brown so placed as to throw out , in clear relief , the blond hair and the white of pillow and book page .  | The Art of Twachtman Exquisite is the work of John H. Twachtman . Most delicate and poetic interpretations of landscape , often his work seems a color poem , or only a dream ; and if but a dream , do you not feel , nevertheless , that it may come true at any bend of a road of a misty morning ? Vague , nebulous at first , the trees and bushes , the stretch of ground leading up , maybe , to a little house , the hills beyond gradually take shape , without obtruding themselves , through the infinitely delicate veil of atmosphere that hangs over the scene . Such a work by Twachtman is an evocation , a poem ; and , if you wish it so , a spring poem , lightly made captive in stanzas of palest rose , green and blue . It has been said of J. l'I . W. Turner , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his marvelous grasp of atmospheric subtleties , his infallible understanding of varieties of aerial effect , and his rare skill in representing the spaciousness of remote distances seen through a veil of misty air , could scarcely have been acquired so completely , great master as he was , without the full training of his powers of expression ; and that this was due to the large experience of nature in all her moods , which came to him as a result of ceaseless observation of the atmosphere of his native land . The same can be said of Twachtman , in whatever medium his work is executed . John La Farge The late John La Farge touched many phases of art . He designed and made stained glass windows , using common material like cheap iridescent glass soap dishes and other washstand accessories , which he bought up wherever he found them , and then had them broken up and ground into cylinder-shaped units , constructing from them most rich and beautiful effects ? all by reason of his own genius . He painted in oils , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Museum , produced one of the greatest pictures this country has to its credit . He  | made many memorandum drawings that would be of priceless value to any art teaching institution . And he painted exquisite water colors . A roamer in Japan and among the isles of the South Seas , La Farge appears to have found in the East his inspiration for the female figure reproduced here . This water color shows the wonderfully graceful figure of an Oriental looking young woman in landscape . Pose , drapery , coloring , are alike beautiful . Against blue sky and succulent green there is projected her long , red , clinging cloak ; below it is viewed a bit of white skirt , from which part of a foot protrudes . She is walking slowly forward , as the well managed turn of this visible foot indicates ; and the curvethe line of beauty ? is effected through the adaptation of the drapery to the inward trend of the left leg and the upward bend of the arm . A slight sheen of light on the very top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by " touching it off " attracts attention to the modest grace with which the head is poised . Edwin A. Abbey A typical Abbey , not typical , perhaps , to those who know him only from his large " Holy Grail " decorations on the walls of the Boston Public Library ? so different from this little water color ? but easy to recognize as his work by any one familiar with the illustrations of Edwin A. Abbey to Shakespeare and Herrick , is entitled " A Citizen of New Amsterdam " ? that is , of New York under Dutch rule . The burgher stands on a brick walk leading over a meadow toward the shore . One imagines it to be the lower end of Manhattan Island , now a platform for thirty and forty storied skyscrapers , but at that time a fringe of salt marsh . The man is looking beyond the shore , over the water . He appears to be searching the horizon for a sail ? a ship of his own , a galleon  | wherewith to swell his fortune . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other facial features , due to his drawing on the stem of a long white clay tobacco pipe . The figure is firmly placed , as if here were the accustomed point of vantage from which to look down toward the Narrows . A black hat with a protruding black feather crowns the head . The nose is long ; the face sharp and shrewd ? that of a man who will drive hard bargains with his expected cargo . Coat and knee breeches are a golden brown , the silk stockings the same , but set off with black garters . Ruffles and cuffs are white , a note repeated beyond the middle distance by the crests of tumbling waves . A capital work of a great llustrator . Abbey was one of a few American artists who , besides having been honored in their own country , were members of the Royal Academy . He was commissioned by Edward VII to paint the scene of his coronation in Westminster Abbey , and it is said that George V was desirous of having the artist paint his coronation as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former commission , he had been greatly vexed by the dilatoriness of many members of the nobility , who had to be in the picture , but who consulted their own leisure in coming to him for their posing . Winslow Homer By Winslow Homer , one of the greatest American artists , with whom water color was so favorite a medium that he chose to be represented entirely by it at the Pan-American Exposition , is a view of a woman wandering by the seashore and looking curiously down at a long strand of seaweed with its garner of shells and other sea-loot . Homer 's art was honest , forthright . So was his speech . I have read a letter by him that is too characteristic to miss . It is addressed from Scarboro , Maine , for many years his home , to Mr. Charles Eddy , at the time the editor of Truth .  | " My DEAR SIR : ? I thank you very much for the copies of Truth you have sent me . The article you suggest I have not the slightest interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain . Yours very truly , WINSLOW HOMER . " No doubt Homer had been asked regarding an article about himself , or illustrations for it . It was like him not to have " the slightest interest in it . " He lived remote , alone , on the Maine coast , where he wanted to be undisturbed and left to himself and his art . Yet this taciturn man was not wholly unmoved by events . I have a letter from him in which he states that he has " not worked any over the past year . " Inquiry revealed that the long break in his activity was due to depression of spirits caused by a fire that destroyed the familiar surroundings of his studio . One likes to think that , after all , the painter of , for example , " The Fox Hunt , " was so thoroughly human . The splendor of the blue sea , a strip of which reaches from side to side of the picture ? Childe Hassam 's " A Bit of New England Coast " ? makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical " Hassam " this ; and today a collection of American pictures must include a " Hassam " or be sadly incomplete . Time was when that many-sided genius , Hopkinson Smith , worked only in black and white and eloquently argued that this was the true manner of producing pictures , because no colors could rival those of Nature , which should be left to the imagination . Then this delightful man , whom many a time I heard promulgate this theory , discovered that he could paint in water colors and ? presto ! ? there was an almost audible silence on the subject of black and white being the only true art medium , and the authorartist promptly proceeded to knock his own former pet theory into a cocked hat by producing aquarelles ? and many of them ? in which the colors rivalled those of Nature ; as witness " Along a Dutch Canal , " a capital example of his work .  | F. S. Church is one of the few American artists in subjects that are poetic and fanciful , and whose " Witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky on a crescent moon , created a veritable sensation many years ago . Representative of his art is a girl and flamingo picture which he calls " The Tease . " There is a gentle , refined humor in much of his work that is a distinct addition to its charm . One might make a water color group of Morans ? Thomas , the patriarch of the clan , Percy , Leon and Edward . Thomas Moran 's work as a landscape painter in oil has been considered in The Mentor ( No. 26 ) . No consideration of American water color would be adequate without mention of the work of the celebrated landscape painter Wyant , of George H. Boughton , of George Wharton Edwards , of Rosina Emmet Sherwood , of Dora Wheeler Keith ? of a dozen or more others , of the whole array , in fact , and prominently such artists as Horatio Walker , T. W. Dewing , J. Alden Weir , Paul Dougherty , Colin Campbell Cooper ; Charles ? - oodbury , of Boston ; Sidney J. Yard and William Wendt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of lack of water colors of the highest standard with the work of such artists to choose from .  |
