While be admitted that an attack of grip had hastened his return by a few days , Mr. Ford said he had intended in any event to take a steamer which sailed a week later than the Bergensfjord , because his wife , his future peace plans , and his business demanded his presence here for a time at least .

" He wore a dark fur-trimmed coat and a derby hat . A twenty-five-foot ladder was raised from the upper deck of the cutter to the rail of the liner , and Mr. Ford clambered down to join his wife , who was on the Guide , outside the Calumet He posed once for the photographers , but when asked to talke about peace replied , " Too bad it is raining , but it be fine tomorrow .

But this attitude gave rise to such gloomy rumors about the reasons for his return , the fate of his expedition , and the condition of his health /hat he changed his mind . Once started , die talked freely . " - Only one thing bothers me in this whole affair , " he said . " My wife does n't like the criticism to which I have been subjected . My son holds a different view and does n't mind it . I like it ; I hope it wo n't stop . You know the best fertilizer in the world is ' weeds . " Mr. Ford smiled aryl turned to more serious things .

They have neglected to select the proper heads for their Governments  --  the men who would prevent such chaotic conditions . In the great majority of cases the people select their rulers and then are afraid of them . They do n't ? write enough letters to them and let them know their views . " Asked if he thought a republic was not a more advisable form of government than a monarchy , the pacifist replied : " Yes . I think that is so . But France is a republic , and it does n't elect the men who would prevent the nation . preparing for war . And you see where France is now . The trouble is that citizens do n't take enough , interest in the government . But so far as neglecting government is concerned , 3 am one of the worrst offenders .

But I find the people who do n't elect the right men are the ones to blame ; they should express their own minds . " Mr. Ford was asked if he had obtained expressions of sympathy with his peace movement from officials in the countries visited , and whether he had had successful relations with them . He replied that he had " seen others just as good . ' " If necessary I will go back , " he continued , " and , if it will help matters . I will charter another ship . I went to Europe ' to show that I was willing to give something more than money to the cause , and I will go again if it will do any good .

" As to his plans for the ' future , Mr. Ford said : " I have n't started in to work yet , but I do n't think it would be wise to tell you more . " " Do the newspapers think I am doing this for self-gratification or advertisement ? I feel that I am simply a custodian of the money I got together . The people who are being slaughtered helped me to get it , and what I have I ant willing to spend for them . Anyway , I think I feel that way . I have thought of it in every way . My business does n't need any advertising . " Mr. Ford said that the reports of seri our dissensions were not based on fact .

Mr. Ford contended that his peace expedition was not a ' one-man party , and that ho simply was backing up and financing the plans of the Women 's Peace Congress at The Hague . After the party reached Copenhagen . he said , the main part of it would return here , while the . delegates elected would go on to The Hague . The expedition , he said , was not a two or three month affair , hut a sustained effort which would continue until peace was obtained .
