txt A Tribute to Frances A. Graham . May an old scholar speak a few words In appreciation of Frances A. Graham , who died last sleek at the family home in Montgomery , N. T.7 For forty years Miss Graham was head mistress of the Graham School in this city . For many of these years this was the most notable boarding school of this region , and drew students from all over the Middle West . Wealthy and fashionable though were Its patrons , it hell them by no yielding to wealth or fashion . It held them by the sincere and strong personality of Miss Graham herself , and of the helpers she gathered around her . Stately in carriage , of old-time exactness in manner , no one who knew it ever forgets that dignified figure . Firm In purpose , unyielding in principle , she influenced three generations of women . Influenced them toward honest aims , steady endeavor , and conscientious work .
