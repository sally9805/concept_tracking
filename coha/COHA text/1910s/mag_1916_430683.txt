WILLS are one of those unmannerly subjects , like funerals and tombstones , which insist upon thrusting their grim heads into our lives at some time or other . In dealing with such visitors it is better to see them at your convenience than at theirs . Do n't wait until the doctor tells you that he hopes for the best , and you suddenly notice that your married daughter from Chicago is standing by your bedside , before you begin to think about a will . To be sure , you can make one then , but it 's pleasanter and the will is apt to be a better one if you make it now . Death-bed wills are like death-bed repentances : they are recognized , but not recommended . Of course the first question that comes up is , Why make a will at all ? Why spend money on a lawyer when the state makes a will for you and distributes your property if you die without leaving a will ? That is a fair question . Lawyers , like doctors , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money wasted on themalthough I 'm liable to be disbarred or executed for high treason if this article is ever read by a member of the bar . However , be that as it may , the money spent on a will is money well invested . Of course  | some of you may feel that , once safely dead , it does n't make any special difference to you what happens to your property ? you 're through with it . Now if there be any such selfish womankind , they belong to the same class in the community as the man who wo n't take out life insurance because he does n't care what happens after he dies . That is not a commendable attitude . It 's selfish enough to die anyway , without leaving your friends and relatives a lot of trouble and expense over your property . As to the state 's disposition of your property , most of us prefer to dispose of our own things in our own way . Moreover , there are also a number of specific reasons why women should always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die without one , the court has to appoint an administrator to take charge of your property . This may be some person entirely unknown to you or the last one whom you would have chosen personally . Well , it 's your own fault . Why did n't you choose for yourself ? You would n't allow the state to select your cook , or your stenographer , or even your husband . Yet you will calmly go ahead and die and let a court which does n't know you from Eve name the one who shall read over all your old love-letters and say who shall have your engagement ring , what shall be done with your clothes and how much your funeral shall cost , and pass on all the other intimate details of your life and death . There are heartburnings and bickerings enough even in the best-regulated families over the distribution of property without increasing the chances of dispute and bad feeling and possible litigation by failing to take the trouble to write down who shall have what . I know a brother and sister who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because their mother neglected to write down before her death who should have a certain mahogany dining-room table . So both on moral and sentimental grounds you should make a will . You should on material grounds , also . An administrator appointed by a court has to file a bond in double the amount of the value of the property of the estate . This bond costs money . This money comes out of the estate . An executor , as the person named in a will to take charge of the estate is called , does not have to file a bond . When a bond is filed , the estate must be administered with all possible formality and red tape , for the bondsmen will insist on this in order to be c ? charged from liability . A lawyer must retained , the estate advertised , appraises appointed , an inventory made and filed an account prepared , filed , and audited . and a decree entered discharging the administrator and releasing the bondsmen from further liability on their bond . Th : = means that surety-premiums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks ' fees , court costs , and attorneys ' fees must all be paid out of the estate . They make a pretty big hole in a small estate . For example , you die and leave a little account of one thousand dollars in a savings-bank and a will leaving it all to your sister . She can go over to the office of the register of wills , surrogate , or judge of probate , depending on the state in which you die , and probate the will . That means that the will is filed and copied in a will-book and that she is given a certified copy of it and letters testamentary , which state under the seal of the court that she has sworn to do her duty as an executrix and has been duly appointed as such by the court . Armed with that , she goes down to the savings-bank , draws out the money , pays all the bills , including the inheritance tax . and keeps the rest . That 's all there is to it . It has cost her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weeks . the time of the notice required to be given to the savings-bank . On the other hand , you carelessly and selfishly die , leaving no will . The court appoints an administrator or administratrix , after more or less w ; angling on the part of your relatives as to who shall act . The administrator does not care to ask any of his friends to go on his bond even if the court would take them . So he goes to a trust company and the fund is deposited with them as counter-indemnity for their bond , and all checks must be countersigned by them . The trust company charges twenty dollars a year premium on the bond . The appraisers are allowed perhaps ten dollars each . The court costs and charges amount to from twenty-five to thirty-five more . The advertising comes to about ten dollars , and the attorney who prepares and files the account and attends the audit is probably allowed a fee of fifty dollars . Altogether it 's a very scrawny and closeclipped estate which finally emerges from the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your relatives have to wait a year .  | and perhaps two , before they get their money , as no account can be filed until one year after the death of the decedent . The smaller the estate the more reason why a will should be made . As I write this , I am puzzling over how to distribute twenty-five dollars which a former servant left in a savings-bank . It will cost about twenty-six dollars to get it out and into the hands of her waiting relatives . Sometimes the failure to make a will involves more than a loss of time and money . You are a widow and die without a will , leaving children who are not vet of age . Now you may not care who looks after your property , but you do have a lively interest in the person who looks after your children . If you had left a will , you could have named therein the guardian for your children . You did n't . Now it 's too late . The court must do so , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and premiums payable out of your children 's share of your estate . You could easily have selected some one who you knew would have been fitted for the office and who would have fulfilled its duties as a labor of love . Suppose you leave real estate . It ca n't be sold without an order of the court . That involves a long and expensive proceeding on the part of your administrator . If you leave minor children , that stilt further complicates matters . A guardian must be appointed for them who must join in the application at a price ? and their shares must be set aside and held until they are of age ? also at a price . " Infants ' proceedings , " as such actions are termed , are most technical and expensive , yet unless every contingency is provided for , good title can not be given to the real estate . Nor can clear title be given for at least two years after your death . In the meantime there may be a chance to sell at a bargain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering for want of the money which that property would bring . It ca n't be helped . For two years that property ca n't be sold , and then only after the delay and expense of long and weary court proceedings . If you had left a will , you could have included therein a power of sale , and at any time when the interests of the estate demanded it the property could have been sold . I recall a case where a man died , leaving a widow , two children , and no will . A part of his estate was two building-lots in a Western town . Just after his death there was a great boom . The lots could have been sold at a tremendous profit . The widow realized that their value was only temporary , but , try as she would , she could give no clear title which a purchaser would accept , until two years had elapsed . By that time the boom had passed permanently . She could obtain only a small offer for the lots , not large enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the children and the instituting of the longdrawn-out proceedings for the sale of the property . For eighteen years , until her children became of age , she paid taxes on those wretched lots , although there was many and many a time when the money that they might have brought would have been most welcome . To summarize : in order to save time , money , trouble , dispute , and litigation , for the sake of your own feelings , for the sake of your friends and relatives , for the welfare of your children , make a will . I will go farther . Not only should every woman make a will , but she should see that her husband makes one . The only valid excuse for failing to do both of these things is a lack either of property or of a husband . Why ? Well , for all the reasons stated , such as saving of time , money , and trouble , and also for one very important additional reason . Take the case of Mrs. Young . She married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenements , and hereditaments , or , to put it in lay language , he owned half a block or so of city property . Mrs. Young was happily married , with an allowance that satisfied even her substantial ideas on that subject . One time the question of wills came up . " Why pay lawyers ' fees ? " asked Mr. Young astutely . " The state makes a good enough will for me . When I die , you get everything . A will would n't give you any more . " So Mrs. Young let it go at that . In fact , it seemed to her rather bad form to discuss the matter anyway . Three months after their conversation Mr. Young was killed in an automobile accident . It was found that his property consisted entirely of real estate . This was distributed as Mr. Young had stated it would be , by the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania . He was mistaken , however , about the amount his wife would receive . Instead of getting it all absolutely , she received only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow 's  | exemption of some five thousand dollars . Except for that half life-interest the property went absolutely to Mr. Young 's two elderly sisters . They had not spoken to him for five years and disapproved of Mrs. Young even more strongly . However , they heartily approved of Mr. Young 's prejudice against wills . Mrs. Y o u n g h a s changed her mind entirely in regard to the etiquette of finding out whether one is to be a rich or a poor widow . Assuming that I have been fortunate enough to convince my readers that it is their moral and material duty to make wills personally and by proxy ? husbands officiating in the latter capacity ? there arises certain important questions to be answered : to wit , how shall a will be made ? what shall it contain ? and where shall it be kept until needed ? Now , I dislike to keep constantly referring my readers to lawyers , and it is perfectly possible for you personally to draw a will that is entirely valid . But you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new deal with a will . By the time it is tested , the maker of it has gone where , whatever else there may-be , there are certainly no wills . Moreover , it is fairly easy to make a mistake . Wills are kittle cattle and must be handled with a considerable amount of care . There was the case of Mr. Blizzard , who hurriedly made a will in a New York hospital and then proceeded to die more or less contentedly . The will was signed at the end as the law prescribes . It was also duly witnessed , and the witnesses stated in the subscription clause that they had signed at the request of the maker of the will , in his presence , and in the presence of each other , and that the maker had signed , sealed , published , and declared it in their presence as and for his last will and testament . This was according to Hoyle . The will left a large amount of property in California to a married woman . Unfortunately she was not married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last lady  | retained able Californian counsel , whose eagle eye at once detected the fact that Mr. Blizzard in dating his will had hurriedly used the abbreviation ' 96 instead of the full date , which happened to be 1896 . Her attorneys charged with great enthusiasm that abbreviated will , and , incidentally , Mrs. Blizzard , although that charge came afterward . When the smoke of litigation cleared away , that layman-made will lay broken and shattered against an opinion of the California court , which held that a will must bear a date and that it was evident that the will could not have been made in the year 96 B. C. , or even A. D : therefore the will was dateless , therefore it was not valid . The learned court refused to recognize any abbreviation whatever . To be quite fair to California , it should be stated that this intelligent decree was afterward reversed and that , moreover , other courts in sister states have been just as hypercritical in sustaining wills as California in breaking them . There was Mr. Stevens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters , to say nothing of a fine crop of nephews and nieces . Notwithstanding t h e s e responsibilities , he selfishly centered his delayed affections on the comely and efficient young woman w h o c o n d escended to operate a typewriter in his office . Furthermore , he wrote her divers and sundry letters to that effect . In one of these letters , after one of the con ventional endearing openings , which I will omit because all my readers know it by heart , Mr. Stevens ended in a burst of mingled business and sentiment , as follows : I am thinking of you every moment , sweetheart mine . If anything should ever happen to me , I want you to have all my bonds , and I am going to put them into an envelop and mark it with your dear name . They are to be yours if I die first . With all my love , dearest heart of mine , CHARLES S. STEVENS . Soon after inditing this middle-aged love-letter Mr. Stevens departed this life  | under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his safe in an envelop bearing the name of his ex-stenographer . She resolved not to allow sentiment to stand in the way of safety and blushingly offered the love-letter as a will . In spite of wild cries of anguish , indignation , and disgust from the brothers , sisters , nephews , and nieces of the decedent , the courts sustained the love-letter , and the young woman got the bonds . Then there is the fact that the law gives special meaning to words and phrases which the most intelligent layman would never suspect . To any lay-mind the expression , " I give and devise my house and land to Susan Brown , " would mean that Susan gets the house for keeps . Far from it . You have overlooked the rule in Shelley 's case . In the old days , and in these new days in some states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina , Mr. Shelley ? no relation to the poet ? still reigns . His rule is simply expressed in words of one syllable by Mr. Coke in his immortal work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coke on Littleton . " He writes there as follows , " When the ancestor by any gift or conveyance taketh an estate of freehold and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited , either mediately or immediately , to his heirs in fee or in tail , the heirs ' are words of limitation of the estate and not words of purchase . " Now you know all about it . Is n't it wonderful what a clear , dramatic wordpicture Mr. Coke has painted ? You understand instantly that under that rule if you want Susan Brown to get your property absolutely , you must leave it to Susan Brown and her heirs . If you just leave it to Susan Brown , she has it only for life and ca n't sell it , or will it , or give it away . Conversely , if you wanted Susan to have it for life and her children to have it after her death and accordingly wrote , " I give and devise my real estate to Susan Brown for life and at her death to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Blackstone would say , by Mr. Shelley . Susan would get the whole business , and her heirs could whistle plaintive tunes for their share . Now far be it from me to alarm you , gentle reader , or to persuade you to spend your good money on lawyer-folk . Let them starve . They 've got no friends anyway . Still these examples show but a few of the pits and gins and traps into which the economical will-maker may stumble if she tries to make anything but the simplest kind of a will . As a matter of fact , it is really better economy to pay a lawyer ten to twenty-five dollars for drawing your will properly than to have your estate after your death pay five hundred or a thousand dollars because it was drawn improperly . Suppose , however , it is necessary for you to draw your own will . You may live in a place where you ca n't get hold of a lawyer ( they do say that there are such places still left ) or you may prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a number of convincing reasons . A few words in regard to form may therefore not be amiss . Fashions change in wills as in everything else . A century or so ago , Mrs. Betsy Smith would not have considered a will valid which did not begin something like this : In the Name of God . Amen . I , Betsy Smith , the loving and lawful wife of John Smith , being of sound and disposing mind , memory , and understanding , and considering the manifold uncertainties of this life , do hereby make , publish , and declare as and for my Last Will and Testament , in the manner following to wit : Imprimis , I devote my soul to my maker whence it came , my body I consign to the earth in the hope of a glorious resurrection . As for the estate which it bath pleased God to bestow upon me , I dispose of it as follows , etc . Times have changed . The will of Betsy Smith 's **32;574;TOOLONG is likely to contain less piety and more brevity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , Edythe Smythe , do hereby make , publish , and declare as and for my Last Will and Testament as follows : First : I give , devise , and bequeath all of my property , real , personal , or mixed , absolutely and in fee simple to my husband John Smythe and his heirs forever . Second : I nominate and appoint my said husband , John Smythe , as the Executor of this my Last Will and Testament . In Witless Whereof , I have hereunto affixed my hand and seal the loth day of December , A. D. 1915 . EDYTHE SMYTHE ( L. S. ) Signed , sealed , published , and declared as and for her last will and Testament by the abovenamed testatrix in the presence of us , who at her request and in her presence and in the presence of each other have hereunto affixed our names as witnesses : CLARYCE JOHNES , LYLIAN BROMINE , MAI BURNES . Mrs. Smythe should sign her name to such a will at the end just before the subscription clause , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should sign in the presence of three witnesses , state that the paper is her will , and ask them to sign their names at the end of this subscription clause . They must sign in one another 's presence and the presence of Mrs. Smythe . If all these details are observed , she has a will that is good anywhere in the world . Some tates and countries require two witnesses , some three , some none at all , but her will should be drawn to meet the requirements of all , because she may die leaving property in any state . In that case the will would have to be probated there , and if it did not comply with the statutes of that state , would not be recognized as valid . This will is good if it is written by Mrs. Smythe herself or by some one for her , and whether typewritten or written in longhand . It is not necessary to name in a will any relatives to whom property is not left or give any reasons for omitting them . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red seal on a will . The letters " L. S. " with a circle around them are just as good . Remember one thing , however . A new baby means a new will . So much for the form . As to the contents , it is a delicate matter to advise as to what a will should or should not contain . Men and women like to select their legatees as they do their wives and husbands ? personally . Still they are known to listen even to matrimonial advice ? if so be that it coincides with their views . So here goes . In the first place a will should always appoint an executor and should always give him the power to sell the real estate , unless the real estate is left to the same person who is appointed executor , when , of course , it is not necessary . That saves long and expensive court proceedings and also gives the purchaser a clear title . It must give the exact and correct name of any person or corporation to whom property is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts who all her life had been interested in a certain marine charitable organization known as the " Seaman 's Friends Society . " She meant to leave it the bulk of her fortune . Either she or her lawyer ( he said it was her fault , and she said nothing ? being dead ) made a trifling mistake in the name , and it appeared in the will as the " Seaman 's Aid Society . " After her death there popped up from another city in a far-away state a society of that exact name . To be sure , the old lady had never heard of it and had told the officers of the " Seaman 's Friends Society " shortly before her death of her intentions . It made no difference . What she had written , she had written , said the courts , and the " Seaman 's Aid Society " got every penny . Finally , as well as firstly , in the majority of cases a wife should leave everything to her husband for the same reasons that he should leave everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the property can be disposed of when necessary without the appointment of guardians or the delay and expense of the court proceedings necessary when minor children have an interest in it . Moreover , there comes a time when the hands lose their cunning and the brain grows dark . Then no father or mother wishes to live on the charity of the children . Let us suppose that you have finally decided to lead a will-less life no longer . Signed and sealed , your will lies before you . Now comes the question what shall be done with it ? Do n't lock it up in your memory-box , or leave it in your bureaudrawer , or hide it in your trunk . A will may be the deed of your husband 's or your children 's future . If lost , disfigured , or destroyed , it can not be replaced when the time comes to make use of it . In a case of my own I once prepared a will for a woman in which she left a large property in trust for a spendthrift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whom she was separated . She took this will with her after it had been executed and shortly afterward died suddenly . She had lived alone . Her son and husband were notified and obtained immediate access to her papers . No will was ever found . Her son ran through in a year his share of the estate which his mother had planned should support him for life . Her husband squandered his on vices . The time and thought and money of this woman were wasted , and her estate was made a curse instead of a blessing , because she failed to take the obvious precaution of leaving her will in her solicitor 's safe or depositing it in a vault at her bank or trust company . The receipt for the will from your lawyer or trust company is all that should ever be kept among your personal papers at your home So I end as I began : make a will , make it right , keep it safe , and you 'll live happier , die more comfortably , and be remembered more gratefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
