txt WHAT THEY DIED FOR . League of Nations the Only Satisfactory Outcome of the War . To the  --  Editor of The New York Times : A recent ; . communication from the League- for the Preservation of American Independence , soliciting a subscription ? to help defeat the League of Nations covenant , has depressed me beyond words , for , although it fairly reeks with dishonesty concerning the possible effect of the proposed League upon American sovereignty and national life , find it has the support of some  --  United States Senators , These gentlemen say their sentiments ' are American , ? They may be , but I hope not : They sound more German ' than anything ' else in their inhumanity and selfish nationalism  --  undeniably they are the sentiments of self-seeking politicians the world over , who from time immemorial have fostered international enmity . ? ? My eldest son 's life was forfeit in this ' war . I search his letters in vain for evidence that he thought himself fighting for what these Senators represent . He believed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent future wars . To advance this he was willing to make the ' supreme sacrifice if . need be . Since the war began I have felt that any pace that did not recognize the transcendent importance of international co-operation against belligerency would be ? meaningless . My faith however , was always strong that peace'terms dictated by the Allies would make provision for it , and not my sole consolation for the loss of my son is that a plan for a League ' of Nations to carry out this great principle , marking an epoch in Man 's history , has actually been given first place in ' the Paris treaty . And against the Senators of my own country who would rob nie of this consolatlo : . I my feelings are akin in bitterness to those against the German Emperor . ' The League , of Nations covenant may , not be perfect , but is probably as nearly so as conditions would permit and , in any event , is perfect enough to try . it provides the great essentials indispensable to the prevention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has in ' the past made might right between nations . No criticism has In any way been able to discredit the fact that the League has provided for the first tune in history : ( 1 ) The machinery for international interference with the belligerent plans of nations against each other ; ( 2 ) For great reduction in national armaments ; ( 2 ) For arbitration of disputes and delay in resorting to war ; ( 4 ) For the abolition of secret treaties : ( 3 ) For the economic boycott of a ; belligerent nation . Who can believe ' that these provisions alone , when carried out by the powers who have agreed to them , would not make international war well-nigh impossible ? No honest man . And yet these Senators pretend they would do nothing but spill blood and entangle us in endless European wars , and would deny them even a trial . Could we possibly become worse entangled with a League of Nations than we just have been - without one ? The League of Nations is the Monroe Doctrine for the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I say hail to this League and pray that it be given a trial . JULIAN It . TINKHAM . Upper Montclair , N. J. , Sept. 4 , 1919. '
