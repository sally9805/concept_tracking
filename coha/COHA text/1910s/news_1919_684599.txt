txt NEW YORK REVISITED . Impressions After an Absence of Fifty Years . To the Editor of The New York Times : I was last in New York in 1860 . From what I can see today that must have been when Moses had his last attack of gooseflesh . Getting into New York today Is like getting into a Brooklyn Bridge car at the rush hour . I have made a circuit of your largest hotels , and have at last found a place to hang from by my toes at one of your smallest hotels . It consumed the tenth of a baby gnat 's eyebrow this side of an hour to purchase a ticket to get out of New York on the morrow . The Brooklyn Bridge car at rush hours serves as an illustration both ways . I passed the Biltmore Hotel . A man fell from a window under the roof and was crushed to a jelly at my very feet .

I. New York , June 30 , 1010 . Republican Tactics . To the Editor of Pie New York Times : Your clear and comprehensive editorial article in today 's Thir.8 under the heading ? ? Their Only Way Out " should be a warning to all United States Senators , especially the Republicans . Instead of using their spare time during the present short vacation holding meetings where they smile upon an audience that hisses our splendid President . and for which meeting they deserve a reprimand from every true American citizen , they could use their time to much better advantage pondering upon ways and means of curbing all profiteers in order to reduce the outrageously high cost of living , and thereby receive the everlasting gratitude of all the people . The Republican Party has reached the end of the trail . I say this in all sincerity as a stanch Republican of many years ' standing , and I ' pray that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ALFRED W. BECK .
