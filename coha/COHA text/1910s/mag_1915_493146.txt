Reform In Philadelphia THIS is not an appreciation of reform , it is not an explanation or lament . It is a mere story of how reform rose and fell in Philadelphia . Reform was beaten down at the election of November second , and Philadelphia celebrated all night in honor of the event . There were , of course , other issues in the campaign . The tariff was against the reform party like a strong trade wind blowing in its face . There was also religion that went whispering hoarsely through the city . But the issue of reform is the one that will undoubtedly be remembered longest , and on that issue Philadelphia had its mind made up . Four years ago , when Rudolph Blankenburg was elected mayor , reform in Philadelphia had reached its summit . It was the result of a succession of vigorous rebellious movements dating back to 19o5 , through which a strong group had been developed who were hungry for the cleaning up of the city 's government . They were nourished on speeches full of high civic purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's affairs . There was little else for them to be nourished upon , for the city , state and nation were in the hands of the Republican organization . The persistency of these rebels had been extraordinary . Year after year they were defeated , yet they always came back for more . Division men worked their precincts and stood manfully at the polls on election day , and citizens of an independent cast came out year after year and voted religiously against the " Gang " ; and at last came " The Day . " There were a dozen factors that went to make up the success of the election in 1911 , but at the back of them all was the insistent demand for reform . It was a conjurer 's word in those days . The city was exalted by it , poor and rich alike . Everyone was willing to do his share , and the candidate for mayor added the climax . He was a magnificent figure to follow ? a white-bearded Teutonic warrior , full of enthusiasm . For thirty years he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better things . They called him affectionately " the old war-horse of reform , " and " the Old Dutch Cleanser . " He was a strong campaigner who thrilled men , even the lowest , with a sense of something superbly earnest and sincere , and swept them away with him in a plea for a non-partisan business administration . After the victory there was a new spirit in the air . Philadelphia seemed to have wakened on the morning after election to find that it owned its own city . Meek citizens were seized with a new confidence and asserted their rights , officeholders acquired a new spirit of docility . Every man who had struggled in the ranks of the rebels saw his record of effort and self-sacrifice magnified to large proportions . He treated his former political antagonists with condescension based upon his new sense of potential power . The new administration was his administration . In ward committee meetings , ward leaders emphasized the importance of filing complaints of political activity against officeholders , the penalty for which under the law was dismissal , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work promptly . " ' There is need for honest men in City Hall , " they explained . " There will be so many holes there presently that we can not find pegs enough to fit them all . " Each man seemed to see in the changed conditions opportunity for fulfilment of some hope of his own , and looked for free and welcome admission to any and every office in City Hall for the expression of it . The new mayor took his oath of office on the first Monday of December , 1911 . Several days after the inauguration an impatient ward delegation called in force upon him to advocate the appointment of their ward leader to a certain position . It received no satisfaction ; the mayor declined to interview political committees . A tremor of doubt ran through the other wards , lessened only by the thought that the mayor was " getting his bearings " and perhaps the delegation was not made up of iL real reformers . ) , In the second week of the administration the convention of the National Civil Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sent to the reform ward committeemen throughout the city , and they came and listened to the new mayor ? their mayor ? and heard him say : I have preached for nearly thirty years ? now I mean to practice . . . . The spoilsman will have to take a back seat ? I care not under what label he is traveling , whether he is labeled Republican , Democrat , Keystoner , Prohibitionist , Socialist , or what not . It seems almost incredible that it should have taken so many years to convince the intelligent people of our great country , the intelligent people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , the intelligent people of the city of Philadelphia , that it pays to have real civil service and practice it . The statement was made by me during the campaign , and it has been emphasized since our great victory , that the merit system will hold sway in Philadelphia while I am mayor . It was astounding doctrine . There was thin applause from the members of the League , but many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went silently away . Civil service reform was a little-known cult in Philadelphia then . There was a civil service law which looked very fine on the statute books , but it made small impression on appointments to office . In Philadelphia political job and public employment were synonymous terms . They were favors granted , not occupations . And now , at the moment of triumph , this mild , meek civil service thing began to loom like the genii of the fisherman 's bottle , and cast a shadow over the city . Mutterings in ward committees and at meetings were stilled by leaders who believed that speeches were meant as an imposing front and for the satisfaction of the press , but that a back door would presently open through which the faithful might enter . They argued forcefully , " The mayor can not let his organization go to pieces . He must prepare to control the legislature next year or he will be ripped out of office , and he must prepare to capture councils the year following and to perpetuate himself in a successor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , there was no wholesale decapitation , no sign of an effort to build an organization ; simply talk of work proposed , of putting the city 's administrative plant in good working order , and of bright schemes for its development . The hope of recognition died hard , but it died , and the mutterings were unrestrained . Ward meetings now turned ferocious . It was a serious thing for men who had struggled and suffered for years to find themselves , after a great victory , of no more consequence in the city 's government than they had been before , to find that officeholders who had fought them still continued to hold office . Their bitterness was intense . They felt that the mayor was their mayor , the man they had elected , and that he had deceived and betrayed them . There were not a great many of them , perhaps , but they believed as Philadelphia largely believed , and their rancor ran like poison through the city . The city committee of the Keystone party , which was the title under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flickered up and called the mayor a " Benedict Arnold , an ingrate " ; and then passed away as a real factor in the political situation , leaving the mayor with no organization at his back , and nothing but an appeal to an independent citizenry as his weapon . The administration went about its business . Men held their places as long as they did their work well . New men were appointed only after careful examination . Novel principles were injected into all departments . Time-honored grafts were eliminated . City employees who had wandered in carelessly between nine and ten o'clock and had quit at three were ordered to report at nine and to remain until four , and subsequently until five o'clock . Office furniture of ponderous awkwardness disappeared . Filing-cases appeared in an institution that had been innocent of them . Partitions were erected in vast , scarcely occupied spaces . Clean , active young men appeared at desks in partitioned offices , where insolent , lounging fellows had been wont to smoke pipes in lofty-ceilinged spaciousness . Girl stenographers took dictation ; formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman . In the highway bureau one engineer was found . Shortly there were a hundred and eighty-one . Philadelphia was embarked on a business , non-partisan career . Some of the lounging old fellows who were dismissed were discovered to be veterans of the war , with a more or less clouded record , and some of the engineers employed were imported , possibly from New York or elsewhere . These were two additional squirts of poison into the city 's veins . In 1913 came the test of the administration 's popularity . Certain county offices were to be filled and councilmen were to be elected . It was a dull campaign . Meetings were slimly attended and lukewarm . No candidate dared plead for a nonpartisan administration . Each emphasized the fact that his office was not covered by the city 's civil service law , but even this suggestion met with little enthusiasm ; the stalwarts had been fooled once , they were cautious about believing again . They sulked and were listless ; they grumbled , " The mayor did nothing for us , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that the Blankenburg administration was honest . People admitted it , but were not warmed . The administration gave out stories showing its achievements in the elimination of waste and graft , and the inauguration of ambitious projects . But the people were indifferent ; they did not trouble themselves to vote . And the organization ticket carried overwhelmingly . The City Council , which had purred about the mayor in the early stages of his administration like a house cat , gathered an organization strength that enabled it to pass ordinances over his veto as readily as it passed them originally . It locked horns with the mayor , interfered with everything he undertook , scorned his messages . The mayor appealed to the citizenry for support and got none . The answer was , " Did n't we give him power to put those fellows out of business when we elected him ? He should have driven them out of town . He did n't do it . It is his lookout . " To the men who had been active in politics the situation was not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his friends ; he did n't build up an organization . Now look at him . We told you so . " Yet the administration accomplished remarkable results . The city government as a working business machine was made over from a slovenly , easygoing , wasteful , grafting affair to one that might be compared almost favorably with a private corporation . It planned and secured the beginning of projects of harbor development and rapid transit of a scope that had never been conceived by any other administration . The mayor stands ready to turn over to his successor a foundation for the greatest constructive work the city has ever known . The people by a vote of two to one directed him to turn it over to the Republican organization . There is no reverence for reform in Philadelphia . The city has gone back to itself . One of the ward transparencies in the glorious celebration on the night of November second last gave Philadelphia 's real tenet of belief . It bore the inscription : " We stand by Pat Ryan . He stands by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
