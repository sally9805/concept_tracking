txt Private contracts are so affected by a superior public interest that the manner of making or breaking them is under the supervision of the law . If people were allowed to make con , tracts to suit themselves alone , the public would have doubtful standing to regulate the manner in which such contracts might be ended . The rule applies to match , ' a ' breaking contracts of labor for public utilities . They are affected with a superior pub -- lie interest . The terms of the contract are suitable for regulation by law . But the subject has hitherto been attacked illogically . The agreement for hiring is unregulated , and may be made between the private worker and the public utility to suit themselves : Having been made in that manner , there is a presumption that such con ' tracts may be broken without Intervention by the public . authorities . Yet the practice is for public . authority to pay no attention to the contract of hiring , but to intervene . when ? the workers " fire " their employers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public interest , but It is not recognised that the beginning of the relation Is the logical point to begin the regulation of employers and workers in the public interest . There Is now pending at Washington an anti-strike bill affecting railways which changes its form often , but which makes this mistake , and one other . Jurisdiction is taken . over ' railway contracts of employment in the public Interest , but the public has only minority representation upon the regulating board , as if it were the party least concerned .. Hearings are now being held upon proposal for a New York law which differs ' from the Federal bill in that it begins at the beginning and takes control of both parties to the contract . The employers are not allowed either to hire or " fire " without oversight . Their conditions of employment and their administration of the contract are both to . be fixed by a board upon which both parties to the contract of em- , employment ire to have equal representation , with reservation of supervision : by public authority in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides . . The employers are bound In many respects upon which unions are accustomed to lay moat ' emphasts . On the other hand , the employes are to be bound in some respects against which their unions are persistent objectors . The , men are to have the right of collective bargaining , but in order to ' obtain , standing as one party to the contract . they must file the particulars of their organization . ? Their officers must be named , and the rights and duties of ' the organiza-1 tion must be specified in the articles of association , which must be flied . The ! association may Or may not call itself a union , but it must file its consent to abide by the contract of employment . That contract may be made directly between the parties . Only in default ' Of that agreement does the wage board take control . The board is. to be established by the Public Service Cornmission under provision for equality of representation . For example , the unorganized employes are to be represented proportionally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment are to be investigated . by the wage board and reported to the . Public Service Commission . Both lockouts and strikes are forbidden . The , penalty is punishment for misdemes.ndr . , That may properly be called a bill for the protection of the public rather than for the satisfaction of labor or the punishment of capital when it is not at fault . It does not surrender the public interest in advance- , as may be said . of the Federal bill , which has abandoned the attempt to forbid a strike pouting investigation . It does ask unions to give up some of their requirements which experience has shown are contrary . to public interest . ? Thus it raises ' the question whether ' the public or the unions arc most to be considered , It is a difficult question , but it is a merit of the ' bill that it . raises it frankly . If the unions are to dictate ' the conditions of employment upon public utilities , it is well to have that also settled with equal plainness.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
