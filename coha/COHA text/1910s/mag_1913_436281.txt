HUMAre nature is full of contradictions , which give it much of its charm . But the character and career of Alexander H. Stephens seem to involve contradictions beyond the share of most of us . In physique he was abnormally frail , delicate , and sensitive ; nervous sometimes to the point of hysteria ; yet he had the spirit of a gamecock , was ready for a duel when honor required it , walked right up and struck a far bigger man who had insulted him and who nearly murdered him in consequence . Perhaps with some braggadocio , but with more truth , he said of himself : am afraid of nothing on earth , or above the earth , or under the earth , but to do wrong . ' He was studious by nature , longed for quiet , and solitude , and meditation . Yet he lived in a perpetual whirl , either drawn by a thousand activities abroad , or beset by a throng of visitors at home . ' I supposed when I got this room I should be by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livelong day but jabber with each transient interloper who may be disposed to give me a call . ' He was one of the most logical , clearheaded , determined defenders of slavery and of the thorough subordination of black to white . Yet few men have been more sensitively humane , more tenderly sympathetic with suffering in either white or black . The Negroes loved him , and on one occasion 82 after the war three thousand freedmen gathered on his lawn and serenaded him with passionate admiration and devotion . No man was more bitterly opposed to secession and to the war than he was . No Southerner made a harder or more nearly successful fight to prevent the withdrawal of his state . Yet when Georgia went , he not only went with her , but became the vice-president of the Confederacy . He himself puts this contrast vividly in his diary written while a prisoner at Fort Warren in 1865 . ' How strange it seems to me that I should thus suffer . I who did everything in my power to prevent the war . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was near losing my life for resenting the charge of being a traitor to the South , and now I am here , a prisoner , under charge , I suppose , of being a traitor to the Union . In all , I have done nothing but what I thought was right . ' Nor does this sum up the list of Stephens 's contradictions . The second officer of the Confederacy and a devoted champion of its cause , he was yet persistently opposed to the conduct of the government from beginning to end . He opposed Davis 's financial policy , he opposed conscription , he opposed martial law , he considered that the president 's whole course was dictated either by gross misjudgment or by a belief in the necessity of dictatorial power . And here we have , I think , a rat her piquant attitude for a man who held the next to the highest place in a new-born nation fighting for life and death . These considerations make the vice-president , if not the greatest , certainly the most curious and interesting figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's career , the question of health , negatively important for most leaders of men , becomes enormously positive . From his birth in 1812 to his death in 1883 , his life seems to have been a long disease , for-ex er on the verge of terminating fatally . It may be that the rough experiences of pioneer farming in his childhood ? the corn-dropping , the sheep-tending , exposure , hardship ? injured him permanently , or saved him , who knows ? So with the long , desperate battle for an education and a profession , in solitude and poverty . The battle may have weakened , may have toughened , perhaps both . At any rate , we rarely hear of him except as suffering . All the descriptions of him emphasize some phase of physical weakness and inadequacy . His own account at twenty-one sets the note ( the arithmetic is somewhat peculiar ) : ' Hy weight is ninety-four pounds , my height sixty-seven inches , my waist twenty-seven inches in circumference , and my whole appearance that of a youth of seventeen or eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my net weight was seventy pounds . If I continue in a proportionate increase , I shall reach one hundred pounds in about ten years more . ' Later portrayals have sometimes an unkindly touch , as the caustic diatribe of the robust Dick Taylor , no doubt in some points justified : ' Like other ills , feeble health has its compensations , especially for those who unite restless vanity and ambition to a feminine desire for sympathy . It has been much the habit of Mr. Stephens to date controversial epistles from " a sick chamber , " as do ladies in a delicate condition . A diplomat of the last century , the Chevalier d'Eon , by usurping the privileges of the opposite sex , inspired grave doubts concerning his own . ' But most observers seem rather to be impressed with the contrast between the man 's physical deficiencies and his splendid spiritual strength . In the height of his congressional career in Washington ( 1855 ) a keen-sighted journalist noted that , with the stress of great occasions , ' the poor , sickly , emaciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest physical exertion , at once grows instinct with a galvanic vitality which quickens every nerve with the energy of a new life , imparts to every feature a high , intellectual expression , makes the languid eyes glow like living coals , and diffuses a glow of reviving animation over the pallid countenance . ' Even more striking is another picture taken in the same place in 1872 , after war and imprisonment had done their worst . An immense cloak , a high hat , and peering somewhere out of the middle a thin , pale , sad face . How anything so small and sick and sorrowful could get here all the way from Georgia is a wonder . If he were laid out in his coffin , he need n't look any different , only then the fire would have gone out in the burning eyes . Set as they are in the wax-white face , they seem to burn and blaze . That he is here at all to offer the counsels of moderation and patriotism proves how invincible is the soul that dwells in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair , and his friends picked him up and carried him off in it as if he were a feather . ' How far this fiery energy of the soul was responsible for the weary failure of the body , who shall say ? But never was man , in mind and spirit , more heartily and vividly and incessantly and at every point alive than Alexander H. Stephens . From childhood he fought his way in the world , fought for education , fought for success as a lawyer , fought for political distinction . He liked fighting . ' I was made to figure in a storm , excited by continual collisions . Discussion and argument are my delight ; and a place of life and business therefore is my proper element . . . long to be where I shall have an argument daily . ' In age and in prison the fire , indeed , might burn a little low . ' Personal ambition had no part in anything I have done . ' But in the early days the man panted to get upward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall never be worth anything , and the thought is death to my soul . I am too boyish , childish , unmanful , trifling , simple in my manners and address . ' When he had become something ? not enough , never enough ? the record of work he did is , for an invalid , quite inexplicable ; or rather , it fully explains the invalidism . ' I rise and breakfast at eight ; then commence with my mail . Frequently I do not get half through that before I am bored almost to death with calls on business of all sorts ; then to the Committee at ten ; then to the House at twelve ; then to dinner at four ; then calls before I leave the table till twelve at night . Then I take up and get through my unfinished reading of letters and newspapers of the morning ; and then at one o'clock get to bed . I now have about one hundred letters before me unanswered . ' This petulance , this vivacity , this mad energy of living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voltaire , who , with his little , weak , and shattered body , went on for fifty years , making enemies and smashing them , puncturing social rottenness with his fierce wit , blasting others ' lies and telling petty lies of his own , sometimes pitiable , sometimes malignant , often fascinating , but always , always splendidly alive . Stephens made few enemies , told no lies , was neither pitiable nor malignant ; but he was splendidly alive until the coffin-lid put out the torch that seemed to have exhausted its fuel long before . But though Voltaire had plenty of physical ills , I find no indication that he ever suffered from melancholy or mental depression . Stephens did . The jar of over-tense nerves mingles curiously with his eager bursts of ambition and aspiration . My feelings and hopes seem ever to be vibrating between assurance and despondency . My soul is bent upon success in my profession , and when indulging in brightest anticipations , the most trivial circumstance is frequently sufficient to damp my whole ardor and drive me to despair . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed hopes or dreams unrealized . It was a constitutional melancholy which , not only in youth , but even in middle life , seems to have eaten like a canker into the man 's very soul . The words in which he describes it most definitely have a strange , poignant bitterness that wrings the heart : ' Sometimes I have thought that of all men I was most miserable ; that I was especially doomed to misfortune , to melancholy , to grief . ... The misery , the deep agony of spirit I have suffered , no mortal knows , nor ever will . .. . The torture of body is severe ; I have had my share of that ... But all these are slight when compared with the pangs of an offended or wounded spirit . The heart alone knoweth its own sorrow . I have borne it these many years . I have borne it all my life . ' To his beloved brother , Linton , he endeavors to describe his spiritual raal- ady . ' It is the secret of my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his speech , usually so lucid , is incoherent , stumbling , and obscure . It appears that his physical deficiencies wounded him , as they did Byron ; he shrank and withered under the jeers and mocking looks of those who could not see his soul . Then the stung soul rebounded and strove with every ounce of will to make the mockers love him by doing good to them in strange new ways of Overwhelming potency . But the explanation is neither clear nor wholly sufficient ; it sounds manufactured to fit facts beyond the vision of even the explainer . All we can say is that we get dim glimpses of a spiritual hell . What is supremely interesting about Stephens is that he neither accepts this condition of things nor submits to it . Such a wretched frame for such a fierce vitality might easily have madeanother Leopardi , veiling all the light of heaven in black pessimism , cursing man and nature and God with cold irony for the vile mistake of his creation . Stephens fights his ills , makes head against them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental agony . Worsted for the moment , he forever reemerges , with some new refuge , some new comfort , some new device of cure . One day he tries Burton 's Anatomy of Melancholy , finds it excellent , on homceopathic principles , and recommends it to his brother , though Burton himself is inclined to advise all melancholy persons to shun his majestic folio . More serious than such bookishness is the clear determination to overcome mental misery by effort of will . ' I have in my life , ' he says , been one of the most miserable beings that walked the earth . . . Without enjoyment , without pleasure , without hope , and without sympathy with the world . ' But the unfailing remedy for those who will but try it is the absolute control of thought . Never let the mind dwell upon anything disagreeable ? turn it to something else . . . . Great and heroic effort was necessary at first and for a long time . ' But with a proper discipline of one 's self in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happiness are obtainable by all . ' I do not read that he ever attained them , but others may , by following his precepts . He fought for them , at any rate . Stoical self-control was not his only refuge . He had one higher ? God . In his youth he declined to be educated for the ministry , and I do not think he was ever consistently satisfied as to speculative religion . But he seems to have had a keen and mighty sense of the divine in spiritual things , and in his hours of agony he seeks relief in this and finds it . He devotes a portion of every day to communion with God in prayer , and gets from it comfort in his anguish , light in the valley of dark shadows , and the growth of a kindlier , sweeter temper toward his fellow men . In old age , in sickness , in solitude , in prison , he sums up thus the mighty help that God has been to him : ' That the Lord is a stronghold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustaining grace , I should have been crushed in body and soul long ere this . ' Nevertheless , with a temperament so introspective , brooding , and sensitive , it is doubtful whether even religious contemplation would have cured Stephens of melancholy and morbidness . It might have lifted him above the pessimism and misanthropy of Leopardi only to land him in the deeper spiritual wretchedness of Amiel . Contemplation , even divine , is not always sufficient to save such a temperament from ruining itself . A better , surer remedy , at least a needed balance-wheel , is action , con- stant contact with the busy , outward , stupid hurry of the world . Stephens knew this , and had the courage and the energy to force himself out of himself . He may have possessed ' a charm against loneliness , ' as his brother writes ; but he knew that in loneliness lay his danger , and he kept as much as possible in the bright current of turbulent humanity , even when all his inclinations bade him fly from it . ' It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal upon earth would make , I should sink into profound indifference to all things connected with men and their affairs . But with that effort that I daily exert , to the persons about me I appear , I have no doubt , to be one of the most cheerful and happy men on earth . ' As a result of this he had people near him always . His hospitality was notorious even in the hospitable South . Though he was far from wealthy , his mansion , Liberty Hall , was open to all men at all times . Rich and poor , high and low , ignorant and learned , gathered there and feasted at the owner 's spiritual table as well as at the material . ' Distinguished visitors from everywhere sought the sage 's dwelling ; so did hungry tramps , black and white . ' Like many persons of melancholy temperament , he was rich in delightful social qualities , made his guests feel thoroughly at home , studied their needs and ministered to them . And that especially frequent concomitant of melancholy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had in a very high degree . His letters and his diary abound with good stories . What a quaint comic invention is the imaginary Finkle , through whom at irregular intervals he narrates his autobiography . His prison life at Fort Warren appears to him to be full of humorous matter . When he is not weeping over it , he is laughing at it . One of the best specimens of his dry wit , though more bitter than is usual with him , is the comment with which he closes some rather severe observations on Davis . ' It is certainly not my object to detract from Mr. Davis , but the truth is that as a statesman he was not colossal . . . . After the Government was organized at Montgomery , it was reported that he said it was " now a question of brains . " I thought the remark a good one . ' These social qualities ? cheerfulness , kindliness , sympathy ? won friends for Stephens everywhere . In college , though poor , he was generally beloved and gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in Washington it was the same . The venerable John Quincy Adams saluted him with verses more notable for feeling than for genius . Members of all parties treated him with affection and respect . When he gave up his congressional seat in 1859 , he received the unusual honor of a dinner tendered by a list of members of both houses of Congress without party distinction , headed by the Speakerof the House and the Vice-President . Stephens 's universal popularity was by no means confined to men of his own position in life , but was perhaps even greater among the working people . ' Thank God for little Alex ! ' shouted crowds assembled on his first appear . ance after being wounded by a political adversary . And the Negroes , especially those in his own service , were as enthusiastic and devoted as the whites . It will be evident that qualities like these seemed to pave the straight way to political success . In a certain sense Stephens had such success in large measure . Why that success was limited will become clearer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men for a political purpose he had few superiors . And his art was largely sincerity . He made it clear that he himself acted only from a profound and well-reasoned conviction , that he would throw over his party and even his constituents in a moment , if his conviction was against them ; and the remnant of honesty that is latent in all men , politicians as well as others , responded to such straight-fern ard uprightness . History records few finer things than Stephens 's manly stand against the rush of secession in his state . Protesting in the face of angry thousands , he almost swept the current back . And what is perhaps most impressive of all , he so far retained the confidence and affection of his opponents that they elected him a chief officer of their government when they had established it . The same qualities that made Stephens acceptable in general social and political circles , made him deeply bele% cd in the more intimate relations of life . He never married . Yet children were very dear to him , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twice at least he was in love . In the first case poverty as well as health obliged him to control his passion . The second time , he was already in Congress and well-to-do in the world . The match was suitable and the lady , it seems , not unwilling . But he would not ask her to marry so frail a bit of humanity . ' A woman 's due , ' he thought , ' was a husband on whom she could lean , and not an invalid whom she must nurse . ' It was , perhaps , a mistake for him and her both . At any rate , it added to his bitterness of spirit . Once again one is reminded of Leopardi . In every way Stephens was a man to whom affection meant much . He had the deepest love for home , for Georgia , her hills and streams and forests . His outcry for her from his Northern prison is poignant in its pathos : ' Let my days he brought to an end in my own native land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ! My native land , my country , the only one that is country to me , is Georgia . The winds that sweep over her hills are my native air . There I wish to live , and there to die . ' His home farm may be barren , may be simple . It has neither luxury nor splendor . But to him it is everything . When a young man , just beginning life , with boundless ambition , a good opening and large salary were offered him away from home . But he unhesitatingly preferred to practice in his native town , although earning only a few hundred dollars a year . And in old age and captivity , as he turned generally to Georgia , so he longed most of all for the remembered haunts of youth and happiness . ' That old homestead and that quiet lot , Liberty Hall , in Crawfordsville , sterile and desolate as they may seem to others , are bound to me by associations tender as heart-strings and strong as hooks of steel . ' These local affections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are men ? men especially ? who , if they can live where they will , care little with whom they live . It was not so with Stephens . His love for his friends was as deep as his love for home . Among the great number of these friends none was nearer than Robert Toombs , and the marked contrast between the two makes this intimate relation singularly charming . Stephens was little and frail ; Toombs huge and solid . Stephens was a thinker , Toombs a liver . Toombs conquered men ; Stephens charmed them . Very often the two took opposite sides and contended against each other energetically . Yet at the same time they praised , admired , and loved each other , and were never estranged save slightly in the midst of the secession fury . Even then , after Stephens 's great anti-secession speech , Toombs led the cheering for the beloved enemy , though he remarked to a friend who compli- mented him on it , ' I always try to behave myself at a funeral . ' But the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died when he was very young , but his love for his father 's memory has a depth and tenderness which is quite irresistible . Surely few sons could write , in old age , a tribute so impressive and so complete as the following : ' Never was human anguish greater than that which I felt upon the death of my father . He was the object of my love , my admiration , my reverence . It seemed to me impossible that I could live without him ; and the whole world for me was filled with the blackness of despair . . . . Whenever I was about to do something that I had never done before , the first thought that occurred to me was , what would my father think of this ? . . . The principles and precepts he taught me have been my guiding-star through life . ' Even deeper and more absorbing was Stephens 's love for his young half-brother , Linton , whom he educated , trained , and advised through boyhood and young manhood , and who afterward became his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes and sorrows and desires , both public and private . Linton himself was a man of great ability , deservedly prominent in political life . He was also a man of singular charm , as fully appears from Waddell 's excellent life of him . To have been looked up to and worshiped by such a man is not the least of Stephens 's claims upon our interest , and the elder brother returned the devotion of the younger with all the passion of a heart keenly sensitive and not distracted from its sole object by either wife or child . The perpetual recurrence of Linton 's name in his brother 's letters and diary almost recalls Madame de Sevigne 's unlimited adoration of her daughter . ' Oh , if I had Linton with me now , how full would be my joy not- withstanding I am a prisoner ! How light is my burden compared with what it has been ! The full dawn of day is certainly upon me ! May the sun of my deliverance soon arise ! Oh , may Linton soon come ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further in a notable tenderness for animals , especially for dogs . Stephens had always one or more of these to tend , to confide in , or to frolic with . When absent from home , he writes of them with a solicitude which is sometimes amusing , but more often pathetic . Over the blindness of one of them , Rio , he sorrows as over the affliction of a friend . He walks with Rio , to guide the dog 's steps , and he buries him with a touch as characteristic in its simple vanity as in its profound emotion . ' The world will never see another Rio . And few dogs ever had , or ever will have , such a master . Over his grave I shed a tear , as I did over him frequently as I saw nature failing . ' Perhaps it is possible to overdo this matter of sympathy with animals . It seems to some of us that the universal pity of the nineteenth century rather tended to increase the aggregate of sentient woe than to diminish it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for it , especially as he was not aware of the huge maleficence with which later investigation was to load that domestic parasite . But when Stephens mourns over the necessary destruction of prison bedbugs , he seems to push altruism to the edge of the ludicrous ? and over . ' I have often felt sorry for what I have to do to these bloodsuckers . Most willingly would I turn them loose and let them go away , if they would go and stay , but this they will not do . Between them and me. therefore , there is an irrepressible conflict . Either I or they must be extinguished . ' Iii the more important field of pity for human suffering , and of attempts to relieve the wretched and to assist the struggling and down-trodden , we can ha% e nothing but admiration for Stephens 's persistent endeavor . He does , indeed , as with regard to Rio above , indulge in very frank statement of his own merit in this kind : ' While I have been here I have with free will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for the benefit of others than I have for myself , which is more than many mortals I ever knew could say for themselves . ' But the merits require no such emphasis . They are great and indisputable . Probably few persons of his means have done more for others than Stephens did . He was constantly educating young men , so that all those of promise in his home town appealed to him , and many from outside . During the war he was devoted in his attendance at prisons and hospitals , visiting them often with fruit and flowers , which , I think , was providing a charming function for that generally useless functionary , a vice-president . Whenever I see a head at an iron grate , my heart is interested , ' he wrote before he had passed four months behind an iron grate himself . It is worth noting that one of the points in which he differed from the government was his belief that prisoners of war should be set free , since the Confederacy was not able to provide for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his heart outran his head , who will blame him ? It is worth while to be fooled occasionally by vice and idleness , worth while to be ' like a ship otherwise staunch but eaten up by barnacles that he can not dislodge , ' for the sake of winning the slave 's simple eulogy : ' He is kind to folks that nobody else will be kind to . Mars Alex is kinder to dogs than mos ' folks is to folks . ' It is to be observed , further , that Stephens 's charity went much back of the hand . Oftentimes the fingers are spread widely when the heart is tight shut , and some who are ready to give to a beggar are less ready to forgive an enemy . Stephens had no real enemies . In all that bitter time I meet few besides Lincoln and Lee who speak of those opposed to them with such unfailing kindliness . It is indeed interesting that one of Lincoln 's many efforts at conciliation before the struggle , should have been his well-known correspondence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . In all the vast length of Stephens 's book on the war I do not think there is a sentence of bitterness toward the North , or even toward those Northerners who had taken most part in bringing on the conflict . This tone of tolerance is still more marked in dealing with friends than with enemies . Coming fresh from the reading of so many volumes of reminiscences which were harsh and bitter , filled with striving to justify the author at the expense of all those who had fought side by side with him , I was especially impressed with Stephens 's gentleness and courtesy . He disagreed with many . He was estranged from none . Even of Davis , whose policy he thought absolutely wrong , he has no unkind or cruel personal criticism . They met as friends , he says , and they parted as such . I doubt not that all ? the President , the Cabinet , and Congress ? did the best they could from their own conviction of what was best to be done at the time . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few are ready to make it ! The root of this kindly and universal tolerance is to be found in a cardinal principle of Stephens 's nature which it is now time to take up and investigate . He was essentially an intellectualist , and guided his life , far more than most men do , by systematic reasoning . I have already made it quite clear that this does not mean that he was cold or insensible . Most certainly he was not . Neither does it mean that he had the calm , dispassionate , scientific spirit of the nineteenth century , which observes all facts curiously without special eagerness to relate them to preconceived theories . Stephens was a deductive thinker of an older type . He reasoned from accepted generalizations to very positive conclusions . And even in this line his thinking was neither profound nor original . In his letters he is perpetually turning over rather glaring commonplaces , and the comparison of his diary with Amiel 's , which I have already suggested , will show at once that the Southern statesman had very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a tumult of passions and preconceptions and prejudices , he strove mightily to clear his mind of cant , to get at the conclusions of calm reason as to the terrible questions put before him , and then to act on those conclusions singly , honestly , unflinchingly , with absolute disregard of party , or tradition , or convention . In a time when the still voice of thought was well-nigh drowned in the furious outcry of politicians and fanatics , surely this quality must be counted unto Stephens for righteousness . It was this which made him so patient with those who differed from him , this which made him so genuinely humble and modest . He reasoned to his own conclusions and acted on them . But others had their own conclusions and must act on them . Oddly enough this very intellectual tendency which made him modest made him vain ; as we have exactly the same tendencies exhibited in Cicero , one of the most confirmed intellectualists who ever lived , and placed in times and situations quite similar to Stephens 's . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his opponent may be right and to feel that his opponent , and everybody else , should recognize the simple fact of Cicero 's own power and achievement . In Stephens the vanity is of course in no way so colossal as Cicero 's , but the allowance for possible error on his own part is as large and fine as ever in any man . ' It may be that if the course which I thought would or could then save it the Confederate Government , or would or could have saved it at any time , had been adopted , it would have come as far short of success as the one which was pursued ; and it may be , that the one which was taken on that occasion , as well as on all the other occasions on which I did not agree , was the very best that could have been taken . ' How refreshing that is in all the jar and clash of positive assertions and violent opinions and dogmatic assurance of a world of might-have-beens . One should read . also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole burden of the government , in the event of Davis 's death , should fall upon the vice-president 's shoulders . The clear appreciation of the abstract end to be attained is no finer than the full recognition of the immense difficulties and his own unfitness to encounter them . Yet if Stephens was modest where he admitted the possibility of error , he was rocklike when he had deduced his conclusions , knew his ground , and felt that he was right . An interruption during his celebrated answer to Campbell of Ohio brought out one of those tremendous sentences in which a man strips his whole character bare all at once . ' You are wrong in that , ' interjects Campbell . ' No , sir , ' replies Stephens . ' I am never wrong upon a matter I have given as close attention to as I have given to this . ' So a god might answer . And he would stand by these intellectual conclusions to the issue of life or death . Huge Judge ' , Cone had called Stephens a traitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Judge 's face . They met . The Judge demanded a withdrawal . Stephens refused and struck . There was an instant collision . Cone pulled out a knife and slashed his opponent again and again , got him down , and cried , ' Retract , or I 'll cut your damned throat . " Never ! ' said Stephens , ' cut , if you like . ' He caught the descending knife-blade in his bare hand , which was cut to pieces , and he went to the hospital , when his adversary was pulled off , with eighteen knife-thrusts in his body and arms . The man simply could not say that he nas wrong when he knew he was right . It is like the legend ) of Galileo , who succumbed to the gentle persuasions of the church and yet whispered , ' E pur si mum . ' It is most interesting to follow out this intellectual tendency in the different phases of Stephens 's life . To begin With , he was a man of system and exactness . Manifold and varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arranged his time according to a schedule and gave certain hours to certain pursuits . Moreover , he had a fine memory for minute details , and was always strong in dealing with figures and statistics . Art and the artistic side of literature seem to have had little interest for him . His reading , which was both careful and extensive , was mainly in history and in lines of practical thinking and morals . So with the natural world . He had , as already noted , a profound , instinctive love for the surroundings that mean home . Beyond this he was chiefly interested in minute observation of the weather , and takes just pride in having been the means of publishing the reports of the weather bureau which have since become of such immense value to the country . As regards religion , I have already pointed out its significance to Stephens on the emotional side of his nature . He always retained a faith in the literal interpretation of the Bible which was perhaps rather old-fashioned even in his day . Yet in some quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is evident from his diary that he had a strong disposition to submit religious views to the strict intellectual tests which he applied to other matters . It seems odd at first , yet it is really characteristic , that with this tendency he should have combined a strong tincture of superstition . His diary contains numerous discussions of good and ill luck , and he takes an undeniable interest in seeing the new moon over the right shoulder . ' If there is anything in signs , I shall certainly have good luck this moon . ' In his own profession of the law Stephens 's fine intellectual sincerity stands out fully , and well proves that success requires neither dishonesty nor shuffling . What business do you follow , Alex ? ' said his uncle to him in the early days . ' I am a lawyer . ' After an ominous silence the uncle spoke again . Alex , do n't you have to tell lies ? ' Alex did not have to tell lies . Hear what he says , reviewing his career in old age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his client 's case what he knows is not such ; any code of morals justifying him in this does not deserve the name . ' And again , more personally , ' My rule from the time I was admitted to the bar was : first , to investigate a case submitted to me , to inquire into the facts and the law applicable to it ; then , if I did not believe the party entitled to success before the court , I told him so and declined to appear or prosecute the case . ' ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS Stephens believed that the object of law was justice , and that the lawyer 's high function was to reconcile differences and remedy evils . He detested prejudice of party , or locality , or class , or station . This feeling he carried so far that it led him into a singular tirade against what is surely a most worthy and respectable portion of the community . If I am ever to be tried for anything , may Heaven deliver me from a jury of preachers ! . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that charity which they , above all men , should not only preach but practice . ' And elsewhere he speaks of ' the usual bloodthirsty propensity ' of that calling . ' Stephens 's religion was different enough from Voltaire 's . Yet here one would think Voltaire was speaking . It was in politics , however , that Stephens 's natural characteristics came to their fullest fruition . As a speaker he was much praised , and was effective and successful . ' All lungs and brains , ' one admirer said of him . But to me the most impressive eulogy is Lincoln 's . Think of winning these words from such a source . ' I take up my pen to tell you that Mr. Stephens , of Georgia , a little slim pale-faced consumptive man , has just concluded the very best speech of an hour 's length I ever heard . My old withered dry eyes are full of tears yet . ' Nevertheless , Stephens mistrusted oratory , as one who knew its dangerous power . When he had conviction with him he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction was essential . Without it the rest was but as a tinkling cymbal . Where conviction led him he would go , no matter what friend deserted him or what party disclaimed him . He argued for the abolition of his own seat in Congress . He told the South that their agitators had done more than anything else to bring on the war . He fought secession with all his might . At the same time he was an ardent advocate of slavery , believing ? with Lee ? that slavery presented the most satisfactory solution of the difficult relation between blacks and whites , and that it was the duty of the superior race to protect and care for the inferior . On behalf of his state he resented the usurping attitude of the Richmond government . Yet when the Governor of the state began to do what the President had done , Stephens was just as hot in opposition . All these things he did in perfect good temper and kindliness , and he could not understand why his opponents would not take it so . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were acting from theirs . Why should they be angry with him ? Yet they were , and too many of his compatriots sympathized with the caustic remark of General Taylor : ' Mr. Stephens , with all the impartiality of an equity judge , marked many of the virtues of the Government north of the Potomac and all the vices of that on his own side of the river . ' First , last , and always the compass of Stephens 's political life was his belief in human liberty as expressed in the compact between sovereign states known as the Constitution . Admirably characteristic is the account of his first interview with President Jackson . Stephens expressed some doubt as to the action of the troops against the Indians in view of State jurisdiction . Jurisdiction by the Eternal ! When the United States Mail is robbed and citizens murdered ! ' shouted the Presi-dent . But Stephens was ready to be murdered himself rather than give up a principle . Why should not others be ? I really believe he would have preferred being torn to pieces by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is fine , but is perhaps carrying intellectualism rather far . So after the war . He was ready to accept the result and to work loyally for the future . But he could not give up the principle ? never . And he wrote his immense two-volumed book , ? d ialogued , thoroughly Platonic , thoroughly intellectual , ? in which , as in Plato , men of straw are set up to be bowled over by masterly dialectic ; a learned book , an awe-inspiring book , as dead as a folio of eighteenth-century sermons . In short , he was an idealist ? an ideologue , Napoleon would have said ? who would have introduced reason into this chaos of unreason , this curious and fascinating Inferno which we call life . Because life would not heed him he resented it , but in the gentlest and most affectionate fashion , returning good for evil in every way he knew . In the political world , where he figured most , he seems to have been-pitifully ineffectual . We saw in our study of Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow opportunism , prevented him from making any distinguished mark on the history of his time . Curiously enough , in Stephens 's case , the same result followed from an exactly opposite cause , and the excess of conviction most nobly nullified a prominent and notable career . But I feel sure that posterity will adjust the difference , and that Stephens will grow more and more in our history as a figure of commanding purity , sincerity , distinction , and patriotism .
