txt Queens Telephone Service . I have read with interest the statement concerning the proposed plan of the telephone company to reduce Its rates . Residents of the Boroughs of Manhattan . Bronx , and Brooklyn certainly will greatly benefit by the imaginary ton barriers being disposed of . But how about the residents of Queens County ? I reside at Woodhaven and under the proposed plan of reduction I would be entitled to service north to Whitestone or College Point . a distance of about elx or seven miles , east to Floral Park . a distance of about eight miles , and south to Rockaway , a distance of about five or six miles , but if I telephoned one mile west I would encounter the " barrier " line and have to pay an extra toll , Residents . In the exchanges of Richmond Hill and Jamaica , In my judgment , would prefer some Brooklyn service rather than " College Paint " and other outlying sections where phone calls are few and far between from Jamaica and Richmond Could the telephone company not divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local service to Brooklyn . and subscribers on the northern boundary similar service , and have the " toll sine " in Queens County instead of the " county line ?
