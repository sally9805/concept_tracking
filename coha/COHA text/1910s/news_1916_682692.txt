There was riLich comment about the attitude Mr. H wiles assumed . Mr. Hughes suppleihented his speeches , In which he said he was not " too proud to fight " to protect the lives and property of American citizens on land and on sea , by making clear his position in regard to the speech delivered on Thursday evening at Lewiston , Me. , by Theodore Roosevelt , in whicu the Colonel raked tile hyphenates tore and aft . The candidate is with the Colonel and approves of what lie said , arid that was the message Mr. Hughes intended to convey in the telegram he suit horn Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his speech . Mr. Hughes told THE NEW fors TIMES correspondent this , afternoon that his telegram to Colonel Roosevea was to be taiten absolutely at its lace value , and that it was dm ; Patched with a full knowledge of the words Colonel Roosevelt had uttered . Mr. Hughes did not use the words " hyphenate " or " pro-German , " but throughout his addresses he laid great emphasis on the need for national unity and patriotism , and at each mention of these topics his voice was loud and his gestures emphatic . First at Clayton , where he spoke to 3,000 persons , mostly of German extraction , and later at the coliseum tonight , he made these state-ments : No Reason to Get Into War , " We have in this country the driving force of a splendid . patriotic feeling . 1 have observed throughout the land how eager the people are to show the intensity of their devotion to the Institutions of our country . There is no lack of patriotic sentiment in the United States .

" It is said that this Administration has kept us out of war . There was not the slightest reason why any one should get us into war . You could not get this country into war without making most inexcusable blunders . No one wants war with the United States , every one is disposed to be friendly to the United States , we are disposed to be friendly to all peoples , we have no policies which should bring us Into serious strife . But we have honest rights , and , so far as I am concerned , I am not too proud to fight to maintain honest rights . We stand for the ' firm maintenance of all American rights with respect to American citizens both on land and sea We propose that the rights of American citizens shall be maintained wherever they are . " The telegram sent by Mr. Hughes to Colonel Roosevelt had come-as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meetings , delivered with undisguised vehemence , left them in a quandary . At first they were disposed not to think too harshly of Mr. Hughes because of his telegram , although there were some leaders who did not like it at all . When Mr. Hughes got through talking they were free to admit that his message to Roosevelt was important . Disappointed In Hughes . Leaders of the Republican Party in Missouri , headed by Mayor Henry Kiel , City Committee ChairmanJohn Schmoll , and Walter S. Dickey , nominee for United States Senator , had predicted upon the arrival of Mr. Hughes that he would get the solid vote of the citizens of German extraction , who form a large percentage of the voting population of the State . These voters , they said , were bitter against President Wilson because of his International policy , and , as Mr. Dickey expressed it , policy , could not be pried loose from Hughes with a battle-axe . " All of them were not so sure tonight after reading the Roosevelt speech and Mr. Hughes 's telegram of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were still sure that the vote would be cast against Wilson , but there was a certain sense of di appointment over the altitude assumed by Mr. Hughes . ' Mr. Spmoll : said he - did not believe the telegram sent to Colonel Roosevelt - would make any difference , adding : " There are 50.000 citizens of German origin in St. Louis , and more than 60,000 in the State . They 'll vote for Hughes . " Two citizens of German extraction who did not want their names used because they are not in politics except to defeat Wilson said , after hearing the Clayton address , that they were not so sure of the situation as Mr. Sehmoll seemed to be . They bad started thinking that way they said . as soon as they heard of the telegram to Colonel Roosevelt ; they did n't like Wilson , and they did n't like any one who hitched up with Roosevelt or congratulated him for his attacks on German-Americans . Altogether they were in a bad way to find a candidate who met all their requirements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some Republicans who are not of German origin said it would help Mr. Hughes in the end , and that the German-Americans could not control the . politics of ihie State or any other . They pointed to the fact that e loudest cheering at the meeting at the Clayton Court House was heard when Mr. Hughes . by inference at least , assailed the killing of American men , women , and children by German submarines . Democrats Encouraged . Some of the Democratic leaders , who had feared the strength of the antiWilson sentiment among the GermanAmericans here , were hopeful that the happenings of the day would help their ticket in this State at least . The Democrats here seem satisfied that they are going to carry the State . although they do not think the margin will be a very large one . Mr. Hughes got here at 8:30 A. M. and was met by . a crowd of about .1,000 at the railroad station . He refused to ride in a dosed automobile which had been provided for him , per instructions given by advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm in invalid , " he exclaimed . He climbed into the , automobile assigned to the Secret Service men . There was little cheering in the streets . Surrounded by Mayor Kiel , Schmoll , and others of German extraction , Mr. Hughes went first to the Jefferson Hotel and then to the Planters to hold a reception . Mrs. Hughes accompanied ' him . A delegation of suffragists met Mr. Thighes at the Planters Hotel and demanded a speech . Among them was Mrs. Charles P. Johnson . " GiVO us something to remember you by , " theypleaded . " I have not time to make a speech , " Pelted Mr. Hlmhes . " You know what I said in the West . My heart is with you . Mrs. Johnson was not satisfied with that His heart may be with us , but we event his head . too . " she exclaimed . An effort to get Mrs. Hughes to express her views also was made . She told the-women that the role of camaigner belonged to her husband , and slusliad nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a luncheon at the Missouri Athletic Club , where he made ' an address , and from there to Clayton , where he spoke trom the Court House lawn .

Coliseum tonight a crowd of 10.1300 .. persons gave-Mr . Hughes a demfOrarteilliTilinutea. : at kind the nominee had faced . The scene was spectacular . Every one had been sup- , Plied with an American flag . One hundred men and women dressed in red ; white , and blue marched up and down the aisles . It was much like the welcome given to President Wilson early in the year in the same hall . although the demonstration lasted longer . Despite the noisy welcome , there were about TOO empty seats in the balconies . During the demonstration Mr. and Mrs. Hughes led in singing " The StarSpangled Banner " and " America . " Both were waving flags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 30,000 St. Louis voters of German extraction . There were demonstrations also for Mayor Kiel and Judge Lamm , Republican nominee for Governor , both of German blood . Mr. Hughes opened his address by saying , ? This sounds like election night " He spoke at length on his stand on child-labor legislation and the safeguarding of women in industries . He was amazed , he said , by the claims made by- the Administration and charged that the Child Labor laws , just passed . affected only a small number of children . We must protect the future of the race by safeguarding the youth and women . " he said . " There is nothing I desire so much as the betterment of human life . " Mr. Hughes in his talk referred repeatedly to points made by President Wilson in his acceptance speech today . " I protest . " Mr. Hughes said , ' ' against the extravagant claim that the Antitrust act was clarified by definition by our opponents . They folded themselves upon a vague phrase and presented that as the solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child labor legislation you would suppose they had discovered the children , " said Mr. Hughes . " I am for the protection of the children  --  Was for it before the present Administration was heard of . Refers to His Albany Record . " I want to read to you , " said the nominee , " what a Governor of a State ' said to a Legislature nine years ago . He said in 1907 : ' I recommend to your careful consideration the important subject of child labor . Laws for the protection of children in securing for them their rights through an elementary education and in surrounding them with appropriate safeguards make an especial appeal to human sentiment , and nothing should be left undone to give them full effect . ' That I said in the State of New York nine years ago . " Mr. Hughes referred to child labor legislation enacted during his term as Governor of New York . The nominee declared that the business man had a right to know what he could and could not do . " Here we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suppose allusion is made to the Federal Trade Commission law . I have no quarrel with the composition of the Trade Commission law , but I can not accept the crude statement or Suggestion that the Anti-trust law has been clarified by definition . It is said in the Federal Trade Commission act that unfair methods of competition in commerce are hereby declared unlawful . Now what are unfair methods of competition ? Naturally a man in the street would think about fraud . It is not necessary to establish a trade commission to deal with fraud . Fraud has been recognized by the common law since its institution . " No , they are not thinking of fraud . Unfair competition has a different meaning from fraud under the law . It is a time-honored phrase . We know what It means . In a very simple way of statement , it may be said to havi1 relation to methods by which one man 's goods are palmed off as the goods of another man , through deceptive statements in advertising and the like . Those things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law passed to reach them ? Of course not . Talk about clarifying the antitrust law by definition , why there is not a business man in the country who knows what that act means or what he should do or should not do under it . ' ? I complain of the extravagant claims made with respect to the clarification of the law in the alleged interest of business when nothing of the sort has been done and , the . net expresslysistates ' : thitt.withing of the sort waa , attimapted : You can not mislead the American people by claims of that description . " Mr. Hughes assailed the Administration 's Mexican policy . Wilson 's Stand Toward Muerte . " We said to Huerta not simply that he would not be recognized but that ? he should not even be a candidate at a Mexican election . Is that the way we deal with a great and powerful State ? Do we dictate who shall be candidates of great and powerful States ? What Is the use of talking about treating email and weak States in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from principle and get ourselves in- I volved in serious difficulties by the departure , when we attempt to control Mexican politics , instead of adopting the ; straight course of protecting the lives and . property of American citizens ?
