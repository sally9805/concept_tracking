txt George E. Davis , one of . the men most actively concerned in the ironworkers ' dynamiting conspiracy , was arrested here yesterday . He was held on a charge of conspiring to transport dynamite illegally from this city to Mount Vernon , but his arrest is considered by the Federal authorities to be a matter of the highest importance as according to the charge the conspiracy is said to be still in existence . During the dynamite trial at Indianapolis Davis was referred to continually under the name of O'Donnell . In a remarkable confession he has admitted that he was responsible for an extraordinary series of outrages which occurred early in 100S . As a result of his statements it has been established that if the had not made their confession as they did a series of dynamite explosions would have taken place simultaneously in all parts of the country .

Davis is a tall , strongly built man , with cleanshaven face and dark hair . There is nothing about him to suggest that he would prowl around at night with a hundred pounds of dynamite in a suit case and engage in hand-to-hand fights With watchmen in order to blow up bridges . Foster said yesterday that he believed that Davis acted as he did through some idea that he was doing something praiseworthy for the cause of labor . There is something of the idealist in his face .

Foster attired himself as an ironworker . He recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , however , wrote to him and asked Davis to meet him on a matter of great importance at the Fort Pitt Hotel . He encountered Davis at a critical moment , for Davis had just been halted by the walking delegate of the local union and told that if he did not pay $26 for his union card he would have to quit the job . This . was too much , for Davis , who thought that he had suffered much for the ironworkers ' cause . As he says in his confession : " I was feeling sore at being put off the job and thought the International had deserted me and was trying to get MIS out of the way . Foster seemed to know all my movements and I . decided to make a clean breast of matters . " At the Fort Pitt Hotel Foster confront.d Davis when he called with all he had ' done in the last few months .

Be lSpent the afternoon in the room of the Marshal and left last night for Indianapolis , where his case will be brought before the United States Grand Jury .

The confession of Davis begins by describing the methods of the " Entertainment Committee " of the Iron Workers Union . This committee consisted , he said , of ten or twelve members . Their duties were to " beat up " non-union men , for which- they received regular pay of $5 a day . Davis later in his confession ' aIleges that there was a standing price for " beating up " the foreman of an open shop job . If it " was done thoroughly enough to put the foreman in the hospital e150 was paid for the job . At the same time it seems to have beeen recognized as an inferior wort of work for when it was suggested to Davis , he alleges that Frank C. Webb ; a member of the International 's Executive Board remarked to him : " You had better not engage in it . It ' ould spoil you for the other work . " Davis - says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . N. J .. and then he seems to have entered upon a steady six months of causing explosions , mainly in the ? vicinity of this city . Continuing his confession , Davis says that on Dee . 2e , 1907 , he blew up the railroad bridge. , on the Newark branch of the Erie . near Harrison , N. J. John . T. , he says , sent .5200 to Local Union 40 for this job . Davis says that , accompanied by Webb , he went to Philadelphia . and there bought from Michael J. Cunnane forty pounds of 60 per cent , dynamite , with fuse and caps , for $50 . Davis says he did the job alone and reported his success to Webb . Webb , he says in his confession , handee him the rest of the 5200 , and Davis returned $30 " as a Christmas present " Plan to Blow Up Queensboro Bridge . Shortly thereafter Webb and Davis , according to the confession , went and leaked over the Queensboro Bridge , or , as it was then called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert opinion that it would take 200 pounds of dynamite to wreck this work-100 pounds at each pier . He made careful preparations for the job . He took a room at First Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street , where he could overlook the work , and then made reconnaissances , climbing the piers under cover of darkand even placing some of the dynamite . Meanwhile he was dickering with the union for what he should get for his mork . The first offer was Stec. but he . demanded $1.500 . The union agreed to pay that sum and Laois then : mid he must have e2,5cm . This was the final price , hut as the bargain was being struek he discovered that under the bridge was a power house , in which at all times were from twenty to thirty firemen at work . Davis refused to go on with the dynamiting on the ground that he would not kill these workers . Webb , he said , called him " chickenhearted. " but Davis remained firm . The dynamite he had laid he removed and the explosion never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " You 've got to give Davis credit for two things . He never would blue. , up anything that would risk any life or limb , and he was willing to take chances which Mc ? Janigal and never risked . Why , they used alarm clocks and were miles away before the explosion took place . George only used a fuse ten feet or so long and stayed right by where he could see that the explosion came off . Once he was in a saloon in Philadelphia six blocks or so from where he had lighted the dyne. - mite fuse , and he waited until all the windows were blown out . Then he went to ; another saloon which had itsgelatfe deer smashed In . " ' Did that boiler explosion smash do that ? ' he asked the barkeeper . " ' No , ' said the barkeeper , ' it was n't the explosion . It was the coon . He ' just jumped clean through the door when the noise came . ' " As the detective told this story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feb. 11 , LOOS , Davis tried to blow up the Scherzer drawbridge , near Pelham . On March 25 he dynamited the railroad bridge of the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad Company near Bradshaw , Md. , for which he received $100 . On April 6 he blew up Pier 58 , North River , for which he received 5200 . On April 13 he caused nn explosion in the Philadelphia yards of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company . Sent to Look for Jobs . He seems by this time to have established his reputation , and he says that on reporting to Webb in this city he was sent off to look for possible Jobs . " There is a lot of work in the East / should like to find out about , " Davis represents Webb as saying to him , and it . was agreed that while on tour Davis should receive SS a day . He visited Pell River , Providence , and one other place in four days . As a result of his report Webb sent him off to blow up Siades Ferry Bridge at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis , cent $50 by telegraph , and Jones , who was also arrested yesterday , is represented by Davis as saying to him that that was not enough . Webb , he asserted . was receiving from the International $150 for each job , and was not passing sufficient of it on to the man who was taking the risk . That there was a good deal of danger was proved on May 21 , when Davis went back to try again to blow up the Scherzer Drawbridge . He was accompanied by a man called Big Rudy , and they carried two suitcases of explosives . Had Fight with ' Watchman . " At the time of arranging for the explosion , " says the literal confession , / ' had a fight with the watchman on the sob , a number of shots were fired , and a suitcase containing 100 sticks of dynamite dropped in the canal . Saw Webb the next day and he said , ' ' What 's the matter with you ? You want to watch Met ; how many of you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only me and Big Bundy . ' Webb said , ' Is that so in the papers , where somebody got wounded ? What did you do with the suitcase ? ' Davis told him , and Webb replied , ' Find it , ' and Davis told him , ' I am pat going back . ' " It was proved at the Indianapolis trial that the suitcase had been found where Pavis said he dropped it . About two days later , Davis met Frank M. Ryan , President of the Inter . national , and Webb in Third Avenue , near Thirty-fourth Street , and went into a ealoon . The confession then gives this conversation between them : " Ryan said : ' I want to be sure that embody is following us . ' Then directing his remarks to Davis , he said : ' you are going it pretty strong . Are you trying to , commit suicide ? Who got shot ? ' . Davis replied : ' Nobody got shot , ' and then detailed what occurred in the fight with officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going it pretty strong . It 's all right , but do n't get picked up . ' " Then Ryan , directing his conversation to Webb , said : ' What 's the matter with the fool ? Why did n't he open the case ? ' Webb replied : ' He had a ? great chance opening the case when the fellow was shooting at him ' Then Ryan mild : ' Were there any marks on the staff or on the suitcase ? Where did - you get the suitcase ? ' Davis told him theie were no marks on the dynamite , end : told where he purchased the suit , ease . " Br another conversation with Ryan ( .. resident of the International , ) and after several jobs had been blown up , Ryan said : ' You are wotlanc9. very fast here . You must be a wizard to do so many jobs and have such good luck , and not be caught at it . ' " - I- The next few days were employed by - Davis at rite direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn. , and am Providence . They did nothing , and ' Davis remarks " that job was a hoodoo . ' However , he returned to Providence on June 4 , , l ' , X1S ; - - and caused an egAieeeteeteif soMeewograbelog carried - - on by the Phoenix Company with so short a fuse that he was only four blocks away when the explosion occurred . This was his last job for a long lime as he was arrested at Somerset . Mass. , and convicted on the charges of assault with intent to kill and of causing an explosion , and was . sentenced to serve three sears in prison . He was released in March . 1911 , it is believed through political influence , and Mr. Miller , the Indianapolis District Attorney , said yesterday that it was a curious thing that every arrangement had been made to arrest him again as he left the jail , but he evaded the officers waiting for him . On his release Davis received funds from the International Union , through Webb , he says , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days before he was arrested . They talked over the explosions ceased by the other and , and John J. instructed Davis in the use of the alarm clock . Davis then tells of his wanderings . On Sept. 26 , 1911 , lie was sent to Mount Vernon to try to destroy some iron work there . He failed , but managed to cause the explosion on Sept. 30 . Many Explosions Were Planned . It then appears from Davis 's confession that in revenge for the arrest of the arid in order to show the authorities that their removal did not necessarily mean the end of dynamiting , a whole series of explosions was planned . It was said yesterday by Mr. Miller that the authorities were assured that the plan was to cause almost simultaneously outrages in San Francisco , Omaha , St. Louis , New York , and two other populous cities . This is how Davis in his confession says the idea was broached to him . " In the Summer of 1911 Webb said to Davis : ' I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company at St. Louis . The Executive Board ( international ) has decided to go ahead with a lot of jobs all over the country . The idea is for you to handle them . You get six or seven fellows you can trust ; you look up the jobs and give the men directions . But do not do any of the blowing up yourself . " Webb then added : ' When you get back from doing that job at St. Louis Frank Ryan will come and we three will plan things out . They are suspicious of Hockln and will not trust nim . The Executive Board is putting it ip to Ryan to handle the work ' " Call Everything Off . Just about this time , however , the confessed , and Davis says he received a telegram from Webb in this city saying , " Call everything off . " Then conies the allegation that the Ironworkers determined to kill William J. Burns , the detective ; Walter Drew and his assistant . Badorf . In his confession Davis thus describes the offer made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in St. Louis . In one conversation with Barry shortly after the confession of the elcelamaras , Barry said : We ought to get Burns . Drew , and Badorf . ' Davis told Barry about Badorf , being after him at Fall River . Barry said : ' Our local is strong financially and willing to stand part of the cost . ' Barry was an officer of the local . " After Davis returned to New York from St. Louis . he met Webb , who said : ' A price has been fixed of 53.000 for Badorf and . $5,000 for Drew . How would you be on earning some of this /enemy ? ? getting Burns , for instance ? ' Davis said : ' I have n't any money for expenses , and do n't know Burns . ' Then Webb said : ' We can fix it up M advance expense money . Burns is out at San lernacisco . You can go out and trail him around , and get a chance to get him . ' Davis replied : ' I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " On these facts the Government will base the accusation that the conspiracy Is still existing and evidence is likely to be produced that during the trial of the dynamiters at Indianapolis they received SS a day from the union while they were in court , and t'nat since they have been in jail they have received $30 a week .
