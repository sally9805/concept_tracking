N the Executive Cha ? - ber of a state capitol a short time ago , where members of a conven-tion of State Defense committees were com-paring notes and listen-ing to the Govei nor ? it might have been any capitol or any Governor in the country ? a man arose and said that he thought America did not have a fighting spirit . At once they were ready to argue him down upon one conclusion : The draft ! The big human thing that has intruded upon living , dying , marry-ing , and new-born babies , probably the only thing in the history of the country that has so intruded and been welcome . The spirit manifested toward it has been the greatest surprise America ever had . No one dreamed that " compul-sory military service " would go through the country as smoothly and regularly as men breathe . The mere word " draft " had a bad start with its adverse psychological connotation . Draft here-tofore seemed to mean tossing up to determine the unfortunate person who was to attend to a tag-end or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some were wont to think of Ireland , where " draft " has meant riot at the drop of the hat . The last generation went back to Civil War times , when the draft caused a turmoil in the country hardly less than war itself . Then there were riots and fights . Editors , politi-cians , and men of note helped to create dissension . Conscripts bought release for a few hundred dollars . And although there was a physical test and an age limit , beyond these draft selection was short-sighted . The whole draft law of the Civil War was a failure . But more than the memory of trouble in 1863 , or in Ireland , the idea of a draft to Yankee young bloods ordinarily signifies simonpure compulsion . This time an impulse was born in the national consciousness powerful enough to overcome the resentment which compulsion engenders in the average American . By the force of this impulse the age-old tradition of odium was stripped from the draft overnight . The service call went out to nine and a half millions of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here am I. Take me . " It came like one voice ? speaking for men who had joined hands . Back of it was to he found a case of national psychology , reflecting nearly every aspect of national . life and ideals . When you have had your eye close to the draft , to speak of it as national this and national that seems almost a blunder . Every number drawn was taken home to Robinson Crusoe 's island , there to stay with its own problems until brought to the local board , that number 's lair of high priests . When General E. H. Crowder , Provost-Marshal-General , laid out the plan , with its district and local draft boards , and uniform regulations for all , he saw that this step would strike the homes first ; that a man 's first conception of the draft would be its relation to conditions within four walls . If there had been outcries from these homes , then riots and uproar would have followed , and the draft might have proved to he as disturbing as first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again it would have had plenteous criticism and comment . But there were practically no anti-draft demonstrations ; and no scandals other than those participated in by a few second-rare physicians who would do second-rate things wherever placed . Nothing has happened to make headlines ; nothing but the operation of a punctilious military machine working from questionnaire to examination , to camp ? a steady flow of unperturbed streams front . Historians undoubtedly will point to this as a never-to-be-forgotten benefit from " preparedness . " The country was prepared for something very different as the result of the peremptory call . " I sat for one month with a loaded pistol in my pocket , " said the chairman of a local board for a large and complicated suburban district . But to sit and be a human holster was all the use he had for the weapon . Many cities arranged after the National Guard left to have access to a regiment or companies of regulars to help in dealing with anticipated draft emergencies . Working with secret-service men , the police were forearmed with absolute knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounted to a card index of suspected trouble-makers . Home Defense leagues , created as volunteer auxiliary police , trained regularly in ex pectation of being called for draft-riot duty . In many places , inspectors high in the police force lectured to volunteers on the handling of riots . For naught . The draft came . Men were crazy to go . i Some were so anxious that they m-mediately enlisted so that there would not be the slighest suspicion that they waited to serve until they had to . This feeling gradually diminished . The impetus which selective service gave to recruiting was due in great measure to the fact that the boys were poor waiters . As soon as a man came grinning from his successful physical examination , I heard the question asked time and again , " Ca n't you shove me right in ? " There was nothing worse than waiting to be called , except being turned down . Officers took advantage of the psychological reaction of waiting by opening special branches to drafted men , such as tank and aeroplane service , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of them men who had been receiving salaries of a thousand dollars a month . One captain had been head chauffeur for the father of one of the privates . " The kid was tickled to death to serve under him , " the men said . He thought his regiment of motor mechanics the finest in the world . This was but another general reaction . The drafted men also believed they were the flower of the country , handpicked . They became so justly proud of their organization that they even looked down upon the old National Guard because they saw the Guard still in encampments here and there , while they thought they surely soon would be on their way over . To get there quicker , men refrained from sending in questionnaires ; the penalty for delinquency was " immediate service . " This rule did not apply to all delinquents , the majority being foreigners who did not understand and some empty heads . The delinquent population was negligible . On the contrary , local boards had to cope with an eagerness which prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord , to try to exert a little influence to be called , and to write to Washington setting forth special claims . Volunteers came for examination by local boards after having failed to pass the more strict recruiting tests . I saw one , after he had been passed by the local-board physicians , kick up his heels for joy and then rush away to telephone to his father . Not all those who were given the prescribed physical examinations came out and kicked up their heels . Surprises and disappointments awaited them . Bad ears , bad teeth , and numerous irregularities were discovered . Case t , a city man , went in like an innocent lamb and came out knowing that he had a rupture of the neck which might strangle him to death if he coughed violently . Surprised enough ! Case 2 was a country laborer who had not taken time to find out whether he could see heyond the dirtcart he loaded every day . " Ca n't you read any of the letters on the chart ? " asked the examiner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he . His eyesight was going and he did n't know it . Case 3 was told that his heart possessed an accelerated beat and that he must consult the district medical advisory board . He asked what made heart acceleration . " A drink or two will do it , " said the doctor , sadly . On his next examination the report read , " Heart normal , " and olfactory evidence was " all sober . " When possible , physicians volunteered to correct real defects free of charge . Discoveries of illiterates and Americanization cases had attention . One " surprise " took the local board quite off its feet . She was a child wife , nothing more ; only nineteen and had been married a year and a half . Previously , she had been in with her husband , to put in a claim for exemption for him , because all they could earn and save was being put aside for an expected newcomer who " some day would he President of the United States , " of course . To-day she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been too hasty about heralding the newcomer , and now she feared the government would hold her for perjury . All claims of exemption she wanted swept - aside . Her husband would go . He was a good man , who in the parlance of the neighborhood " did not hold out on her " ? hold out his Saturday pay-envelope . " I will go to work , " she said . Ah , but she was too young , the august board decided , and things were too uncertain . Even the board could see that the nation would be in need of Presidents . I believe / witnessed the accumulation of an additional twenty-five per cent . belief in human nature , on the part of a rather cynical member of a board at another " surprise . " A young fellow had been put in Class 3 because his stepfather had abandoned his mother . Young S. returned a few days after filing his statement , and told the board that his father had come back and was supporting the family , so he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disappointment of a " turned down " in the draft were dark and fathomless . Turned down by the draft . It cut . A fellow hated to speak of it . His sister was told not to mention the subject . Bah ! It struck at the pit of his stomach . A pound or two under weight ; or ? have mercy ! ? too fat ; flat feet and all the other disqualifications rankled to the quick . On Staten Island , in New York Harbor , a drafted man already in Class r and about to entrain winced when he had to come before the local board to claim exemption . " Father died suddenly last night . I ca n't go , " he blurted out , as if the double tragedy had almost overpowered him . It was man to man with the board and the boy then ? each understood . What a fluid condition the draft was ! As changeable as life itself ; and dependent upon human nature . Moreover , as men were different , so were their class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the index of class attitudes . I have selected typical men who drifted in to show the relation of racial psychology to the draft . You know the way Americans took it ; they took it like men of ' 76 . And I do not mean to imply here that the hybrid and visiting groups were not good Americans . Their philosophies had a different start , so we must expect somewhat different viewpoints . F. was a soldier who had been in the National Guard during the Mexican maneuvers . He could not re-enlist because of personal obligations , so he took his turn in the draft . But the draft was too slow for him . Hewrote to Washington that lie had liquidated the obligations and asked that he he inducted into the infantry to make use of his National Guard experience . Special dispensation he wanted , so that he could see service at once . And he was to be married on the day after his acceptance came . The American girl had said as much with a quivering underlip . The American girl ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air I could look down and spend a lot of words telling what a part in the draft she played . A brawny wife of a hard-working American man one sunny morning suddenly appeared over the top of the desk of the draft officer . " Jim says , " said she , " have n't ye something for him to do , something special . I can earn a little by washing , and if he 's earning a little and serving , too , you can take out the exemption . " " Well , what does your husband do ? " asked the officer . " Oh , Jim ? He 's a longshoreman working around the docks . " There happened to be a regiment of stevedores being recruited then . Jim was taken in , and several others in the neighborhood with him , who went to handle the shipping end of army operations here and in France . What a rub in the draft ? Jim and the college men , and the ex-convict I ran across : He was standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sore as a pup because he ca n't go , " said one of the men skirting the knot of fellows . The " ex-con. " dropped his head to the man next to him . " They put me in Class 5 , " he muttered , distastefully . " Class 5 , because I have been convicted once or twice . I 'd be a whole lot more use in the army than you fellows . I 've had some experience in handling guns . " The crowd went to the train , leaving the gun expert to walk away with a brooding countenance . That was a city group for you . The country attitude was still different . Before the recent order of the Provost-Marshal granting furloughs during seeding and harvesting time , the farmer 's son wanted to go , but some farmers wanted their boys to help gather the crops " to feed the nation and the Allies , " which had been dinned into their ears as a patriotic duty . That was , and to a certain extent is yet , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , and probably none would change with another . Frenchmen , Scandinavians , Spaniards , Jews , Italians , Irishmen , German-born , and slackers grimly took their troubles to the centers of draft business . There was no one measure for the patriotism or disinterestedness of all of them . The disinterested were few , and will be discussed later . The patriots gave , that was all , and each man 's gift to the country was in ratio to things as they were with him . The smallest gift may have been the largest , and the French boy who could just choke out his answers I should put at the top of the list . He was a waiter , he said , in a French hostelry on the Avenue . Pierre earned enough to support himself and his aged mother . " Claim exemption ? " he was asked as a matter of course . " Ah no , monsieur ! " But he stuttered and hesitated when he answered . His face reddened . The words he uttered were almost inarticulate . i The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before long he was in camp ? out of mind at the draft board . That was a few months ago . The other day an elderly lady ? lady , with crisp white bonnet-strings and a jet breastpin , approached the desk . With difficulty they learned what she wanted . Her larder was empty ? not empty the way you mean ? but empty . She was in want . Was there any way by which Pierre could be returned for a while , with great regret ? " Why , why did n't he claim exemption ? " the board asked , in surprise . She hesitated , too . " It could not be , " she said , in broken English . Only then did the truth dawn upon them ? he was too proud to claim exemption for France . ' The Irish doctor on the examining staff experienced the hard moments of his life if an Irishman came in to claim exemption . How he hated to hear it ! His face grew almost purple and his brogue out of bounds as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coercion , which ofttimes succeeded and sent the occasional Irish exemptionist into Class r forthwith . What kept an Irishman obdurate now and then was his feeling that he might be helping England . But to give prominence to the latter would be putting too much emphasis upon the occasional Irishman . A real , typical Irish hearty was Timothy M. , who was turned down with double hernia marked against him . By January he was back . " Say , boss , " he said , looking the board member squarely in the eye , " Call me up now . Call me up ! I 've had an operation and I 'm fit as Sint Patrick himsilf . " He was a laborer . He 's now down at Camp Upton , the happiest Irishman that ever entrained , they said . It was harder to get the real reaction from the Italian registrants . They were sensitive , reserved , and quiet about their patriotic beliefs . " Why did you put in a clim for exemption ? " inquired a draft officer of a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you want to hang around and see an American boy go off while you sit still and pile up money ? " The fellow mumbled , and after persuasion told his story . At the beginning of the war he was a pharmacist and tried to enlist . Recruiting officers asked him if he had become a citizen , and when he answered that he had not he thought they " kicked him out " without cere-mony . His feelings were hurt . " I am just as good as an American boy , " he said , defiantly . After expert tactics and explanations , matters were smoothed , and in the end the Italian requested to be placed in Class i . Now there is a new pharmacist down at Fort Oglethorpe , Georgia , who feels that the army could not get along without him . The next " case " ? what a poor word ! ? appeared to be a jumble of Italian and English about the children being sick . Two members of the hoard took a hand at piecing together the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The upshot of it was that he had claimed exemption a few weeks before only because his children then were ill . Now they were all right , so he had entered himself in the tank service and wanted a permissive order from the board ! His wife had come with him to sign the waiver of exemption . She said she could do sewing and get along . " Where do I go to get some Red Cross work ? " she asked , as a matter of course . The Spanish types in some instances felt neutral toward the draft , following the strict neutrality of their mother country . Scandinavians to a great extent were already in marine service and offered themselves freely . An interesting situation came up when a German told a local board that his attitude at the beginning of the war had entirely changed because he saw that America was morally right . " fight for the United States if they will call me , " he said . There was no rule which could apply , and he had to be put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans who had taken out their first citizenship papers , who wanted to he in Class i for immediate service . I do n't know of any more interesting phase of the psychology of the draft than was shown by the Jewish young men and their environment , the heart of the Ghetto , a center of socialism and socalled pacifism . You will find here the must marked change of sentiment toward the draft that has occurred . When the first quota left , two thousand weeping persons formed an excited , hysterical mob around a departing group . Women fainted . Children screamed . The school-house was the asylum of dozens of overwrought parents . Not long ago the final quota left . Only a few persons stood by , and they waved quietly . To-day they are selling Liberty bonds , and the old woman who shouted derision at the bond speaker was pursued up the street by an infuriated crowd . Germany 's treatment of Russia in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk took the scale from the eyes of the Jewish ordinary . When the world war began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not help but think that Germany was fighting the old Russia ? the Russia of Nicholas . Therefore , they saw the German side as their own , in a measure . BrestLitovsk changed everything . But the old folks who have come through pogroms and frightfulness still were loath to send all their sons back to them . " I geef you my sons . But leave me one . Just one ? " begged a patriarchal father . The young men were willing to serve ; they came in and asked to go , and I heard one say to a board member : " For God 's sake get us out of here to camp ! We can not stand by and see the old folks go on so . " The old folks had their side . They were born with a philosophy of protest , were more critical and more given to analysis than the average American . " Let them stop the war ! " some said at first , when many of them were opposed to all war . A month or so ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it can not end by saying so . We must fight until there is understanding between the forces of militarism and the forces of peace for which we stand . " A good many of the " slacker " stories have been unfounded or have been explainable upon investigation . Despite the affidavit and the probe into moonlight affairs , board members found that falling in love and marrying went on just about as they did when they were young ? only more so because of the imminent parting . I have seen a real slacker and a scared rabbit , and I do n't know that there was much difference . A foreign young man came in with belladona in his eyes and a pitifully frightened expression . He was ordered hack the next day , when his eyesight was powerful enough and his slackness nearly gone , although he still was trembling from fright . If , when he arrived at camp , he protested that he had scruples , religious or otherwise , against lighting , he would have been put at what the men rudely called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . Such scruples seldom remained unshattered after the drill and camp rigor was under way . The dishwashing stools were left for the next peaceful new-corners . Slackers were easily classified . First , the exceptionally few who held firm anti-war convictions suffered from the misnomer . Second , men whose emotions were played upon by family and friends . Third , young fellows who were scared to death because they knew too little Americanism to understand what the draft was all about . And last , a set of weaklings , God help them ! . . . they get in trouble wherever they go . To such as these , and to others , too , the picture in the headquarters office of a local board was nothing more or less 4 , than the abiding-place of the hand of Fate . In this attitude they entered the room . One glance around confirmed their worst suspicions . Here was an immense filing-cabinet containing " case " papers for every man . Charts of numbers hung on the walls , with mysterious red lines through those called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your hat ? " asked the draft officer of a negro rolling his eyes heavenward for mercy . " No , sah ! " The officer continued : " I changed your address last week . Then what do you want ? Claim exemption ? " " No , sail , not me , sah . Ma fust stop 's Berrrlin ! " The knowing methods of local boards in handling the men often were the result of the experience of the members before they were board officials . They were lawyers , brokers , school-teachers , and men of affairs in communities . The word went around , when the selections for local boards were being made , to keep politicians out . The Committees of National Defense performed valuable service by quietly scrutinizing the field and making recommendations regarding the men available . The ProvostMarshal-General and the state AdjutantGeneral approved the appointments . No finer groups of men ever served their country . Late hours and long , they put in , with no blare attached to the work . As time went on , the local boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communities . They shouldered the difficulties of anything from trying to get a man to support his wife , as he claimed to do in his draft statement , to handing out forceful advice about proper physical care and the waste of good war material when a wife hit her drafted husband on the head with a broom-handle . " Do n't ye forget , now , that I 'll bring ye back a piece of the Kaiser 's mus-tache ' " shouted an Irishman to his board mentor as he left for the train . What he meant was that a ten-thousanddollar consulting engineer had helped a plasterer so much that nothing was too unobtainable for him to try to bring back . When draft business accumulated complexities necessitating an appeal to a higher court , then the papers in the specific cases were sent to the district boards . Here was a different scene . From three members in the local board , the number in the court of appeals was increased to thirty volunteers . Again the members were chosen for their high standing in the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one whose opinions carried undoubted weight . The personnel of the district hoards was divided into committees , so that there would be groups particularly familiar with special industrial work , specialists , in other words , for the special appeals . In the New York board of appeals , presided over by Charles Evans Hughes , about three-quarters of the members were lawyers ; the others were physicians , bankers , heads of corporations , and representatives of labor interests . They heard no cases by personal appearance of drafted men themselves , unless by special dispensation a man talked with the head of the committee handling his case . Occasionally an applicant would come in who insisted that he ought to be sent abroad , when the board considered him better fitted for work here ; or who thought that he could not leave his business until he straightened out his financial affairs . The district board was not disposed to grant such stays . Men could be found to go on with a business , sometimes with fresher and better viewpoint than the incumbent in a rut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopkeeper in Oxford Street , London , who hung out the sign : CLOSED DOWN JOINED UP . When the committees decided upon the proper action on the day 's cases , the chairmen stood before Justice Hughes and read the reports . If there were any points disputed , the members gathered around and voted by holding up their hands . Then they retired to their desks and the drone of the reports went on . Or Justice Hughes would ask : " Has he a child ? " " No . " Enough . His case was settled . Life or death , it might be . Nearly all the claims for exemption were for industrial reasons or because of dependent relatives . The decisions were accepted with grace . On the whole the men felt that the questionnaire system incurred a minimum of injustices . I talked with the chairman of a local board where there were many peculiar industrial problems to be solved . He testified to the satisfaction under the selective-service system . It was definite and yet so flexible that it supplied all the hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge experiment , after all ? a paper scheme that had never been tried out . How it would operate in a decentralized administration no one dared to foretell . It seemed almost hopeless to think of maintaining uniformity among 4,500 different local boards and their district courts , each with dissimilar conditions . But only minor changes were made in the selective-service law as operation showed where improvements could be made . " I expected resentment and trouble , " said the chairman of a suburban district . " Only once or twice in ten months have I had to exercise any authority , and then with nothing back of it , so far as the ordinary ruffian could sec , but the little shield with the letters Selective Service U. S. ' Yet , instant recognition was shown . On April ist I had vised 2,637 cases ; I had seen 2,63o men . Many of them brought from one to five persons with them . With the exception of possibly one or two cases of drunken men , I saw nothing that even approached a rebellious spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of good fortune , or chance . Analysis showed that there were definite psychological reasons for the unparalleled reception of the draft . America had not been the only country fighting in this world war purely for the sake of ideals and principles , for nothing . This idealism infected the land . The old principle of the association of ideas made the children of Flanders represent the American home and all that it meant . Months , and years now , of this struggle , had fastened war-times in the minds of all . The Balkans , Mexico , Belgium , it had been one after the other until the coun-o try was tempered like fine steel to the idea of upholding right , by war if necessary . And the United States had experienced a period of unexcelled national prosperity induced by the foreign trade . Every factory , every store , had been making money . Even given this state of mind , the success of the draft could have gone no farther without the right administration of the selective-service law at Washington . Many local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common sense from the very beginning , until the moment of this writing . General Crowder made broad rulings and interpretations , leaving details regarding sectional peculiarities to be carried out by those nearest them . He outlined two general stipulations : i . The business of local boards is to furnish men for the service of the United States . 2 . It is the business of local boards to use common sense . Such principles , one safely could say , would almost insure the success of any great undertaking . Applied and adhered to in this greatest of national complexities , you saw the result . After the draft came , I am going to put first in specific effect upon the perceptions of the young men the influence of mothers and sisters . There is n't much to say about this after one of the drafted men has been quoted . He stood in the office of the local board , talking it all over , and came to this spontaneous conclusion : " Gee ! but the women have bucked up ! " Mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish mom had n't cried when I left , " said a young fellow on the train going to camp . But for one who shed tears , a hundred set their teeth . In general , the fact that women were more economically independent , therefore better able to support themselves , helped to relieve the tension somewhat . This was part of the present plane of higher education which contributed to the draft spirit . Men understood the political situation better ; the local boards handled their men more expertly . They studied the psychology of the draft crowds . " Do you want to go , kid ? " one board member asked , turning the candidate around , while undecided on a point of physical fitness . Of course he wanted to go , more than anything else in his life when it was put up to him like that . " He could never fight , could he ? " parleyed the doctors while they examined a short but stocky , young fellow . " Fight ! " Well , he 'd " show them ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the measuring-tape was taut with his manly fighting strength . And then when they put a gun in his hand he was a child again with a new toy . He thought he was Uncle Sam 's best soldier , had his picture taken , and wanted to use his gun right away . In the mean time , new soldiers came back from camp for a visit . The drafted man heard tales of adventures , of maneuVOL . CXXXVi I.-NO. 819. - 46vers and camp life , which made him " jump out of his skin " to get into it . His friends , the thin ones , were nicely filled out . The adipose comrades were trimmed . Every new soldier said the food was the best he ever ate . And altogether it was just the life for a young fellow who wanted to serve his country and sce something of the world at the same time . How good it sounded to the drafted man . After that , how slowly the numbers progressed , he thought , until finally he began to look around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loopholes to get into the game . When the physical examination had been passed and a man 's name went down in Class A , fir .. t preferred , the pride of being physically fit put fight into his bones . He wanted the hardest work . Strong lifts for the strong man . He joined the boys who called Class 5 " the cripples , ' and the navy " paradise . " On top of all this came the psychology of the uniform . I 'm not so sure that the actual fit of the clothes did not have peculiar reaction . I recall a case in point . He is on the western front to-day . He was n't a nobody , but he is fighting in the ranks . He gave me this analysis of the draft spirit from another viewpoint . " The mobilization of the National Guard on the Mexican border helped the draft morale . The men kicked while they were there , then came back and told how fine army life was . Naturally , the man who came back on furlough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met , who never noticed him before , said , ' Well , guess we 're going to have a cold day for March . ' ' That 's all right , ' said the new soldier . ' We 've walked post at camp when it was thirteen below zero ! ' " He had a new faith . He said " We 've walked post . " The rich , poor , high , low , had been on the same beat . Within this new fighting entente was a new democracy , reflected without . National ideals were cemented . A great light illumined social conditions , playing up the human touch ? all for a distinct fighting purpose . These were the psychological reactions to the draft , the answers to ? " Has America the fighting spirit ? "
