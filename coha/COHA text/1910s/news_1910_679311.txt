To use this money personally , she declares , would be inconceivable . She therefore gives $24,500 to the Village of Saratoga Springs to be held in trust and utilized for the betterment of the village , for which Mr. Trask was a zealous worker , and $7,500 to the Rev. Dr. Joseph Carey , to be used for the completion of Bethesda parish house , which was Mr. Trask 's gift to the parish . Mrs. Trask , in a letter to Village President James D. , made public to-day , said : " The suble  --  t upon which I approach you is so terrible to me that T find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your associates to distinctly understand my feeling in the matter , trust myself state it . After the death of my husband , Spencer Trask , it was many days before I was able to talk with my counsel and advisers . When I saw them they urged . upon me my duty to take action against the New York Central Railroad for the unspeakably criminal carelessness which led to the fatal tragedy of Dec. 31 , 1909 . " Such action I positively refused to consider . I made only one request , namely . that I might never again hear the name of the New York Central Railroad spoken in my presence . My advisers , however , pointed out to me that this was Impossible . They said that I owed a duty to the community , a grave responsibility to the public . This argument was further urged by several other able advisers , who pleaded that I must sacrifice my feelings at whatever cost of pain for the protection of others In time to come . Moreover , my counsel told me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executrix , I was obliged under the law to Join in bringing suit . " Therefore , greatly against my purpose . I consented to allow my co- ? : yPetitors to proceed as , they felt it to he their duty , entreating them , if possible , to avoid litigation , The officers of the reproad , to avoid litigation , made a settlement with my co-executors . From the amount paid by the officers of the railroad in this settlement , the proportion required by law was given to my husband 's next of kin , and I am Informed that the remaining sum of $32,000 belongs to me . " Of course . I personally would not touch this money , I hope it is needless for me to say that it would not be conceivable for me to use it , no matter what my stress might be . It must be dedicated . And I am sure that the most fitting dedication is to give it to the town to which Spencer Trask devoted many years of aealous service . and for which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I therefore have directed my lawyers to hand to the Rev. Dr. Carey $7,500 to complete my husband 's gift , the Bethesda Church parish house , for I believe that stch a house will contribute largely to the common good of the village . And I have directed them to place the remaining $24,500 with my bankers in trust , to he used for the Village of Saratoga Springs . " T beg . Sir , that you will consult with the Trustees of the village and with the Reservation Commission , of which Spencer Trask was Chairman . and learn their iudgment as to its expenditure , reserving ' for yourself the power of final decision , subject to my approval . " May I take this opportunity , Mr. President , to convey to you . and through you to your Trustees , what f have been too ill personally to acknowledge before  --  my deep appreciation of the public honors that were given to the memory of my husband and my profound gratitude for the reverent sympathy sent to me , both publicly and privately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he permitted to unite in service with you and those faithful ones who are working for our town to bring to pass therein a threefold betterment  --  a practical progress . an Intellectual growth , and , above all , a moral development .
