THE United States once was a maritime na ? tion , in the usual sense of the word ; but it is so no longer . Why such a vital trans ? formation came about in our national life is a question that already has a considerable literature , some of it full of the sailor 's manly sentimentalism and sincere patriotic fervor , some of it prejudiced by class interests , very little of it written in a spirit of sound historical accuracy . The traditional argument of our shipping men is founded on the broad claim that we were at one time mistress of the seas . But the soundness of this claim depends wholly upon what is meant . As to tonnage , we unquestionably were carrying just before the Civil War a preponderant share of the world 's trade . As to perfection of ships and ability of officers and crews , the case is equally strong in our favor . But if the traditional argument ? ment refers not only to a preeminence in ocean commerce but also to the naval power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is not only active but potential ? then I think that the premise is at fault . In the full sense of sea power , the United States never was mistress of the seas . Our two wars with Great Britain scarcely affected the fact of British naval supremacy , American tradition and school history to the contrary . What we settled on the sea in those wars was the superiority of a few individual American ships over a few individual British ships , and the general superiority of Amer ? ican construction and personnel , as evinced in the work of our swift and daring privateers . We con ? vinced ourselves that we would be able at any time to build and man a navy to cope with England 's navy ; but we have never done it , and the matter still remains in the region of faith . Our two wars were the chief means of convincing England of the wisdom of using her sea power with moderation ; but they did not touch the sea power itself . Even at the zenith of our maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water-borne commerce , we depended upon British sea power for the freedom of the seas . England could have stopped our trade anywhere , at any time . That after the war of 1812 she did not attempt to do so , except in a single conspicuous in ? stance , is proof of the general liberality of her sea policy . The traditional argument holds that the decay of the American merchant marine was brought about by two main factors ; the first of which was the staggering blow delivered by Confederateraiders sent out from England during the Civil War . It is altogether unfortunate for a fair view of England 's sea policy that the Alabama incident and others of a similar nature had to occur when they did . They are beside the mark . For the preceding decade conservative feeling in England had been excited by the rapid advance and dis ? proportionate excellence of the American merchant marine . The situation , however , was simmering down ; British builders and owners were improving their own merchant marine to compete with ours , and undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its natural results , without the coer ? cion of British sea power . Then came the Civil War , and with it a stiffening of conservative opin ? ion throughout England . The opportunity was seized , against the united protests of British liber ? als . But after the war these incidents were atoned for in a fair court of arbitration , and British poli ? cies became liberal again . The second factor blamed for the decay of our merchant marine is the policy of a Congress con ? trolled by the interior of the country . This is only another way of saying that Congress refused to build a big navy or adopt a policy of subsidies . Much as I personally regret the passing of an era with which my whole life has been bound up , I have never been able to agree with the traditional argument on either count . A merchant marine in sound standing easily recovers from fortuitous blows ; for causes of its actual decay we must look deeper , to economic forces . The indifference of Congress to our maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of an overwhelming economic pressure . When Commo ? dore Vanderbilt , in the early days of the steamship era , suddenly sold out his growing steamship lines and turned his energies into railroad development , the action was significant of the whole tendency of the nation . From a strip of states fronting the sea and backed by virgin forests , we had rapidly changed into a continental nation with enormous inland forces to be organized . The maritime im ? pulse of our early days lasted over into the suc ? ceeding era , and , as frequently happens in such a situation , reached its maximum when the economic forces that supported it were already on the wane . The break had to come . There was not in the nation sufficient manhood energy and financial power for both internal and external development . To this set of factors must be added still another , the growth of industrialism throughout the western world . Thus for two generations virtually the whole energy of the United States was to be spent upon internal development . The choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , from this distance seems healthy and in ? evitable . But now we have undergone another economic change . A revival of maritime interest is taking place with us to-day . Our tonnage is advancing by leaps and bounds . In a few years we will pos ? sess a more than respectable merchant marine . Ship yards are springing up everywhere along our coast ; they probably will be able to compete on equal terms with European yards for a period of five years after the war . There is plenty of capital for the enterprise . Above all , the country is now fairly well developed internally . The farmers and merchants , the men of the interior , are awakening to the significance of maritime affairs . It looks like a real national maritime expansion this time . What international policy shall we pursue ? The conservatives , in the temper of those British conservatives who built the Alabama and set her loose upon our shipping , claim that we should look singly to our own interests , and that it is nothing to us what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched our maritime enterprise , let us push it forward by the whole force of our government , by subsidies and every sort of legislative and diplo ? matic action . Let us build the first navy in the world , and support our flag on every sea . If Great Britain objects , fight her . These men , of course , are imperialists at heart . They are interpreting patriotism in terms of the old order of international relations . Their strong views are apt to emanate from an inaccurate belief in our past naval achieve ? ments and to disregard the total change that has come upon the relations between commercial and naval sea power with the development of modern armaments and modes of propulsion . By closing their minds to the interests and activities of other nations , they lose sight of several very important considerations . They lose sight of the fact that England would not sit idly by while we built the first navy in the world -- that their policy contem ? plates an orgy of naval construction such as the world has never seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole problem ? the fact that the very life of the British Empire depends upon her naval control of the seas . The liberals also believe that it is not for us to be subservient in the matter . Trade and com ? merce are for all , and no nation must be permitted to hold a monopoly of the ocean routes . Of pre ? cisely this policy liberal England has been the best exponent that ever controlled the seas . Only in times of national crisis , when even the policies of liberals tend to become conservative , has Great Britain allowed herself to overstep the bounds of moderation in her use of sea power . The Ameri ? can liberal is quite willing to enter into a discussion of subsidies or preferential tariffs and port charges , at any time when we are actually unable to compete with foreign commerce . But he recognizes that the naval control of the seas is a vital necessity to Great Britain , while it is not a vital necessity to the United States . He concedes the point to Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the American merchant marine would have gone on developing side by side with the Brit ? ish merchant marine , and without hindrance from British sea power , if it had not been for a shifting of economic forces within our own country . He sees that the mistaken policy of backing a merchant marine by a great navy must sooner or later bring any nation face to face with the legitimately dom ? inant sea power . Great Britain found no objection to the development of the German merchant mar ? ine ; it was the building of the German navy which aroused her to action . This threatened the life of the Empire . It disclosed a spirit , not of commer ? cialism , but of conquest . Shall we enter this game ? Shall the United States embark on a voyage which leads nowhere but to defeat or imperialism ? Then why raise the bugaboo of British control of the seas ? The American liberal feels that the course of Great Britain has in many cases been reactionary during the present war ; he has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cies as to trade and the general problem of inter ? national relations . But he has faith that at the close of the war British liberalism will again come into its own , as it did at the close of the Boer War , and that these reactionary tendencies will be promptly nipped in the bud . He had reason to believe that after the war British sea policy , en ? lightened by the grave lessons that are culminating in these tremendous days , will be more liberal than ever before . If , however , this faith should prove to have been misplaced , if British sea policy should continue reactionary into days of peace , then the American liberal would be as willing as the conservative to take sharp action . The blame then would defin ? itely rest upon Great Britain ; she would deserve the ill-will of the world and the censure of history . But such a result is unthinkable ; the whole force of the past is against it . A war between the United States and Great Britain on any count is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall into the lap of the reactionaries ; that out of the present conflict is not to emerge a new and more liberal order of internationalism , whereby vital matters may be settled without resort to arms . The present administration , by announcing for the United States the definite policy of building the second largest navy in the world , seems to have aligned itself with the liberals on this question . There may be good reasons why we need so large a navy , but we do not propose to threaten British naval supremacy . In order that there may be no misunderstanding , however , the whole question should be covered by international agreement ; there should be treaties between us , on our part sustaining British control of the seas , and on the part of England guaranteeing the freedom of the seas to the American merchant marine . Such treaties must of necessity wait for the settlement of pending difficulties , and ought to wait until liber ? alism has once more established itself as the dom ? inant political force in England . British liberalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain by our maritime expansion . And Ameri ? can liberalism knows that unless we are out for conquest ? and we shall never be out for conquest  - -  our maritime expansion has nothing to fear from British sea power . I ASKED her for another piece of butter . Her face remained inattentively blank . With a pro ? pitiating smile I asked again . She too smiled , but it was as she responded to a beckoning gesture of the fat-faced man at the marble-topped table next to mine . I hated her . I wanted the butter . Like some other students I am perforce a devotee of the continental breakfast , and with nothing but coffee and rolls one must at least have enough butter . Of course I knew the reason for my short ration ; I had n't tipped her for a couple of days , and the commercial traveler type had dimes enough to com ? mand an unlimited supply of smiles and attention . With an increased contempt for women I re ? turned to my room and tried to clear the desk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roommate . Pamphlets annoy me . They appear so utterly devoid of human interest . But the title of one of them caught my eye . It was " Behind the Scenes in a Restaurant . " I opened directly to a chapter on the tipping system , and I paused from my Wordsworth concordance long enough to read it . As a result I have n't divided my life into Before and After reading a pamphlet issued by The Con ? sumers ' League of New York City , but I have decided always to tip the waitress , even to the bitter extent of abolishing dessert . I have n't been converted to tipping . Restaurant-keepers should no more expect the public to pay three-fourths of the wages of their employees than shop-keepers should expect it . Arkansas , Iowa , Mississippi and South Carolina have forbidden tips , but until the less enlightened states pass similar laws waitresses will be forced to " work " for tips either by mak ? ing me eat butterless rolls , or by smirking at the commercial fat-face . One girl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips . If you tell the boss you ca n't make any , he says you are no good and discharges you . You have to put up with it or starve . The majority of girls ? the better class of waitresses ? if they could get a good living would be glad to do without tips . " Of course I knew in a vague sort of way that waitresses were underpaid and largely dependent on tips , but I realized it only as one realizes that there are poor uneducated bushmen in Australia , and it 's too bad , and something ought to be done about it , but meanwhile there is the assignment for tomorrow 's class- , work . Then along came this pamphlet dryly stating that eighty-seven per cent of the thousand and seventeen women restaur ? ant workers interviewed are being paid less than nine dollars a week , and that even when food and tips are estimated and added the proportion re ? ceiving less than a living wage is still thirty-one per cent . One of my temperamental objections to pam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity into per cents . We of little faith and less imagination fail to grasp the full significance of that thirty-one per cent . Tragedies numerically expressed meet with scant understanding . This pamphlet , however , supplements its statistics by some far more tangible information as to what " less than a living wage " really means . " Restaurant workers are a tenement house pop ? ulation ... as a whole their lot falls within the congested tenement districts of the city . Confu ? sion , overcrowding , dirt , lack of sunlight , air and privacy , and unwholesome surroundings are only too common in their homes . The janitor of an East Side tenement house said , A little while ago , down in Third street , there were twenty-three girls sleeping in two rooms . They 'd put their mat ? tresses down on the floor at night and pile them on top of each other in the day time . Most of them were kitchen hands at s 's , ' naming a well known chain of restaurants . " But though women restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy of under ? payment and overcrowding , they can lay claim to the dubious distinction of being the largest group of women without the protection of the law as far as hours are concerned . The New York State labor law makes it illegal to employ women in
