into believing they and their customs were per ? fect , or which attacked their customs in favor of new ones . The picture of what poetry might be was as hazy during the seventeen centuries after the birth of Christ as it is now . There could be fashioned no statements to grasp it , because the striving toward poetry had not resolved itself to a definite art , but had become a fixed form , into which any kind of content might be poured . Wordsworth was the first poet of any propor ? tions to turn the content of poetry into a definite channel . He amazed those about him by making his striving toward poetry a medium for the ex ? pression of individual reactions toward inanimate as well as animate life and introduced an attempt to make the sound of words themselves convey dif ? ferent emotions . But Wordsworth , even in his most delicate portraits of nature ? with the excep ? tion of the daffodil poem , and one or two others ? could not kill within himself a belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a reflection of human nature in all of its noblest aspects . " So the moral and preaching note entered and marred his definite pictures . Still , he sounded the first weak bugle call for another striving toward poetry ? a striving which contends that poetry need have no direct connection with the salient motifs of human nature , and need only paint a picture , without com ? ment , or supplemented by the poet 's purely spiritual reaction , utterly disregarding human morals and favorite human beliefs . This second broad trend taken by man 's pur ? suit of poetry , struggled on through poets no bet ? ter or worse than Wordsworth , and made little progress , although some of the others ? Shelley and Keats , and last of all , Swinburne ? used the sound of words as an effective aid toward the utterance of strong spiritual exaltation . Browning threw aside the " must be a reflection of human nature " tradition , and , to make some of his poems clear word paintings , mingled them with the reactions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit were predominant and weaving of words into intangible tone pictures was sec ? ondary . Only with the coming of the French sym ? bolists , and after them what is called modern poetry , did poetry definitely enter into the comple ? tion of its second large trend . Poets , the word must be used for identification , are finally moved , somewhat in unison , by an aim which has brought , and will in the future bring , them many sugges ? tions of poetry . But what poetry really is , is still as hazy to poets and laymen as it always has been . The deep , unformed longing to escape from the drab nightmare of physical daily details , perhaps even to glorify the details in an impersonal way and find escape in that , has been the cause of all art . // But artists have only of late begun to feel that the established forms of all art have been but feeble gropings toward a far distant point . Pure poetry is the vibrant expression of ever thing clearly delicate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and nature . That pursuit of poetry which has as its basis the wrongs of the poor , or the utterance of the broader emotional surges of humanity , may have an undying place in literature , but it can not be the basis of a separate art . The distinct social message or sermon , no matter how right or much needed it may be , is only of a utilitarian or cor ? rective value , although it may rise to tremendous heights of clear prose strength . True poetry is the entering of delicately imaginative plateaus , un ? connected with human beliefs or fundamental hu ? man feelings . When poetic style is rescued from its position of chambermaid to some " burning mes ? sage " or " noble idea , " and dressed so deftly and fantastically that it becomes its own reason for ex ? istence , poetry will reach these plateaus in greater quantity than occasional lines or widely separated poems . Then , philosophy , political economy and obvious sentimentality will be expressed in the ptc'se rhythm best suited to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of a delicate dancer chained by the undying desire of men to instruct each other ' MAXWELL BODENFIEIM ? CORRESPONDENCE Governmental Housing SIR : The article on Governmental Housing in a recent number of The New Republic is timely and interesting but unfortunately presents a narrow , one-sided and is practical view . The proper housing of wage earners is always a problem of importance , the adequate solution of which has so far baffled mankind . In war time the subject becomes fundamental to successful industrial and operations , and the difficulties of financing , planning and building homes are so much greater , and the requirements for speed so essential , that government aid becomes imperative . There is no need to reply in detail to Mr. Pope ? s statement , but the main views advanced are so misleading that some counter statement should be offered to the consideration of the readers of The New Republic . The principal points to note are the following : 1 . The attempt to discredit the individual-home-o the ship policy is unfortunate . " The American Home , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States League of Local Building and Loan Association may be a bit sentimental . Yet there is no escaping from the significance of the figures of these associations , with cooperative banks . The last report of the secretary gives a membership of 3,568,342 in 7,034 associations , with total assets amounting to $1,696,707,041 . Workmen should not and can not be required by employers , or any one else , to become home owners against their will , but the opportunity to do so should be vastly extended . 2 . Co-partnership in housing , as in other matters , should be energetically advocated . In this matter we have much to learn from England and other countries . It would be a mistake , however , to overlook two facts : first , that the conditions in the United States are less favorable , on the Whole , for co-partnership and other cooperative enterprises ; and secondly , that these enterprises are not well adapted for the emergency of the War . They are inadequate in extent , and much too slow . 3 . The attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate , and the statement of 1115 attitude is , in my judgment , untrue . The writer of the article affirms that " the employer has not been and is not likely to be a disinterested adviser , and there is no reason for expecting disinterested advice from him in the matter of the proposed housing policy . " I believe that the employer as a rule has the same desirable combination of Selfishness and altruism in this matter of housing which is back of the best work of the world in other fields . In fact , successful industrial housing is hardly conceivable without the cooperation of employers of labor and other business men . 4 . Mr. Pope says , " As for the real estate developer , it must at once be granted that his motives are selfish , and Scarcely concerned beyond immediate prospects of profit . " This is may be true in many cases , but the need is not to take t but whole business out of the real estate operators ' hands , but to bring it more strictly within public regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cleveland Homes Company , recently organized through efforts of public spirited members of the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce , has proposed a practical method by Which homes for workers would be secured mainly through cooperation with the real estate dealers operating in the city . 5 . The writer of the earlier article in The New Republic states that " we shall not find one constructive example that can be repeated to the advantage of all classes of work ? ers ' We shall find not one that has even approached the problem of the housing of the low paid classes . " Happily , 6 the facts are otherwise . There are many examples of good housing in the United States ? not perfect , perhaps , but worthy of imitation , repetition , and adaptation to the various : requirements of wage earners . A list of more than fifty of these examples has been printed recently in a check list the Journal of the American Institute of Architects , and in a pamphlet published by the American Civic Association , entitled " A Good Home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful work in this field are the following : American Brass Company , Water- 14% Conn. ; American Woolen Company , Lawrence , Miss .. ; Billerica Garden Suburb , Billerica , Mass. ; Cin- 44 " inati Model Homes Company ; Draper Company , Hope- he ' , Mass. ; Goodyear Heights , Akron , Ohio ; Improved Housing Association , New Haven , Conn. ; Kenosha ( Wis . ) Homes Company ; Modern Homes Company , Youngstown , I i Norton Company , Indian Hill , Worcester , 1VIass. ; Hill ctavia Association , Philadelphia ; Riverdale , Rome , j/i . ? ; Viscose Company , Marcus Hook , Del. ; the Washington ( D.

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale operations , the elimination of excessive speculative profits , and in the case of home ownership , financial cooperation .

The methods should vary , and may come from the initiative and cooperation of employers or groups of employers or business men , or real estate operators , co-partnership com ? panies , public authorities , or a combination of some or all of these . 7 . Finally , it should be recognized that a good home for every wage earner can be provided only by recognizing that housing is intimately and permanently related to a number of large and difficult problems . Some of these are planning problems , some questions of broad economic policy . The first step toward a solution , however , is to recognize that the subject is primarily one for the right ap ? plication of broad economic principles .

Cambridge , Massachusetts . Dr. Van Dyke on Traitors SIR : Being engaged as a volunteer in the service of our country in this war , speaking almost daily in behalf of the reason and right of our cause , I have been grateful for the fidelity with which the hard-worked newspaper reporters have generally recorded my remarks . But , as the proverb says , " Accidents will happen even in the best regulated families . " It is doubtless due to one of these accidents in a newspaper report that a correspondent in your number of December 1st has reproached me , with others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-Germans , seditious persons , and presumptive traitors . This is an absolutely false report . I have never advo ? cated nor approved anything of that kind . The main safe ? guard of liberty is the stability of order . It is by law , civil in time of peace , martial in time of war , that the sacred and inalienable rights of men and the life of the republic must be protected . Your correspondent 's letter is probably based upon an inaccurate account of a dinner given by the Authors ' Club on November first . This is what I said on that occasion : " Any inhabitant of this country who puts destructive material into the machinery of the ships which are carry ? ing our brave boys across the ocean to serve under our flag , is a constructive murderer and a traitor . He should face a traitor 's trial and a traitor 's doom . Shooting would be too good for him . If convicted he should be hung with ? out delay . The same thing is true of every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens , urging them to be disloyal or recalcitrant , per ? suading them to evade or to resist the call which our coun ? try has made for the service of all its people in the defense of its rights and its honor . These men , whether they are candidates for the mayoralty or any other office , or merely irresponsible emitters of hot air , are in fact trying to ob ? struct and impede the action of the Ship of State . They are imperiling the unity , the welfare , the success of our country in this great struggle which has been forced upon her by Germany . Let them reckon with their own con ? science in the sight of God for their private thoughts and feelings . But if they speak treason , or act treason , or incite others to treason , they also must face a traitor 's trial and a traitor 's doom . Upon conviction shooting would be too honorable a punishment to inflict upon such criminals . When proved guilty , it seems to me , they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue their nefarious work , they imperil the lives of thousands of loyal citizens and the safety of the republic . " By this I stand , in spite of the articles of the Socialist newspaper , the Call , under the title of " The Guillotine . " Any one who wants me can easily find me , and the guil ? lotine in America is an idle menace . Let me add a few words to make clear my position in regard to enemy aliens , pro-Germans , professional pacifists , Potsdam Socialists and all that crowd . This is what I think we ought to do . We should check and restrain an indiscriminate , hys ? terical campaign of proscription , boycottage and persecu ? tion against people who have German names , a German accent , or German blood in their veins . Many of them are among our best citizens . Many of them are here just because they ar their forefathers emigrated to escape from that system of irresponsible , militaristic autocracy for which the imperial German government stood . But , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country 's conscience is engaged , we should be firm and reso ? lute against any one who tries to impede or cripple our country 's cause . Fines , imprisonment , internment in a comfortable camp in the South , are altogether inadequate . In many cases they are only rewards for treachery and en couragements to continue the warfare . We ought to be more strict , straight and promptly just in punishing sedition and treason . For example : a man who is found on an American transport ship with an explosive bomb concealed on his person should be executed without debate or delay . A man who by speech or action endeavors to impede America 's efficiency in this righteous war should be judged by the law , and if convicted , promptly executed . Our policy , up to now , shows the " defects of its quali ? ties . " We are friendly , good-natured , long-suffering . But what we need now is to realize that we are up against a power which opposes and despises all our national prin ? ciples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of set ? tling international differences , we must do what we can to cancel that false , immoral choice . We must fight against the imperial German government on the battlefront and we must repress and suppress , by all lawful means , the activities of its agents and friends in this country . HENRY VAN DYKE . Princeton , New Jersey . Improvized Negro Songs The letter in The New Republic recently by - 3 Mr. T. G. Stewart , of my own state , on negro imagery , brought back to mind some notes that I made about ten years ago from a younger generation of Negroes along // the Ohio River . At that time tobacco was being cultivated for the first time very extensively along the river on the Kentucky and %Vest Virginia sides , which necessitated an influx of the southern type of Negro in large numbers . A government engineer in charge of the construction of a dam that took seven years to build , often invited me t ? attend the Negro camp meetings , and in the glowing fig hit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were sung , chanted or shouted . This seemed to him a hobby , incidentally , and I trust he will , some day , give them to the world through some channel in their entirety , for his note-book is full . As the meetings " warmed up " three or four songs be at one time would be in the air . Sometimes a song would v repeated for an hour at a time , with much clapping and clatter , in one section of the gathering . The songs seemed to be weirdly executed ? Possibly in a spiritualistic manner ? and , strange to say , seldom if dvee were they delivered with the same words . These were supplied , it seemed , at random , just so they suited the tone In this the Negro was extremely resourceful . Here is one that seemed very popular : ossi " Hold your light , Brudder Robert Hold your light , Hold your light on Canaan 's shore . What make ole Satan for follow me so ? Satan ai n't got notin ' for do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hold your light on Canaan 's shore . " There seemed , beneath it all , a feeling that they were e oppressed ; that they would do their best here , but web , h longing for the end . They believed firmly , as shown heir their songs , that a future reward awaited them . Ttbe , songs were all of a religious tone . The songs were   tic , to say the least . Patience seemed to be expressed in : " Brudder , keep your lamps trimmin ' and a-burnid ' Keep your lamp trimmin ' and a-burnin ' , Keep your lamp trimmin ' and a-burnin ' , For dis world 's most done . " This patience seemed to be rewarded by : 0 , yes , I want to go home ( repeated after each " Dere 's no rain to wet you , line ) . Dere 's is no sun to burn you , 0 , push along , believers , Dere 's no hard trials , Dere 's no whip a-crackin ' , My brudder on de wayside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no stormy weather .

Walk ' em easy round de heaven , 0 , shout glory till ' em join dat band ! December 22 , 1917 THE NEW " The Ship of Zion " was very much liked . It had half 4 dozen versions , one of which follows : " De Gospel ship is sailin ' , Hosann ? sann ( repeat after each line ) . 0 , Jesus is de captain , De angels are de sailors , 0 , is your bundle ready ? 0 , have you got your ticket ? " Songs were manufactured or woven by groups of Ne ? groes to suit occasions , like this one : " O , de ole nigger-driver ! 0 , gwine away !

" The songs all seemed to afford the Negro a tie to Heaven 411 , , d were a great stimulus to courage . I never heard a vulgar song . All had a religious motive . The songs were earned by ear , and changed to suit any occasion . t Groups of Negroes were known to sing , with scarcely a reak , from morning till night . It would be interesting to ever to learn if any oppressed race , which they were , was t ver held up by religious sentiment alone . KARL LEMMERMANN . Cleveland , Ohio . Luxuries and Labor Shortage SIR : In The New Republic of October 20th you have an editorial on labor shortage . I believe the following suggestion would go a long way toward relieving this labor s shortage . t , I am what you might call an ex-I . W. W. I was a - member of the Western Federation of Miners when it went into the I. W. W. about eleven or twelve years ago , but after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with them . The thing that appealed to most of the miners about the I. W. W. was that it was organized on industrial instead of on craft lines . The craft organizations with their different agreements made it possible for one organization to scab on another to destroy the effectiveness of a strike . Another thing that appealed to most of 1 ; 1 miners was the attack the I. W. W. made on the and trusts with their high initiation fees , closed unions and restrictions on apprenticeship . There is nothing in the record of the capitalist class that can skin the labor trust for greed . The I. W. W. has done one good thing in showing up the hogs . Eleven or twelve years ago the I. W. W. was not so throughly committed to sabotage as now . There were Lots of men in the organization who did not believe in it . I remember very well a number of men who advocated just the , opposite tactics to sabotage . They believed , for instance , that miners should act as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the work in the most efficient and . workmanlike manner . They believed it was good tactics to refuse to work in wildcat mines , to refuse to work at anything that did not produce , directly or indirectly , things that would be of use to the working class , to refuse to work as servants of the rich , to refuse to build any costly private dwelling , to refuse to make any expensive clothing , to refuse to produce any luxuries until there were enough of the primary necessities to supply every one , to refuse to quit when fired , to demand that no man who wanted work should be turned away . They believed the slogan of the working class should be " every man has a right to a job . " It is the power to refuse employment to a man that makes it possible for some to spend large sums of money on themselves while others starve . The power to refuse employment makes it possible to cut down production . Cutting down production raises prices . Throwing men on the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices is profit . What the laboring man wants to do is to cut out producing luxuries for someone else and produce more of the essentials . This will lower the price of essentials and make it possible to command higher wages . But now the I. W. W. and other unions injure the working man and his cause instead of helping him , when they destroy anything or stop useful production . They cut off their nose to spite their face . Some time ago you stated in an editorial that it was the policy of the I. W. W. to hamper production so all business would become un ? profitable , thus forcing business to turn itself over to a socialist republic . The I. W. IV . make a mistake in thinking decreased production will make business unprofit ? able . Decreased production makes prices higher , wages lower and profits greater . Now is the best time the workingman ever had to come into his own . The needs of the government are the same as the needs of the workingman . The workingman has more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win this war the government must cut out the production of luxuries and produce more of the essentials . In such production the workingman will have more help now than he will ever have . Frank Vanderlip , president of a great bank , and a government adviser , advises bankers to refuse loans to men who wish to invest it in things that have not considerable utility . This is right in line with the workingman 's interests . If the I. W. W. must bomb someone , let him bomb those who throw whole ship loads of bananas into the ocean , or those who destroy carloads of food , or those who withhold food from use . If he must destroy something , let him destroy some of the booze that is stored away throughout the country . This would be less harmful than destroying crops . Prescott , Arizona . WM . CROCKER . What is an Intellectual ? s IR : What is an " intellectual " ? If we must use this lately overworked word , which to my nostrils doth smack a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least use it with a certain inclusiveness ? Have we no warrant for calling any man who does his own thinking an " intellectual " ? May we only call him an " intellectual " if his own thinking leads him to extreme radicalism ? Are there no liberal , no conservative intellectuals ? Is it even certain that there are no wholly Bourbon intellectuals ? I am moved to ask these questions because I have noted for some months past that the younger and more ardent of our radicals , from poetic journalists to journalistic poets , have taken a great fancy to this word . They have bestowed it upon themselves as an exclusive title and distinction , and they withhold it firmly from all who do not agree with them . With the editors of The Seven Arts they con ceive of themselves as fostering " the fine spirit of a young America which tomorrow shall come into its own . . . . - It is the spirit of the young world , without frontiers , with ? out kings , without industrial despotism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironic twinkling of the stars they would hitch their wagons to . Not that one would have them aspire less ; it is n't their aspiration , it 's their perspiration one objects to . Witness the words of Mr. Padraic Colum in your issue of September 2nd : " To write in favor of that which the great interests of the world are against is what I conceive to be the duty and the privilege of the intellectual . " From a rather careful reading from week to week in our more radical publications I have at length arrived , and with ? out previous prejudice , at the following conception of our American Intellectuals , so lovingly self-styled : An American Intellectual is any writer for publication , whether a citizen of the United States , or alien resident thereof , who believes our country is a financial oligarchy camouflaged as a democracy . To be worthy of the title he must , in addition , be a Conscientious Objector ? not only to war , but to pretty much everything in the way of a national obligation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the law , to interfere with our successful prose ? cution of the present war . He must denounce the draft , and any curtailment of his personal privileges , which he must always refer to as his Rights . He must sneer at any symptoms of awakening patriotism as atavistic outbreaks of brutish herd-psychology . Moreover , it will make his possession of the title even more secure if he is a Revolu ? tionary Socialist ; inalienable , if he is a Proletarian An ? archist . And finally , it should be counted to him for an added grace if he is an upholder of Sinn Fein , or a German sympathizer . Now is n't it just conceivable ? I put the question with humbleness ? that here and there an American may be using his intellect fairly and fearlessly upon our present national and social problems , doing his thinking at first , not at second hand , and yet not coming to all the conclusions suggested above ? If one is not a doctrinaire pacifist is one therefore a low-brow ? It is fatally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country be not Ireland ) is a pre ? liminary symptom to softening of the brain ? Can only a moron believe in war-time censorship of public speech and printed opinion ? Or , if nowadays one thrills a little with affectionate pride at the sight of gathering troops and the passing flag ? should one 's family be warned , and an alienist at once consulted ?
