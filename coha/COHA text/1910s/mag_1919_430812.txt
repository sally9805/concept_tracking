WOMEN voters of America , fifteen million strong , today hold in their hands the fate of parties , the choice of the next President , the future social and industrial policy of the United States . But without a program this power is nothing ; heir votes will be frittered away beeen the parties on issues set up by the politicians themselves . What is their program ? The Republican and Democratic national chairmen , Mr. Will Hays and Mr. Homer Cummings , realize that women 's votes can decide the next election . At the recent national conference of Republican women with the Republican national committee at Washington , Mr. Hays indicated he was wide awake to this fact , although he gave no sign of knowing that women 's votes can not be won by the usual baits which catch men . Following eager handmaidens of the party who proclaimed the necessity of growing two Republican votes in every precinct where only one had grown before , and exhortations on the part of women leaders to organize , organize , organize for 1920 , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large proportion of the " fourteen million seven hundred thousand four hundred and seventyhree " women voters in the country , with which number he was evidently greatly impressed , as he kept repeating it in his speeches and did not forget it in one of them . With the winning of Presidential suffrage in Ohio and Tennessee since this conference there are now more than fifteen million women entitled to vote for our next President ; if thirty-six states ratify the national suffrage amendment before November , 1920 , as now seems likely , there will be more than twenty million . At the conference of Democratic women with the Democratic national committee , held at Chicago about the same time , Mr. Homer Cummings showed he was alert to the importance of the woman vote and that he was keenly aware of the failure of the Democratic Sixty-fifth Congress to pass the national suffrage amendment . He made a bid for the woman vote by urging speedy ratification of the amendment by Democratic state legislatures . At the Washington Republican conference I pointed out that if two Republican votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Republican party must win a large proportion of the woman vote . If Republican women were to be induced to organize with any enthusiasm , they must be given something to organize and work for . It was the plain duty and opportunity of American women to use their power , and to impress upon the minds of politicians who are to frame the platforms of political parties at the national conventions next summer this vital political truth : that that party will win the election which offers the most sincere and appealing issues to the minds and hearts of women . I concluded by stating that women had it in their own power to frame and force that program . Nat ional woman suffrage is today practically won . Our problem is to persuade women voters in 1920 to place other vital women 's issues above the interest of any political party . The question we must have answered in the coming campaign is not " What shall women do for the political parties ? " but " What shall the political parties do for women ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women did not put sex in government , and that until political , civil , social , and econcmic opportunity is , open equally to women and men , thinking women must remain organized to fight for equal opportunity and to advance legislation that will make finer human beings and better government for all of us . There are , of course , issues before the country today  | which are not distinctively women s problems , but their solution will be women 's business as well as men 's , and we should now be giving intelligent thought to them . Although it is impossible to prophesy now what place the League of Nations may have in next year 's campaign , some of its provisions which may involve our son sin all the wars of the world , and others which may lessen wars in future , are of vital concern to women . As some form of league will probably be adopted , ought we not to demand fair representation of women in the Assembly and on the commissions to be established by the League ? Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how our representatives in the Council and Assembly shall be chosen -- by the President , by Congress , or by the people at this next election . The High Cost of Living The high cost of living is bound to have a place in the next national platforms . Since women buy nearly go percent of the food consumed in the country , we must assume our part of the responsibility in solving this problem . We must know something of causes before suggesting remedies . Are we to b. eve the packers , who testify before congressional committees that high prices are due to the retailers , or are we to believe the retailers , who blame the consumers , particularly the women , for extravagance and because they no longer shop with their market baskets but insist on using the telephone and expensive automobile delivery ? On the other hand , the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission states that high prices are not to be accounted for by these suggestions , or by the fact that millions of men have been taken from production and sent to Europe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of currency through large issues of paper money , or by the enormous exports of food and clothing . These facts , he says , are being used as " smoke screens " to conceal the operation of the most complete machinery for profiteering any country ever saw . Do we realize that the present problem is one of distribution rather than of production , and that increased production can not possibly lower prices without a change in this system of distribution ? There is no doubt that present high prices are in part also due to the rules written during the war by the United States Food Administration , which applied to meat , I fish , eggs , and poultry , one of which caused the price of poultry to jump from 18 cents to 42 cents a pound in a single night ; that they are caused also because food on its way from producer to consumer passes through the hands of a series of speculators with related interests , each of whom sells the identical product and takes a profit , which series of profits the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the next election , we women should study also the advantages of cooperative stores , agricultural cooperation , and local community markets . The farmer could sell his chickens or eggs or wagon-load of fruit and vegetables directly to these local agencies , and the housewife could buy her supplies directly from them . This would eliminate the wasteful cost of handling by middlemen and of long shipments of produce to wholesalers , all of which must now be paid by the consumers . Such a system would be a long step toward breaking monopolies and lowering prices . Women voters , who will be called upon to help solve the future of our railroads and our national resources by electing a President and a Congress which will inevitably have to deal with these problems , should be giving attention now to the proposed nationalization of railroads through the Sims bill ( the Plumb plan ) , and to the policy by which our lands , mines , minerals , . forests , and water power can be most effectively  | administered to lower prices and enlarge opportunity for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters has the most intimate bearing on individual life and opportunity for ourselves and our children 's children . A distinctively women 's program we can not hope to have adopted by political parties unless we care enough about it to urge it ourselves . What issues shall we demand ? Foremost among these should be ( r ) government care for maternity and infancy , ( z ) the removal of children from industry , ( 3 ) the feeding of America 's millions of undernourished children , ( 4 ) no discrimination against women in industry and the Civil Service , ( 5 ) the elimination of all remaining barriers in law or custom which perpetuate inequality between women and men , and prevent their equal participation in government . Government Care for Maternity and Infancy As to the first , the high death-rate of women in childbirth in the United States , the neglect of maternal and infant mortality , should arouse every mother in the country to demand , as a national political issue , pledges from the politcal parties for government aid for prospective mothers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely rural communities . It is no exaggeration to say that our national and state governments have not given as much thought and money to produce healthy human beings as to produce healthy animals . The men in control of political parties have not moved in this matter , and they will not move unless women demand and unless political advantage is seen through granting that demand . Maternal mortality is closely related to infant mortality , as proper care of the mother before , during , and after childbirth greatly increases the child 's chance of life . The value of human life has been emphasized by the war ; the efforts of belligerent nations to save the lives of babies have redoubled since it began . Do we realize that in 1913 ( the latest figures available ) 15,000 women died in this country from conditions caused by childbirth , and that these women could have been saved , as deaths from this cause are almost entirely preventable ? Physicians and statisticians agree that these figures are a great underestimate . In 1913 the death rate per 100,000 population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that from typhoid fever ; this rate would be quadrupled if only women of child-bearing age were counted . In 1913 childbirth caused more deaths among women from 15 to 44 years old than any disease except . tuberculosis . Only two of a group of fifteen important foreign countries show higher rates from this cause than the - United States . These cruel facts emphasize the need of higher standards of care for American women during this period . A recent investigation by the Children 's Bureau shows that the low standards result chiefly from two causes , general ignorance of the dangers connected with childbirth and of the need for hygienic instruction and skilled care to prevent them , and the difficulty of securing proper care due to special local conditions . These causes vary greatly in city and rural districts . In the country the lack of skilled care is the factor . Improvement will come only with general knowledge of the necessity for better care before , during , and after childbirth . If women demand better care , physicians will provide it , medical colleges will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vital importance of community measures to insure good care for all classes of women . Any one who is familiar with our sparsely settled Western states knows the harsh conditions under which many mothers must bear their children . The lonely cabin or dugout I on the desert or prairie homestead far from  | doctors or nurses , the willing but often unskilled ministrations of relatives and neighbors , the dearth of suitable food , fresh milk , a pure water supply , antiseptics , and sanitary arrangements  - -  one marvels that so many of these brave pioneer mothers survive and that their babies live . These courageous women are a potent factor in the building of the West . The figures of an investigation in Montana by the Children 's Bureau are eloquent . ( Other Western states have a bad record for maternal losses and infant mortality , or undoubtedly would have if proper records were kept . ) Out of 463 mothers in the rural area studied , three-fourths had no prenatal care whatever , although many had tried to get information concerning it from books or magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their confinement , a course entailing a heavy financial burden upon the family ; of the 359 who remained only 129 were attended by a physician , so that twothirds of these mothers had to meet their ordeal without competent medical care . Fortysix women , or one in five , were attended only by their husbands , and three were quite alone . Nearly all worked till the last day doing heavy chores like carrying water . Very few received aftercare by physicians , and most of the nursing was unskilled . Many mothers suffered serious complications , and eight died , a large percentage . The infant mortality rate of 71 per 1000 live births was unusually high . Nearly one-fourth of all the mothers interviewed were on their feet before two weeks had elapsed , doing all their housework except washing ; nearly one-half were doing their housework , washing , and chores within four weeks after the baby was born . State care for mothers during the period of childbearing should be demanded by American women . Other countries , including England and New Zealand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriations for this purpose . Governments are beginning to realize more clearly since the war that women perform an important function for the state in bearing children . New Zealand has provided public nursing stations in the " back blocks , " from which nurses and medical aid are sent to prospective mothers in the sparsely settled areas . Australia , which has not this system , has a higher rate of maternal and infant mortality . So has the United States . A Good Bill Tabled Under the sponsorship of Miss Julia Lathrop , Chief of the Children 's Bureau , Miss Jeannette Rankin introduced in the Sixty-fifth Congress a bill " to encourage instruction in the hygiene of maternity and infancy ; to provide for cooperation with the states in the promotion of such instruction and care in rural districts ; to appropriate money therefor and regulate its expenditure , " etc . The bill provided for an initial appropriation of $480,000 , and a later annual $2,000,000 , to be apportioned among those states which appropriate a sum equal to that received from the Government . In every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state board of maternity and infant hygiene must be created , consisting of the governor and representatives of the state board of health and the nursing and teaching professions . The act was to be carried out by cooperation of these state boards with the Chief of the Children 's Bureau . Instruction was to be provided on the hygiene of maternity and infancy , where otherwise inaccessible , through public health nursing and university extension and consultation centers . Provision was to be made for medical and nursing care for mothers and infants at home or at a hospital when necessary , especially in remote areas . Fees might be required for specified services under certain conditions , and " the receipt of aid under this act shall not be construed as the receipt of charitable relief , and shall not in any way .  | affect unfavorably the legal status of any such , person . " This bill got no further than a committee report , but as a pledge placed by women in the platforms of political parties , it would have to be made law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little attention will be paid to the needs of these mothers . Women voters with political power can see to it that a " platform " is really made a " program , " and that our government in future shows more concern for the propagation of the human race than for animal husbandry . Women should back , too , the national and state bills providing for an increase in public health nurses , without which , according to the Children 's Bureau , the lives of mothers and children can not adequately be protected . The United States Public Health Service has a program calling for public health nurse in every county in the country , but its appropriations must be greatly increased before that ideal is made a fact They will be increased if women voters demand it . Meanwhile the National Organization lot Public Health Nursing is seeking for state legislation providing county nurses under state control , an effort which should be supports by everywoman who realizes the need of expert care for mothers and children and for all workers . " Medical Freedom " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these law . As to my second point , the removal of children from industry , the swift re-enactment of the national child labor law should be insisted upon . It will be remembered that the Supreme Court declared the 1916 national child labor law unconstitutional . It is unthinkable that American women will allow the exploitation of the health and lives of hundreds of thousandof young children now toiling in factories , mines , and cotton mills to continue . Women voters will surely defeat the party which refuses to pledge itself to an effective chit : labor law . Feeding Our Hungry Children As to the third point , the feeding of America - hungry children , the brutal fact revealed by recent investigation , that from three to six million American children are underfed , that from fifteen to twenty-five percent are not getting enough to eat , is the concern of the nation , of men as well as women , since it involves the health and efficiency of our future citizens . Whatever may be the cause , whether it is the parents ' lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the high cost of living , it is clearly the immediate duty of women to deal with the appalling result and see that America 's children are sufficiently fed . Sporadic local charities will not answer . What means of relief shall we demand : a Belgian or French or Armenian Children 's Relief Commission adapted to American needs , or government appropriations to furnish American school children at least one nourishing meal a day ? . Itch appropriations should be shared between the national and state governments and expended by cooperating national an ( ' local boards . If we can axe the world a good place for little children to live in , it will inevitably be a better place for all human beings Only by beginning now to impress our demand , backed up with votes , upon the minds of political leaders can we make government protection of America 's exploited and neglected children an issue in the next campaign . The fourth point of our woman 's program . no discrimination against women in industry and the Civil Service , is of overwhelming importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , and civilization . Whether or not we believe with many men that woman 's place is the " home , " it is a fact that the necessities of modern life have taken about 12,000,000 American women out of it to support themselves and  | their families . It is also a fact that these wage- ' earners , whether employes kv the Government or by private enterprises , nave been almost universally exploited and denied the pay that men receive for doing the same work , from the most highly skilled women teachers and artisans down to the lowest form of unskilled labor . It is the shame of our national government and all other enoloyers of labor that women are paid less than men , not because of the quality of the work done , but because they are women . They are also discriminated , against in socalled " protective " legislation , designed to " protect " women as regards night work , the conditions and hours of labor , etc . These laws . some intentionally and some unintentionally , have resulted in giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jobs . Witness the effect of the woman 's night work law , recently passed by theNew York Legislature , upon women street-car conductors in New York City . It should be evident that protective laws providing better hours and conditions of labor should be applied without regard to sex for the good of both men and women . If it is bad for women to work long hours by day or by night , or under improper sanitary conditions , is it not bad also for men ? If it is humane to protect women by special legislation from poisoning in lead and chemical works , , should not men be equally protected ? Our demand should be equal opportunity for women workers , and the same pay that men receive for the same work . We should insist that employers apply this principle in hiring labor and fixing pay : the qualifications of the worker , regardless of sex . The government Civil Service from the beginning has been a scandal in this respect . The Civil Service law says that women may be appointed to government positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the appointing official . With one or two rare exceptions these officials , the department and bureau chiefs at Washington , are men , and almost invariably they have used their discretionary power to deny women the right to work in fair competition with men . Women are excluded from many entrance examinations to the best positions . A recent examination announcement for positions in the Bureau of Efficiency at Washington , with salaries ranging from $1800 to $3000 , called for " investigators qualified in economics , male . " The same sex limitation is made every year in hundreds of other examinations on different subjects , which college women are as well qualified to fill as college men . Before women are tested in capacity they are rejected from these positions , just because they are women . This wrong applied to high and low positions before the war . The war created an extraordinary demand for women in the lower paid positions ( typists , stenographers , clerks , etc. ) , because the men were drafted . The discrimination against women continues as regards the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examinations for these positions . Also , it is almost impossible for a woman in any department to rise above a salary of $1600 to $1800 a year . Our government officials frankly deny women choice of position and advancement because they are women , and because men , being men , should have the preference . Equal Pay for Equal Work As regards equal pay for the same work , the Civil Service manual states in several places that women must expect to be appointed at a salary several hundred dollars less per year than men who might obtain the same position after taking the same examination . The salaries for identical positions , according to the manual , are to begin with $720-$84o for women and $900-$1000 for men , although the women in many cases pass better examinations than men . The government not only makes a practise of rating work done chiefly by women below work of corresponding skill done chiefly by , men , but it pays the skilled labor of women less  | than the unskilled labor of men . The most notorious examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government Printing Office . There the women who do skilled work at machines , making bank notes , bonds , postage and revenue stamps , or binding the books and pamphlets published by the government , are paid less than the men who push the finished product from place to place on trucks ! With fifteen million women voters , the time has come to protest effectively against this shameful treatment . That political party which declares for equal opportunity and equal pay for women in industry and the Civil Service , and which pledges itself to amend the Civil Service law in form arid administration and to create a new Civil Service Commission on which women shall be fairly represented , should secure strong support from women voters in the next election . Equal Rights With Men Our fifth and last point , elimination of all remaining barriers in law or custom which perpetuate inequality between women and men and prevent their equal participation in government , is fundamental . Far more than the personal and economic subjection of women , about which John Stuart Mill wrote an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humbleness in the hearts of women themselves are our chief barrier . Men will give us the equality we have the knowledge and courage to demand . We have lived through a four years ' crusade of eloquence about democracy ; we have fought and won our war for world democracy . It behooves us American women today to survey our status and realize what measure of equality and democracy is our portion . Only one woman has won a seat in the United States Congress , and very few have been elected to state legislatures . With almost no exceptions all the higher executive offices in both our national and state governments , all positions in our diplomatic and consular service , all federal and state judgeships , are , by law or rigid precedent , held only by men . Women are still excluded from many colleges and universities , from many schools of science , theology , law , and medicine . Girls are not taught in our schools the vital importance of economic independence . Marriage laws in many states , and laws including the guardianship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wife on her husband . The right of a wife to a share of her husband 's income in recognition of her services as houseworker and nurse , which would modify that dependence , is not recognized . The woman is disgraced and punished for prostitution by laws , courts , police , and social custom , while the man who trades with her usually goes free ; in all other forbidden vices both buyer and seller are punished . This , then , is our status . Will we meanly accept or nobly reject it ? The choice is curs , and with political power as a weapon the responsibility is ours . Men can not be blamed if the political parties do not voluntarily accept these and other woman 's issues in the next Presidential campaign . Women with votes in their hands , fifteen ? perhaps twenty ? millions of them , can swing the next election and force a woman 's program which will be a determining factor in the future social and industrial life of the United States . Let us determine now upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
