txt The Navy Department has threatened to seize the oil refineries on the Pacific Coast , following the refusal of the oil companies to deliver oil on the ' Navy 's confiscatory terms . The serious situation , which has thus arisen , is set forth in the following official statement of the Standard Oil Co. of California , obtained by Dow , Jones 4 : Co. : ? " The arbitrary policy pursued by the Navy Department in acquiring its fuel oil supply on the Pacific Coast has aroused the marketing ' companies to sharp opposition . Throughout the period of the war it has been the practice of the Navy to secure fuel oil on requisition orders which , in effect , commandeered the required supplied . Originally , and when oil was selling at $1.30 a barrel in the open market , the Navy demanded deliveries at a " tentative " price of $1.08 a barrel . The tremendous demands of the country for crude oil and its refined products led to a shortage in the spring of 1918 , which caused the greatest alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted in their supply ; others entirely cut off from the use of oil as fuel . Even the railroads were notified for the discontinuance of the use of fuel oil . To meet the continuing decline of fuel oil storage the Fuel Administration sought to stimulate production by higher prices . The marketing oil companies , against their opposition , were requested to advance the rate paid to producers 25 cents a barrel , at the same time advancing the price to consumers no more than 15 cents a barrel . These requests were complied with and the marketing companies absorbed the difference .. Thd effect of these conditions was an advance in the market price to $1.60 a barrel , which rate was paid by every agency , public or private , except the Navy . " The Navy continuing to commandeer its requirements now advanced its ' tentative ' price to $1.47 a . barrel , a figure maintained until June 30 of this year . In the meantime the marketing companies were assured , as they had been for more than a year , that a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' reasonable profit ' would be allowed . It is known that some investigation was attempted by the Navy - Department . Inquiries were made bath ' of tho.Fuel Administration and of the ' Federal Trade . CoMmisiion . Their-recommendations were receivedandrrejected . Promises that a ' just price ' would be fixed were : reiterated but not carried . out . " By the end of June , 1919 , the Navy had requisitioned hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil at ' a preliminary price of $108 , while its market value waa . $1.30 a - barrel and great quantities at $1.47 when the market price was $1.60 . It owed the marketing - companies immense sums of money . Thereupon , and without notice to the marketing companies , or hearing them on the subject , the Navy tendered requisition contracts at the reduced figure of 86 cents a barrel . " In face of advanced costs and universally higher prices the navy thus reduced its arbitrary figure of , $1.47 , more than 40%. and fixed a tentative price of nearly half of the prevailing market prices . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants the marketing companies ' arc supplying the Navy with oil at a tentative figure of 86 cents a barrel for which they pay producers the price recommended by the Fuel Administration of $1.29 a barrel ; they are forced not only to forego a fair profit but to finance the requirements of the Navy by incurring losses which already aggregate more than half a million dollars . " The oil companies have refused to execute the requisition agreements . The necessities of the war are over and they decline voluntarily to submit to the further taking of their property without just compensation . The marketing companies have expressed their readiness and desire to supply the Navy 's requirements under ordinary coin ' mercial conditions , but they have declined to make deliveries upon the Navy 's confiscatory terms except under duress and compulsion of force used by the Navy . Such duress and compulsion have been exercised . Refusal to . deliver the products commandeered has been met with the formal threat of an immediate seizure not only of the products in question , but of the plants at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebtedness of the Navy to the oil companies piles up . It continues to obtain its requirements without paying a just price . Its bills are being paid to unwilling sellers by promises of adjustment now more than two years old . This in the face of the fact that the commodity which it seizes . has a well known fixed market value , a value paid by 96% of the consuming public , of which the Navy , in the volume of its requirements , constitutes the remaining 4% . " Proceeding at a time when this country is in all respects at peace , the Navy is paying no more heed to the acts of Congress and to the policy of the Administration than it did in this connection- during the war . Through out the past years , every commodity seized for The needs of the government has been paid for at a just and reasonable price . The food control , naval appropriations and other similar acts of Congress require the President in commandeering the necessities for the government . to fix just and reasonable compensation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the compensation fixed may accept 75 i , thereof and bring his action in the court of claims for such further amount as he desires to claim . These provisions and the scrupulous policy of the government in this regard are ignored by the Navy Department . It seizes what it wants with no effort to fix a just compensation and contents itself with the formal assurance that the suppliers will be fairly dealt with and will receive a fair profit . Nor have even these assurances throueh the period of the war been translated into action . " It is a serious matter when a great agency of the government embarks on a policy of confiscation without hindrance by Congress or the Chief Executive . It is a blow at civil rights which must not go unchallenged . Against it the Standard Oil Co. of California , in common with the marketing companies and producers of the Pacific Coast , raises a most solemn protest -- a protest of nation-wide interest and the grounds of which are of vital import to every citizen of the United States .
