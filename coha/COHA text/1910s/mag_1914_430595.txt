 | I. THE GERMAN OFFENSIVE IN any review of the military operations of the European War during September , the history of the German offensive thrust into France necessarily commands attention almost to the exclusion of all else . In Poland and Galicia mighty battles have been fought ; victories destined perhaps to contribute more than the western battles to the next mapmaking in Europe were achieved . But it was the struggle from Brussels to the gates of Paris that held the attention of the world . Primarily this was because the supreme military machine of the world was here subjected to its first trial in nearly half a century . From Sedan to the Battle of the Marne the German army had been held the greatest military weapon in the world , and armed with it the German Kaiser had dominated the counsels of Europe during his whole reign . Since Waterloo destroyed the Napoleonic army no troops , save those of the German Empire , had enjoyed an equal fame . In the trial of September , too , the German army showed itself not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German offensive thrust must be the work of general staffs of the future , but at the present moment , close to the event , the spectacle of a nation launching more than a million of magnificently trained , fully equipped men , whose courage equalled their efficiency , in one gigantic drive , sending them in three weeks forward over more than two hundred miles , from victory to victory in battles far surpassing the Napoleonic struggles in numbers engaged , and rivalling the Russo-Japanese War in the sacrifice of life , seems in all our written history comparable only with dispatch of the myriads of Xerxes against Greece and the Armada of Spain against England . II . THE ATTACK UPON FRANCE In the examination of the gigantic military operation three distinct things must be considered . It is necessary , first , to explain why Germany should have decided to utilize practically all of her enormous military machine in a thrust at France ; second , why the route through Belgium was selected , despite the fact that the violation of Belgian neutrality insured the appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it remains to review the actual military operations themselves in their three separate phases , the drive at the left flank , the thrust at the center , and the recoil . German attack upon France was dictated by the following considerations : In a war with France , Russia , Great Britain , and Servia , having only Austria as an ally , it was certain that when all her foes had their military strength in the field , Germany would be decisively outnumbered . But at the outset of the conflict only France could mobilize with approximately the same promptitude as Germany . The size of Russia , the inadequacy of her system of communications , the comparative inefficiency of her general staff , as Berlin saw it , the long delay that would be necessary before Great Britain could put anything hut a small expeditionary force in the field , all these circumstances combined to give Germany a period of some weeks during which she could strike at France . If , while England was raising an army and Russia slowly coming up , restrained by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Austria , Germany could deal France a swift , tremendous , decisive blow , not defeating but destroying her military force , repeating in 1914 the successes of 1870 on a colossal scale , then Germany might hope to be finally rid of one foe before the others were up . At  | Paris she could dictate French submission and turn her victorious army against Russia . The Kaiser 's position was precisely that of Napoleon at the outset of his last campaign . In Belgium , British and Prussian armies were on foot ; from Austria , Russia , the rest of Europe , new armies were sure to come ; Napoleon 's plan was to crush the armies in Belgium before the others came up , and deal with them in turn . For this purpose he fought the Waterloo campaign . III . THE ADVANCE THROUGHT BEL-GIUM Precisely the same necessities compelled the Germans to go through Belgium as inspired their attack upon France . Granted that for six weeks they were free to use their massive military machine against France almost exclusively , it was equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France promptly , to be at the throat of the enemy without delay . Hence it was impossible to attack France from the Franco-German frontier . Here , from the very morning of her terrible defeat in 1870 , France had been building tremendous forts . Verdun , Toul , Epinal , Belfort barred this approach and behind them was a second line hardly less formidable . It was true that none of these fortresses was impregnable , but to smash through them with the whole field army of France manning them , ? this would consume time and there was lacking to the Germans time for such an operation . Not through the Vosges could their swift and terrible thrust be sent . There remained the Belgian gateway . Westward from Aix-la-Chapelle in Germany to Liege in Belgium ran one of the great trunk railroads of Europe . West of Liege the line opened into several double-track routes across the plain to Brussels . From Brussels south to Paris yet more trunk lines flowed over level country destitute of large rivers , high mountains , or other natural obstacles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to crush France by one blow , then , here was her only possible avenue of approach . Taking it , she could hope to come at Paris and overwhelm French military strength either by weight of numbers or skill of her strategical dispositions within the time allotted her . Accordingly , without the slightest hesitation , she chose the Belgian route and the first roar of hostile artillery in the world war was heard under the forts of Liege , almost before the first declaration of war was forth . IV . THE SHADOW OF SEDAN From the attack on Liege on August 4 until the German mobilization was complete , a period of twelve days , the press of the world was filled with the reports of the gallantry of the Belgian army , which with apparent success fought off the cavalry screens sent forward by the Germans while they gathered their masses . In the first flush of Belgian resistance the suspicion went abroad that German military strength had been overestimated , that the machine was breaking down at the very start . But for all disrespect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay dearly and without delay . Thus on or about August 17 the German invading army , hardly less than a million strong , finally stepped forward , crushed down Belgian resistance with scarcely an effort , sent the shattered fragments of the Belgian army back upon Antwerp , occupied Brussels on August 20 , and wheeling to the left began its tremendous drive at Paris , opening east and west as it advanced . Now what was the state of the French army on August 20 , when this overwhelming blow was about to fall ? At least twothirds of its number were fighting far off along the Meuse and the Vosges . Before Nancy the much-advertised " counter-offensive " had come to grief and after a brief foray into German Lorraine had been sent home shattered . South before Belfort another invading French army clung to Muelhausen , which it had taken , lost , and retaken . Along the Meuse a third experiment in the offensive had ended equally unhappily . On the north between Paris and the German flood a few army corps were barely beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sambre from Charleroi to Namur and along the Meuse from Namur to Mezieres , where junction was made with the beaten force retiring from the recent offensive . Westward toward Lille and about Mons two British army corps were also taking position , but were not yet ready . All told , there were perhaps in the north Anglo-French troops amounting to a third of the German mass . When they wheeled left in Brussels and started toward Paris the Germans were actually nearer to the French capital than either of the great French armies on the east . If they could crush the allied force before them , or outflank it and roll it east away from Paris , they could envelop the whole military force of France in a net pinned down at one  | end on the Swiss frontier and carried at the other by the swiftly moving right of the German advance . With three of their six weeks still remaining , the Germans were in a position to repeat Sedan on a truly colossal scale . To this effort the following ten days were devoted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to grasp the next ten days of the campaign is to recall the advance of Grant toward Richmond in 1864 . From the Wilderness to Cold Harbor Grant 's whole effort was to crush Lee by frontal attack , since his army was twice as large as the Confederate , and at the same time , moving by the left flank , to interpose between Lee and Richmond . The problem of the French was Lee 's , to inflict the greatest possible losses , strike back at every favorable moment , and still keep the road to the capital open and check the deadly drive at their own left flank . On August 23 the first blow fell . At the same time the allied center near Charleroi and the right on the Meuse near Givet were assailed , overwhelmed , forced back after desperate fighting , while Namur , to the amazement of the world , capitulated . The British on the left about Mons repulsed several savage attacks , but were involved in the general retreat . This was rather an attempt to , destroy by sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disaster avoided . The second blow came upon August 26 and fell upon the British alone . Standing about Cambrai , Le Cateau , Landrecies , and preparing to withdraw , the British army , two corps against five , were suddenly assailed by a huge German army which struck at their front and at the same time reached for their flanks . This was the critical moment , not merely for the British , threatened with annihilation as Sir John French has reported , but for the whole northern army , for if the British were destroyed the whole left flank of the allied forces was gone , the center and the left would be rolled up as the British had been , the northern army would be destroyed , and the mass of the Germans would be between Paris and the eastern armies . could surround them , destroy them by sheer weight of numbers , and turn then to its Russian task . But the British army was not destroyed . Fighting as it fought at Waterloo , with the same obstinacy , tenacity , imperturbability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won clear and went home , dealing terrific blows as it went and inflicting losses which were enormous . When next it stood , fresh French troops protected its left , and with its escape the German move by the left 434 THE AMERICAN REVIEW OF REVIEWS  | flank was , as it turned out later , blocked , but by how narrow a margin is now plain . VI . NEWS FROM THE EAST Yet as the German armies were winning their first victory on fields familiar to the students of the Waterloo campaign , their generals received news of evil omen . Precisely as Napoleon , at the moment he was launching his attack upon Wellington , learned of the appearance of Prussians in the fields toward Plancenoit , the German commanders at Charleroi heard that Russia had stepped over into East Prussia , won several victories , isolated Koenigsberg , and was driving forward toward the Vistula furiously . Evidently Russian mobilization had been quicker than was expected and at the end of the third week it was necessary to deplete the armies in France . Two corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still unfought . Cambrai won , but the great enveloping drive balked , there was yet worse news from the East , this time from Galicia . Here the main Austrian field army was in distress , had met with disaster about Lemberg , the first real disaster of the war ; five corps had been crushed , half the Austrian force in that region . Unsupported , the Austrian army might be annihilated . Now it was necessary to send east , not alone the two Austrian corps , hitherto aiding in the attack upon France , but five German corps . To make the matter worse , here was a Servian army , having routed four more Austrian corps at the Jedar , driving north for Hungary . Having sent seven corps east , two to East Prussia , four to Galicia , the advantage of numbers was no longer with the Germans in France . Five corps were withdrawn from Alsace and this relieved an equal number of French corps , which moving on interior lines might soon be expected in Picardy or Champagne . It was Waterloo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more and more insistently demanding the attention of the very troops relied upon to give the fatal blow to the defenders , hardpressed now , having narrowly escaped disaster , but still unbroken . VII . THE BLOW AT THE CENTER By September 1 it was plain that the German move by the left flank had failed . Steadily retreating , the French left had come squarely home under the guns of Paris . The center following stood behind the Marne River ; the left prolonged the line to the Argonne , where it joined with the armies of the Meuse and the Vosges facing north and east respectively . It was no longer possible to envelop a wing . But it was still possible to break through the center , cut the line between Paris and the eastern fortresses as a flood sweeps away a dam resting on either wall of a valley , destroy the center , and then deal with the wings in detail . For the Germans the stroke was necessary , since they still had the whole force of France to dispose of ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it could not be destroyed , since Russia was pounding ahead terribly in Galicia , requiring larger and larger depletions of western armies , then a retreat from France was inevitable , for already the Germans were outnumbered in both fields and the advantage due to better concentration at the start was passing rapidly , had perhaps vanished . Hence the decision to strike at the center . To the American this change in plan is best described by recalling the course of Lee at Gettysburg . On the second day the whole weight of his attack was upon the left , hi , necessity to get Round Top , roll up the left , and dispose of the Union army . By a narrow margin he failed and on the third day his effort was to break the center against whin he launched Pickett in his famous charge . But as the advantage on tae third day at Gettysburg was all with Meade , so at this point in the campaign in France it rested with Joffre . He had had two weeks to repair the earlier blunders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could fight upon the field he selected and on this field he had been preparing for many day Finally , his troops were fresh , reinforced by new corps , were close to their bases , could b : easily reinforced and supplied . The Germans on their side were exhausted by efforts unparalleled in war , their losses had been terrible , they were far from their bases . the railroads were destroyed , the roads wrecked , the odds unmistakable . VIII . THE BATTLE OF THE MARNE General Von Kluck , who commanded the German advance , must also have realized , by September 1 , that the move by the left flank had failed . The allied left was back too near to Paris to leave any chance for cutting in behind it . To take a homely figure , the allied army from Mons to Compiegne had been in the position of a closing door : it ALLIES VS . GERMANY : STRATEGY OF THE CAMPAIGN 435  | hung on the barrier fortresses to the east and was swinging closed on Paris . General Von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it closed . By this time the crack was too narrow and a day or two later it banged shut on Paris . As Von Kluck advanced , e armies of Von Buelow , Von Hausen , the Grand Duke Albrecht , and the Crown Prince had kept pace , while the allied armies facing them had given way , not because of the pressure of the armies in front of them , but because the withdrawal of the Anglo-French on the left exposed their flank . Now the left stood on Paris , the right on the barrier fortresses , the center south of the Marne River on a slightly curving line passing through Montmirail , Sezanne , La Fere Champenoise , Camp de ' Madly , Vitry-leFrancois , to Revigny on the Ornain , just north of Bar-le-Due . North of this point Verdun and the barrier fortresses above ' Foul were now half surrounded by the Crown Prince 's army coming west by Stenay , and had been left to their own resources . Between Vitry and Paris the railway disance is 127 miles ; the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had concentrated an army subsequently estimated at 1,100,000 . In addition the garrison at Paris counted 500,000 . Against this the Germans did not have above 900,000 . To succeed it was necessary to throw their full weight upon one point . They selected the center and in the next few days the whole drive was between Sezanne and Vitry , centering at Camp de Mailly , happily for the French the field on which for years their artillery had been tested and their artillerists practised . Nowhere else in all France could their shooting be expected to he half so good . The first operation was Von Kluck 's . On September 1 he was north and as much west as east of Paris . Gathering in all his outriding detachments he marched southeast across the front of the Allies before Paris and then south across the Marne . His advance if continued would have brought him to the left of the French center , which he would have struck on the flank , while Von BueIow struck it full in front . The result would have been disastrous if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he failed . His failure was due to the fact that he was attempting to execute a movement which could only be successful if the garrison in Paris was too small to take the offensive and if the Anglo-French troops who had faced him from the Sambre to the Marne were definitively out of the game . Otherwise , when he had passed Paris going south , the garrison could strike toward his flank and rear while the Anglo-French force advanced against his front . Then he would be precisely in the same peril that Sir John French had been in at Cambrai . Only the prompt collapse of the allied center could help him . No sooner had he touched Provins than the trap was sprung . At the same moment the Paris garrison struck his flank and rear , the British and French his front . The two lines closed upon him as a pair of scissors upon a sheet of paper . For two days he was in deadly peril and his escape here was a supreme triumph of generalship . But in escaping he at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back he opened the flank and rear of the German center which had battled terrifically but had not pierced the allied center . That in turn had to halt , concentrate , and start back ; then the left was in the air and had to follow suit . By September 12 the whole German force was going back followed by French and English troops tasting at last the joy of victory . This was the answer of French strategy to German , a retreat on a selected position , ? a battle at last with every chance in favor of the Allies , after three weeks of delay which brought the Russians up and compelled weakening the German battle line in France to save the eastern frontier . To gain this time , this advantage , General Joffre had sacrificed cities and provinces to flame and sword . It was the calculation of a strong man , who trusted his nation and his government , but neither the nation nor the general was unworthy of such confidence . IX . THE RECOIL When the Germans started back and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command , " lip , guards , and at them , " at Waterloo , flung themselves into the pursuit , the situation of the two armies was strangely reversed . From Cambrai to Paris , Von Kluck had been upon the allied flank struggling to get behind it and crumple it up and after it the center and left . Now the garrison of Paris , done with garrison work for a time , was on his flank reaching for his lines of communication , snapping up his ammunition 436 THE AMERICAN REVIEW OF REVIEWS  | trains in the first hours of the advance Now he was racing for his life to get ahead of the flank thrust and precisely as the Anglo-French left in retreat dragged the whole force with it , Von Kluck was dragging the whole German army . Back over the same roads on which they had advanced , suffering alike from weariness , hunger , lack of ammunition , but still moving almost as fast as when they came , the German army toiled , evacuating town after town , whose capture had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much of the impedimenta of war , beaten upon by torrential rains , assailed by troops still fresh and rested , followed by British cavalry led by Sir John French , possibly the greatest of living cavalrymen , ? such was the German recoil . Again and again the weary lines halted and the artillery fought off the attack . From the Seine to the Aisne , there was no rout . So far the German army showed itself quite as great in retreat as the Allies . So far it was not a Waterloo , but it was a Gettysburg , ? a Gettysburg followed by a prompt , sweeping , tremendous pursuit . The thing that Meade failed to do , Joffre and French did not hesitate to undertake . And so , having raced from the frontier to Paris to get on the allied flank , the Germans raced from Paris toward the frontier to save their own flank . For them the world had turned upside down ; for the historians it was a marvelous repetition of a tremendous drama . For fifty years the farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as the high-water mark of the Confederacy . The high-water mark of German invasion was Lagny , seventeen miles from Paris and five from the outer ring of forts . Von Kluck reached it on September 6 , thirteen days earlier than Von Moltke in 1870 . X. THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN The German attack upon France was a desperate effort to end a war , so far as France was concerned , by a single dash . The Russian operations were from the outset frankly the beginning of a campaign . Nor is it possible yet to review , even with the relative clarity official statements for the western field permit , the progress of the terrific battles along the Vistula , the Dneister , and the . San . Only the broader outlines can be sketched . For the Russians two tasks were necessarily set . Beginning at the earliest possible moment they must exercise pressure upon the German forces in East Prussia and compel the recall of troops from the French field of operations ; second , they must crush Austrian military strength before prospective German victories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern battles . The geography of the Russian campaign is simple . Russian Poland projects far into the bulk of Austro-German territory , ? is , in fact , more than half surrounded by German East Prussia and Austrian Galicia . The westernmost town of Russian Poland is little more than 200 miles from Berlin and the road lies through the German fortress of Posen . On this road it might be expected that Russia would thrust out . But such expectation wholly disregarded the military situation . Had Russia sent her main army this way , it would have been open to attack on both flanks by the troops in hostile territory north and south and its communications with Russia might have been cut behind it almost before it had crossed the frontier . Because of this , Russian mobilization was based not on Warsaw in the middle of Russian Poland , but on the MemelCzernowitz line far behind . The first operations were directed not at invading Posen. but at crushing German troops in East Prussia and Austrian in Galicia , thus clearing the flanks for the main advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prussia , about Gumbinnen , where a considerable Russian army stepped over the line , defeated the Germanrolled them back to Koenigsberg , while a second army coming north from Warsaw struck at Allenstein south of Danzig . This invasion , barely three weeks after war had been declared , compelled the transfer of two German corps from the west to east . Once they had arrived , Russian invasion ova checked , Russian armies wholly defeated and sent home , but the two corps had still to be kept on the field . Meantime operations far to the south demonstrated that the East Prussian operation had been minor . For presently about Lemberg , in Galicia , a huge Russian force , ? the Austrians estimated it at a million , ? began to exercise pressure . Its left on the Carpathians , its right in Russian Poland before Lublin ; toward which the Austrian left was striking , its center before Lemberg , this Russian army advanced through ten days of furious fighting . The battle ended in Austrian disaster , On the right , Halicz on  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routed . Two days before , Lemberg fell , abandoned by a defeated army hastening west toward Przemysl , the chief fortress of Galicia . The fall of Lemberg was announced on September I , with the report of the capture of 80,000 Austrians and the killing and wounding of 50,000 more . Five corps , five of the eight non-Slav corps which make up the Austrian army , were crushed . As for the Austrian left moving on Lublin , it was left in the air , and had to turn back , fighting all the time to get to the cover of Przemysl and Jaroslay . It , too , met with disaster . By September 16 Russian official bulletins announced the capture of 250,000 Austrian troops , a third of the eastern army , together with cannon innumerable and a wealth of material , the flight of the survivors , the investment of Przemysl , of Cracow , the appearance of Cossacks on the crests of the Carpathians toward Hungary , above all the beginning of the main Russian advance to Berlin by Breslau and Silesia . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Battle of Cambrai , the victory of Lemberg five more , before the battle of the Marne . Eastward , too , came two corps which Austria had rashly enough lent to Germany to crush France . Such was Austro-German contempt for Russian military strength . In the west , France had demonstrated that her army was not that of Sedan . In the east , Russia proved that the lessons of Mukden were not forgotten . By her victories in Galicia she had also , by September 17 , apparently destroyed Austrian military strength . Her task had been to weaken German strength in France and crush Austria ; she had performed both tasks beyond the expectations of her allies . XI . FROM THE MARNE TO THE AISNE It remains to review briefly the operations from the Marne to the Aisne , ? operations still continuing at the moment these lines are written . When General Von Kluck fought his way out of the trap set for him near Paris and started north , he was exactly in the position of the Allies during the long retreat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy had labored , first to encircle the allied left and roll it up , interposing between it and Paris ; second , to crush the allied army when at last it made a stand at the Marne . Now the Allies on Von Kluck 's front and flank were driving at the same object . From September 7 to 14 Von Kluck went north . On the 13th , with their right flank protected by the Oise. beyond which to the west a strong flank guard stood at Noyon , seventy miles north of Paris , the German forces began to take root behind Soissons ,  | with the Aisne in their front . Under pressure they gave slightly and stood on the heights to the north from Laon east through Craonne , across the Aisne north of Rheims to the Argonne , beyond which the Crown Prince was struggling desperately to get out of trouble . On this line Von Buelow , Von Hausen , and the Grand Duke Albrecht had taken position , falling back and keeping in touch with Von Kluck . In all this time French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right flank of Von Kluck , in pressing hard upon the center at the same time , and in a hard drive to catch the Crown Prince . In the general advance of the Germans , the mission of the Crown Prince had been to.surround the barrier fortresses of Verdun and ' Foul , while General Von Heeringen , coming west against Nancy from Alsace-Lorraine , had endeavored to cut them off to the south . Had this move succeeded there would then have been opened a short road between the Germans and their own fortresses and railroads at Metz and Thionville , and the long and dangerous route through Belgium could be abandoned and the thousands of soldiers occupied in guarding it released . When it failed , it left the Crown Prince west of Verdun , still untaken , with his line of retreat in peril , because the French at Verdun were on both sides of the Meuse and nearer than he to his road home . Thus in the fighting that followed and still continues , the object of the French was and is to attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Meuse , while at the same time exerting pressure on the center to force a general retreat out of France . As for the Germans ' plan , it has not yet been fully revealed . Their stand might mean that they were making a tremendous rearguard fight to let their heavy artillery , traveling over muddy roads , get safely away . It might mean that they were endeavoring , by severe resistance in the center and on the right , to prevent the Allies from sending reinforcements against the Crown Prince . But aside from these defensive operations , all preliminary to a further retreat , this time behind the Meuse , it might also mean that the Germans , having failed in their first great drive to destroy the French army on the Marne , had fallen back to a selected position , strongly fortified in advance , to refit , to replenish their ammunition exhausted in the recent fighting , to await the arrival of reinforcements from East Prussia before advancing again . If the last were the case , it might be expected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive , and certain movements about September 17 seemed to confirm such a view . As for the Allies , it became a matter of gravest importance for them to keep the Germans on the defensive , to compel them to continue the retreat before they were strengthened by new regiments , for if they resumed the offensive the victory on the Marne might prove to have been only a technical victory and the battle have to be fought over again . The Battle of Cambrai proved to be the defeat of the German plan to envelop the Allies and achieve a second Sedan . The Battle of the Marne , like the Battle of Gettysburg , was a victory for an army standing and accepting a battle which , if unfavorable , might have brought national disaster . The Battle of the Aisne , still undecided , now , seems to be a contest to determine whether the Allies can drive the Germans out of France , put them definitely on the defensive in the western field , or whether , after a brief retreat and a short stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again driving defeated forces before them .
