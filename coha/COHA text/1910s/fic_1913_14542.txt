Evening . A room in an old cottage , with walls of dark oak , lit only by the moonlight that peers through the long , low casement-window at the back , and the glow from the fire that is burning merrily on the spectator 's left . A cobbled street can be seen outside , and a door to the right of the window opens directly on to it . Opposite the fire is a kitchen dresser with cups and plates twinkling in the firelight . A high-backed oak settle , as though afraid of the cold moonlight , has turned its back on the window and warms its old timbers at the fire . In the middle of the room stands a table with a red cover ; there are chairs on either side of it . On the hob , a kettle is keeping itself warm ; whilst overhead , on the hood of the chimney-piece , a small lamp is turned very low . A figure flits past the window and , with a click of the latch , PIERRETTE enters . She hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiver and runs to warm herself for a moment . Then , having turned up the lamp , she places the kettle on the fire . Crossing the room , she takes a tablecloth from the dresser and proceeds to lay tea , setting out crockery for two . Once she goes to the window and , drawing aside the common red casement-curtains , looks out , but returns to her work , disappointed . She puts a spoonful of tea into the teapot , and another , and a third . Something outside attracts her attention ; she listens , her face brightening . A voice is heard singing : " Baby , do n't wait for the moon , She is caught in a tangle of boughs ; And mellow and musical JuneIs saying ' Good-night ' to the cows . " ( The voice draws nearer and a conical white hat goes past the window . PIERROT enters . ) PIERROT ( throwing his hat to PIERRETTE ) . Ugh ! How cold it is . My feet are like ice . p. 3 PIERRETTE Here are your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She kneels beside him , as he sits before the fire and commences to slip off his shoes . ) PIERROT ( singing ) . " Baby , do n't wait for the moon , She will put out her tongue and grimace ; And mellow and musical JuneIs pinning the stars in their place . " Is n't tea ready yet ? PIERRETTE Nearly . Only waiting for the kettle to boil . PIERROT How cold it was in the market-place to-day ! I do n't believe I sang at all well . I ca n't sing in the cold . PIERRETTE Ah , you 're like the kettle . He ca n't sing when he 's cold either . Hurry up , Mr. Kettle , if you please . PIERROT I wish it were in love with the sound of its own voice . PIERRETTE I believe it is . Now it 's singing like a bird . We 'll make the tea with the nightingale 's tongue . ( She pours the boiling water into the teapot ) . Come along . PIERROT ( looking into the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had form , but had she soul ? PIERRETTE ( cutting bread and butter at the table ) . Come and be cheerful , instead of grumbling there to the fire . p. 4 PIERROT I was thinking . PIERRETTE Come and have tea . When you sit by the fire , thoughts only fly up the chimney . PIERROT The whole world 's a chimney-piece . Give people a thing as worthless as paper , and it catches fire in them and makes a stir ; but real thought , they let it go up with the smoke . PIERRETTE Cheer up , Pierrot . See how thick I 've spread the butter . PIERROT You 're always cheerful . PIERRETTE I try to be happy . PIERROT Ugh ! ( He has moved to the table . There is a short silence , during which PIERROT sips his tea moodily . ) PIERRETTE Tea all right ? PIERROT Middling . PIERRETTE Only middling ! I 'll pour you out some fresh . PIERROT Oh , it 's all right ! How you do worry a fellow ! PIERRETTE Heigh-ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIERROT I say , did you see that girl to-day ? PIERRETTE Whereabouts ? PIERROT Standing by the horse-trough . With a fine air , and a string of great beads . p. 5 PIERRETTE I did n't see her . PIERROT I did , though . And she saw me . Watched me all the time I was singing , and clapped her hands like anything each time . I wonder if it is possible for a woman to have a soul as well as such beautiful colouring . PIERRETTE She was made up ! PIERROT I 'm sure she was not ! And how do you know ? You did n't see her . PIERRETTE Perhaps I did see her . PIERROT Now , look here , Pierrette , it 's no good your being jealous . When you and I took on this show business , we arranged to be just partners and nothing more . If I see any one I want to marry , I shall marry ' em . And if you see any one who wants to marry you , you can marry ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd ! PIERROT ( singing abstractedly ) . " Baby , do n't wait for the moon , She has scratched her white chin on the gorse ; And mellow and musical JuneIs bringing the cuckoo remorse . " PIERRETTE Did you see that girl after the show ? PIERROT No . She had slipped away in the crowd . Here , I 've had enough tea . I shall go out and try to find her . p. 6 PIERRETTE Why do n't you stay in by the fire ? You could help me to darn the socks . PIERROT Do n't try to chaff me . Darning , indeed ! I hope life has got something better in it than darning . PIERRETTE I doubt it . It 's pretty much the same all the world over . First we wear holes in our socks , and then we mend them . The wise ones are those who make the best of it , and darn as well as they can . PIERROT I say , that gives me an idea for a song . PIERRETTE Out with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed it yet . This is what flashed through my mind as you spoke : ( He runs up on to the table , using it as a stage ) . " Life 's a ball of worsted , Unwind it if you can , You who oft have boasted ( He pauses for a moment , then hurriedly , in order to gloss over the false accenting ) . That you are a man . " Of course that 's only a rough idea . PIERRETTE Are you going to sing it at the show ? PIERROT ( jumping down from the table ) . You 're always so lukewarm . A man of artistic ideas is as sensitively skinned as a baby . p. 7 PIERRETTE Do stay in , Pierrot . It 's so cold outside . PIERROT You want me to listen to you grumbling , I suppose . PIERRETTE Just now you said I was always cheerful . PIERROT There you are ; girding at me again . PIERRETTE I 'm sorry , Pierrot . But the market-place is dreadfully wet , and your shoes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop in . I 'm going out to find that girl . How do I know she is n't the very woman of my dreams ? PIERRETTE Why are you always trying to picture an ideal woman ? PIERROT Do n't you ever picture an ideal man ? PIERRETTE No , I try to be practical . PIERROT Women are so unimaginative ! They are such pathetic , motherly things , and when they feel extra motherly they say , " I 'm in love . " All that is so sordid and petty . I want a woman I can set on a pedestal , and just look up at her and love her . PIERRETTE ( speaking very fervently ) . " Pierrot , do n't wait for the moon , There 's a heart chilling cold in her rays ; And mellow and musical JuneWill only last thirty short days . " p. 8 PIERROT Oh , I should never make you understand ! Well , I 'm off . ( As he goes out , he sings , sidelong , over his shoulder in a mocking tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " PIERRETTE listens for a moment to his voice dying away in the distance . Then she moves to the fireplace , and begins to stir the fire . As she kneels there , the words of an old recitation form on her lips . Half unconsciously she recites it again to an audience of laughing flames and glowing , thoughtful coals . " There lives a maid in the big , wide world , By the crowded town and mart , And people sigh as they pass her by ; They call her Hungry Heart.For there trembles that on her red rose lipThat never her tongue can say , And her eyes are sad , and she is not gladIn the beautiful calm of day.Deep down in the waters of pure , clear thought , The mate of her fancy lies ; Sleeping , the night is made fair by his lightSweet kiss on her dreaming eyes . Though a man was made in the wells of timeWho could set her soul on fire , Her life unwinds , and she never findsThis love of her heart 's desire.If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a meddler 's part.Silence were best ; let her keep in her breastThe dream of her hungry heart . " ( Overcome by tears , she hides her face in her hands . A slow , treble knock comes on the door ; PIERRETTE looks up wonderingly . Again the knock sounds. ) p. 9 PIERRETTE Come in . ( The door swings slowly open , as though of its own accord , and without , on the threshold , is seen THE MANUFACTURER , standing full in the moonlight . He is a curious , though kindly-looking , old man , and yet , with all his years , he does not appear to be the least infirm . He is the sort of person that children take to instinctively . He wears a quaintly cut , bottle-green coat , with silver buttons and large side-pockets , which almost hides his knee-breeches . His shoes have large buckles and red heels . He is exceedingly unlike a prosperous manufacturer , and , but for the absence of a violin , would be mistaken for a village fiddler . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again of its own accord , the door closes noiselessly behind him . ) PIERRETTE ( jumping up and moving towards him ) . Oh , I 'm so sorry . I ought to have opened the door when you knocked . THE MANUFACTURER That 's all right . I 'm used to opening doors . And yours opens much more easily than some I come across . Would you believe it , some people positively nail their doors up , and it 's no good knocking . But there , you 're wondering who I am . PIERRETTE I was wondering if you were hungry . THE MANUFACTURER Ah , a woman 's instinct . But , thank you , no . I am a small eater ; I might say a very small eater . A smile or a squeeze of the hand keeps me going admirably . p. 10 PIERRETTE At least you 'll sit down and make yourself at home . THE MANUFACTURER ( moving to the settle ) . Well , I have a habit of making myself at home everywhere . In fact , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May I put my feet on the fender ? It 's an old habit of mine . I always do it . PIERRETTE They say round here : " Without feet on the fenderLove is but slender . " THE MANUFACTURER Quite right . It is the whole secret of the domestic fireside . Pierrette , you have been crying . PIERRETTE I believe I have . THE MANUFACTURER Bless you , I know all about it . It 's Pierrot . And so you 're in love with him , and he does n't care a little bit about you , eh ? What a strange old world it is ! And you cry your eyes out over him . PIERRETTE Oh , no , I do n't often cry . But to-night he seemed more grumpy than usual , and I tried so hard to cheer him up . THE MANUFACTURER Grumpy , is he ? PIERRETTE He does n't mean it , though . It 's the cold weather , and the show has n't been paying so well lately . Pierrot wants to write an article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisement . He thinks the editor may print it if he gives him free passes for his family . p. 11 THE MANUFACTURER Do you think Pierrot is worth your tears ? PIERRETTE Oh , yes ! THE MANUFACTURER You know , tears are not to be wasted . We only have a certain amount of them given to us just for keeping the heart moist . And when we 've used them all up and have n't any more , the heart dries up , too . PIERRETTE Pierrot is a splendid fellow . You do n't know him as well as I do . It 's true he 's always discontented , but it 's only because he 's not in love with any one . You know , love does make a tremendous difference in a man . THE MANUFACTURER That 's true enough . And has it made a difference in you ? PIERRETTE Oh , yes ! I put Pierrot 's slippers down to warm , and I make tea for him , and all the time I 'm happy because I 'm doing something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should find it a drudgery . THE MANUFACTURER Are you sure it 's real love ? PIERRETTE Why , yes ! THE MANUFACTURER Every time you think of Pierrot , do you hear the patter of little bare feet ? And every time he speaks , do you feel little chubby hands on your breast and face ? PIERRETTE ( fervently ) . Yes ! Oh , yes ! That 's just it ! p. 12 THE MANUFACTURER You 've got it right enough . But why is it that Pierrot can wake up all this poetry in you ? PIERRETTE Because  --  oh , because he 's just Pierrot . THE MANUFACTURER " Because he 's just Pierrot . " The same old reason . PIERRETTE Of course , he is a bit dreamy . But that 's his soul . I am sure he could do great things if he tried . And have you noticed his smile ? Is n't it lovely ! Sometimes , when he 's not looking , I want ever so much to try it on , just to see how I should look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd smile at me a little more often , instead of at others . THE MANUFACTURER Ho ! So he smiles at others , does he ? PIERRETTE Hardly a day goes by but there 's some fine lady at the show . There was one there to-day , a tall girl with red cheeks . He is gone to look for her now . And it is not their faults . The poor things ca n't help being in love with him . ( Proudly ) . I believe every one is in love with Pierrot . THE MANUFACTURER But supposing one of these fine ladies were to marry him ? PIERRETTE Oh , they 'd never do that . A fine lady would never marry a poor singer . If Pierrot were to get married , I think I should just fade away Oh , but I do n't know why I talk to you like this . I feel as if I had known you for a long , long time . ( The MANUFACTURER rises from the settle and moves across to PIERRETTE , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANUFACTURER ( very slowly ) . Perhaps you have known me for a long , long time . ( His tone is so kindly and impressive that PIERRETTE forgets the table-cloth and looks up at him . For a moment or two he smiles back at her as she gazes , spellbound ; then he turns away to the fire again , with the little chuckle that is never far from his lips . ) PIERRETTE ( taking a small bow from his side-pocket ) . Oh , look at this . THE MANUFACTURER ( in mock alarm ) . Oh , oh , I did n't mean you to see that . I 'd forgotten it was sticking out of my pocket . I used to do a lot of archery at one time . I do n't get much chance now . ( He takes it and puts it back in his pocket . ) PIERROT ( singing in the distance ) . " Baby , do n't wait for the moon , She is drawing the sea in her net ; And mellow and musical JuneIs teaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper as the voice draws nearer ) . Who is that ? PIERRETTE Pierrot . ( Again the conical white hat flashes past the window and PIERROT enters ) p. 14 PIERROT I ca n't find her anywhere . ( Seeing the MANUFACTURER ) . Hullo ! Who are you ? THE MANUFACTURER I am a stranger to you , but Pierrette knew me in a moment . PIERROT An old flame perhaps ? THE MANUFACTURER True , I am an old flame . I 've lighted up the world for a considerable time . Yet when you say " old , " there are many people who think I 'm wonderfully well preserved for my age . How long do you think I 've been trotting about ? PIERROT ( testily , measuring a length with his hands ) . Oh , about that long . THE MANUFACTURER I suppose being funny all day does get on your nerves . PIERRETTE Pierrot , you need n't be rude . THE MANUFACTURER ( anxious to be alone with PIERROT ) . Pierrette , have you got supper in ? PIERRETTE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut . Will you be here when I come back ? THE MANUFACTURER ( bustling her out ) . I ca n't promise , but I 'll try , I 'll try . ( PIERRETTE goes out . There is a silence , during which the MANUFACTURER regards PIERROT with amusement. ) p. 15 THE MANUFACTURER Well , friend Pierrot , so business is not very brisk . PIERROT Brisk ! If laughter meant business , it would be brisk enough , but there 's no money . However , I 've done one good piece of work to-day . I 've arranged with the editor to put an article in the paper . That will fetch ' em . ( Singing ) . " Please come one day and see our house that 's down among the trees , But do not come at four o'clock for then we count the bees , And bathe the tadpoles and the frogs , who splash the clouds with gold , And watch the new-cut cucumbers perspiring with the cold . " That 's a song I 'm writing . THE MANUFACTURER Pierrot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't be happy . PIERROT Would n't I ? Give me all the money in the world and I 'll risk it . To start with , I 'd build schools to educate the people up to high-class things . THE MANUFACTURER You dream of fame and wealth and empty ideals , and you miss all the best things there are . You are discontented . Why ? Because you do n't know how to be happy . PIERROT ( reciting ) . " Life 's a running brooklet , Catch the fishes there , You who wrote a bookletOn a woman 's hair . " ( Explaining ) . That 's another song I 'm writing . It 's the second verse . Things come to me all of a sudden like that . I must run out a third verse , just to wind it up . p. 16 THE MANUFACTURER Why do n't you write a song without any end , one that goes on for ever ? PIERROT I say , that 's rather silly , is n't it ? THE MANUFACTURER It all depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be always happy . PIERROT That wants a bit of doing in my line . THE MANUFACTURER Shall you and I transact a little business ? PIERROT By all means . What seats would you like ? There are the front rows covered in velvet , one shilling ; wooden benches behind , sixpence ; and , right at the back , the two-penny part . But , of course , you 'll have shilling ones . How many shall we say ? THE MANUFACTURER You do n't know who I am . PIERROT That makes no difference . All are welcome , and we thank you for your courteous attention . THE MANUFACTURER Pierrot , I am a maker of dreams . PIERROT A what ? THE MANUFACTURER I make all the dreams that float about this musty world . PIERROT I say , you 'd better have a rest for a bit . I expect you 're a trifle done up . THE MANUFACTURER Pierrot , Pierrot , your superior mind ca n't tumble to my calling . A child or one of the " people " would in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little things that glide about into people 's hearts and make them glad . Have n't you often wondered where the swallows go to in the autumn ? They come to my workshop , and tell me who wants a dream , and what happened to the dreams they took with them in the spring . p. 17 PIERROT Oh , I say , you ca n't expect me to believe that . THE MANUFACTURER When flowers fade , have you never wondered where their colours go to , or what becomes of all the butterflies in the winter ? There is n't much winter about my workshop . PIERROT I had never thought of it before . THE MANUFACTURER It 's a kind of lost property office , where every beautiful thing that the world has neglected finds its way . And there I make my celebrated dream , the dream that is called " love . " PIERROT Ho ! ho ! Now we 're talking . THE MANUFACTURER You do n't believe it ? PIERROT Yes , in a way . But it does n't last . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't soul , and , if there is soul , there is n't form . Oh , I 've tried hard enough to believe it , but , after the first wash , the colours run . THE MANUFACTURER You only got hold of a substitute . Wait until you see the genuine article . PIERROT But how is one to tell it ? THE MANUFACTURER There are heaps of signs . As soon as you get the real thing , your shoulder-blades begin to tingle . That 's love 's wings sprouting . And , next , you want to soar up among the stars and sit on the roof of heaven and sing to the moon . Of course , that 's because I put such a lot of the moon into my dreams . I break bits off until it 's nearly all gone , and then I let it grow big again . It grows very quickly , as I dare say you 've noticed . After a fortnight it is ready for use once more . p. 18 PIERROT This is most awfully fascinating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANUFACTURER Not always ; I have other messengers . Every night when the big clock strikes twelve , a day slips down from the calendar , and runs away to my workshop in the Land of Long Ago . I give him a touch of scarlet and a gleam of gold , and say , " Go back , little Yesterday , and be a memory in the world . " But my best dreams I keep for to-day . I buy babies , and fit them up with a dream , and then send them complete and carriage paid in the usual manner . PIERROT I 've been dreaming all my life , but they 've always been dreams I made myself . I suppose I do n't mix ' em properly . THE MANUFACTURER You leave out the very essence of them . You must put in a little sorrow , just to take away the over-sweetness . I found that out very soon , so I took a little of the fresh dew that made pearls in the early morning , and I sprinkled my dreams with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift of tears ! How beautifull You know , I should rather like to try a real one . Not one of my own making . THE MANUFACTURER Well , there are plenty about , if you only look for them . PIERROT That is all very well , but who 's going to look about for stray dreams ? p. 19 THE MANUFACTURER I once made a dream that would just suit you . I slipped it inside a baby . That was twenty years ago , and the baby is now a full-grown woman , with great blue eyes and fair hair . PIERROT It 's a lot of use merely telling me about her . THE MANUFACTURER I 'll do more . When I shipped her to the world , I kept the bill of lading . Here it is . You shall have it . PIERROT Thanks , but what 's the good of it ? THE MANUFACTURER Why , the holder of that is able to claim the goods ; you will notice it contains a complete description , too . I promise you , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a string of great beads ? THE MANUFACTURER No . PIERROT Ah , then it is not she . Where shall I find her ? THE MANUFACTURER That 's for you to discover . All you have to do is to search . PIERROT I 'll start at once . ( He moves as if to go . ) THE MANUFACTURER I should n't start out tonight . PIERROT But I want to find her soon . Somebody else may find her before me. p. 20 THE MANUFACTURER Pierrot , there was once a man who wanted to gather mushrooms . PIERROT ( annoyed at the commonplace ) . Mushrooms ! THE MANUFACTURER Fearing people would be up before him , he started out overnight . Morning came , and he found none , so he returned disconsolate to his house . As he came through the garden , he found a great mushroom had grown up in the night by his very door-step . Take the advice of one who knows , and wait a bit . PIERROT If that 's your advice But tell me this , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say for certain . Would you consider yourself a fool ? PIERROT Ah of course when you ask me a direct thing like that , you make it er rather awkward for me . But , if I may say so , as man to ma I mean as man to ( He hesitates . ) THE MANUFACTURER ( waiving the point ) . Yes , yes . PIERROT Well , I flatter myself that THE MANUFACTURER Exactly . And that 's your principal danger . Whilst you are striding along gazing at the stars , you may be treading on a little glowworm . Shall I give you a third verse for your song ? " Life 's a woman calling , Do not stop your ears , Lest , when night is falling , Darkness brings you tears . " ( The MANUFACTURER 'S kindly and impressive tone holds PIERROT as it had held PIERRETTE some moments before . Whilst the two are looking at each other , a little red cloak dances past the window , and PIERRETTE enters with her marketing. ) p. 21 PIERRETTE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE MANUFACTURER But I must be going now . I am a great traveller . PIERRETTE ( standing against the door , so that he can not pass ) . Oh , you must n't go yet . THE MANUFACTURER Do n't make me fly out of the window . I only do that under very unpleasant circumstances . PIERROT ( gaily , with mock eloquence ) . Pierrette , regard our visitor . You little knew whom you were entertaining . You see before you the maker of the dreams that slip about the world like little fish among the rushes of a stream . He has given me the bill of lading of his great masterpiece , and it only remains for me to find her . ( Dropping to the commonplace ) . I wish I knew where to look . THE MANUFACTURER Before I go , I will give you this little rhyme : " Let every woman keep a school , For every man is born a fool . " ( He bows , and goes out quickly and silently . ) PIERRETTE ( running to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how quickly he has gone ! He 's out of sight . PIERROT At last I am about to attain my great ideal . There will be a grand wedding , and I shall wear my white coat with the silver braid , and carry a tall gold-topped stick . ( Singing . ) " If we play any longer , I fear you will getSuch a cold in the head , for the grass is so wet.But during the night , Margareta divine , I will hang the wet grass up to dry on the line . " Pierrette , I feel that I am about to enter into a man 's inheritance , a woman 's love . p. 22 PIERRETTE I wish you every happiness . PIERROT ( singing teasingly ) . " We shall meet in our dreams , that 's a thing understood ; You dream of the river , I 'll dream of the wood.I am visiting you , if the river it be ; If we meet in the wood , you are visiting me . " PIERRETTE We must make lots of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll dance and dance until I fall , and the people will exclaim , " Why , she has danced herself to death . " PIERROT You 're right . We must pull the show together . I 'll do that article for the paper at once . ( He takes paper , ink , etc. , from the dresser , and , seating himself at the table , commences to write ) . " There has lately come to this town a company of strolling players , who give a show that is at once musical and droll . The audience is enthralled by Pierrot 's magnificent singing and dancing , and er very much entertained by Pierrette 's homely dancing . Pierrette is a charming comedienne of twenty , with " what colour hair ? PIERRETTE Fair , quite fair . PIERROT Funny how one can see a person every day and not know the colour of their hair . " Fair hair and " eyes ? p. 23 PIERRETTE Blue , Pierrot . PIERROT " Fair hair and blue eyes . " Fair ! Blue ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIERRETTE What 's nonsense ? PIERROT Something I was thinking . Most girls have fair hair and blue eyes . PIERRETTE Yes , Pierrot , we ca n't all be ideals . PIERROT How musical your voice sounds ! I ca n't make it out . Oh , but , of course , it is all nonsense ! ( He takes the bill of lading from his pocket and reads it . ) PIERRETTE What 's nonsense ? Pierrot , wo n't you tell me ? PIERROT Pierrette , stand in the light . PIERRETTE Is anything the matter ? PIERROT I almost believe that nothing matters . ( Reading and glancing at her ) . " Eyes that say ' I love you ' ; arms that say ' I want you ' ; lips that say ' Why do n't you ? ' " Pierrette , is it possible ! I 've never noticed before how beautiful you are . You do n't seem a bit the same . I believe you have lost your real face , and have carved another out of a rose . PIERRETTE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've found it at last . Do n't you understand it all ? " I am a foolWho has learned wisdom in your school . " To think that I 've seen you every day , and never dreamed dreamed ! Yes , ah yes , it 's one of his beautiful dreams . That is why my heart seems full of the early morning . p. 24 PIERRETTE Ah , Pierrot ! PIERROT Oh , how my shoulders tingle ! I want to soar up , up . Do n't you want to fly up to the roof of heaven and sing among the stars ? PIERRETTE I have been sitting on the moon ever so long , waiting for my lover . Pierrot , let me try on your smile . Give it to me in a kiss . ( With their hands outstretched behind them , they lean towards each other , till their lips meet in a long kiss . ) PIERRETTE ( throwing back her head with a deep sigh of happiness ) . Oh , I am so happy . This might be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit by the fire and put our feet on the fender , and live happily ever after . ( They have moved slowly to the settle . As they sit there , PIERROT sings softly : ) " Baby , do n't wait for the moon , The stairs of the sky are so steep ; And mellow and musical JuneIs waiting to kiss you to sleep . " ( The lamp on the hood of the chimney-piece has burned down , leaving only the red glow from the fire upon their faces , as the curtain whispers down to hide them. )
