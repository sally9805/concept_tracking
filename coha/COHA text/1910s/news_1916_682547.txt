txt Accordingto He Chooses seemingly " offithe Logic cial " report from of Pacifism ! the . Ford factory in Detroit , if any of Its 20,000 employes who are or who become members of the National Guard stop work as a result of the present possibility of a war with Mexico , they will be treated " as though they ? had quit the plant to engage in other lines of business . " So carefully made is this statement that though it is credited , not to Mr. FORD himself , but to " one of his assistants . " there is little of obvious danger in assuming that it defines Mr. Foso 's own position and purposes as clearly as he cares to have them defined at present . It will be observed that there Is nothing In the words to bring upon anybody responsible for them the legal penalty , or risk of penalty , incurred by an employer who threatens with discharge or other punishment an employe who joins the National Guard or who discriminates against one who belongs to it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not expect , and will pot get , from him , while serving the country as a whole ' - ' and Mr. FORD 'S interests only Incidentally ? the special consideration as to salary and place which so many other business men of something like his financial resources have promised their men in like case . As a distinguished pacifist who is determined to retain that eminence , such action as this was enforced on Mr. FORD by logic and consistency , but there are also the logic and consistency of ? the patriot , and nobody is really inclined to deny that Mr. FORD at least wants and intends to be a patriot . One can not help regretting , therefore , that having ? seen to what end his pacifism has brought him , he does not decide to abandon it , at least to the extent of admitting that the country 's call for help must be obeyed . Thep , not less logically or consistently , he could act in his other capacity and be as efficiently patriotic as his neighbors . Instead , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided on action which , while not technically illegal , violates the spirit of the law by impeding , as much as he can , recruiting for the National Guard . His men already in it must go where they are ordered , regardless of his preferences or their own , but ho is keeping men out of the Guard and encouraging others to do so . Of what were at A Possible first the many unSolution certainties a b o u t of a Mystery . the naval battle off coast of Jutland , practically all but one have now been cleared up : We know how it , happened that the British lost so many ships and men , and can fairly well understand  --  why the first report of the battle , as made by the British Admiralty , gave everybody the false impression that the Germans had won , if not exactly a victory , at any rate something very much like one . The cost of the encounter to each side has been disclosed with an accuracy no longer subject to reasonable questioning . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ill-advisedly described as a rat hole , there has been to this day no other or better explanation than the one first made  --  that they were out on " an enterprise to thel northward . " The nature of that " enterprise " still I can only be guessed , and for none of the I guesses can more than plausibility be claimed . One which has that merit tol some degree is that the risks of battle were taken by the Germans in order that ' while the attention of the British commanders was concentrated on such big game as the fighting ships of their enemies , a more or less numerous fleet of swift cruisers , lightly armed and armored , could slip out into the Atlantic , and on that and other oceans duplicate the achievements as commerce destroyers of the Emden. the MOwe , the Eitel Friedrich , and the few others that happened to be free when the war began . This theory , while not confirmed by the concealment by the Germans for a time of some of their losses in the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for thus there is provided for the concealment the " military reason " that without it is lacking . The Germans may have thought , or hoped , that the missing ships had escaped to carry out the " enterprise to the northward " that had been planned . If this theory is sound , the importance of the British victory , expensive as it was , is very great . . That not a few Meeting a women feel as Pressing strongly as men the Emergency . desire directly to serve their country , at a. time like this , is shown plainly enough by their prompt and eager taking up of several activities related closely and in highly . important ways to the actual military operations . Red Cross work in one or another capacity has attracted great numbers of them , as has the task of providing for the soldiers in the field , the hospitals , and the training camps those smaller comforts , diversions , and luxuries which , though not coming within the scope of the governmental agencies , yet have a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of army life . Another most admirable enterprise has been undertaken by the women who are devoting their special attention to caring for the wives and children of the men who have so suddenly and unexpectedly been taken from their homes , and deprived , for what may be many months , of the earning power that kept those homes going . Not a few of the domestic crises thus created are pathetic , and even desperate , and they are of a sort with which the Federal authorities hardly could , and certainly do not , deal . They require , and perfectly well deserve , the personal attention which patriotic women , themselves more fortunately equipped with resources . can , give and are now planning to give systematically . The work to be done along this line is one of beneficence , but not of charity . That always offensive and demoralizing taint can be avoided by viewing it as something between a privilege and a duty . Its efficient performance will remove , or at least largely mitigate , what is by far the cruelest hardship incidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the risking of his own life that troubles the mind of the volunteer soldier half as much as the thought that he is leaving behind a wife and children inadequately provided with the necessities of life .
