The gloomily romantic John Trevena of Dartmoor 's present here becomes the lighthearted and fairly light-footed adventurer in the romance of her past . The scene is laid in. the early eighteenth century . England is beginning to drink tea ( when she can afford it ) and has not forgotten her fear of witches . The official villain , one of those grinding country lawyers , tyrants , and extortioners who have played such a part in rural fiction , is abjectly superstitious , and much of the action turns upon this weakness . Among many other victims of Grambla 's greed and trickiness has been Squire Clabar of Moyle , who has died ruined and brokenhearted , and whose son has become Grambla 's drudge . Against this son , as the story opens , Grambla turns ; discharges him from his employ , and turns him out of his cottage . At this moment , however , returns to Moyle Church-Town , after long absence as a sailor and wanderer , Clabar 's supposed son Peter . who is really his daughter Cherry .

Cherry , like Rosalind and others too numerous for mention , has roamed the world without harm in her man 's garb . She is able to appear either as a strong fellow with a gruff voice or , in the twinkling of an eye , even without shift of raiment , all that is fair and feminine . By taking the trouble to squint a bit , the reader may easily give the old sievelike convention the air of holding water once more . Having accomplished this feat , he may well enjoy a tale told with far more skill and gusto than are common to its kind . The baronet designs Cherry 's hand ( she is something of an heiress , and he knows the secret of her birth ) for his eldest son ; but it is the younger who has won her heart , and , after due mystifications , she surprises him with her hand .

AU this has been done , but who shall say that it does not deserve to be done again and yet again , so long as a storyteller may be found who can bring a fresh and willing hand to the business ? In Mr. Knox 's Country . By E. W. Somerville and Martin Ross . New York : Long-mans , Green &; Co . We suppose that Miss Somerville and Miss Ross , the two ladies who write of Ireland with so robust humor and so virile pens , are regarded as quite dOclassees by those of the modern Irish school , who , without Synge 's genius , ape Synge 's melancholy . It is quite possible that we should be told , if indeed we have not been told already , that these most entertaining ladies who belong properly to the tradition of Lover and Lever are false to the ideals of Ireland and misrepresent the Irish people to make a-Saxon holiday . Well , if indeed we shall be thus exhorted , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , we imagine , will Miss Somerville and Miss Ross . And we shall continue in our phlegmatic Saxon way to hold it as an article of faith that the colors used by these ladies are not less true of Ireland than the sombre tints of Synge 's imitators . After all , it does n't rain every day , even in Ireland . In the present volume we renew acquaintance with many delightful friends , and chief among them Mr. Flurry Knox , master of hounds , and that shrewd old tartar , his grandmother . We can not discover the faintest sign of any exhaustion of the fecund imagination that has produced so many stories dealing with the adventures of Major Yeates , R.M. , and his neighbors . Indeed , the humor , if anything , seems to romp more riotously through this series of sketches than through its predecessors . " The Comte de Pralines " is an example of the authors ' woik at its best . The description of the famous run , in which the spurious " Count , " Miss McRory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chase by misguided enthusiasm for the Major 's hunter , were the only participants , is one that will be appreciated by any one who has ridden to hounds anywhere : the introduction of the jackasses is a stroke of humor that amounts to genius . The illustrations , for which Miss Somerville is responsible , are , as usual , excellent . H. R. By Edwin Lefevre . New York : Harper &; Bros . In his inscription the author , after a fashion now in favor , takes the bread out of the mouths of " the critics " by foreseeing that they will presently " point out how completely he has failed to write a Satirical Romance of To-day . " Just why the critics are likely to make such a slip is suggested by a passage in the context : " To irritate a reader by compelling him to think in order to understand was , you told me , both unfair and unwise . " And if a reader , how much more a critic ! However , a reviewer must say something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth is , we have no one in America just now who can do the kind of thing Mr. Lefevre attempts . Several Englishmen can do it , and have done it , notably Mr. Bennett in " Hugo " and " Denry the Audacious , " and Mr. Wells in " Mr. Polly " and elsewhere . The daring male who breaks loose from convention and timidity and sweeps all before him is a favorite pivot for satirical fantasy . But he must break loose , not be propelled from behind . H. R. is a bank clerk who suddenly receives word from Mr. Lefevre that he is to demonstrate a rebel and a genius . Therefore he beards and browbeats the president of the bank , insults his daughter , and sallies forth to conquer New York . This , by the free play of an effrontery and egotism which , we gather , are upon a scale hitherto unknown in the metropolis , he proceeds to do . The means are such as come to his hand  --  anything might have served as a fulcrum for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sandwich-man on the street , and gets his idea . Around the sandwich-man he builds a new system of advertising , makes a fortune , wins the banker 's daughter , and is understood to be on his way to the White House , or thereabouts . The success of such a book depends upon its spontaneity and easy force . Mr. Lefevre has labored the business . His primary error , for this kind of thing , is an error of which Mr. Bennett or Mr. Wells is incapable  --  his sprinkling the pages with detached epigrams and clevernesses which irritate the reader without compelling him to think . And they irritate him especially because in the main they are not flashes of true satirical wit , but cheap cynicisms . The Green Half Moon . By James Francis Dwyer . Chicago : A. C. McClurg &; Co . Judged by the standard Balzac set himself when he wrote the " Comedie Humaine , " " The Green Half Moon " has little chance of immortality . " Listening to these people , " he said of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , I felt their rags on my back , I walked with my feet in their tattered shoes , their desires , their wants , everything , passed into my soul and my soul passed into theirs ; it was the dream of a waking man . " " The Green Moon , " on the contrary , is a pleasant bit of fiction made out of cardboard , and the people in it sprung into life , not in a garret , where are born " the dreams of a waking man , " but in a snug library , where the puppet , pulled with a string , is but too apt to step within the covers of a novel . A particularly good American man , young and handsome , meets a perfectly beautiful American girl as both are steaming out of Bombay on a fast steamer bound for Arden . They love at first sight ; but love is not all beer and skittles for the stricken . Miss Alice Harrington , of Troy , New York , is the companion of Lady Hope Stanger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into war with Germany , has confided a most impOrtant task which has to do with a mysterious jewel . Mr. Dwyer excites suspicions that he can do better than he has taken the pains to do by the way he hides this jewel . For some really excit ing pages we do not know , as the hero does not know , what is contained in a package that Alice , with small feminine insight , has confided to him . Good , pure men are proverbially maladroit , and John Sheridan Warren among simpletons is the chief . He gets the jewel , loses it , gets it again , and loses it , till the reader , out of patience , hopes with all his heart that wicked Zunel , the incendiary Mohammedan , may find it and tuck it away under his green turban . None of the adventures recorded in this book ever took place , but Mr. Dwyer has a certain gift in storytelling . He has the art of putting in details which puzzle the judgment and almost persuade . The Twisted Skein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Scribner 's Sons . Some day somebody will write a story about college life in which the hero is not working his way through Yale by tending furnaces and waiting on table , is not one of the brightest students in the junior class , is not looked upon as a " grind " and accordingly snubbed by his classmates who own automobiles , Is not the idol of the elderly maiden ladies with whom he boards , does not get into all sorts of misunderstandings and more trouble because he is constitutionally unable to " tell " on some athlete whom the campus adores ( despite a pronounced yellow streak ) , and does not finally square himself with the whole college , not forgetting the crew coach and his charming young daughter , by " making " the ' varsity crew overnight and pulling it  --  single-handed , of course  --  to victory over Harvard in the last pulse-quickening chapter . But that day seems a long way off . Consequently , one finds Karl Truman , the hero of Ralph D. Paine 's latest book of undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have guided generations of college heroes to glory on the printed page . Karl is altogether too good and too hardworking to be more than a nonentity at Yale until he comes to New York as captain of the chess team and defeats Princeton , Harvard , and Columbia . An elderly stranger who has wasted his life making money and accumulating a successful business man 's grouch sees the chess champion perform , becomes interested , and determines to " invest " in him . And so , when the captain of the chess team returns to New Haven , it is with a handsome allowance which enables him to blossom out in modish clothes , live in a high-priced dormitory , mingle as an equal with the other students , try for the crew , and enjoy all the things from which his former poverty barred him . But , of course , there are serious complications . He is not suspected of locking a cow in the chapel , but another equally villanous freshman prank is charged up against him ; he is arrested , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save " Yale spirit , " the hero brings that useful commodity into play , and , by the time Harvard 's colors are lowered on the Thames , there is very little for the other characters to do but offer apologies and make an enormous fuss over the great No. 7 who won the race for Yale when the stroke-oar failed . His German , Wife . By Douglas Sladen . New York : Brentano 's . The imperturbable tolerance which this English writer affects makes curious reading in time of war . We have no quarrel , he seems to insist , with Germans as Germans , certainly not with any really nice , well-bred Germans , who are after all pretty much like ourselves , only better educated and more conscientious and energetic and habitually efficient in every way . As for the English themselves , page after page of well-considered criticism falls from the lips of the fair , impecunious Baroness Ernestine Frederika Kunigunde Lysnar von Adlerstein , who is modestly sampling insular life as Mrs. Isherwood 's lady companion . Again and again to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Renny Isherwood , his unemployed physical magnificence , his superfluous magnanimity , and his general futility , are pointedly brought home by the candid young Baroness . She decides to marry Renny , however , takes him home for a German honeymoon , and , after participating in the English exodus following the declaration of war , manages to have a taste of army-post life in both countries . None of the episodes are of great interest in themselves , the story 's real intention being the comparison of German and English types and standards . This is competently and perhaps too chivalrously done  --  one touch of real malice would have improved the tale immeasurably . The Obsession , of Victoria Gracen . By Grace Livingston Lutz . Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott . " The Obsession of Victoria Gracen " has popular qualities and those guaranteed to please its audience . The first few pages are well written , with a faithfulness to reality that is not stereotyped . A funeral party , excited with the morning 's happenings and pumped up to a high level of vulgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits down at a full meal to discuss the future of the orphaned boy who is to live under the roof . Richard is hard , resentful , unattractive , and he bitterly resents the criticisms , frankly uttered in his presence , upon his dead father and mother . That night , out of the blue , comes a message , inviting him to live with a maiden aunt , his father 's sister , a woman of wealth and breeding , alienated from Richard 's father by the latter 's marriage . After this , the literary merits of the book are nil , for the author , like other people , does not thrive in prosperity . But although from a certain standpoint this book is poor reading , it is spectacular , sentimental , and pietistic , and therefore sure to please the thousands to whom the Elsie Books fell as manna from heaven . Cleverness in the management of petty incidents is an asset of which the author makes good use . COURAGE AND CANT . Greek Genius and Other Essays . By John Jay Chapman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net . Mr. Chapman is nothing if not courageous . He is so courageous that he is willing , out of confidence in an active and original mind , to write without thinking ; with the result that he sometimes says very good things , and sometimes says things which are not good at all . The latest example of his courage is this book of essays , wherein he passes from criticism of Euripides to lack of criticism on Shakespeare and Balzac with the amazing versatility of a plunging horse that has broken from the traces . We are writing in a feeble effort to imitate Mr. Chapman 's own breezy manner , and our words may sound a trifle presumptuous , but , as a matter of fact , there is one section of the book so sound in judgment and so timely in point that we are almost ready to ' forgive the author his glowing indiscretions in other chapters . We refer to Mr. Chapman 's diatribe on Sir Gilbert Murray , and we think the rebuke therein administered , though it might perhaps be better if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is deserved . Every one in these days has been reading Murray 's translations of Euripides and hearing them on the stage ; every one admits the brilliancy of these prodUctions , and every competent judge knows that he stands very high as a scholar . But Murray has admittedly used a free hand with his author , and the layman frequently asks just how free he has been and how far this freedom is justified . Now , Mr. Chapman shows by sufficient illustration that Murray not only expands his author In a way and to a degree that are at least surprising , but transfuses into his version a tone of neo-British religiosity and estheticism that , unfortunately , are not surprising to those familiar with Certain tendencies of modern Oxford scholarship . And w , e think that Mr. Chapman is entirely justified in meting out this severe language to - what is really a systematic perversion of the Greek genius : The structural nature of a Greek drama is known to every one , and is perfectly well known to Mr. Gilbert Murray ; but the fumes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and these fumes pervade the introductions and the notes to the poems . The merit of the verse itself is due to this very envelope of steaming inspiration and poetic sentiment But the waking Murray ought really to join in warning the public against the hymning , dreamy , irresponsible Murray , the poet Murray , who is spreading grotesque ideas about Euripides beneath every shaded lamp in the Anglo-Saxon world . We know that certain scholarly and honest persons excuse these aberrations on the part of the brilliant Oxford professor on the ground that he is making Greek a live subject to thousands whcbn it would otherwise never reach at all . The plea is specious , but we are afraid of it ; we distrust dishonesty even from Greek professors dona ferentes . Another man might be indulged in his ambition to rewrite into modern moods a classical poet , but when the highest authority of the greatest of English universities spreads false notions about his subject , the question of veracity takes another color . He stands as the apostle of Greek ; and if Greek has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supreme Greek poets presented life in a manner the very opposite of the religiosity and sentimentalism which Sir Gilbert Murray is pouring out of Oxford . Mr. Chapman can scarcely be reckoned a scholar ; he is a David beside the Goliath he attacks ; but he has hurled his pebbles well . He might even have gone further , and found in Murray 's importation of very recent humanitarian ideas into the origins of Greek epic something of the same betrayal of a great trust . Sir Gilbert has published a manly recantation of the pacifist opinions he held in politics before the present war . We wonder whether it has occurred to him that the sentimentalism of his scholarship is of the same character , and indeed not free from the same perils . Mr. Chapman , we have said , is courageous ; would that he was always wise . " We should read Shakespeare for pleasure , and only for pleasure , " he says . " The plays were meant to be gay trifles , the perfume and the suppliance of a minute . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false in regard to Euripides as is this grotesquely exaggerated half-truth about Shakespeare ? Mr. Chapman stumbles on an occasional bit of shrewd criticism in the later essays in his volume , but on the whole his tone and manner are lamentable . His contempt for all other critics but himself is not pretty . He writes in a spirit of hysterical exasperation against the " pundits " who have seriously studied an author , and against " the - whole cant of criticism . " His system is revealed in the command that " we should use no method in dealing with Balzac , but should approach him through accident and chaotically . " Will Mr. Chapman understand us when we intimate that his attitude in these essays is about as sad a piece of cant as has come to us in many a long day ? It is a pity .
