THE greatest evil in our age is war . The most menacing feature of this evil is readiness for war , which makes of peace a perennial farce , and the most widespread factor which makes for war is that form of patriotism which spends itself in distrust and hatred of other nations . It rests on the medieval politics which found in war outside , the easiest road to national unity and the surest method of suppression of internal reforms . Through no fault of their own it has been the fate of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine , for the last forty years , to be the centre on which this type of patriotism has impinged . This has made these provinces the crux of the war problems of Europe . Around the mourning figure of Strassburg , symbolic of the distressed province of Alsace , the war-hatreds of France have rallied for forty years . The France which seemed to be menaced with dissolution in 1871 was again , in a fashion , unified by the fear and hatred which the fate of Alsace-Lorraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become again , since Agadir , the occasion if not the justification of that contradiction in world-politics , a republic in arms . ' On the other hand , the fate of Alsace-Lorraine has served Bismarck 's purpose of unifying Germany through her hatred of surrounding nations . 688The result of the seizure of these provinces , and of the distrust this policy has inspired , has held Germany together and made possible a scale of military expenditure which has appalled the world . It has hung as a dead weight on all German progress , internal and external . It has turned over the nation to the control of a blind militarism which rides gloriously toward a fall . The treaty of Frankfort was not a treaty of peace . It was devised to keep hatred alive . Its purpose was not to welcome back the Germanic people of Alsace , but to keep Germany unified against France . And thus the question of Alsace-Lorraine has divided Europe into two hopeless alliances , which can accomplish no worthy result , and for whose senseless antagonism there seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin , amid all her griefs , it is the glorious role of Alsace-Lorraine to safeguard the moral unity of two great nations , concentrated on the same thought . ' Yet all this is through no fault of Alsace and Lorraine ; they have given no occasion for war . Their part has been passive . Of that form of patriotism which spends itself in war talk and war accessories , these provinces are today in no sense the cause , they are only the excuse or the occasion . France can do nothing for them , and Germany in her present temper will do nothing . Germany says to her province of Elsass-Lothringen , ' I will not give you freedom till I am sure of your love . ' ALSACE ? LORRAINE : A Alsace replies , ' I can not love you till you set me free : Lorraine replies , ' I am not of your family , I can not understand your ways . ' Then Germany says to France , ' We can not be friends until you forget . ' And France says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not . ' This is the vicious circle , which most good men in Alsace-Lorraine hope some time to break . The people of these provinces , torn suddenly from France as a result of incidents in which they had no part , held by Germany avowedly not for their own sakes but as appendages of their two strong fortresses , have naturally passed through the gamut of feelings instinctive to peoples conquered in war . And these feelings were the more bitter because it was not the people who were conquered . Through the open door of Strassburg and Metz , Germany had been more than a dozen times invaded and many times overrun by the marauding hosts of France . It was Bismarck 's plan to close these doors , to hold the key of France and Germany in his hand , so that these irruptions should forever cease . At the treaty of Frankfort in 1871 , France threw the provinces overboard to save herself from a worse fate . And ever since that time they have been a ' wound in the side ' of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emotional patriotism of France has looked forward to revenge . For forty years mourning wreaths have been placed on the symbolic statue of Strassburg in the Place de la Concorde . For forty years the Paris press has stirred up the shallow springs of national egotism or patriotism . For forty years the Boulevards have looked forward to the ' Guerre de Revanche , ' the ' Guerre d ' Honneur , ' which should bring back to France her // abducted daughters of the Vosges . It is a better and more earnest type of man who looks forward to the War of Honor , but the two words , honor and revenge , mean the same thing . War , and the name of every war , is a lie . And beyond the Rhine , all this serves the plans of the Pangermanists , who talk and dream of their ' War of Expansion , ' which should give Germany her needed space ' under the sun , ' and fill northern and central Europe with more problems of Alsace-Lorraine , all to be settled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact no one can believe that any considerable number of rational people on either side of the Rhine desire war , or would look upon war as other than a dire calamity . Preparation for war is forced upon the common men by their acquiescence , sometimes by machinery they do not control , but never by their will . Nor can we doubt the assurance of the rulers , on both sides , that they do not want war , and that they will , on either side , in no case take the initiative in attack . The fact is , that modern Europe has no room for war , no stomach for it , no money to pay its cost . Neither France nor Germany is to-day , nor ever can be , ' prepared for war . ' To be prepared for war is to have it ; and gross accident or hideous crime aside , the War of Revenge and the War of Expansion are alike impossible . But neither chauvinist nor Pangermanist cares for this . They are peculiarly impatient as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on both sides largely venal , it is their business to make war and war-trade . It is not war for Alsace or for Lorraine , but war with Alsace-Lorraine as the excuse . The chauvinists of France rest their case mainly on matters of feeling . As a matter of fact , they are relatively harmless , for their influence on politics 690 ALSACE-LORRAINE : A STUDY IN CONQUEST is small and waning , though they have received a lease of noisy life since the incident at Agadir in 1911 . Their colleagues in Germany , more menacing to world peace , for the moment , because they form a privileged class nearer the scats of power , back their pretensions by a sort of pseudo-science , a shallow imitation of philosophy . It is said that in the centre of a cyclonic storm all is perfectly quiet . If Alsace-Lorraine is such a storm-centre , the same fact holds true . There is scarcely any part of Europe where the war spirit is lower or the war-maker less in evidence . The sole problem of these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief difference of opinion hinges on whether these will be secured sooner by insistence or by patience . If Alsace-Lorraine is the nightmare of Europe , ' the fault lies with Europe . The provinces want no war , for they have seen war and know what it is . The last war of civilized Europe was fought on their lands , and worse than battle itself is life on a battlefield . In the old days Alsace was a battlefield of religion . The ancient Chronicles of Thann tell how the land was ravaged in the Thirty Years ' War . Towns destroyed have never been rebuilt . In one commune , the record tells us , there was not for twelve years a wedding , nor for fifteen years a baptism . ' So often as the Swedes gave battle to the imperialists , so often did the imperialists make war upon the Swedes . It was an endless massacre ! ' Alsace still remembers vividly the awful bombardment of Strassburg and the bloody fields of Weissenburg and Worth . Lorraine has before her waking eyes the campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Ann ? , e Terrible ' of 1871 . Not far away is the ravine of Gravelotte , with the war- swept heights of St. Privat , St. Hubert , and Sainte-Marie aux Chenes . All about the scenes of the futile sorties of Bazaine ? Noisseville , Colombey , and the highway that leads through Rezonville and Vionville to the French border at Mars-la-Tour ? the land has been for forty years made up of graveyards rather than farms . And then , not far away , in France , but still within the boundaries of old Lorraine , were the horrors of Bazeilles , its massacre of citizens as well as soldiers , ' the obscene sea of slaughter ' of Sedan . The battles of Napoleon III were fought on the soil of Alsace-Lorraine , but the provinces had no part in these wars . They were offered up in final sacrifice . II In his clever account of the German enigma , M. Georges Bourdon uses these words : ' One must not speak of Alsace-Lorraine ; it is better to listen while she speaks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen while Alsace-Lorraine speaks for herself . In traveling over the two provinces he has had speech with many good men and women , representing every point of view which the question permits . These have freely and frankly expressed their hopes and fears . Their opinions are summed up here , often in their own language , as nearly as may be in condensed translation . ' Chauvinists and Pangermanists alike are rare , and very rare , among the natives of Alsace and Lorraine ; their contests belong to the outside world , and we may for the present pass them I mention no individual names , except from articles in print , because I would have no one held personally responsible , but to all I acknowledge my indebtedness ; I am under special obligations to my colleague and companion , Professor Albert Leon Guerard , for his sympathetic interest and invaluable help . ? THE AUTHOR . // in and disregard their exterior assertions . There is no doubt a war-feeling which has its roots in these provinces , though its manifestations are outside . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who chose to remain French , ' were allowed to leave the provinces . The number of those who thus left in the years 1871-73 , is officially stated to have been 270,000 , about one fifth of the total population . These are the ' 61nigr ? s , ' while the Germans who have since come in from ' Old Germany ' are spoken of as ' immigres , " Vieux Allemands , ' or ' Alt Deutsche . ' The spirit of these men and women who chose to leave their native land fur a principle represents the noblest impulses of the human heart . They abandoned their homes , not through hatred of Prussia , not because they ' would not become Germans , ' not even because they wished to remain citizens of France . Their primary motive was this : they would not place themselves or t heir sons in a position where , as conscripts in a foreign army , they would fight their kinsmen and friends . This was no passing emotion . It was grounded deep in religion and conscience . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of forty years ago were not actors merely in the great tragedy of Europe , a play on which the curtain is yet to be rung down . They were themselves the very soul of the tragedy . The ? migr ? s have naturally had a large influence on their kinsfolk at home . The population of neighboring cities of France and Switzerland , notably Nancy , Belfort , and Basle , has been greatly increased and strengthened by this movement of Alsatians who would not be German . In each of these cities the number of ' ? migr ? s ' runs into the thousands . The University of Nancy has grown up through the influence of these people , having been built to take the place of the University of Strassburg as the Eastern stronghold of French culture . It is said that in the German army there are but three Alsatian officers , while in the French Army thirty generals are of Alsace or Lorraine stock . The emigres hold to the spirit of the solemn protest of Bordeaux , spoken by M. Grosjean before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last act of the twenty-eight deputies of Alsace and Lorraine before leaving their place in the empire . The protest is in part as follows : ' Delivered , in scorn of all justice and by an odious abuse of force , to foreign domination , we have one last duty to perform . We declare once for all null and void an agreement which disposes of us without our consent . The vindication of our rights rests for ever open to all and to each one in the form and in the degree our conscience shall dictate . In the moment we quit this hall , the supreme thought we find in the bottom of our hearts is a thought of unutterable attachment to the land from which in violence we are torn . Our brothers of Alsace and of Lorraine , separated at this moment from the common family , will preserve to France , absent from their hearthstones , an affection faithful to the day when she shall return to take again her place . ' Then on March 24 , turning toward Germany , Frederic Hartmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which unlocks the whole question of Alsace-Lorraine : ? ' By the fact that you have conquered us , you owe us a status in law , a civil and political constitution in harmony with our traditions and with our customs . ' To all inquiries concerning AlsaceLorraine , the German answer begins invariably with the words , ' There is 692 ALSACE-LORRAINE : A STUDY IN CONQUEST no question of Alsace-Lorraine . ' Amplifying this answer , we have : There is no question of Alsace-Lorraine ; the land is German by tradition , by language , and by conquest . Its affairs concern Germany alone ; the whole alleged question is the work of the boulevard journalists of Paris . Taking up the German position first from the side of law , it is claimed that Alsace and Lorraine are territories won by conquest confirmed by the treaty of Frankfort . As such , all rights have lapsed and there remain only those that the Empire in its wisdom and friendliness may grant . France has no further concern in the matter . The relations in International Law were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As France tried for years to suppress the German language and German culture in Alsace , it becomes Germany 's national duty in turn to wean these people from the French . The FrancoPrussian war was begun by Napoleon , with the avowed purpose of seizing the Rhine provinces for France . To guard against the repetition of such an offense , ' the Pangermanists contend , we have taken the Rhine valley for Germany . The connection of Elsass-Lothringen with the Empire is the very last word of irrevocability . We might as well be asked to surrender Prussia as to give up the territory bought and paid for at Gravelotte , Mars-la-Tour , St. Privat and Sedan . Restoration of Elsass-Lothringen is not debatable for us in any form whatsoever . No proffer of territory in exchange anywhere on the face of the globe could induce the German government even to consider such a transaction . Why did we retake it ? Because the safety of German territory demanded it . France openly coveted the left bank of the Rhine . What else was the real underlying cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that part of our fatherland west of the Rhine was to be permitted to develop in peace and safety as an integral part of the German nation . ' Again , in law , Elsass-Lothringen is not a state of the German Empire , not one of the twenty-eight members of the imperial confederation . It is Reichsland , ' ? imperial property , to be administered in the general interest of the imperial states . ' Its present status is almost exactly parallel with that of the territories within the United States , or perhaps still more exactly , with that of the Federal District of Columbia . ' The territory is allowed certain privileges , not rights , of selfgovernment , but not to the prejudice or advantage of the actual states . As in the United States of the past and present , the people of the territories are held in tutelage until they are ready for self-government , so ElsassLothringen is held in training until its people are ready for autonomy within the German Empire . To this end , they must be educated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German traditions and with German culture . Naturally , the business of ElsassLothringen must be conducted in the German language . The people must be familiar with German methods of government and modes of thinking . They must think as Germans , for the Empire is not an assemblage of states and cities and people . It is a confederation of Germans , by the Germans , and for the Germans . All this involves no real hardship , for the same requirements exist throughout the Empire , and all residents or the Empire , Danes and Poles , Saxons , Swabians , Bavarians , and Prussians alike , must conform to it . All Germany is under the ferule ' of training in Deutschthum . ' Meanwhile , German rule in Alsace-Lorraine is consideration // itself compared with the methods usually found necessary in dealing with a conquered people . To revert to the process of Entwelschung , ? its advocates maintain that it is salutary and necessary . The continuity and efficiency of the Empire depend upon it . It has been honestly and consistently pursued in ElsassLothringen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or revision ! In so far as it has failed , the fault lies with hesitation or leniency in administration , not with the plan itself . The Affaire de Noisseville , ' in 1908,1 may serve as an example of such failure . The Statthalter ( governor ) permitted the building of a monument to the French soldiers on this German battlefield . Its dedication was witnessed by 100,000 people who waved the tri-color and sang the Marseillaise in defiance of national proprieties . It produced a revival of French sympathy which swept Lorraine off her feet , and threatened to undo in an hour the loyalty resulting from years of patient German tutelage . The German outlook for the future does not grow promising . This the officials unwillingly admit . Lorraine abuts on France as Alsace does on Switzerland . But the greatest obstinacy appears in the districts thoroughly German by blood and speech . It centres especially in Ober-Elsass and its two chief cities of Colmar and Miihlhausen . But whatever the discouragements , it is certain in the minds of the German authorities that Elsass-Lothringen can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free state of the Empire . Still less can it be given back to France . Alsace is German at heart and belongs in the Empire . To abandon Lorraine would be to disgrace the fifty thousand ' The notorious Zabern affair took place subsequent to Dr. Jordan 's investigation . ? THE EDITORS . graves of brave Germans who gave their lives to win back the lost provinces and to gain the German Rhine . The international politics of Germany hinge on romantic sentiment . Moreover , though forty years is a long period in the lifetime of a man , it is but a moment in the history of a race . Alsace lies where races meet . She has been part of Germany , of Austria , of France , of Germany again . She has resisted all changes with characteristic obstinacy . She has been reconciled , more or less , with each in turn , and she will be reconciled again . The reestablishment of the monarchy was strenuously opposed by Alsace , and she voted persistently and almost alone against the overwhelming majority which established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks for autonomy , for home rule within the Empire . No man of sagacity expects or hopes to see the region returned to France . It is argued by Germanists , on the other hand , that home rule is demanded not for the good of the people , but because home rule is the custom of the other states . But under German law Elsass-Lothringen is not a state , but imperial territory , Reichsland . ' This distinction her politicians resent . I may here , again in passing , refer to the differences now existing between the Reichsland and a state . The Reichsland has no executive head of its own . It is governed from Berlin ? by a Statthalter , appointed by the Emperor ; the powers of the Statthalter and his Ministerium at Strassburg being derived from the Emperor . The constitution of the Reichsland was granted from Berlin ( in 1911 ) , ? not framed by the people or their representatives , or voted by them , or subject to amendment by them . 694 ALSACE-LORRAINE : A The Government of Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary . ' The limitations on the executive are set by the constitution itself and not , as in Great Britain , by the changing will of the people , as expressed through their deputies . In theory , the Bundesrath and the Reichstag in Berlin could change this constitution at will , or withdraw it altogether . Much of the local friction in ElsassLothringen centres about edicts or laws of special protection ( Abwehrgesetze ) , known locally as ' laws of exception ' ( lois d'exception ) . These measures , it is claimed , are made necessary in Alsace-Lorraine , as similar or more rigid laws have been in the new Prussian provinces of Schleswig-Holstein and Posen , by facts in the history or geography or temperament of the provinces concerned . These districts all border on unfriendly powers , and from these emanate influences which Germany finds it necessary to combat . There are very many of these ' laws of exception . ' I may name a few which were called to my attention : The Germanization of the University of Strassburg . The dissolution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dissolution of Souvenir Societies for the decoration of French graves . The limitation ( to about one in two weeks ) of the rendering of French plays . The limitation of French instruction ( which is given in German , to students who use French in daily speech and in their games ) . The occasional banishment or imprisonment of ardent ' nationalists , ' or even of visitors from France or Switzerland . The revival for a time of the passport system . The requirement of German signs STUDY IN CONQUEST and notices , and the other matters locally called ' coups d'epingle , ' and variously ignored or resented according to the temper of individuals . Street signs can be written in French only by special permission . IV Those who believe in the future of German Entwelschung recognize more or less clearly mistakes in the past . Some of those indicated to me by different persons are the following : Too great leniency : willingness to compromise in Lorraine with French sympathy , in Alsace with Swiss republicanism . Too great severity : the attempt to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Holding Alsace-Lorraine responsible for outbreaks of chauvinism in Paris ; matters in which these provinces had no part . ' It is a mistake in these days to hold conquered territory . ' To carry the theory of Reichsland to its logical conclusion the inhabitants should have been removed . Turkey has put the theory into practice in Armenia , but Germany is not fitted for the task , especially when dealing with people exactly like her own . To the policy of taking French territory at all it is said that Bismarck was strongly opposed , but yielded to Moltke 's insistence on the necessity of retaining Strassburg and Metz , to which , in the military sense , Alsace and Lorraine are but outlying appendages . It was a mistake not to make AlsaceLorraine frankly part of Prussia . This was done with other conquered territory , ? Schleswig-Holstein , Posen , and even the historic German state of Hanover . It was a mistake not to make the Emperor himself Landesherr of Alsace- // Lorraine . This would perhaps have touched the springs of patriotic feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two districts have scarcely anything in common save their experiences in rupture from France . By uniting them we transfer to each the complaints of the other . Lorraine , largely French , chiefly rural , and altogether Catholic , is more docile than Alsace . The latter is peculiarly headstrong in her republicanism . The Abbe Thilmont of Lorraine ascribes to his people the calmness and coolness of the German with the delicacy and exquisite sensibility of the French . They are profoundly attached to religion as the last surviving interest , but they hate extremes , clericalism as well as sectarianism . We in Lorraine think sometimes with our heads and sometimes with our hearts . With our heads we accept a situation we can not change . But who can read the heart ? ' As for Alsace , the dominant note is that of republicanism . As we shall see later , the clue to its character is found not in its love of France , but in its love of liberty , a survival of the old Germanic freedom , which is still alive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the Germanic militarism of to-day . These undercurrents are not likely to appear to the casual traveler who may visit Strassburg or Metz . Since 1871 there has been a large immigration to these cities from the rest of Germany , the ' Vieux Allemands ' or immigr &; of common speech . To-day , Metz is about three fifths German and two fifths Lorraine ; while in Strassburg about two fifths are German immigres and three fifths Alsatians . The Germans have added greatly to the wealth and importance of these two cities . In Metz , especially , large additions have been built up from German capital . ' Strassburg , the quaint and busy city on the Ill , with its highpitched roofs and the huge lacy spire of its red minster , with its cheerful and apparently well-satisfied people , seems to have little in common with the tragically draped statue in Paris . ' The city is prosperous , its general administration effective , and business always dreads a change . The future of Strassburg is unquestionably German . Every visible trace of French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be imposed by force . ' The question of Alsace-Lorraine underlies all this seeming peacefulness and the most stiff-necked Prussian official comes at last to realize its existence . ' A closer study shows that , even in Strassburg , the Alsatian does not change his point of view . He is a ' citizen of no mean city , ' and that city must bide its time to come to its own and manage its own affairs . The most sympathetic of the immigres slowly come to the same point of view . In so far as they do not , they constitute a class apart , without social recognition from the Alsatians . Outside of Strassburg and Metz ? even in cities like Colmar and Mtihlhausen ? the immigrC 's constitute but a small fraction of the population . So far as expansion ' is concerned , crowded Germany gains nothing by annexation , for the land of Alsace still belongs to the Alsatians . The Germans can not get a foot of ground unless they buy it . This they could do before 1870 , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Germanization of Strassburg and Metz is scarcely more marked than the Germanization of manufacturing cities outside of Germany ? let us say , of Milwaukee , or of Sao Paulo , in Brazil . German immigrants are crowding into Basle and Ziirich , perfectly willing 696 ALSACE ? LORRAINE : A STUDY IN CONQUEST to become Swiss . German merchants and manufacturers have expanded ' ' throughout the world , and this without aid or help of the Mailed Fist or the Spiked Helmet . With the growth of German industries there has come to Metz and to Strassburg , as well as to other German factory towns , a large accession of cheap labor ' from Poland and from Italy . But all this , while tending to make still more impossible the return of the provinces to France , contributes nothing whatever to the problem of conciliation . Another mistake , it is alleged , lay in the earlier attempts to conciliate the old aristocracy of Alsace-Lorraine . Some of these accepted imperial favor , but the class as a whole was not affected by them . Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regard French culture as superior to German , and regret that such culture is in a degree denied to their children . The blending of races and race-interests comes more readily from the bottom of the social scale . It was our experience in Muhlhausen to walk into the Bourse and find three hundred men , ? well-to-do Germans to all appearance , ? transacting their vociferous business all in French . The use of French in common life is advancing downwards in spite of , and largely because of , official pressure in the other direction . It was a mistake that the constitution of 1911 was not granted twenty years earlier . This might have given an earlier interest in imperial as against local politics . It is said that the government encouraged the development of a socialist party in Alsace , to give 1 There are almost a third as many Germans in the United States as in Germany .

The constitution is an admission that while the territory is ' Reichs. land , ' its people are not peons or feudal servitors who go with the land , but are in some degree , at least , Germans , ? second-class Germans ' in the bitter words one may hear in Alsace .

' While the Ministerium itself has contained many men of a high order of scholarship and intelligence , the lower positions have been largely given // to non-commissioned officers used to the harsh discipline of the Prussian barracks .

' It is claimed by many that the greatest mistake in German management has been its subordination to the military group in Berlin . To keep hatred alive is to strengthen the cause of ' armor-plate patriotism . ' The fundamental error , the Alsatians claim , is the failure to grasp the spirit and purpose of Alsace . In the words of one Alt Deutscher in Strassburg , ' I do not know these people called Nationalists in Strassburg and Colmar and Miffilhausen . I have never met any of them ; I do n't want to meet any of them ; I do n't know their names ; I never read their papers ; I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is as easy to make the feelings of Alsace understood at Berlin as to inject the essence of violet through the skin of a hippopotamus . ' Because Alsace was chiefly German , it was thought that she would welcome restoration to the Empire , even though in the humble relation of tenant of Imperial territory . The relief of our ' brothers in chains ' in France was part of the alleged motive for the invasion of Alsace . But the long-lost brothers had grown up in another family , and they resented being made pawns in a greater game ; Alsace has no love for any empire . She had held out against Louis XIV as against Napoleon . She had compelled Mazarin 's assurance that the sole purpose of the French arms in Alsace was to assure the independence of the free cities , with no thought whatever of taking advantage .

Landau entered this league in 1511 , and the largest of the free cities , Miihlhausen , left it in 1523 , to join the more pow- , erful confederation of the cantons of Switzerland . In their internal affairs these cities were free from all outside control , and even after the date of 1681 , when the seizure of Strassburg by Louis XIV , in time of peace , finally carried Alsace into the kingdom of France , it was a maxim in politics not to touch the affairs of Alsace . We may note further that Alsace was seized by Louis XIV at a time when the apparent glory of France was at its highest . It was an era , not only of military splendor and reckless expenditure , but also of literary and political distinction . Even the court of Berlin spoke French in preference to German , and the German mind was profoundly influenced by French methods of expression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continental Europe , as it is still in Paris . French culture in Alsace was 698 ALSACE-LORRAINE : A STUDY IN CONQUEST not a veneer , it was an actual accomplishment . But the theory of Germany for the last forty years is that France is decadent and corrupt , to be avoided by the honest student . Modern culture and modern science are products of German genius . But Alsace accepts only part of this assertion . She looks upon the romantic veneration of the German for ancient forms as a mild atavism , a return toward barbarism . The final evidence of the failure of the Prussian regime is its futility . It gets nowhere , not a step has been permanently taken , and if the bitterness of feeling has abated , that is the work of time , not of Entwelschung .

Strassburg on the Rhine frontier stood for that half-assimilated Teutonic element , an essential part of modern French culture . " For Strassburg enjoyed for centuries a unique privilege that the best friends of France and Germany would be glad to see restored . ' VI We may now look at the situation from the other sides ? the side of France and the side of Alsace . There is a question of Alsace-Lorraine . It can be settled only by granting to its people equal rights within the Empire . The responsibility for failure rests with the Pangermanist warfaction which dominates Prussia , and which through Prussia rules Germain . The present attitude of Alsace is concisely summed up in these three lines of current doggerel : Some day , of course , there will be no other result possible : Elsass-Lothringen will be a self-governed state within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bind her to France . Her people will become increasingly bilingual and cosmopolitan in their sympathies . She will furnish her part of the cement which will bind Continental Europe into one gystern of good-will . This is the dream of the future , the // hope of those who see a free Europe arising from her subservience to armored patriotism and conscript soldiers , ? a Europe in which mind shall rule , not coward force and fear . What shall we say of to-day ? The theory of the Reichsland or conquered territory of Germany may be good imperial law , but it is not good politics and it is not good policy . It is not good law , for it is brigand law ? the law of force and fear , not that of right and order . France might assign her sovereignty over Alsace ; she could never sign away the rights of the people . This is a question of to-day , and there is no reason why the people of Alsace , and through them the people of Germany and France , should suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole world is interested in Alsace-Lorraine because the whole world is injured by the rivalry in arms for which the uneasiness of the two provinces furnishes the cause in evidence . Of going back to France there is no question . To return to France through war is a process horrible and inconeei ? able . In peace , it is outside the domain of possibility . ' It would be a pitiable politician and a sorry strategist who would begin putting the national house in order for the great emergency by abandoning Die Wacht out Rhein . ' That the great emergency ' is itself a nightmare with no real existence . does not change the problem . It is not clear even that the provinces as a whole would wish to return . The whole business of Alsace must be with Germany . Home rule and autonomy within the German Empire might be more acceptable than to return as three minor departments in highly centralized France . All political relations with Prance are beyond discussion . In so far , German officialism is right . The question of Alsace-Lorraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no direct or immediate solution is possible , for this is the heart of it . When can Germany give her conquered provinces a freedom her own people have not yet achieved for themselves ? There are some who see the answer in the neutralization of Alsace-Lorraine , forming of the provinces a buffer state , an independent , unfortified republic connecting two similar states , Belgium and Luxembourg , with the republic of Switzerland . This would separate France from Germany by a belt of neutral nations , distinct from both , protected by both , sympathetic with both ; for now , as in the days of Voltaire and Frederick the Great , there is nothing mutually exclusive in French and German culture . It has been suggested that toward this end , the most ideal conceivable by any one , France might barter her Madagascar or the French Congo . But this project is to all appearances outside the realm of practical politics . Only a St. Louis can restore a conquest . ' To give up territory won by force would be to dishonor the graves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free Alsace would be to confess the fundamental wrong of the policy of blood and iron . ' There is little force to the suggestion of restoring Lorraine to France while holding Alsace as Reichsland . Alsace is dearer to the heart of France than Lorraine could ever be . ' While Lorraine partakes of the spirit of Alsace , the future of Alsace determines the fate of her associate . The suggestion that the French-speaking provinces be returned to France has no merit . This again would be a species of dismemberment . The solution of the question lies entirely outside of all matters of race or language . It turns wholly on the position of Alsace within the Empire . 700 ALSACE ? LORRAINE : A As to the details of home rule , public opinion divides widely . In some degree this becomes a question of religion . I have tried here to avoid all those phases of the problem which are entangled in German politics , and the ' centrist politics ' of Germany hinges on Catholic alliances and demands . Both Alsace and Lorraine are essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion does , according to the individual feeling and conscience . Some of the most noted of the leaders of ' Nationalism ' are honored as abbes by the Church . Other church leaders are equally devoted to the cause of Germanism . ' The attitude of clericalism has its rigorous opponents within the clergy , and with these words we may leave the questions of ' centrisme ' and clericalism untouched . But it is true as a whole , probably , that the Catholics would prefer a more conventional government to a pure republic . They look forward to a condition like that of the Grand Duchy of Baden , the state of the Empire lying parallel with Alsace on the other side of the Rhine and inhabited by much the same sort of Swabian people . But it is not easy to supply the provinces with a grand duke or a prince , by promotion or by importation . ' We can not make a new dynasty in the twentieth century . ' The princely families which swarm in middle Germany are relics of the feudal system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , it would never take it up . It can imagine an empire in which the Emperor holds authority only by dynastic right . Only as a matter of historic succession is it necessary that he should have kings and dukes and arch-dukes and bishops as his august colleagues and subordinates . The selection of some Catholic STUDY IN CONQUEST prince as Landesherr would be accept . able to Lorraine , but probably not to Alsace . Alsace is strong in the faith , but likewise prone to heresies ; at times she displays a mysticism more profound than orthodox . From Alsace comes the suggestion , as acceptable , of the names of two Protestant princes of the North , who have studied at the University of Strassburg , and who are therefore in touch with Alsatian aspirations . But to Alsace generally the word ' autonomy ' means the organization of a republic within the Empire . The leaders point to the free cities , ? Hamburg , Bremen , Ltibeck ? as models in this regard . But these cities were historically free , joining the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic within the Empire seems to conservative Germany a dangerous experiment . Moreover , if Alsace were a monarchy even , she would make herself a republican monarchy . The enthusiasm of Catholic Lorraine for France seems checked somewhat in the last ten years . This is due to the rise of the anti-clerical party in France , and to the seizure for public uses of property held by the Church . The situation of Alsace-Lorraine i , in the long run hopeful for the cause of freedom . Obstacles vanish as men arise to remove them . Alsace and Lorraine have the task to keep alive their local identity , their traditions of culture , their economic prosperity . The must lead in movements which tend toward the reconciliation of France and Germany . They must lend no encouragement to chauvinist or to Pangermanist . The peace society lately formed at Miihlhausen by Jacques Schlumberger and his associates , the Franco-German League , with its many adherents in both nations , ? these are all steps in this direction . Alsace-Lorraine should aid in the liberal movements of Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in behalf of German freedom . Some day German science will point the way forward from Bismarck and Von Molt ke to Schiller and Kant . ' When this time comes , this great nation , " the second fatherland " of every cultured man , shall stand for honor and justice , the prophecy of Heine shall come true . Not only Alsace-Lorraine , but the whole world in this ideal sense shall be German . ' ' War ' says a leading Alsatian , ' is the worst possible solution of our problems , because war is no solution . With war there is never a solution of any question . Alsace has been part of Germany , of Austria , of France , and now of Germany again . If France should gain Alsace by war , it would be only the beginning of another war , and so on without end . Our hope is in the change of feeling in Germany , and in the rising demand for local rights and local freedom among the German people in the place of concentrated pater-nalism , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained by continuous local agitation as a means of educating Germany . Most of us think a quiet patience better . Agitation only makes it harder to come to mutual understanding . ' We have grown up under a regime more democratic than Germany ? especially Prussia ? has ever known . We should do our best to be good citizens of Alsace , and this will have its weight in Germany , for the German people , outside the military clique , are men like ourselves . ' It is also said that ' Every solution implying war is to be rejected . No definite solution could result from a Franco-German war , by which Alsace would find herself cut into two parts , each to destroy the other . A war , whatever its result , provokes always the desire of revenge and leads to indefinite international disorder , in which the antagonism among different elements would be greatly intensified . Other questions of high importance are rising to the surface ( social , moral , educational questions ) demanding solution ; for all these questions , implying higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collaboration of all men of good-will , who should ignore all national frontiers . ' It is inadmissible that the question of Alsace-Lorraine should indefinitely hold back the general development of Europe . A FrancoGerman entente would necessitate for Alsace-Lorraine a government according to its own will . It would thus destroy the worst obstacle to the pacification of Europe , and open to civilization new lines of progress . This solution which , in assuring peace to the world , would guarantee the development of Alsace and Lorraine , would nevertheless offend two powerful influences : the self-conceit of two nations , and the interest of the war system . It is for the people of these provinces to say loudly and clearly that the demand be made the friendly bridge between two civilizations , not the glacis of a fort nor yet a field of battle . This is the meaning of the meetings at Miihlhausen , and of the vote of the Landtag : No War ; Franco-German reconciliation , and Autonomy for Alsace-Lorraine ! ' ' Our duties in Alsace are plainly three : ' To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every effort towards the liberalizing of public opinion among our compatriots in Germany . ' To cease irritating agitation for what we know we can not get . " Agitation heats the blood and makes for enmity , not friendship . ' To this third proposition there are many who do not agree , in Strassburg and Metz , as well as in Colmar and Miihlhausen . These claim that agitation also educates , and they have used the forces of eloquence of tongue and pen , of merry raillery and biting sarcasm , in the intent of the autonomous republic . The cartoons of Zislin , in the local journal Dur 's Elsass , have often been most suggestive . Artistic and forceful is the brush work of Walz . ' The point of view of the active nationalists may be summed up as follows : Whether our aim is possible or not , that is not our concern . It is our right , and so it becomes our duty as free men to speak . We look to the future , not to the compromises of to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ugly fellow of the Pangermanist league .
