txt MEXICO 'S NEUTRALITY Assurances of a Friendly Attitude Toward the Allies  --  The Measure of Carranza By EMETERIO DE LA GARZA , JR . To the Editor of The New York Times : The diplomatic relations , international commerce and business intercourse between the people of Mexico and the people of the United States have never been better . General good feeling prevails between both countries and all differences and controversies are satisfactorily and justly arranged , although these are highly difficult and troublesome times , the like of which we have never had before in the history of the world , and though one of the two great neighboring republics of the continent is belligerent and the other is neutral , a peculiar and entirely different position from any in which they have found themselves in the history of America . In view of these facts one must have a great deal of consideration and give a lot of credit to the statesmen of both nations , who , under the adverse circumstances , can maintain not only the best of relations and dealings , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trusted ? Can we count on his integrity and discretion ? Is the Government of Mexico neutral , strictly neutral ? Will that country ever join the Allies ? When we consider the momentous international problems that Mexico has to face today , her position in regard to the United States , to the world war , and her recently inaugurated policies with the Latin-American countries , we have to admit that the local and sectional issues , the personal equations , and the actions of the warring factions , which for a long time so insistently called for the attention of the public , have lost all their importance . We know that General Carranza is in control of the whole situation throughout the Republic of Mexico and that the bands of brigands scattered here and there arc rapidly being exterminated . Villa , Zapata , Diaz , Pelaez , and the other turbulent minor " generals " are no longer a political or national factor which would menace the safety of the Government or the existence of Mexico , but the job of the town and rural police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munitions , or followers , these self-appointed and self-styled Chiefs of Insurrections arc now on their last legs and will surely die if President Carranza merely leaves them alone . What matters now is the international situation and the attitude of Mexico toward the belligerent nations , chiefly the United States , today the power of powers . Since the beginning of the war Mexico decided to be neutral . Why ? Because General Carranza 's duty to his country and the aims of his Government are to establish peace , and the duty of tile United States to mankind and the aims of its Government are to win the war . Two very different propositions that naturally call for two very different attitudes . When tile war began In 1914 Mexico wax in a special , unique position among the nations of America and of the world . My country was passing through the most bloody and fierce civil strife of our national life , one that twisted her like a whirlwind , stormed round her like a tempest , and consumed her like a flame . When the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autocracy in 1917 Mexico in suffering , in sorrow , in poverty , was just beginning to live under a new political Constitution and a new Government , trying through Carranza 's enduring patience and heroic efforts to extricate and liberate herself from a long period of anarchy and chaos . She could not go into a foreign war , having a war at home : every man and every dollar was needed within the country in order to restore peace and to consolidate her organic whole and restore the health of her society . This is the cause , the reason , and the secret of President Carranza 's declaration of neutrality , a measure essential to Mexico a own life and preservation . The baste condition , the condition sine qua non of her existence . le peace . But has the Government of General Carranza been really neutral ? Absolutely and entirely so . The Government of Mexico has refrained from taking part with or assisting either of the belligerent nations , has lent no help , support or comfort to any of them President Carropze , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is the result of the condition of Mexico and of his own firm conviction that in this way he can best serve the interests of the country . His neutrality is not negative but positive , is not a symptom of weakness but a proof of strength , Is not indifferent but intensively active in performing a duty to Mexico and also a difficult political in ? ternational task . And we have to confess that he has done it remarkably well , as no party or parties have any just claim on him or have accused him of any overt act . The best proof of the neutrality of Mexico le that her Government has never entertained nor listened to the diplomatic intrigues of Germany , who constantly and vrelstently is plotting and trying to plunge the country Into a war with the United States , offering not only material help , financial assistance , but to restore to Mexico the lost provinces . The best proof of the neutrality of Mexico is one that the people of the United States will accept because It is entirely convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington toward the Government of Mexico , the cordial good-will which is daily confirmed by substantial deeds and eloquent acts , seeking only the welfare of our people ? an attitude , as President Wilson puts It , " of sincere friendship , not merely the sort of friendship which prompts one not to do his neighbor any harm , but the sort of friendship which earnestly desires to do his neighbor service , " and President ' Wilson would not have taken such an attitude , believe me , If General Carranza or his Government had invited any suspicion or have been guilty of any political error . As a matter of fart , all false rumors and fancy theories being set aside , Mexico maintains a benevolent neutrality for tile United States and her allies . We not only are sending to thin country our coffee , cocoa , rubber , gum , hides , all kinds of lumber , especially mahogany and ebony , all kinds of metals , especially copper , lead , silver , In larger quantities than before , but the whole output of hemp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is sold to the United States at a reduced price for tile benefit of the American farmers , and all our oil , deducting for home consumption , is delivered to the United States , France , and lEngland . And , after ell , these facts and practical things are what count , ler this Imeans that our hearts , the heart of the Mexican people , can not possibly remain neutral , and is In full sympathy with the cause , purposes , and ideals of the United States , who is fighting for a safer and better world . Speaking not long ago with one of the highest officials at Washington and din . cussing the Mexican situation , wondering at Carranza 's success , he who is one that has knowledge of the Attie lion sstill to " President Carranza is honest ; that is what makes him powerful . " One Summer 's night when walking through tile gardens of the White House with one of Carranza 's representatives , I asked him : " Do you believe that Carranza can bring about the pacitidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said he , " nobody can . " Carranzs , is one of the very few men who have started and ended a revolution . Usually revolutions destroy those who set them on foot  --  the cards beat the players . And he errs who measures General Carranza with the ordinary measures applied to the average revolutionary chieftain . President Carranta defeated and overthrew on the battilefield a dictatorial military power and defeated the old reactionary power in the diplomatic field . He obtained recognition from the United States and all other nations . He gave Mexico a new Constitution . He was elected President and built up a Government . Con/tale and courts are restoring law and order , all through the country business and industries are being reorganised , and Mexico will ultimately emerge from the revolution stronger , richer , and greater . We can well trust a man with such splendid record In spite of the fact that no difficulties , troubles , and woes were ever equal to his . EMETERIO Dill LA GARZA , Jr .
