THE housekeeper has seen the prices of food steadily rising for the last ten years , and there is little wonder that she is inclined to ask when and whether the end is coming . Fruits and vegetables are high and steadily rising . Meat is out of sight , and there are no longer " cheap cuts , " for no sooner does she forego porterhouse for round than , behold ! she pays as much as she did before , raising visions of shin bone and chuck and meat once a week . Potatoes are always high and the only really cheap food is flour ; yet at times we feel the necessity of determining whether the baker shall lighten his loaf or raise the price . It is significant in this connection that the rise in food values of the last few years is not confined to luxuries that affect the rich , but is most marked in staples that form the basis of the food for the masses . It is also significant that farmers are rapidly abandoning beef production because of the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chicago this year is over 4,000,000 below that of the year previous -- not a cheering prospect , surely . It may be well , therefore , to consider somewhat carefully the conditions that control prices and the chances whether they will decline or go still higher . Everybody understands that food values are often controlled by trade conditions and even by trusts , but that really high prices of necessities are possible only when the buying power of the masses of men is great , and that anything which makes the wage-earner unable to continue to buy the same foods as his employer will of itself operate to lower price ? . Remembering these fundamental facts , which are quite outside the scope of this paper , I will proceed at once to the discussion of the two remaining factors in food value ; namely , production and population , as they have been related to each other in the past and as they are likely to be related to each other in the future . HOW THE CONDITIONS OF LIVING HAVE CHANGED Consider for a moment what the present generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or forty years ago . and speaking for the masses of the people , nearly everybody owned his own cow and she fed upon the public domain . Milk and butter produced under such conditions cost nothing but labor , and that was largely furnished by the cow herself in collecting her free pasturage . Now , the same products are made almost exclusively out of forage and grain raised on land worth from fifty to three hundred dollars an acre , and they are delivered to the customer in costly packages , bearing frequently the name and guarantee of the producer . Then the cow and her calf cost next to nothing . Now they are not only fed at large labor upon costly food , but they are housed in expensive buildings , which the law as well as public sentiment demands must be kept in sanitary condition . Then milk and butter were incidental outputs of the home . Now they are the products of skilled labor , especially trained . Cows good enough to he kept under such conditions are not had  | for nothing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total cow population horn , and it is not strange that they cost from $00 to $120 , or even much more if purely bred . All this must raise the cost to the consumer , and still other elements of cost are being added . We are now demanding , for example , the tuberculin test , which must raise still more the cost of both milk and its products , not only because of the cows destroyed by the test , but also because the business is necessarily passing into the hands of better men . The reader and the housewife should remember , too , that milk at 10 cents per quart and butter at 35 or 40 cents per pound are not more expensive than meat at 25 cents . In previous days , and within our own recollection , cattle , sheep and swine ranged the public lands , the latter feeding on mast . Under conditions such as these flesh food cost little beyond the expense of killing . On the western range steers were raised for the cost of herding and they were fattened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , literally carrying themselves to the slaughter house and almost knocking at the door after a hearty breakfast collected for themselves on the public domain . Raised under conditions such as these the meats must be cheap , for the feed cost nothing , and the expense of herding was , under favorable conditions . not far from a dollar a head a year . We have also seen our markets flooded with venison and bear meat , squirrels , fish and wild turkey that cost nothing but . the sport of killing . We have seen millions of buffalo killed for the tongues and the entire race exterminated for their robes . But now conditions are different and all our meat is produced , like our milk , on expensive feed raised upon costly land . Moreover , the animals , instead of walking to market , are hauled in express trains and their carcasses are transported in especially constructed refrigerator cars . Indeed , the wonder is that meat is not higher than it has been , for besides all these considerations of expense it requires about ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of edible meat , which is worth no more for supporting life than is any one of the pounds of grain that were consumed in its production . Contemporaneous with all this the grain raiser has not been idle . Sixty or seventy year ; ago wheat was raised in little patches , cut with that new and wonderful tool , the cradle , that had but recently supplanted the sickle , and threshed with the flail on the barn floor or by one of the new machines that consisted of a cylinder only , leaving the separating to be done by hand with the fork , the rake and the fanning mill . Now , we have covered our boundless prairies with wheat fields , plowed with the gang plow , sowed with the hose drill and reaped by the seven-foot binder , threshed by the forty-inch self-feeder machine , or better yet , harvested by the forty-horse combined header and thresher . Moreover , within that time we have skimmed the cream of fertility off literally millions of acres in Illinois , Iowa . Nebraska , Kansas , Dakota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in repeating the process in the Canadian Northwest . Corn used to he raised in immense ( I ) fields of three or four acres , hauled upon the barn floor and husked at leisure in the early winter . Now it covers millions of acres , so that sometimes from Be car window nothing but corn can be seen on either side of the train as far as the eye can reach . It is raised by the quarter section , planted and cultivated by machinery that handles two rows at a time . The best of seed is used , and the total production has risen to the inconceivable amount of over two and one-half billions of bushels per year . Yet it has been worth SO cents a bushel within a twelvemonth ! The marvel of it all is that we have kept pace with this enormously increased production and have been . able to consume it all . They used to burn corn in Kansas as being cheaper than coal , and when I see the boundless fields I wonder that they do not do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairies for day after day , sees the Sian Joaquin , the Sacramento and the Willamette valleys in their glory . across the thousand miles from Calgary and Edmonton to Winnipeg , can not but wonder who eats it all . and marvel at . the consuming power of the American people . When he remembers the completion of the Union Pacific in the sixties , making a single band of steel across the continent , with the doubt of its success , and then regards the dozen trunk lines that span these prairies now , all hauling grain , stock and fruit in trains undreamed of in the sixties , he can but be lost in  | wonder that the country could eat so much . As I have said , we have kept pace with it all and have ourselves eaten the most of the product of this wonderful development . We have exported much , it is true , but now both corn and beef are coming to us from Argentina , and it looks as if we had only entered upon the period of high prices for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been , the hest-fed people on the earth , if the increase of stature and weight of Americans is to be maintained , and if famine is to be forever a stranger to our shores . If consumption has thus kept pace with our marvelously increased production in the past there must have been a reason for it . Does the reason stilt exist , and if so how is it likely to operate in the future ? That reason lies in the unparalleled increase in population during the period of which I have been speaking , and we are warranted in assuming that the increase will continue indefinitely or until it has passed our limit of increased food production . OUR HIGH BIRTH RATE We have now three times the people we had in the days of the Civil War , and the Revolution was fought with fewer than the present population of Illinois . Let all men everywhere remember that hack of all questions of food supply , beneath , over and through all discussions on the cost of living runs this fundamental fact that man under good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done this in the United States for the last one hundred and fifty years in spite of four wars and in spite of the ravages of yellow fever . smallpox , tuberculosis , scarlet fever , diphtheria and every and all other abnormal causes of decrease , This rapid increase in people has gone on almost unobserved among ns because in our marvelous development we have constantly needed more and more men , and because population is continualIy thinning itself by the ever westward movement that has resulted in peopling almost every nook and corner of the public domain . Immigration has stood in the public mind as the great cause of increased population , but with our present stock we can in ten years duplicate by birth every immigrant , dead or alive , that ever carne to our shores . Ah , no , it is not the steerage passengers , it is the birth rate , with an abundant food supply , that has made us populous . As long as our numbers were small and the western movement was rapid , the increase went on unnoticed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the West fills up , we shall feel the tide setting back upon us and the first consciousness of the horde of people just ahead of us is in the unprecedented numbers of children demanding instruction in the public schools , compelling the doubling of educational equipment almost during the 1 st decade . Has the significance of all this failed to occur to the students of prices ? If we have doubled every twenty-five years for the last one hundred and fifty years , what shall we be likely to do in the next century ? It is profitable to consider that question soberly , for here is one of the two keys to the situation . Our present population is , roughly speaking , ninety millions . The following table shows what it will be a century from now , unless something happens to prevent the normal rate of increase : But , the reader will say , this can not go on forever , and probably it will not go on at the present rate for another hundred years . Certainly , I do not suppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that will happen when the normal rate of increase can no longer go on ? When the family that desires children can not afford them because it can not afford the expense of feeding them ? A PROBABLE SHORTAGE OF FOOD The only force that can strop this normal increase will be some social or economic upheaval due most probably to the increased cost of living , and this will have its origin in scarcity of food . This prospective population is sixteen times our present number , and we do not now know how to produce food enough out of our lands to feed them as they are fed today , even providing they could afford to pay for it . because it must not be forgotten that the ability to pay is one of the factors of increased prices . I say we do not know how to feed a population sixteen times as great as ours . This is for the following reasons : We have skimmed the cream of the fertility off most of our lands . Great stretches of country have already been  | abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century are declining in production except the few that have been fertilized at the expense of others near by . No lands are good enough to endure a quarter of a century of exclusive grain farming without marked decrease of yield . One field at the University of Illinois has raised corn successively thirty years , and it has declined in yield on the average a bushel a year . though it was superior land at the beginning and was " too rich ever to wear out . " It has been said that we can double our yields wherever it will pay to do so , but that can not be done at anything like present prices . The best of farmers now raise double the average , but we shall always have a great mass of men who do not have the knowledge , the business capacity and the skill to secure maximum results , and to put twenty or even ten bushels increase on our yields of wheat and corn means a superhuman effort , especially as we remember that heretofore fertility has not been taken into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate against a. declining store of plant food . Men in high places have held that the protection against scarcity of food is a proper rotation . and they have pointed to the wheat yields of England and Germany on land that has been farmed for centuries as proof of their position . THE EXHAUSTION OF THE SOIL But they do not tell us that rotation of crops adds nothing but nitrogen to the soil , and only draws upon deeper supplies of minerals , because rotation in substance means the introduction of legumes that root deeper than the grain crops . They do not tell us that there are lands among us now fairly productive that do not contain mineral enough to produce maximum crops for the next century , even if we could get it all out , which we can not . They do not tell us that a half century ago England built fleets of ships to haul guano from the South Sea Islands and has long since exhausted the supply that the sea birds were ages in depositing . It stopped famine in Britain , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been exporting steers and corn for the cost of labor , and that they were fed on English soil , transferring to their farms immense quantities of American nitrogen and phosphorus . They do not tell us that for a generation the English feeder has bought shiploads of American oil cake , rich in nitrogen and phosphorus . and they do not tell us that Germany is buying more than a million tons of American phosphate rock a year . Reason enough is all this why English lands yield twice the wheat of ours . They do not tell us that those same English lands that have been fertilized no more than ours have been , with all their skill and exceptional climate , now yield on the Rothamsted plots but 12 bushels as the result of continuous cropping , or 24 bushels under rotation . The average of the rotation plots at the beginning ; sixty years ago , was 32 bushels , but it has dropped now to less than 24 , or 6 bushels below the average yield of England . Rotation is thus no antidote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European wheat yields , and we have given it freely until we have little more to give . These advisers of ours appear not to know agricultural history well ; or , if they do , they do not tell us that increased fertility is the price to pay when we attempt to double our yields , and that , altogether . on top of better methods , higher intelligence and richer knowledge . we can not always make bricks without straw . No , indeed . rotation must come , but it is no protection against the evil day . It is no panacea against the certainty that in the end population will and must overtake production , and it will not alter or amend the general principle that race suicide will come , when it does come . mainly because of the increased cost of raising children . - Where is Carthage today ? Where are Egypt and Babylon ? Where is Palestine and what is becoming of India ? America is the only country in the world where men have not died from famine , and they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt it once and needed no second warning . Bence the fleets of ships to carry guano from the South Sea Islands . Hence the trade in American phosphate rock . Renee European activity in Africa . By any count we must reckon with this issue , and that , too , on our own lands and by our own resources . Certain influences are at work to increase population and the consuming power of the people , quite aside from mere birth rate . The life period is lengthening . due to better conditions of living . The fearful mortality among infants is decreasing , due largely to a more sanitary milk and water supply . Contagious and infectious diseases are under better control . We shall have no more epidemics from-smallpox , yellow  | - ever or cholera. , such as used to terrify the world and decimate the population . Even such afflictions as scarlet fever , diphtheria , typhoid and tuberculosis are soon to disappear and already have lost ' heir worst terrors . War will no longer he attended with the fearful loss or life of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sentimeat , war is too costly now to be much longer tolerated by business interests . In cold blood , it costs too much now to kill men , and when that conviction settles a ittle deeper into the public mind , men will not be killed in large numbers . Fewer men will be engaged in wart which will largely be fought with machinery . and if our whole navy should sink at once it would not destroy as many men as were killed in a single battle like Chickamauga . Someone has said that the time has come when to fire a cannon represents the cost of a college education and to build a battleship costs a. university . These considerations will one day amend public policies , but it will only increase the demand for bread , and now that we are checking the agencies or human destruction , we must understand what it will mean in population . Every lire saved and every infant preserved adds not only to numbers but to the average length of human life and . correspondingly , to the demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting relief from the prospect of permanent high prices for food . Improved methods of production will defer the day and soften its coming , and reduced wages , consequent upon a , dense population . will result in a. forced demand for a lessened amount and a cheaper kind of food for the masses , and this , more than all other causes , will keep prices in check . But hack of it all lies the fact of the pressure of population and the lessening fertility that no race yet has ever stood against nor can stand against except ; by new and permanent methods of agriculture such as have not yet been generally established . PRICES GOING YET HIGHER We can not afford to live in a fool 's paradise in this matter . The day of cheap meat is over and that of cheap white bread is passing , and unless we can speedily establish a more permanent agriculture than has ever yet been established , then will prices not only go higher , but the most of men will be forced to subsist on the cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for considerations of humanity , is eminently undesirable . The era of high-priced food is fairly upon us in spite of our " boundless ( 7 ) natural , resources " and our " inexhaustible fertility , " and the most that we can do is to retard the speed and soften the hardship of its coming by a timely and scientific , attention to our agriculture . Much is expected through reclamation of arid regions by irrigation . but the areas are relatively small , probably all told not exceeding that of Illinois , and the great staple grains . grasses and meats will always be raised on non-irrigated lands . These are largely occupied already . The largest relief comes in breaking up the range for grain farming , hut this means the last of cheap meat , and it means neither a permanent food supply nor a final reduction in price . The permanent food supply is attainable only by permanent systems or agriculture that increase instead of decreasing ; fertility , and even these do not prevent population from overtaking production . In the end high prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had fairly started on the road , and if that is so , the only financial relief is cheaper food or less of it . I am in all things an optimist , not a pessimist , but we can not afford to close our eyes to very evident facts . We have lived as have no other people in a superabundance or food . That time is over . I expect fluctuations in prices ; but , for the reasons outlined , I believe that the era of cheap food is past forever .  |
