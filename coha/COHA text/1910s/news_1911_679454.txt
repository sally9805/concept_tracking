The checks which investors will receive to an aggregate of $146,971,610 , according to.the compilation of The Journal of Commerce , will be an agreeable surprise by their increase over last April 's total of $141,431.122 , and over the Mar.ch total of $100,458,334 . The increase over March is merely seasonal , the April division being quarterly rather than merely monthly . The increase over 1910 Is another increase in the persistent growth of prosperity despite the best efforts of the legislators and the prophets to slay it by act and word . The decision of the Inter-State Commerce Commission to the effect that the railways did not need an increase of rates was accepted as a tribute to their impregnable , actual position , rather than as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a similar interpretation on the conditions of the country at large , as reflected in its profits and interest on investments in general business . This interpretation in fact is a trifle too emphatic to be altogether comfortable , aid of course appears rather in the dividends according to profits , than in , the interest payments which are less responsive to . changes in conditions . The dividend . records make these comparisons : ? The industrial increase is double the railway decrease , on a comparison of a single years changes . Going back to 1909 the increase in the industrial dividends is - marked , the dividends then totaling only $30,451,253 . It thus appears that while the railway profits are holding their own *remarkably , and in a manner disconcerting to pessimists , the industrials are catching up surprisingly . They have still some way to go , but it is not difficult to imagine an industrial dividend total surpasOng the railways ' . That , indeed , would be the natural , sequel of limiting the railways to a reasonable return on their capital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless the enthusiasm of investors should not allow them to indulge an incautious preference for industrials . Experience teaches that reverses are both sharper and more frequent in trade than in transportation . The stability of railway investments would indeed be strengthened under a regime which assumed a governmental responsibility for their soundness , and which checked the reduction of rates which has marked recent years , were it not accompanied by activities in other and less responsible departments of government which createdburdens for the railways faster than the favorable influences accrue . It has sometimes been asked why , if railways were thus discriminated . against , was not this discrimination reflected more clearly in their investment situation . The question could only be k ased by those unaware how the in-asked vestment situation of railways has depreciated in the estimation of the most enlightened students of investment values . It is only necessary to make passing reference to the difficulty that the : railways experience in floating longterm bonds on term 's compatible with sound finance . A better and less disputable measure of this depreciation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railway Age Gazette , which remarks upon the decrease in institutional holdings of railway securities as compared with others . The official returns show a decrease in holdings of railway bonds in fourteen months from $1,551,000,000 to $1,455,000,000 by all classes of financial institutions  --  National , State , savings and private banks , and trust companies . Savings banks alone show a small increase , and savings banks are noted for their disinclination to follow the fluctuations of the market . They seldom sell for profit , or to change their investments , and ' almost never take a loss , through their custom of holding to maturity . The suggestion of disfavor by these experienced students ' of investments is strengthened ' by the fact that while their holdings of railway bonds decreased 6 per cent. , their holdings of public service bonds increased 5 per cent . Special favor is being shown for local securities , about which there ! s first-hand information , and which are free from the inter-State commerce uncertainty . What is called the demand of investors for higher interest has the appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of double supervision with its unknown and unappraisahle effect upon earnings and profits . Only a short time ago it would have been remarked upon this comparison that experienced investors were showing a preference for the more speculative and less conservative investment . It is still open to make this comment upon the tendency to seek higher interest rather than to demand greater security , but so general . a movement suggests a query whtither a talency away from steam railway- investments is in fact a disfavor for the'preferable investment . Is it not possible that public utilities under the eyes of the investor and responsible to but a single jurisdiction are becoming the more conservative as they are a more favored investment ? If so , their larger comparative yield can not long endure , and the bargain season will nob long last , the more forehanded having seen the point first . It will then come to pass that the steam railway securities will take the abandoned place , and'will be preferred by those willing to take chance in consideration of a larger yield .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
