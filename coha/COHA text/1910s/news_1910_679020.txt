txt State 's Attorney Wayman last evening completed preparations for his final blow which he believes will knock out the habeas corpus proceeding , the last resort of Representative Lee O'Neil Browne to avoid trial in the Criminal court on the charge of bribing Representative Charles A. White to vote for William Lorimer for senator . Should Judge Scanlan , who granted a hearing on a hurried application by Browne 's attorneys In the morning , rule adversely to the state and allow Browne to go free , it is confidently expected by attorneys that Judge will order a copies issued for I:rowne and force him to trial in the Criminal court . State 's Attorney Wayman contends that the habeas corpus proceeding is wholly Illegal and that Judge Scanlan sitting as a Circuit judge exceeded his authority in in terfering in a case which already was at trial in the Criminal court  --  a tribunal of cotirdinate jurisdiction with his own . Regard It as Forlorn Hope . Mr. Wayman and his aids Insisted that they were little worried over the last dilatory move of Browne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge 's court tomorrow morning . They do not think Judge Scanlan will grant Browne 's plea . Attaches of the state 's attorney 's office argued that the habeas corpus move was only a forlorn hope of the defense and evidently not concurred In by all of Browne 's counsel , as W. S. Forrest , who has been known as the head of the defense brigade of lawyers , was not in court when the application was made , and said he knew nothing of the move . Former Judge Hanecy , personal attorney for Senator Lorimer , P. H. O'Donnell , and James Hartnett applied for the writ on the grounds that the Criminal court had no jurisdiction over a charge of bribing a legislator for voting for a United States senator . Attorney Forrest declared that the absence of himself and Attorney Charles E. Erbstein , also of Browne 's counsel , did not mean that there was any disagreement among counsel for the indicted legislator . Reports emanated from friends of Browne , however , that Mr. Forrest was not In sympathy with the habeas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venue change appeal , which was overruled by the defendant himself . Wayman Says Absurdity . State 's Attorney Wayman fought hard In Judge Scanlan 's court on the bond for the defendant . He said the whole proceeding was an " absurdity , " and warned Deputy Sheriff Peters that the $15,000 bond that the defendant was allowed to give was worthless , and that the bondsmen could not be held for a dollar should Lee O'Neil Browne decide to leave before the heat-big on The writ , Set for 8 o'clock in the morning . The Initial proceedings were hurried through . Preliminary to the filing of the habeas corpus petition , Ald. John Powers and Aid . John J. Brennan , the indicted legislator 's bondsmen , surrendered Browne to the sheriff . A few moments later Attorney O'Donnell handed the petition to Judge Scanlan . No Fight on Indictment . " On what grounds ? " asked the judge . " On tile grounds that the Criminal court has no jurisdiction in this case in any way , " Attorney Hanecy answered . " You are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " questioned the court , " No , only the court 's jurisdiction , " Mr. Hanecy replied . " It will take only an hour to hear our arguments . ' ? " Very well , this court will receive the petition and set the case for hearing at 8 o'clock Monday morning . Let there be no mistake in my attitude ; I will permit no delay . I understand that he also Is a defendant in a case in the Criminal court at 10 o'clock Monday morning , and this proceeding must be concluded by that hour . " When Mr. Wayman heard of the proceeding , of which he had been kept in ignorance , he hurried to Judge Scanlan 's court and challenged , the right of the court to review the case which already Is before a fudge of concurrent jurisdiction . Wayman Claims Writ Is Void . " For two days , " the state 's attorney said , " two lawyers stood in the Criminal court and argued on a motion to quash . Judge Mc-Surely overruled the motion . The defendant has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribery . Is that jurisdiction in this matter ? The Criminal and Circuit courts are concurrent . " ' ' The only question 1 am desirous to determine , " said the judge , " Is whether or not the Criminal court has jurisdiction of the person , and the subject matter . " " The Supreme court of this state has held that any act of a court to review the proceedings of a concurrent tribunal is a nullity. " declared the state 's attorney in answer . " 1 contend therefore that this writ issued here today is void and that a new bond accepted by CIS court would be void . " " But , " said Judge Scanlan , " if 118 gave a new bond in the Criminal court , then I Would not have jurisdiction over him ; and he would not be compelled to appear here Monday morning . " Sees Chance of Escape . Right , " replied Mr. Wayman , " and If you accept a new bond he may not appear here or on the north side either , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ready now to proceed and we can eliminate this whole matter of bail . " The , court turned to Attorney Francis Walker , who was in court representing the sheriff 's office . " Do you think that the Supreme court decision cited by Mr. ** applies in this case ? " he asked . " I should say that It did not , speaking offhand , " the sheriff 's attorney responded . " The decision of Judge Is a matter of record in the Criminal court , " continued Mr. Wayman . " I ask that the defendant give a new bond in the Criminal court or remain in the custody of the sheriff . The state could not recover a bond in a million years under these conditions . The whole proceedings here this morning are a nullity . " " Unless I sidestepped this matter I would have to issue this writ , " argued Judge Scanlan . In response to a question by Mr. Warman , the court said that the indictment returned against Browne formed a part of the Petition for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , " Mr. Woman repeated , " and the court should take official cognisance of that . The sheriff might be liable for this new bond and should be greatly interested in these proceedings . I think the court will agree that this is an irregular Proceeding and Is apt to give the public the impression of warfare on the bench . " " Mr. Wayman , " said the court , Impetuously , I want you to understand that no dubious technical points will be considered . This point of the defense must be a ' wonderfully clear one . They have presented the petition to me and I granted the writ to show that I have the courage to act in a case Of yublic interest . " Draws Quick Retort . Here Mr. Hanecy interrupted with a remark that the state 's attorney was not arguing " by law . " " My argument is all borne out by the Criminal court records , " the state 's attorney retorted . " I consider this petition to have been sought surreptitiously and not in good faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not appear in any ' court should Judge Scanlan accept a bond that was not good the court said : " I am sure that will not occur , " and turned to the clerk and ordered the bond signed and approved .
