The President Relapses THE President 's last speech to Congress is a relapse into the methods by which he bog ? gled the beginning of the war . Again he commits all the difficulties of a new era to the ordi ? nary energies of his ordinary departments . And again he is on his way to extraordinary confusions . At the very moment while he was telling Con ? congress that " readjustment " would quite well take care of itself there were discharged soldiers within a mile of , him who were giving him the lie direct . They had been discharged at the gates of nearby camps . The War Department had been implored not to discharge them there . It had been implored to send all soldiers all the way back home to their local draft boards to be welcomed and to ' be hon ? ored and to be restored to their families and to their jobs before being finally dismissed and demobilized . But the local draft boards were among the ex ? traordinary agencies of the war . Orders were is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would not be needed any longer . The old estab ? lished routine agencies would now be enough . And our soldiers would be flicked off into the air from the gates of their camps by the General Staff . It is being done . And some of the first victims of it were vagrants and beggars on Pennsylvania Avenue while the President was saying in the Capitol " It is surprising how fast the process of re ? turn to a peace-footing has moved in the three weeks since the fighting stopped . " This " process " for these men was as follows : By their camp commanders they were given their discharge certificates and their final statements of their pay . By their camp commanders they were also given certain allowances of money with which to buy railway tickets . They bought railway tickets . The theory of the General Staff was that they would buy them for home . The fact is that these young men were young men . They had been tied tight for some time . Now they were on the loose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest place at which they could be on the loose as much as possible . Such a place was Baltimore . It was near and it was wet . And there , while their fathers and mothers were awaiting them at home , they got rid of their discipline and of their cash . Their fathers and mothers were many miles ? perhaps hundreds ? perhaps thousands ? away . The one army agency close to all fathers and mothers , and close to all employers , physically , was the local draft board . Our local draft boards could pigeon ? hole our soldiers back into their families and farms and factories as neatly as they funneled them out . They could do it if a system for it were issued to them in one pamphlet of instructions from the office of the Provost Marshal General . But the President thinks that the whole " process of return to a peace-footing " is so smooth and so simple by nature that " it promises , " as he said to Congress , " to outrun . any inquiry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered , and it will not be easy to direct it any better than it can direct itself . " And so , in this case , it directed itself at last from Baltimore to Washington . It arrived in Washington with a few stray cents of carfare in its pockets , and it wandered up and down Pennsylvania Avenue soliciting " inquiry " in the shape of personal individual pity and soliciting " aid " in the shape of personal individual alms . The advance , guard of our demobilized army Was panhandling on Pennsylvania Avenue while the President was saying ; " From no quarter have I seen any scheme of reconstruction ' emerge which I thought it likely we could force our spirited business men and our self-reliant laborers to accept with due pliancy and obedience . " It was a small advance guard . Demobilization is yet small . When demobilization gets big there will be thousands of sons of spirited business 10 and of self-reliant laborers who will accept a dime or a fiver toward their carfare home , from the President or from anybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there , will be thousands of fathers and of mothers who will , want to know why a little " inquiry " and ' aid : beforehand would not have been better than We enormous " inquiry " and " aid " which will hare ' ' to be furnished when their sons have been soiled with all the dirt between a distant camp and the spot where the home-fires have been kept burning . And the spirited business men themselves w s be asking , and are now asking , certain questions about their businesses . The copper business , for , instance , is a large business and an essential business . What will happen to it ? It has been going forward under a price arrangement made by the War Industries Board . The President says truly , and with pride amply earned that " never before have there been agencies lie existence in this country which knew so much 01 , t field of supply , of labor and of industry as the War Industries Board , the War Trade Board , the Food Administration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , now the war is over ; and now our people do not wait to be coached and led . They know their own business , are quick and resourceful at every readjustment , definite in purpose and self-reliant in action . " Therefore " the moment we knew the armistice to have been signed , we took the harness off . We did . By the end of December there will be no War Industries Board . Mr. Baruch is disband ? ing it . He has collected the photographs of all his dollar-a-year colleagues to make a great album or gallery for his reminiscent eyes in his old age . He has paid the . railway fares of all his humbler col ? leagues back to their homes . And he has given each of them a bonus of a few weeks of wages . &he; private pocketbook of Barney Baruch is Prompter and more generous than the treasury of the Republic . And on January 1st the offices of the War Industries Board will be virtually empty . On January 1st , also , the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price ? f Copper will then drop . It has dropped already in many private sales . But the wage of the copper miner is by custom proportioned to the price of copper in the market . Therefore the copper owner Will ask the copper miner to accept a reduced wage . tut the price of food will not have dropped . The test of living will not have dropped . Therefore the copper miner will refuse to accept a reduced Wage . And both sides will be conscious of right . And a great disturbance in the copper districts , with strikes and posses and mobs and deportations , Is widely expected . To prevent it from happening , a plan was proposed t the government for stabilizing copper prices and copper wages through an arrangement quite similar to the one which was contrived and sanctioned by the War Industries Board during the war . The government would continue to be arbiter of prices and of wages throughout the time of the difficult change from war to peace . But The government 's theory is that there is no difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y also is that business men can not cooperatefor the common good under common guidance in times of Peace . " Any leading strings we might seek , to put them in would speedily become hopelessly tangled , " said the President to Congress , because they the business men would pay no attention to them and would go on their way . " They pay attention , one must hope , to the rulings t ? the Federal Reserve Board ( which Mr. Wilson created with regard to discount rates . They pay attention.one must hope , to the rulings of the Federal Trade Commission ( which Mr. Wilson created ) with regard to unfair competition . But they would pay no attention to the rulings of 3 ' new governmental body , even if they them selves should be the ones to request those rulings . Therefore the proposed plan for the stabilizing of the copper industry in the period of reconstruction ? tion was rejected . And no other plan was adopted . And the War Industries Board is vanishing . And when the copper districts are hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government will have to congratulate itself simply on being untangled ? hopelessly untangled ? with the lives of its citizens in the copper business . Surely it can not be thought that this utter refusal of public responsibility for the public welfare is genuinely desired either by Capital or by Labor . Yet in the President 's whole speech there are only three acceptances of responsibility within the field of domestic American affairs . One is to the effect that the tax-rate for 1920 should be fixed now . One is to the effect that the railways can not be put back into the precise legal position which they occupied before the war . And one is to the effect that there ought to be great federal public works for the em ? employment of labor ( and of capital ) during the transition from war industry to peace industry . The first two of these three acceptances could be underwritten by almost any reactionary . They raise no dispute between sensible reactionaries and sensible liberals . The third is an essay in actual applied liberalism . But the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the federal government next spring , promptly , it is necessary to have a centralized agency , by which those works can be assembled and promoted . No such agency exists . The Department of the Interior will pre ? sent its excellent plans for the expenditure of bil ? lions of dollars on the reclamation of hundreds of millions of acres of arid land and cut-over land and swamp land . The Council of National Defense will present its excellent plans for the expenditure of colossal sums of money on colossal systems of roads . The people interested in rivers and har ? bors will present their increased estimates of the cost of bringing all rivers and harbors and inlets and creeks and dew-trickles in western Texas to a state of navigability . And all other groups of people , amounting to at least fourteen or fifteen , will equally present their equally attractive and persuasive sets of ideas . And . Congress will debate them . And Congress is busy . And Congress is interested in the ex ? change of favors ? which takes time . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite claims upon Congress . And there is no extraordinary department or agency or bureau em ? powered to winnow and consolidate those claims . By definition there is no need of any such body . The old established governmental bodies are enough . And Congress will do what it has always in such circumstances naturally done . Nothing consolidated . Nothing comprehensive . Nothing prompt . And Congress can not be blamed . It can not by its own force unify the administrative de ? partments to any common purpose . And therefore there will be no unified system of federal public works to combat unemployment . The Allied governments and the associated gov ? ernment won this war . It is accordingly assumed that the associated government did its best and ut ? most . The statistics soon to , be published on that point will completely destroy that illusion . They will prove that the whole military-industrial programme of the United States during the first twelve months of the war was a feeble and futile failure . It was a failure precisely because Mr. Wilson was still rejecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the public welfare and the principle of centralized responsibility for the administrative welfare of the government of Washington ? which he afterwards in a great de ? gree , and with a correspondingly great success , brought himself to swallow . Now he has rejected those principles again . Now he has relapsed into letting business go its own gait and into letting every department in Washington tread its own path to perdition or paradise . NOW he has reverted to " The New Freedom " for industry and to " coordination " ? voluntary " ordination " ? for his lieutenants . And so now he is about to make the . first twelve months of peace as big a failure as the first twelve months of war . He is the generally recognized leader of American liberalism . Every American liberal must wish him a complete success in his mission of international organization abroad . And every American liberal must also wish that he could meet him 21 the dock on his return and tell him that the only sort of nation which will ultimately adhere to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only sort of liberalism which the United States will accept in 1920 is the liberalism which brings forth its proper fruits of a better life , for the young discharged soldier and for the useful investor and for the workless worker and for the self-respecting employee ? a liberalism genuinely administratively applied .
