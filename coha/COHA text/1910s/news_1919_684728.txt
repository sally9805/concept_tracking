txt HONEST HIRAM JOHNSON . He Does Openly What Others Do by Indirection . To the . Editor of The Nem . York Times : May I suggest what seems to me to be the chief reason why Senator Johnson is looming up as the probable Republican nominee for the Presidency ? It is because he is doing boldly what the Lodge faction is aiming at hypocritically and by indirection . Lodge is venting his hatred of President Wilson under the guise of cautious statesmanship . Johnson makes no bones of it . Lodge and his associates are trying to get every possible partisan advantage out of the fight on the treaty and the League of Nations , but they are unwilling to admit that such is the case . Johnson insists that the question be acknowledged as an open party Issue , and stakes his own future upon it . The Lodge faction makes clever but indirect appeals to every group of hyphenated voters in the country  --  to the Italians about Plume , to the Greeks about Thrace , to the German-Americans over the financial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both German and Irish hyphenates by its persistent jingo propaganda against Great Britain . Johnson does all these things , with the encouragement of the Lodge group , but now they are rightly worried because those minorities of the American people who wish to see the peace settlement broken up , and , to have outrageous attacks made here on all our allies In the great war , follow and applaud the man who does all this most directly and effectively and without wrapping himself in the thin veiling of transparent pretense .
