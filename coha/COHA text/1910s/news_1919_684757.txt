txt Speaking yesterday at the Hotel Commodore , before the American Iron &; Steel Institute , the membership of which comprises the leading iron and steel manufacturers of this country , Judge E. H. Gary , chairman of the organisation and of the United States Steel Corporation , told of the industrial situation in the United States , especially ab affecting the steel industry . He said that labor 's proposals at the Washington industrial conference all lead to recognition of the closed shop policy ; that there was yet work which might be profitab ) y done by the public group of the conference , and that there is no room in this country , except in prison , for Bolshevist ; I. W. W. 's , and other like radicals .  - -  . every proposition contended for by the labor unions at the National Industrial Conference at Washinftton lead to domination of the shop and of the men by the union labor leaders , " said Judge Gary . " Every position taken by the other side centered on the open shop . This is the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world public . From 80% to 90% or more of labor in this country is non-union . It is for them and the employers generally and the large class of men and women who are not , strictly speaking , employers or wage earners to determine whether or not it is best for the whole humanity to have industry totally organized . Judged by experience , we believe it is for the best interests of employer and employe and the general pane to have a business conducted on the basis of what we term the ' open shop ' , thus permitting any man to engage in any line of employment , or any employer to secure the services of any workman on terms agreed upon between the two , whether the workman is or is not connected with a labor union . The verdict of the people at large will finally decide this question and the decision will be right . " I think the fundamental question submitted to the conference.for recormnendaton to industry was the . ' open shop 's that question apparently could not be decided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized into three groups , called labor , employers and public . No affirmative action under the constitution for adopted rules could be taken except by the unanimous vote of the three groups , each of which vote by a majority of all its members . It was necessary to have such a condition as otherwise there could be no conference in which there would be an agrement beween capital and labor , socalled . " However it would seem there were many objects which might have been appopriately considered by the conference and conclusions . for recommendations arrived at by unanimous consent which would be advantageous to the public good , and , therefore , to all mankind , such as working hours , living and working conditions , women 's work , child labor recreation , medical , and surgical treatment , pensions , relief in times of stress , rates of compensation , schools , churches and other educational facilities . With the right disposition and intelligence the public group , the sole survivor of the conference can agree upon recommendations to the industrial world which should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these principles and of any ? others that may be suggested which we believe will be of real benefit to the wage earnerssand to the general public . " Considerable has been said in public ' of late concerning the attempt to spread the doctrine of Bolshevism in this country . All of - us have known for some time that this disease is persistent , and that there has been some inoculation , even in this best of countries . Still we deny that there is danger of serious trouble . There is only one way to treat this disease , and that is to stamp it out ; to meet it boldly wherever it can be found ; to expose it and give it no chance for development . In this free country , with its reasonable laws wisely administered , its golden harvest , healthful climate , peace 1 loving inhabitants , who are generous in contribution for relief and protection . schools , churches , and hospitals , there is no room except in the prisons , for the anarchists , the Bolshevists , or other individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of law and reason . If there are slinking , desperate , murderous Bolsheviki in this country , even in small numbers , I believe the Secret Service Department of the Government should detect and expose them , and that the iron hand of justice should punish them as they deserve ; and as I have faith ? in this country and in its institutions , I believe this will be done and done promptly . Any one who doubts the ability of the proper authorities to protect the person and property of our people agairist Bolshevism and other similar doctrines , fails to appreciate the courage of our citizens and the terrible force and strength of subdued calmness when they are surrounded by threatened danger . " Speaking of the progress of the steel strike , Judge Gary said : " Taken as a whole , the situation at present is good , and steadily improving . After the men were ordered out , in many , if not most of the mills , the larger number of employes continued to work without interruption . At the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public streets and elsewhere by strikers , or pickets , and importuned to engage in the strike ; and many were assaulted and seriously injured . After protection was afforded by the police , sheriffs ' deputies , state constabulary , and , in some cases , state ? or national troops , the numbers resuming Work increased appreciably from day to day , until , in many places , operations are about normal . " It will be observed that the strike is not the result of any claim by any workmen ' for higher wages or better treatment , nor for any reason except the desire and effort on the part of union labor leaders to unionize the iron and steel industry . As stated in the first resolution ( of W. Z. Foster , at A. F. L. meeting in St. Paul , Minn. , June 13 , 1918 ) , the action taken was ' for the purpose of uniting all these organizations into one mighty drive'to organize the steel Wants of America ' . " Without discussing for the present the merit or demerit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor leaders openly state that they seek to unionize , or , as they say , ' organize ' the whole industry of this country . Those who ? do not contract or deal with unions , although they do not combat them , insist upon absolute freedom to both " employer and employe in regard to employment and the . management of the shops . The nonunion employers and employes both stand for the open shop . The unions argue for the closed shop , or , as the leaders now ' insist , ' the right ' of collective bargaining through labor union leaders ' . " Abolition of company nnions , Judge Gary stated , speaking of the stand of the union labor leaders , was included , and insisted upon , in the twelve points published by the leaders who were conducting the strike . " The unions claim , " lie said , " that collective bargaining through different forms of shop organization made up of the employes tends to limit the extension of unions by increasing , ? their numbers . Ther-Anion employes and unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perfectly clear that the whole argument returns to the main proposition of open or closed shop . " In the Industrial Conference there was no objection offeredby any one to a form of collective bargaining as between employes and employers , provided both were free from outside representation and direction . " The Labor group , so-called , was made up of union labor leaders , leaving unorganized labor without special representation . The same mistake seems to have been made by a large portion of the public that was made throughout the war , namely , that organized labor really represents the workmen or wage earners generally , notwithstanding , as a matter of fact , at least 85% of the total are non-union -- not members of any union organization . The Employers group , in which were men first class in every respect , included men connected with large and important lines of industry , and also included several others some of whom at least should have been with the labor group . In selecting the public group there were overlooked thousands of vocations , professions , artisans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less . affected by the cost of production , the expense of living and , therefore , the control and conditions of both labor and capital .
