I WAS wounded and taken prisoner near La 13assee on the 21st December , 1914 , and was well caked-up in mud , blood , and water . On being taken through the German trenches they gave us a right German welcome . Ocli , Englander , swinehund ! You use dumdum which I may say is a lie , one of a good many and fight for money . ' And then again we would hear , Swinellund ' and ' Swine ' something else . Then upwith their rifles as if to blow our brains out . They drew their fingers across their throats ; meaning , I suppose , that they would like to cut our throats , which I would not have cared if they had at the time . I confess I had the satisfaction of seeing plenty of dead Huns in their own trenches , and I was glad to think that they had not been having all their own way . I could not help smiling at one young German , who had got his just as we were coming along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having his hand wrapped up , and squealing like a stuck pig . Ifewas then sent along with h its on to La Bassee . The Germans would not bandage my wounds up , so I had to wait while we got to La I 3assee , which might have been about four miles off . I should think we walked all over La . Bassee , first up one street and then clown another , until I was properly done up with the loss of blood and the fatigue of walking with my bruised shin . I tried to make one of the escort understand that I wanted my wounds wrapped up , as my arm was paining me very much . And at last , after a bit of arguing , I was taken into a house where there were six more Germans . After a bit . of wrestling , they got my jacket off ( it had stuck to my jersey and shirtsleeves , and my arm had gone quite stiff ) . They then cut my jersey and shirt-sleeve off , a quicker and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sling , we set off again to find the house they were taking us to . After another hour or so we found the place , which looked like a hospital full of wounded men . We had to go through an archway and across a big yard to the house where a little red-haired German officer was staying . He could speak English , but the first words were , ' Ah , Englanders , swiners , ' and then in English lie asked us for our pay-hooks , so as to take our names and particulars . As soon as he got them , he said something in German to one of the escort , who then marched its off to another place across the yard , with two or three kicks to help its along , and roused Os up some steps into a room , and made us stand with our faces turned towards the wall , by being knocked round . We were kept like that for about half an hour , and if we looked round there was a kick for us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and roused us out of it again , and with kicks from theyoung German soldiers and a few blows across the back as we were passing through the archway on our way to La Bassee station . When we arrived at tbest at ion , I had no sooner got into the waiting-room when I saw some more of our regiment and French soldiers and some Sikhs a nd Gurkhas . Here I was knocked mund about six times , with a German big enough to eat me , who then robbed me of three francs , which was all I had , itrul I was very glad I did not have any more . After about one and a half hours waiting , we were all bundled into some cattle-trucks . One end of our t ruck had some straw on t he floor , and the other end had some water thrown on to it . And because I could not get , in fast , enough to please them , having one arm slung up , and feeling the pain of my shin , also being very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .5 A.M. the 201h to late on the night of the 2Ist before get Ong into the truck , they almost threw me in . They put the Frenchmen , twenty of them , on the straw end , and Englanders , fifteen of us , on the wet end . The escort , I ; till sure , had had a drop too much from t he way they carried on , and of course the spite fell on to its crouched on t he hot tom of the wet truck . They would pat the French on the back and say , ' Good eomerade , ' then they would come to our end and say , Englander , swine-Minds , ' etc . After this , they searched and turned its over four times on our journey to a big railway shed about six or seven Miles from La Bassee . It was plain t he engine-drive ? knew all about us being behind his engine , for he gave us a good few jolts before he parted with us at this little station . I was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this shed . But . I had no sooner got , onto t he plat form before one of the Germans was going to give me one with the deleted material one nearest with her arms folded , and just peeping out , a packet of cigarettes . She looked at me and drew my attention to the cigarettes . I nodded my head to say that I would like them , so , like a flash our hands met , and the cigarettes had changed their ownership . The German made a hit at her arm , but he was a bit too late that time , and before he had time to look round , the cigarettes were in my pocket . And six of us enjoyed a whiff after we got to our destination , where we arrived shortly after . I do not know what they called the place , but it looked to me like a barracks and a magazine . We were taken into this place , and put in some arched places , which looked like tunnels , and maybe about 25 to 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were three of them , so they put the English in one , the natives in another , and the French in the other ; and when we got to our places I was surprised to see some Highland Light Infantry inside , I should say about 200 or so all told . When we got in and after we had got settled down a bit , they brought us sonic coffee and some German biscuits in a small linen bag . I was not long before I had eaten mine as I was very hungry . Then we wounded were taken to have our wounds dressed , which made us feel a little easier , after which we were sent back to our tunnels again . After a chat amongst ourselves talking ' about our troubles , and enjoying those cigarettes I had given to me on our journey through Lille , we all straightened a bit of straw and lay down to sleep . But before I fell asleep I got to wondering if my dear wife would be able to get to know where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great worry to me for a long time after , and will come into my story later on . At last I fell asleep . We were roused early the next morning ( the 23rd ) when , after abit of cleaning , we smartened ourselves up a bit , as well as we could . I N however a few days before I managed to get all the mud and blood off my clothes . About 7 A . M. t hey brought . us some coffee , and another small bag of biscuits , and as one man of the Highland Light Infant ry did not get any , I gave him a half of mine . 11 is name is Wilson . Ile and I got to be ( limns , and he helped me a lot afterwards , as 1 was not able to do much for myself for a while . Then after coffee we were paraded outside , and they gave us one washhand-bowl between two men to eat ouu meals out of . Several of us drank t he coffee out of a sardine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a great deal of use to us , as we could drink the soup better without the spoon . If you had a knife of any sort on you , you had to give it up , for if they found one on you , you were severely punished . I had a very small penknife , one which my brother William gave to me before I left clear old England , and I wanted I to preserve it as a keepsake . I had managed to dodge five searchings , but the sixth time a German , a bit sharper than the others , found it in toy field-dressing pocket , and then he put his fist up to my face , and growled Swiner ' for not giving it up . I thanked my lucky stars he let it stop 1.1. that . After they had finished searching and issuing the utensils , they sent us back to our tunnels , where we were at liberty to talk among ourselves , with h two sentries with fixed bayonets walking amongst us . About 12 noon , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our men who were strong enough to carry it . The soup was very thin , but it was hot , and it helped to fill a vacant place in my little Mary , ' which was beginning to wonder if it had to keep going on wind and water . After soup ( I will not say dinner , as it would be an insult : to the name of dinner ) , we had nothing to do , so I had a sleep , which is the best ease for an empty stomach , as I found out by experience later 01/. 1 . woke up after about four hours ' good sleep , so I had not long to wait to see what the next meal was like . About I ) P.M. , 11 p came soup again , like that we had at dinner-time , and I may say there was a rush for it , as the boys were beginning to feel the pangs of hunger , which has a very sharp thorn , and I was very pleased to see my new-found chum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we drank it , and he had washed the bowl out , we all set to telling yarns , when there came word that We were going away early the following morning , and had to be in Lille station by about 5 A.M. before the townspeople were up . That set its all wondering where they were going to scud us , but we all dropped off to sleep , about as wise as before we started thinking . 11 We were roused about 3.30 A.M. , the 241.11 , and fell it ) on the parade-ground , and I should say that we were counted at least . a dozen 1 imes before they knew how many they had on parade . At last we got on the move , and reached the station about 5.30 A.M. ; then we were told off to our trucks and we were not long before we left Lille on our way to Bell , as we found out a few days after . It was the worst railway journey I ever had in all my life . The weather was very cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we crouched on the bottom of the truck , and made ourselves as comfortable as possible , and passed the time away by having a few songs and telling yarns of what we had seen and clone . About 3 P.M. we had a slice of bread and a drink of water . The names of the stations I can not remember , but at each station we stopped at , the doors of the trucks were opened so that the people on the platforms could see us , and then we would hear Swine ? , ' from the youngest to the oldest of them . We were on view like a lot of wild animals . We passed the night away shivering with the cold , and trying to have a snooze , but we could not sleep for the shaking of the train . The driver was well up in the way of giving you a good jolt now and again , and so on through the night and the next day ( Christmas day , the 25111 ) . What a Christmas day that was ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was having cake and jam-tarts , and fairly enjoying myself . I fancy I can see them now , as I write this , but , alas , I woke up with a start , the train having stopped with a sudden jerk , and set my arm on the go again . But the worst disappointment was , I could not see any cake or jam-tarts around . It was only a dream . After a short time on view , we set off again . About 10 P.M. the train stopped , when we were shunted onto a siding , where we had to get out , and then were marched into a shed with a lot of tables and forms in it . I began to wonder if my dream was coming true , for on some of the tables there were some small Christmas trees with a few bright things on them ; but I had no need to wonder long , for in they came with some soup for which I was very thankful , and then after soup we had some coffee and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our trucks again . I confess I felt a bit more comfortable in my little Mary after that feed . off we go again , all of its a little brighter . First one and then another would have a pull at a fag-end , as they were very scarce , and we passed the remainder of the night and up to about 1 P.M. the next day ( 26th ) , in talking and snoozing . We had given up wondering where they were taking us to . And we did not know until we got fo a station and we saw Klein Wittenberg  --  a hell on earth , as we found out . It was about 1 P.M. , December 26 , when we arrived . We were hustled out of the trucks and marched straight into the camp . It is close to the station , and as the trains run right along the top end of the camp , we were able to see the trains pass . We were that told off to our barrack-rooms in No. 1 compound . There were eight compounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two rooms to each Init . They are numbered A I , A II , It I , B II , and so on . I was sent to A II . We had 150 men in our room . They then issued us out a bowl and spoon , and then we had soup . I must say this soup was not as bad as the other ; it was the best basin of soup I ever did have from them whilst I was in Germany . After we had finished soup they gave us two blankets a man and two sacks with a bit of straw in between 3 and 4 men . Then we had lectures to tell us what we were to do , and not to do , and who we had to salute . But we did not know a sergeant from a private , and of course we made several mistakes as regards the saluting . We would sometimes salute a private and not a sergeant . Then he would come and give us a kick or a blow with his fist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh at us . So we thought it best to give them all a salute and be on the safe side . At 6 P.M. soup again , but we did not want our spoon this time , as you could read a copy of the Daily Mirror through a bucketful . It was nothing but hot water with a bit of grease floating on the top . After we had drunk it , we made our bed down on the floor , and got underneath the blankets , as it was practically dark at that time , and we only had one stable-lamp to light the whole room up for 1.50 men . Being very tired after our long and horrible journey , all of us were soon fast asleep . We were roused about 6 A.M. ( 27th ) , when we had coffee up , but we did not get any bread till about 9.30 A.M. And when we did get . it , I was not long before I had eaten mine , as 1 was so hungry . And I can safely say that the remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to to clean ourselves as well as we could . But it was hard work without any soap , and I could not wash myself very well with one hand , as it was so frosty . I never witnessed such a cold winter in all my life . Then we wounded had to attend hospital to have our wounds dressed . And 1 may say that I never had a ( Imp of warm water all through the winter to wash my wounds with , and I was not allowed to wash than in the barrack-room . We had about 150 yards or more to go to the tap and wash , and very often it was snowing , and the water almost froze as it ran out of the tap . Very often we could not walk about , as it was so slippery . I know I had several nasty falls myself , and I have had many a good laugh at some of the other chaps ' legs giving way under them . Our dinner that day consisted of sourkrout , which some of the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down after a hard struggle . I was so hungry I could have eaten a horse , and then gone back for the man that rode it . The smoking was very restricted too , as there were not so many of the boys who had any money . So we who had none had to get the fag-ends off them that had sonic . I had a little short pipe , and every morning , I and a chum , Private Lew , of the Highland Light Infantry , used to be on the hunt for fag-ends or anything that we could make a smoke out of . I had got separated from my Lille chum , as the wounded were put in one section , 15 of us , which was called No .5 section . ( The boys used to call us the crippled section . ) Lew 's right hand was wounded , and my left hand was useless through the wound in my arm , so the two of us made one pair of good hands . He would go down one side of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if we had been successful in our hunt. , we would put the fag-ends in the old pipe . Ile and I would then have a pull in our turns . But the cigarette-ends got the same as everything else , very scarce , ' for the boys who used to throw them down would put them in a little tin box and make them up afresh with a bit of paper . We had to look out for something else , so we saved the coffee-grounds and dried them . Then we found some peat. , so we used to mix the coffee and peat together , and get a draw that way . Sometimes we would drop in very lucky and conic across a good Samaritan who would give us a pull out . of his cigarette-end . I have seen as many as eight men have a draw out of a cigarette-end not half an inch long , and then the little bit of wet end would be put away to help towards making another . I can tell you that nothing whatever was wasted . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away before I was captured , and also some of the biscuits that were left in the trenches . But the coffee and peat got the same as the cigarette-ends , if you put a bit to dry . You would have to do guard over it , or else it would walk . So we had to find something else for a smoke , for a smoke we must have , no matter what . it was . I think the hunger must have had a great deal to do with the craving for a smoke , so as a last resort we used to get the bark off the posts around the camp and cut that up and smoke it . I do not know what we should have had to fly to next for a smoke if it had not been for the packages coming from dear old England and Switzerland . But they Cal/lea long time after we started to smoke the bark , and the posts were getting very bare before they came to our rescue , I have explained the smoking part , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder of the story , so you will have an idea what our mind-soother was before our parcels came . I will therefore get back to the afternoon of the 27th . The sick and wounded were allowed to lie down in the afternoon , so I passed the time away sleeping , and I can tell you I could sleep . I think I could have slept on a clothesline . At 6 P.M. we had tea up , in the way of a change , but it was so weak it had not the strength to run out of the ladle . It was the color of whiskey , so you may guess how they make tea in Germany ; but we drank it all the same . I began to wish that I had saved a bit of my bread from the morning , as my little Mary was troubling me a great deal . The front part was knocking at the back , but it got no answer up to 7 A.m. the next morning ; so after we drank the weasel water , we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.M. we had what they call porridge , but it was more like bird-seed and water . It would settle to the bottom , and when we had drunk the water off , there would be about two spoonsful of this seed at the bottom of our bowl . At 8 A.M. we would have to go to hospital , and we would be back about 9.30 , ready for the bit of bread which would weigh from 8 to 10 ounces , and the best part of that would consist of potatoes , and some of it used to be so sad ! You would have thought that it had had a fit through the night . It was like a lump of dough , just the same as if you had mixed sonic meal to feed the ducks with . It reminded me of the clays when may mother used to feed our ducks at home . When we had eaten it , it would lie on the bottom of our stomachs like a bag of cement . We were getting filthy with lice by then , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I did not have a wash with soap from the time I left Bethune on the 20th December , 1914 , until the 5th of March , 1915 , nor even a bath . And you may guess what we were like . I would have my shirt off for an hour in the morning , and an hour in the afternoon , and so you see the lice found us a bit of something to do . But I can tell you it was difficult work hunting lice and killing them , with one hand numb with the cold , and the other useless through the wound . It was like trying to catch a flea with a pair of boxing gloves on . But I managed to bag a few of the tormentors , and there were some big ones too . Some of them when you cracked them made so much noise that , some of the boys who heard them would say , ' Look out ! There 's another Jack Johnson gone off . ' It did not matter how much we cleaned our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . We would be rubbing and scratching ourselves nearly all the day and night through . After we had finished looking our shirts over , we would have a brisk walk up and down the room to warm ourselves up a bit .. This is where the muffler which the kind lady threw around my neck in Lille came in very useful . I would put the middle across my head and wrap the ends around my neck , but I was not long before I found themeans of getting a cap . I tore a bit off one of the ends of the blankets , and got one of the boys to make it into a cap for me , as he happened to have a needle . We got the cotton from the end of the blanket , which is sewn across to stop the ends from fraying . I am afraid a great many suffered in that way . If they ( the Germans ) had been sensible and given us some clothes to keep ourselves warm , their blankets would not have suffered as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits and even slippers out of them . When the cotton had run short from off the ends of the blankets , the towels came to the rescue . They would pull the strands oil ' one by one , and then twist two together to make it stronger . They were very clever fellows at making anything you could mention . They would make knives and scissors out of hoop-iron and large nails , and they would sharpen the spoon-handle so that it would shave you . I have had many a shave with one of them . The Germans would not allow us knives , so we had to put these out of sight . when they were knocking around . The men that were fit did all t he fatigues in camp . One day t hey did not . turn out sharp enough for t he Germans , so they stopped the bread for that day . They gave all the N.C.O. 's theirs , but we sick and wounded had to go without , the same as the remainder , so we were without , bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as they gave it to us . I have tried many a time to save a bit for my soup , but my little Mary was continually asking for it , so I could not refuse it while I had a hit left and down it went . We would be without bread practically every 23 or 24 hours . You see the soup that they gave us was not nourishing at all . I have gone as long as six weeks and never had a bit of meat . The only comfort we got out of the soup was that we would feel full as soon as we had drunk it , but an hour after we would feel worse than we did before we had it . I was always ready for the next issue five hours before it came up . I think the time was against us as well as the Germans , for every minute was like an hour and an hour like a day . I never felt time hang so heavy before . When I had been there a month , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to have a song on New Year 's eve , and the old carol was sung with a vengeance . ( " The Log was Burning Brightly ' sounded grand , but none of us felt very warm from the heat of it , as the stove fire had gone out early in the day . ) And another favorite song that night was , ' Oh where is my wandering boy to-night ? ' and then some one would shout out , ' In Wittenberg , d nigh frozen to death . ' So after we had finished our singing , we all turned in wondering what the new year would bring forth . III We started new year very well , as news came that we could write home and I can say that we all were very glad . So we wrote , and every one of us sent word for some bread and a few shillings to buy something to eat , as they had a canteen open at that , time . We all felt . a lot happier when we handed them in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about a month 's time , but we kern waiting and speculating and saying they might come next . week . But . never an answer came , and not likely ; because they never sent . them our cards and we were made to believe that they had sent ! um . I felt like giving way when I got to know , as I had been hoping and trusting that my wife and children had got my card telling them that I was all right , and I may say it made me 011 ' color for a long time after . Early in January , typhus broke out , and no wonder , for the condition we were in was terrible ; so the first thing they did was to close the canteen and the next thing was they left us to it . We could not see a German anywhere only well outside the wires . But they did not forget to torment us . They kept having an alarm . The sentries would blow a whistle , and we were supposed to be allowed ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were outside two minutes after the whistle blew there would be a shot sent after us , and if we looked through the door or window we would be shot . I remember when the alarm went the first time , we all fell in , in the middle of the room , and the color-sergeant , named Brisbane , of the Highland Light Infantry , went to open the window . But he had no sooner got to it when one of the sentries came up to the present to shoot him and he had to get back quick . We had heard several shots fired whilst we were fell in so we passed the remark that they were only firing blank ammunition to frighten us ; but . after we were allowed Ire go out again , we very soon found mil that it was ball instead of blank as Ak ? thought. , for one of the bullets had gone right through one of the rooms . I think they rather liked to see us running like a lot of rabbits to our burrows , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect it. ; then there would be a race for it , as I do not think any of us wanted to be shot like that . But am sorry to say some were , some fa ta 1-ly and some wounded . The men were beginning to go in hospital and dying very fast now . I have stood against the wires and seen as many as 15 being carried to their last . resting place , and the sentries laugh and jeer as the coffins went by . The same thing happened not only once bu many times . Things were beginning to look very serious for us , as the disease was spreading very rapidly , especially in our compound , No. 1 .. They would be carrying them away on tables at all times of the day . It mademe wonder if I should get it , for it is no joke standing there against the wires , with your eyes sunk right in your head and the skin of your stomach that loose that you could almost , wipe your nose with it , from starvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . I can tell you it was a great relief to us when those six brave English doctors came , as we were in a fine mess then . When they saw the condition we were in , it was a bit too much for one of them ; but when he could talk to us a bit he told us to cheer up and keep a. good heart , and that the Germans would shake hands with us before we left . that place ; and I can safely say his words came true for us who came to Switzerland . I am sorry to say that ( he poor fellow did not live to see it . Ile died with the disease about a month after he came to us . We had the misfortune to lose three of them in about five weeks , so it threw a lot of work on the shoulders of the three that were left ; and I am proud to say that t hey fought hard and won through , and I hope are having a good time in dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did for us . When our doctors got to work they were not long in making things hum . If you had the least signs of the disease about you , away you went , which ought ( o have been done before . I have known ( MU to lie in their rooms over a week before they were sent to hospital . They sent as many as thirty-six out of one room in a day . What would have happened in that room if our doctors had not come ? The biggest part of them would have died , but by catching them in time , before the disease had got proper hold of them , the most of them got over it , so not only myself have to thank them for being alive but a great many of the camp , both English , French and Russians and Belgians . They have earned all the praise and thanks they get and more besides , as it was far worse than being in the trenches . A German doctor got the Iron Cross for leaving us to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is padded up as if he were going to meet a mad dog . On the 28th of February there were sonic plum pudding and some dried grapes came , and was issued to us . Some got a bit and some did not . I was lucky , as I was one of four to share in a one-pound pudding and a few dried grapes , and there were also one pair of socks and a New Testament bet ween the four of us ; so we ' nit four pieces of paper into a cap , one marked socks , one marked testament , and two blank , and drew for them . My chum Lew got the socks and I got the test am ent Which I have now , and I have passed many an hour away reading it . On the 3rd March my chum wont as orderly to the sick in hospital , his hand having nicely healed up . My wound bad also healed up , but it had left my hand quite useless and painful , and it has never been free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my shin had not quite healed up then , and there were six great big sores in different places on my leg , but it was not long after I came out of t he hospital from having typhus before it was better and has never troubled me since . On the 1 , th I had severe pains in my head . I did not report sick as I thought it would be better after I had a sleep , but it was no better when I got . up . On the 5th I. had my first bat It , and a small bit of soft soap and sonic clean underclothing for the first time since I was captured . My head got , so bad that . on the morning of the 6th I reported it to the doctor , so he had a look at my ribs , then said , ' llospital , ' so I went with my blankets , and the first one I saw when I got , to hospital was my chum ( Lew ) . his greeting was , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I told him about my head . He then made me a bed on the floor . I got in and made myself COMfor table .

I did not know but that it was t he next morning , aft er I had gone into hospital , for I remembered the Frenchman dying and asked if they had taken him out . They were puzzled as to what I meant , so I began to think a bit , for I found myself in a wooden bed and in a fresh room with only English in , while the room that I went to sleep in had French and Russians as well . So one of the men that was getting better came over to me after the doctor had gone and explained a few things to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were trying to pull my leg , but I soon found out that it was all true , so I said I must have had a long sleep .

' When I had finished talking to him , I had another sleep , about two hours this time , and I felt a lot better after that . Then he came over to have another talk with me , and lie told me this time dial , my chum Lew was in bed with the typhus ; and there he was , fast asleep the same as I had been , and he laid just in front of me . The corporal injected sonic more stuff into my arm , and he told me that I had plenty of that whilst . I was asleep .

I had no sooner had two spoonsful of the soup when severe pains came across my stomach and I could not eat any more , so with a longing look at those two bits of meat I gave it away to the man that came to have a chat with me the clay before . After the pains left me I had stomach trouble had for five days . It then left site as sudden as it came , and it left 1110 very thin too . I do not , think I weighed more than five stone . I wanted then to be up and about , so I chanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got on my feet than clown I went between the two beds . I was then lifted back into bed again and told not to get out any more , but I wanted to be out of it ; I knew that if I kept lying in bed , my legs would get weaker instead of stronger ; so the next day I chanced it again . I took good care this time not to leave hold of the beds , and I managed to hobble alongside of the beds , and I very soon found my feet : again with a little practice . I crawled out of hospital on the first of April . I insisted on going out , as I hated to be in the place . When I got to the compound I was done up . There is a step about six inches high and for the life of me I could not got both my feet up , so a Russian came and lifted me into the room . I was very glad to be clown again . It was a good job I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been all up before I had come half way . One of the other men brought my blankets for me . There was snow on the ground then , and I just had my two blankets and an empty sack for a bed for nine clays before I got any straw to lie on , and there were some men who came out with me were even longer . And there I walked about like a drunken man for weeks , not caring whether I died or lived , I was so weak and weary .
