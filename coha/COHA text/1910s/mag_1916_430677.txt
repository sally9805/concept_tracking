Seldom does it fall to the lot of a reviewer to open a book upon which he finds it impossi-ble to bestow anything but unqualified praise , and such a rare experience tends to paralyze that critical faculty the exercise of which he has accustomed himself to regard as his distinctive privilege . It is therefore not without a sense of strangeness that we frankly abandon the customary attitude of criticism , and adopt that of grateful acceptance , inviting all who enjoy good things to share with us the pleasure and profit to be derived from the reading of The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent , " by Dr. John Erskine of Columbia University . The book takes its name from the first of the four essays of which it is composed , the other three bearing the titles , " The Call to Service , " " The Mind of Shakespere , " and Wonder and Magic in Literature . " Many readers of " The Hibbert Journal " will recall with pleasure the appearance in its pages , about two years ago , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the needs of an age that is conspicuous for its lack of forethought and its empirical habit of " muddling through , " must have struck many of its readers at that time . It excellent literary quality , too , was such as we do not expect and do not frequently find in magazine articles , and it is therefore with peculiar pleasure that we welcome its republication in book form , and the more so that it is re-enforced by three other papers of equal quality . A volume of " collected essays " can not usually be regarded homogeneously , or thought of otherwise than as what it is , an assemblage for convenience in publication of separate literary efforts . In these four articles , however , a distinct thread of connection is to be discovered , a unity of aim and purpose , a similarity of direction and a kinship of spirit which it is hard to describe . The connecting thread is the author 's conviction indicated in the title of the book that the duty lies upon men not only to acquire that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to bring the power of the understanding to bear upon all the problems of life . We shall probably be reminded that what we chiefly suffer , from in these days is over-intellectualism , and that the present reaction in speculative thinking toward intuitionalism and pragmatism is the inevitable consequence of having laid undue emphasis on the idea of mastering the 1 problems of ontology by the aid of the understanding . It may be true that in the region of pure speculation the instrument of reason has been used for a purpose to which it is unsuited , and that the effort to transcend the finite and comprehend the infinite by means of the intelligence alone is but another of those fruitless attempts to answer the old question stated by Job in the words , " Who shall find out the Almighty to perfection ? It is higher than Heaven , deeper than Hell , what canst thou know ? " But to recognize the limits beyond which the intellect , when it leaves the atmosphere of human experience , must attempt to soar in a vacuum , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is as a necessary part of our equipment for the art of practical living that Dr. Erskine lodges his claim for a deeper recognition of intelligence as among the cardinal virtues . It is undoubtedly true that our poets and writers of fiction , and those teachers and preachers on whom we have relied for guidance in the conduct of life , have not sufficiently emphasized the need for an intelligent apprehension of the causal relations of things . We have been warned by Solomon that " Out of the heart are the issues of life , " by Tennyson that " Knowledge must know her place , she is the second not the first , " by Browning that " All else but what man feels is but the froth o ' the liquor that o'er-brims the cup and runs to waste adown its side , " by Burns that " the heart 's aye the part aye that maks us richt or wrang . " It has been so hammered into our consciousness that to be good is better than to be clever , that the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here we must feel our way carefully . The universal conviction of the best of men that the rightness of the heart and the possession of those virtues that rightheartedness implies are of primary importance , must not be lightly put aside . A man may be full of errors of the head , his knowledge may be of the most limited description , and his reasoning powers those of a child ; yet if his heart is sound , his instincts pure , and his affections deep , we unhesitatingly ( and we believe rightly ) place him among the masters in the difficult art of living . To retain this conviction that character comes before intelligence , and yet to recognize the obligation that the possession of character imposes upon its possessor to develop his intelligence to the highest degree , ? this is the moral contained in the first essay of Dr. Erskine 's book . " He that sinneth against his understanding wrongeth his own soul . "  | Emmanuel Swedenborg , in his interpretation of the doctrine of the Trinity in terms of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents the primary force of the Universe , the ESSE of Being ; but that only when that Esse was incarnated in the form of Truth , Wisdom , or Intelligence , and became the EXISTERE of Being , could there have been generated an effluent force ( the Holy Ghost ) equal to the task of raising life from its low estate to that high one which " cloth not yet appear " but toward which we believe we are moving . This interpretation , it will be observed , gives Love the primary place among our conceptions of spiritual origins , but imposes upon Love the necessity of embodying or objectifying itself in Truth or Wisdom , ? the Word had to be made flesh and to dwell among men . In this way we would interpret Dr. Erskine 's warning . We are not merely to rest in the consciousness that the Eternal arms are around us , that we are being carried on a stream of tendency toward righteousness , that we are doomed to perfection by an irresistible evolutionary law ; but we must consciously become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to our faith virtue but to our virtue knowledge , we must acquire skill in the use of that instrument by which alone virtue can effectively express itself , ? Intelligence . We forfeit the right to justify our errors by the reflection that we have walked humbly according to our lights , if we have failed to inquire whether the light that is in us is not darkness . To " trust in God and do the right " is a useful working principle only if we have intelligently endeavored to discover what the " right " is . But Dr. Erskine 's charge against the old Anglo-Saxon way of viewing life is not merely the negative one of failing to realize the importance of intelligence , or to give it its place as among the cardinal virtues . He charges us , and not without reason , with having regarded the intellect with suspicion as a peril and a snare ; with having assumed that a choice must be made between goodness and intelligence ; " that stupidity is first cousin to moral conduct and cleverness the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , find proof of the justice of this charge in the constant dissociation of goodness and understanding that is reflected in our literature and social standards . Mephistopheles is invariably represented as the embodiment of pure intellect , while the biographies of saints and philanthropists are for the most part pictures of glowing souls radiating heat without light , feeling without understanding , emotion without intelligence . This over-emphasis upon character as against intelligence shows itself especially in our fruitless attempts to solve social problems by mere force of good will , ? problems in economics , for example , in which ( human welfare being the end aimed at ) it is assumed that kindly feeling and noble enthusiasm are the only instruments necessary for the solution . An attitude of kindly contempt expressing itself in such words as " doctrinaire " or " theorist " is maintained toward those who approach such problems from the side of the intellect , whose aim it is to attain to an understanding of fundamental things , and to deal with causes rather than symptoms . And it is strange , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of scientific principles that intelligence can discover ; to produce commodities cheaply we develop our inventive and creative powers to the highest degree ; but that in attempting to solve the great problem of human livingtogether in relations of justice and equity , we forget that here , too , active intelligence is the virtue which gives whatever value they possess to all those other virtues that have moved us to action . In Dr. Erskine 's Commencement address entitled " The Call to Service , " the same demand is made upon the student beginning his life 's career , to break away from the customary attitude which eager young minds so readily adopt in conceiving of the places they are called upon to fill in the economy of things , and to bring the whole force of the intelligence to bear upon the ultimate purpose for which he has been trained . Here , again , the appeal for a broader and more comprehensive conception of the ultimate goal toward which human culture strives , or should be striving , implies a draft upon the higher intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who are to be served constitute two separate classes whom God hath put asunder and whom man may not join without disrespect to the Divine Purpose . The attitude of mind in which those stand who are called to serve the world as preachers , scientists , or teachers , toward the great mass of somewhat unwilling recipients of those services , is of the most vital importance . If that attitude is wrong , as it is so likely to be , it can only be made right by an active use of the intelligence : by rising above personal enthusiasms and ambitions , however noble , and obtaining a glimpse of the ultimate end toward which the whole creation moves , as seen by a God who is no respecter of persons , but who loves the  | humblest day-drudge equally with the most gifted savant . The questions which Dr. Erskine addresses to his students are most well-timed , and we indulge the hope that in the attempt to find answers to them many of our young men may have had their reflective faculties aroused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as may change permanently the course they are to steer in the voyage to which every commencement address is a cheering send-off . It can do our future guides and philosophers nothing but good if they are impelled to such heart-searching as must be stimulated by the questions , " Do you hope to cure your neighbour 's misfortune or merely to live by it ? " " Do you look on the unfortunate as your brothers in temporary distress , or do you see in them objects of charity ? " " Do you think your function is to serve and their function to be served ; and if by a miracle they should get on their feet , would you have lost your career ? " Nor is the author less definite in his arraignment of the professors of Science and Teaching , or of those who propose to serve by making themselves the repositories of learning and wisdom . Not only , he indicates , should the ultimate purpose of a priesthood be to make a nation of priests , and to prepare the way for a condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be the conscious aim of all who serve , in whatever capacity . So long as the gulf separating the servers from the served is conceived of as being organic and in the nature of things , the service can never he of spiritual benefit to either giver or receiver . After warning his theological students of the delusion that " a system of superiorities and inferiorities is vital to the religious life , " or even that a certain superiority of consecration attaches to the office of priest , he addresses himself in similar words to his scientific students . " You , " he says , " can no more be scientific for your neighbors than you can be holy for them . Scientists are as eager to do our thinking for us as ever the Church has been ; they are just as ready to use force to make effective the truth as they see it , and they keep the scientific spirit to themselves as effectively as the priests keep their priesthood . " The third essay , " The Mind of Shakespere , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's excellent review ( in THE DIAL of Dec. 9 ) of Mr. J. P. Baxter 's book on the time-worn Bacon-Shakespeare controversy . From the account which the reviewer gives of the author 's tortuous attempts to deal with the apparent incongruity between the Shakespearean plays and the character and circumstances of their reputed creator , it is a pleasure to turn to Dr. Erskine 's essay , where the strange phenomenon which the mind of Shakespeare presents to the psychologist is discussed in a manner which does no violence to our sense of probability and accords with what we know of the constitution of the human mind . " Can we not imagine , " he asks , " a grown person with whom for the most part expression has remained an instantaneous reflex of experience , who sees true habitually as we less child-like folk do occasionally , and who speaks so spontaneously that he takes no account of his utterances ? " Here is suggested the idea of a sort of short-circuiting of the current which connects perception and expression , in which consciousness and intention are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediateness and accuracy of expression , " which are so conspicuous in the best of Shakespeare 's work , are certainly more explicable on this theory of direct connection between the perceptive and the expressive faculties , than where the surface-consciousness , as with ordinary mortals , must take a hand in the transaction . If this theory seems to make of the poet an unconscious automaton , Dr. Erskine accepts the risk of that conclusion with aboldness which we admire . In the fourth and last essay , Dr. Erskine reminds us that we have not yet so completely escaped from the dominion of superstition , and the child-like belief in magic and wonder , as we like to persuade ourselves . We have told ourselves so frequently that we now live in a world of cause and effect , and that the spirits with whom our fathers lived on terms of familiarity have been finally banished from the earth , that we firmly believe it . In spite of this , we exhibit the remains of our old faith in magic and miracle in many ways . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our intellectual selfrespect demands . We still blunder through life as though we did not know that the great game must be played according to rules . " We still believe , Micawber-like. in things " turning up . " We have not made the progress in the scientific habit of mind that the passing of the years and the amassing of experience ought to have produced . We still love to think that miracles happen , that uncaused good-luck befalls the virtuous though incompetent person , and the literary fiction that reflects the persistence of this primitive superstition still attracts us . And the difficulty is , as Dr. Erskine points out , that we can not , and should not if we could , entirely  | banish this ancient habit of mind . " If we love the poetry of life , there is a sense in which we can not get along without miracles ; without them as a language to talk with we can not express that profound wonder at common facts which is the sign of enlightened manhood . " The difficulty with most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is to that faculty of wonder which keeps the imagination alive , and yet to detect the thimble-rigging by which some of our writers would delude ua into the belief that the laws of consequence are occasionally out of action . The danger of falling under this delusion is finely indicated in the following passage : " We are convinced that to be a professional crook will lead to moral deterioration , but we read with pleasure these fables which keep the soul of the crook unspotted from his own conduct . Our pleasure is based on a fine humaneness , on the undoubted fact that criminals are largely manufactured , and that few of them are originally bad at heart . But this doctrine , excellent as a vantagepoint from which to enter upon some social responsibility and rescue , has been stretched in our fiction until it misrepresents the consequences of wrongdoing , and even diminishes strangely enough that sense of social responsibility from which it sprang . We felt to blame for letting our fellow-man become a criminal , but after the story or the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel less guilty . " Here , again , the moral contained in the title of this book returns to us , and we realize the imperative need for the constant watchful play of the intelligence upon all our mental and emotional processes . In the words quoted from Emerson , " The beginning of power is in the belief that things go not by luck but by law . "  |
