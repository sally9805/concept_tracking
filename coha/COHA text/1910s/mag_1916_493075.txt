. American " S THE Illinois Indians are said to have had no other name for themselves but Illinois , a word meaning men , " as if , " adds their historian , " they looked upon all other Indians as beasts . " Somewhat similar , I think , is the popular use among us of the indefinite term " Society , " society written with a capital and between quotation marks . In both cases there is an assumption of the supreme value of a group of persons or of activities . It is this paramount or egocentric society life , not life in society , I am to describe . Lacking a precise terminology I shall have to make use of such expressions as " society life , " " in society , " " society woman , " " society man . " These allocutions are of course merely short-cuts . The society man is as non-existent as the economic man of the past or as the German man we talk of to-day . Nor is the society life itself ever completely detached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the newspapers . I am to describe society life in its American setting . No modern community , I surmise , is as yet without a society life . There is no community but what gives ceremonial parties or prescribes ways of meeting , and in all such organized social contact or entertainment there are undoubtedly a sufficient number of principles of selection and of leadership to constitute within the group at large a society group . But differentiations in principles exist and in details the psychology of society groups varies . Hence London " Society , " " Society " in Rome , in Vienna , in New York . The society life of New York differs somewhat no doubt from that of Chicago , the society life of San Francisco differs from that of Philadelphia , but these differences I shall ignore and attend only to the common traits of society life in the United States . The foremost distinctive character of this society life is its composition , it appears to me , on the basis of effectual desire . The society group of any American community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the group , in society , to pay the entrance fee , so to speak , and the fees to sustain membership . By these fees I mean , of course , psychologic adaptations , not pecuniary contributions . Not that adaptations or performances costing money are not expected of those in society . Comparatively few persons can belong to society without having some source of revenue . Without means of their own they must be kept by some one -- by a father or a husband or a wife ? for their costs of getting about , of dress , of " paying back , " must be met . Now and then in the larger cities may be found a small class of men who get their living out of being in society , men who dine out for the sake of the dinner . But there are so many easier ways of earning a dinner than by making yourself agreeable at one that this society bread line is never long . At best the position of this type of diner-out is insecure . The society position of persons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also somewhat insecure . Unless they are exceptionally industrious from a society point of view , exceptionally available or useful , they are readily relegated to the group of persons whom one knows but who are not fashionable . An assured social position requires an assured and a comparatively large income . It requires too the spending of that income in certain conventional ways : a society woman or man must live up to her or his position . ' This does not mean necessarily expenditure for the direct amusement of others in society . Once at least a social position is secured , society people do not need to entertain , on any scale , either large or small , but spending in elaborate or conspicuous ways is expected of them . They are supposed to keep a yacht or a racing stable , to patronize the arts , to build a hospital or to found a university . It may be said , therefore , that conspicuous expenditure , or , to use Veblen 's term , conspicuous waste , is a desideratum if not a requisite of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the society life is more concerned with the processes of consumption than with those of production . Not that it is not economically advantageous to certain types of producers to be in society . For real-estate men , brokers of various kinds , for house decorators and certain architects , for portrait painters and drawing-room musicians it is good business to be in society ; their best customers are there . For other groups , for college presidents , let us say , or for lawyers , the advantage of being fashionable is not unmixed . College presidents and lawyers have to do with a large number of persons who are not only outside society but who never expect to get into it . When such persons form the bulk of one 's clientele , as in the case of physicians , of clergymen , of politicians , it may be a positive disadvantage to be reputed a society man ; an unfashionable patient or parishioner or voter may resent the classification . Even to be possessed of a fashionable wife , even to be in society thus vicariously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a dangerous indulgence for a doctor of medicine or divinity or for a statesman . On the whole , although there are persons in society who are economically on the make , although the element of business in " Society " contributes to its dulness , as Mr. Chapman long since pointed out , it is fair to state , I think , that " Society " does not gratify to any considerable extent economic desires , i. e. the desires of subsistence . Without a society life people would be as well off economically as with it , perhaps more so . Their consumption might be more in accordance with their personal comfort and tastes . In fact we sometimes see the desire to spend one 's income to suit oneself rather than to suit " Society " competing successfully against the desire to get into " Society " or to stay in " Society . " Living contrary to one 's tastes , the high cost of " Society , " is now and again rebelled against ? by men . What of the other primal human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to its gratification ? Society life appears to favor the sex desire even less than the desire for subsistence . " Society " sometimes functions as a marriage market , but it does not welcome lovers . That men and women fall in love in society is merely evidence that they can fall in love anywhere , that lovers know no obstacles . Prudent lovers , however , withdraw their love affairs from the society life as far as they can . According to circumstances they may be described as too domestic to want to go out or as afraid of scandal . A society man will carry on his love affairs not only outside of " Society " but even with women who do not belong to " Society . " A society woman for whom this meandering is more difficult may forego love-making altogether . I suppose that kind of negation is generally easier for a woman at any rate than for a man . A society woman is like the saloon keeper who does not drink ; she knows that to one in her position love-making has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself but to her position . So she eschews it . In philandering or in flirting she seeks a substitute a substitute not onlyinnocuous but in so far as it provides her with retainers a society asset . It is notable here as in other connections that the sexes play different riles in the society life . Women are the leaders , men their followers or their backers . Society means more to women , as we say , than to men . It appears to satisfy desire more fully in women than in men ? for women it satisfies the desire for achievement and the desire for prestige , i.e. , it gratifies ambition . Whether or not this is due merely to the reason that men have other means of gratifying ambition , more attractive means , I do not attempt to say . The fact is that men do satisfy their desires for achievement and for prestige in other ways . The fact is too that women who satisfy those desires in other ways are apt to lose or never to acquire " social " ambition . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of achievement . Staying in society as well as getting into it must be arduous and calling for enterprise and skill . The American society life answers these requirements . That art of conspicuous wasting it relies upon is in itself exigent . Other " social duties " are laborious , often exhausting . They require a kind of self-devotion which verges on asceticism . They appeal to the energetic and the self-denying spirit of the American woman . Take the ceremonial , for example , of leaving cards . Afternoon calling gives a woman , I believe , a quasi-mystical sense of acquiring merit . I remember driving one lovely spring afternoon in Washington with a lady who was leaving cards . She paid little or no attention to the charms of forsythia or maple-tree blossoms , but each of the twenty-five calls she made appeared to give her the kind of satisfaction a Catholic or a Buddhist takes in telling the beads on his rosary . The ceremonial of calling has reached its apogee , I suppose , in Washington . So has " dining-out . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " social calling , " affords women opportunities for self-exhaustion and for the concomitant feeling of accomplishment . That the strain of entertaining is severe we may infer not only from the run-down condition of the society woman at the close of the season but from the alacrity with which she sometimes goes to Europe or goes into mourning , her social responsibilities for the time being suspended by circumstance . She welcomes the chance of not " going out " without losing caste . The routine of dining-out and of elaborate consumption in general is fatiguing , but so is cotton-spinning . Possibly the life of the steeple-jack is as trying as that of the social climber . The " social caller " might be even more exhausted at the end of the afternoon had she been calling as an agent for a charity society . In other words an enterprising woman could find other jobs just as hard as paying calls or putting in an appearance or cultivating desirable acquaintances , jobs as hard if not harder . Arduousness is not the only charm , then , attaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties must be more than merely wearing . What other character must they have ? Obviously enough they must bring prestige . Prestige does attach to the society life . Why ? Because its activities are those of elaborate consumption , Mr. Veblen would tell us , and the ability to consume wastefully has always brought prestige , be the consumer an Indian rajah , a giver of potlaches on the Northwest Coast or a plutocrat in other parts of America . True , but in so far as not all lavish consumers are in society , in the United States at least , there must be another source of prestige besides wasteful consumption * attaching to the society life . This source , I take it , is exclusiveness . Exclusiveness is the greatest of all factors in making any group prestigeful ? exclusiveness makes royalty prestigeful to commoners , the church to laymen , men to women , elders to their juniors . It is upon its exclusiveness that the society life most depends for its charm and for its power . By keeping people out it makes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become willing to comply with the entrance conditions , entrance conditions first of a comparatively large circle and then of circles within circles . To he in society is one thing , to be in smart society is another thing . But in either case the entrance conditions are largely conformity to the standards set by those within , standards , as we have noted , of consumption , but also noneconomic standards in special modes of living , of dressing , of eating , of talking , of feeling and of thinking , and first and foremost standards of exclusiveness , i.e. of willingness to exact conformity of others . Obviously we are dealing here , are we not , with caste psychology , with a caste complex ? As in any caste in India or elsewhere , in " Society " conformity is required in matters of dress , of food ( eating in accredited places or having food served in accredited ways ) , in matters of shelter or of place of shelter ( living in fashionable streets or fashionable parts of town , going for the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of language , of occupation , and of mating . Conformity is as necessary in this American caste as in castes elsewhere , but between it and other castes there are two important distinctions . The first distinction is one that keeps us as a rule from recognizing this social classification as a caste at all . Since its membership is composed on a basis of effectual desire , as we have noted , made up of persons possessed of fitting desires and free from desires that might embarrass or complicate , the caste appears exempt from some of the more blatant forms of caste rigidity , from the rigidity of membership through birth , for example , or through family connection . In the same family can we not see one brother in society and another in the church or in the army , one sister the height of fashion and the other described as too serious or too literary or too artistic to enjoy going out , a decent paraphrase for her outcasting ? The second distinction about this particular American caste has to do with sex . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its men than from its women . I do not recall ever sitting at a dinner party next to a barber or dancing at a smart ball with a barkeeper , but on the whole occupation taboos are much lighter upon men in society than upon women . So are dress taboos . An unfashionably dressed man is put up with . So is a man who lives in a cheap lodging in an obscure street . So is a man who ordinarily uses correct English or occasionally eats in an unfashionable restaurant , or even in a fashionable restaurant with unfashionable friends . In women these offenses are hardly tolerated . For it is the women in society who are responsible ? not that the men are given greater freedom theoretically , they are merely more negligible . It matters less what they  - -  -  * If Veblen had been more attentive to American facts he would not have underestimated woman 's direct part in wasteful consumption . To him she is ever the vicarious consumer . In American life , at least , it is her will to power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by elaborate consumption . The average American woman wants to be in society , and she knows that the more elaborate her consumption the better chance she has to satisfy this social ambition . Is this not one clue , at least , to our high cost of living ? do . The society woman must live according to the rule she makes because she counts . For her , noblesse oblige . As for the men , there are no kings in American " Society " there are only queens . American " Society " is a gynocratic caste , a woman-controlled caste . for individual use .
