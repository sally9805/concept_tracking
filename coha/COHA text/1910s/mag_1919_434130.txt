Sums hosts of memories come tumbling in on me . Fifteen years ago , September 3 , 1903 , I met Carl Parker . He had just returned to college , two weeks late for the start of his senior year . There was much concern among his friends , for he had gone on a two-months ' hunting trip into the wilds of Idaho , and had planned to return in time for college . I met him his first afternoon in Berkeley . He was on the top of a step-ladder , helping to put up an awning for our sorority dance that evening , uttering his proverbial joyous hunter to anyone who came along . Thus he was introduced to me , a Freshman of two weeks . He called down gayly , ' How do you do , young lady ? ' Within a week we were fast friends , I looking up to him as a Freshman would to a Senior , and a Senior seven years older than herself at that . Within a month I remember deciding that if ever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else on earth ! After about two months he was calling one evening with his pictures of Idaho . Such a treat as my mountain-loving soul did have ! I have yet the map he drew that night , with the trails and camping places marked . And I said , innocence itself , ' I 'm going to Idaho on my honeymoon ! ' And he said , ' I 'm not going to marry till I finda girl who wants to go to Idaho on her honeymoon ! ' Then we both laughed . But the deciding event in his eyes was when we planned our first long walk in the Berkeley hills for a certain Saturday , November 29 , and that morning it rained . One of the tenets I was brought up on by my father was that bad weather was never an excuse for postponing anything ; no when Carl telephoned anon and said , ' Of course the walk is off , ' But why ? ' I asked . The rain ! ' he answered . ' As if that makes any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , all right , he 'd be around in a minute ; which he was , in his Idaho outfit , the lunch he had suggested being entirely responsible for bulging one pocket . Off we started in the rain , and such a day as we had ! We climbed Grizzly Peak , ? only we did not know it for the fog and rain , ? and just over the summit , in the shelter of a very drippy oak tree , we sat down for lunch . A fairly sanctified expression came over Carl 's face as he drew forth a rather damp and frayed-looking paper-bag ? as a king might look who uncovered the chest of his most precious court jewels before a courtier deemed worthy of that honor . And before my puzzled and somewhat doubtful eyes he spread his treasure ? jerked bear-meat , nothing but jerked bear-meat . I never had seen jerked anything , let alone tasted it . I was used to the conventional picnic sandwiches done up in waxed paper , plus a stuffed egg , fruit , and cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern , and here I gazed upon a mess of most unappetizing-looking , wrinkled , shrunken jerked bear-meat , the rain dropping down on it through the oak tree . I would have gasped if I had not caught the look of awe and reverence on Carl 's face as he gazed eagerly ? and with what respect ? on his offering . I merely took a hunk of what was supplied , set my teeth into it , and pulled . It was salty , very ? it looked queer , tasted queer , was queer . Yet that lunch ! We walked farther , sat now and then under other drippy trees , and at last decided we must slide home ? by that time soaked to the skin , and I minus the heel to one shoe . I had just got myself out of the bath and into dry clothes when the telephone rang . It was Carl . Could he come over to the house and spend the rest of the afternoon ? It was then about four-thirty . He came , and from then on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into the details of that Freshman year of mine ! I shall not go into detail ? only to say that the night of the Junior Prom of my Freshman year Carl Parker asked me to marry him , and two days later , up again in our hills , I said that I would . To think of that now ? to think of waiting two whole days to decide whether I would marry Carl Parker or not ! ! And for fourteen and a half years from the day I met him , there was never one small moment of misunderstanding , one day that was not happiness ? except when we were parted . Perhaps there are people who would consider it stupid , boresome , to live in such peace as that . All I can answer is that it was not stupid , it was not boresome ? oh , how far from it . In fact , in those early days we took our vow that the one thing we would never do was to let the world get common . place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be eager for the start of each new day . The Kipling poem we loved the most , for it was the spirit of both of us , was ' The Long Trail . ' You know the last of it : ? II After we decided to get married . and that as soon as ever we could , ? I being at the ripe and mature age of , as mentioned , a Freshman of just eighteen years , he a Senior , with no particular prospects , not even sure as yet what field he would go into , ? we cons. menced discussing what we might do and where we might go . Our main idea was to get as far away from everybody as we could and live the very fullest life we could , and at last we decided on Persia . Why Persia ? I can not recall the steps now that brought us to that conclusion . But I know that first Christmas I sent Carl my picture in a frilled high-school-graduation frock and a silk Persian flag tucked behind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we would never let our lives get stale , never lose the love of adventure , never ' settle down , ' intellectually at any rate . Can you see my father 's face that sunny March day , Charter Day it was , when we told him we were engaged ? My father being the conventional , traditional sort who had never let me have a real caller ' even , lest I become interested in boys and think of matrimony too young . Carl Parker was the first male person who was ever allowed at my home in the evening . He came seldom , since I was living in Berkeley most of the time , and anyway , we much preferred prowling all over our end of creation , servant-girl-and-pol iceman fashion . Also , when I married , according to father , it was to he someone , preferably an attorney of parts , about to become a judge , with a large bank-account . Instead , at eight-eon , I and this almost unknown , to him , Senior stood before him and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that general effect . And ? here is where I want you to think of the expression on my conservative father 's face . Fairly early in the conversation he found breath to say , ' And what , may I ask , are your pros-pects ? ' ' None , just at present . ' And where , may I ask , are you planning to begin this married career you seem to contemplate ? ' ' In Persia . ' Can you see my father ? ' Persia ? ' Yes , Persia . ' ' And what , for goodness ' sake , are you two going to do in Persia ? ' We do n't know just yet , of course , but we 'll find something . ' I can see my father 's point of view now , though I am not sure but that I shall prefer a son-in-law for our daughter who would contemplate absolute uncertainty in Persia in preference to an assured legal profession in Oakland , California , It was two years before my father became at all sympathetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a great joy to me to have him say , a few months before his death , ' You know , Cornelia , I want you to understand that , if I had had the world to pick from , I 'd have chosen Carl Parker for your husband . Your marriage is a constant source of satisfaction to me . ' Carl finished his Senior year , and a full year it was for him . He was editor of the Pelican , the University funny paper , editor of the University of California Magazine , the most serious publication on the campus outside the technical journals ; he made every ' honor ' organization there was to make ; he and a fellow student wrote the successful Senior Extravaganza ; he was a reader in economics and graduated with honors . And he saw me every single day . I feel like digressing here a moment to assail that old principle ? my fat her , along with countless others , held it so strongly ? that a fellow who is really worth while ought to know by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . A few with an early developed special aptitude do , but very few . Carl entered college in August , 1896 , in engineering , but after a term found that it had no further appeal for him . ' But a fellow ought to stick to a thing , whether he likes it or not ! ' If one must be dogmatic , then I say , ' A fellow should never work at anything he does not like . ' One of the things in our case which brought such constant criticism from relatives and friends was that we changed around so much . Thank God , we did ! It took Carl Parker until he was over thirty to find just the work he loved the most and in which his soul was content ? University work . And he was thirty-seven before he found just the phase of economic study that fired him to his full enthusiasm ? his loved field of the application of psychology to economics . And some would have had him stick to engineering just because he started engineering ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , and finally had to leave , going to Phoenix , Arizona , and then back to the Parker ranch at Vacaville for the better part of a year . The family was away during that time , and Carl ran the place alone . He returned to college in August , 1898 , deleted material About then Carl 's older brother , somewhat fastidious , ran into him in Spokane . Boyd tells of how Carl insisted he should spend the night at his room instead of going to a hotel . ' Is it far from here ? ' Oh , no ! ' So they started oat with Boyd 's suitcase and walked and walked through the ' darndest part of town you ever saw . ' Finally , after crossing untold railroad-tracks and ducking round sheds and through alleys , they came to a rooming-house that was ' a holy fright . ' ' It 's all right inside , ' Carl explained . When they reached Carl 's room , there was one not over-broad bed in the corner and a red head showing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother asked . ' Oh , a fellow I picked up some place . ' ' Where am I to sleep ? ' ' Right in here  --  the bed ' s plenty big enough for three ! ' And Boyd says , though it was 2 A.M. and miles from any place , he lit out of there as fast as he could move . Boyd adds , ' I do n't believe he even knew that red-headed guy 's name ! ' The reporting went rather lamely it seemed , however . The editor said it read amateurish , and he felt he would have to make a change . Carl made for some files where all the dailies were kept , and read and re-read the yellowest of the yellow . As luck would have it , that very night a big fire in a crowded apartment house broke out . It was not in Carl 's beat , but he decided to cover it anyhow . Along with the firemen he managed to get up on the roof ; he jumped here , he flew there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what an account he handed in ! The editor discarded entirely the story of the reporter sent to cover the fire , ran in Carl 's word for word , and raised him to twelve dollars a week . But just as the crown of reportorial success was lighting on his brow , his mother made it plain to him that shepreferred to have him return to college . He bought a ticket to Vacaville , ? it was just about Christmas , ? he also purchased a loaf of bread and a can of sardines , and with thirty cents in his pocket , he left for California , traveling in a day-coach all the way . I remember his story of how , about the end of the second day , he coldbloodedly cultivated a man opposite him who looked as if he could afford to eat , and of how the man ' came through ' and asked Carl if he would have dinner with him in the diner . The tale of what and how much Carl ordered and the expression and depression of the paying host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyhow ? never mind the host ! All his mining experience , plus the dark side of life as contrasted with society , as he saw them both in Spokane , turned his interests into the field of economics . And when he entered college the next spring , it was to ' major ' in that subject . May and June , 1903 , he worked underground in the coal-mines of Nanimo . In July he met Nay Moran in Idaho , for his second Idaho camping-trip , and it was on his return from this outing that I met him and ate his jerked meat and loved him and never stopped doing that for one second . III There were three boys and a girl in the Parker family . Each of the other brothers had been encouraged to see the world , and in turn Carl planned fourteen months in Europe after he should graduate , his serious object being , on his return , to act as Extension Secretary to ' Professor Stephens of the University of California , who was planning to organize Extension work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come a bit to our senses , and I had begun to realize that , since there was no money anyhow to marry on , and since I was so young , I had better stay on and graduate from college . Carl could have his trip to Europe and get an option , perhaps , on a tent in Persia . I stopped writing here to read through Carl 's European letters and laid out about seven I wanted to quote from : the accounts of three dinners at Sidney and Beatrice Webb 's in London ? what knowing them always meant to him ! They , perhaps , have forgotten him , but meeting the Webbs and Graham Wallas and that English group could be nothing but red-letter events to a young economic enthusiast one year out of college , studying Trade-Unionism in the London School of Economics . Then there was his South African trip . He was sent out by a London firm , to expert ' a mine near Johannesburg ? after he had cabled five times for it , said firm still sent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ? neither of us ever had much patience under such circumstances . But he exported his mine , and found it absolutely worthless ; explored the Veldt on a second-hand bicycle ; cooked little meals of bacon and mush roundabout wherever he found himself , and wrote to me . Meanwhile he learned much , studied the Coolie question , investigated mine-workings , was entertained by his old college mates , mining experts themselves , in Johannesburg . At last he borrowed money to get back to Europe , claiming that ' he had learned his lesson and learned it hard . ' About that time he wanted California with a fearful want , and was all done with foreign parts , and claimed that any place just big enough for two suited him ? it did not need to be as far away as Persia after all . And finally he came home as fast as ever he could reach Berkeley ? did not stop even to telegraph . I had planned for months a dress I knew he would love , to greet him in . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had started to retire , ? in the same room with a Freshman I was supposed to be ' rushing ' hard , ? when I heard a soft whistle , our whistle , under my window . My heart stopped beating . I just grabbed a raincoat and threw it over me , my hair down in a braid , and in the middle of a sentence to the astounded Freshman , I dashed out . My father had said , ' If neither of you changes your mind while Carl is away , I have no objection to your becoming engaged . ' In about ten minutes after his return we were engaged , on a bench up in the Deaf and Dumb Asylum grounds ? our favorite trysting-place . It would have been so foolish to have wasted a new dress on that night . I was clad in cloth of gold for all Carl knew or cared , or could see in the dark , for that matter . The deserted Freshman was sound asleep when I got back ? and joined another sorority . Thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lecturing on Trade-Unionism and South Africa . did not please him altogether , and finally my father , a lawyer himself , persuaded him to go into law . Carl Parker in law ! How we used to shudder at it afterwards , but it was just one more broadening experience he got out of life . Then came the San Francisco earthquake . That was the end of my junior year and we felt that we had to be married when I finished college ? nothing else mattered quite as much as that . So when an offer came out of a clear sky from Halsey &; Co. , for Carl to be a bond salesman on a salary that assured matrimony within a year , though in no affluence , the bottom being all out of the law business and no enthusiasm for it anyway , we held a consultation and decided for bonds and marriage . What a bond salesman Carl made ! Those who knew him knew what has been referred to as the magic of his personality , ' and could understand how he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner on his second visit . I somehow got through my senior ? ear , though goodness , how the days dragged ! for all I could think of was Carl , Carl , Carl , and getting married . Yet no one ? no one on this earth ? ever had the fun out of their engaged clays that we did when we were together . Carl used to say that the accumulated expense of courting me for almost four years came to $10.25 . He just guessed at $10.05 , though any cheap figure would have done . We just did not care about doing things that happened to cost money . We never did care in our lives , and never would have eared , no matter what our income might have been . Undoubtedly it was the main reason we were so blissful on such a small salary in university work ? we could never think at the time of anything much we were doing without . I remember the happiest Christmas we almost ever had was over in the country , when We spent under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clown to bed-rock that year , anyway . ( It was just after we paid off our European debt . ) Carl gave me a book ? The Pastor 's Wife ? and we gloated over it together all Christmas afternoon ! We gave each of the boys a ten-cent cap-pistol and five cents ' worth of caps ? they were in t heir Paradise . I mended three shirts of Carl 's that had been in my basket so long they were really like new to him , ? he 'd forgotten he owned them ! ? laundered them , and hung the trio , tied in tissue paper and red ribbon , on the tree . That was a Christmas ! We loved tramping always more than anything else , and just prowling around the streets arm-in-arm , ending perhaps 101,123-N0. 8 with an ice-cream soda . Not over costly , any of it . I have kept some little reminder of almost every spree we took in our four engaged years ? it is a book of sheer joy from cover to cover . Except always , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed almost impossible to say it . And then came the day when it did not have to be said each time ? that day of clays , September 7 , 1907 , when we were married . Idaho for our honeymoon had to be abandoned , as three weeks was the longest vacation period we could wring from a soulless bond-house . But not even Idaho could have brought us more joy than our seventyfive-mile trip up the Rogue River in Southern Oregon . We hired an old buckboard and two ancient , almost immobile , so-called horses ? and with provisions , gun , rods , and sleeping-bags , we started forth . The woods were in their autumn glory , the fish were biting , corn was ripe along the roadside , and apples , Rogue River apples , made red blotches under every tree . ' Help yourselves ! ' the farmers would sing out , or would not sing out . It was all one to us . I found , along with his every other accomplishment , that I had married an expert camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not even boil rice . The first night out on our trip , Carl said , ' You start the rice while I tend to the horses . ' He knew I could not cook ? I had planned to take a course in Domestic Science on graduation ; however , Carl preferred to marry me sooner inexperienced , than later experienced . But evidently he thought even a low-grade moron could boil rice . The bride of his heart did not know that rice swelled when it boiled . We were hungry , we would want lots of rice , so I put lots in . By the time Carl came back -I had partly cooked rice in every utensil we owned , including the coffeepot and the wash-basin . And still he loved me ! That honeymoon ! Lazy horses poking unprodded along an almost deserted mountain road , glimpses of the river lined with autumn reds and yellows , camp made toward evening in any spot that looked appealing , ? and all spots looked appealing , ? two fish-rods out , consultation as to flies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the river aways to try his luck , one down . Joyous reunion with much or little luck , but always enough for supper ? trout rolled in cornmeal and fried , corn on the cob garnered from a willing or unwilling farmer that afternoon , corn bread , the most luscious corn bread in the world , baked camper style by the man of the party , and red , red apples . Eaten by two people who had waited four years for just that . Evenings in a sandy nook by the river 's edge , watching the stars come out above the water . Adventures , such as losing Chocolada , the brown seventy-eight-year-old horse , and finding her up to her neck in a deep stream running through a grassy meaddow with perpendicular banks on either side . We walked miles till we found a farmer . With the aid of himself and his tools , plus a stout rope and a tree , in an afternoon 's time we dug and pulled and hauled and yanked Chocolada up and out on to dry land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient senile had just fallen in while drinking . And then , after three weeks , back to skirts and collars and civilization , and a continued honeymoon , from Medford , Oregon , to Seattle , Washington , doing all the country banks en route . In Portland we had to be separated for one whole day ? it seemed nothing short of harrowing . Then came Seattle and house-hunting . We had one hundred dollars a month to live on , and every apartment we looked at rented for from sixty dol lars up , until in despair we took two wee rooms , a weer kitchen and bath , for forty dollars . It was just before the panic in 1907 and rents were exorbitant . And from having seventy-five dollars a month spending money before I was married , I jumped to keeping two of us on sixty dollars , which was what was left after the rent was paid . I am not rationalizing when I say I am glad that we did not have a cent more . It was a real sporting event to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saved a dollar or so , just to show we could . Seattle was quite given to food fairs in those days , and we kept a weather eye out for such . We would eat no lunch . make for the Food Show about three , and nibble at samples all afternoon , coming home well-fed about eight , having bought enough necessities here and there so that our consciences did not hurt . Much of the time Carl had to be on the road selling bonds ? we almost grieved our hearts out over that . In fact we got desperate , and when Carl was offered an assistant cashiership in a bank in Ellensburg , . Washington , we were just about to accept it when the panic came and the cry was all for retrenchment in banks . Then we planned farming , planned it with determination . They were too awful ? those good-byes . Each got worse and harder than the last . We had divine days in between , to be sure , when we ' d prowl out into the woods around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water-front , ending at a counter we knew which produced , ? or the man behind it produced ? delectable and cheap clubhouse sandwiches . Bond business and business conditions generally in the Northwest got worse and worse . In March , after six months of Seattle , we were recalled to the San Francisco office . Business results were better , Carl 's salary was considerably raised , but there were still separations . On July 3 , the Marvelous Son was born , and never was there such a father . Even the trained nurse , hardened to new fathers by years of experience , admitted she never had seen anyone take parenthood quite so hard . Those were magic days ? three of us in the family instead of two , and separations harder than ever . Once in all the ten and a half years we were married I saw Carl Parker downright discouraged over his own affairs , and that was the day I met him down town in Oakland and he announced that he could not stand the bond business any longer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , leaving the boy and me was just not worth the whole financial world put together . Since his European experience ? meeting the Webbs and their kind ? he had a hankering for university work , but he felt the money return so small that he just could not contemplate raising a family on it . But now we were desperate . We longed for a life that would give as the maximum chance to be together . Cold-bloodedly we decided that university work would give us that opportunity and the long vacations would give us our mountains . The work itself did make its strong appeal , too . Professor Henry Morse Stephens and Professor Miller of the University of California had long urged Carl to go into teaching ; and at last we decided that if it meant living on husks and skimmed milk all our days , at least we would be eating what there was to eat together , three meals a day every day . We cashed in our savings , we drew on everything there was to draw on , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Harvard ? with fifty-six dollars and seventy-five cents excess-baggage to pay at the depot , such young ignoramuses we were . That trip east was worth any future hardship we might have reaped . Our seven-months-old baby was one of the young saints of the world ? not once in the five days did he peep . We owned the world . And I , who had never been farther from my California home town than Seattle , who never had seen real snow , except our first married Christmas in the Northwest , when we spent four days in the Scenic Hot Springs in the Cascades and skied and sledded and spilled around like six-year-olds ! But stretches and stretches of snow ! And then just travelling , and together ! And then , to be in Boston ! We took a room with a bath in the Copley Square Hotel . The first evening we arrived , Nandy ( Carleton , Jr. ) rolled off the bed ; so when we went gallivanting about Boston shopping for the new home , we left him in the bathtub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with pillows , there was a big window letting in plenty of fresh air , we instructed the chambermaid to peep at him now and then , and there we would leave him , well-nourished and asleep . ( By the time that story had been passed around by enough people in the home town it developed that one day the baby - just seven months old , remember ? got up and turned on the water and was found by the chambermaid sinking for the third time . ) Something happened to the draft from the home bank that should have reached Boston almost at the same time we did . We gazed into the family pocketbook one fine morning , to find it , to all intents and purposes , practically empty . Hurried meeting of the finance committee . By unanimous consent of all present we decided ? as many another mortal in a strange town has decided ? on the pawn-shop . I wonder if my dear grandmother will read this ? she probably will . Carl first submitted his gold watch ? the baby had dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of the pawn-shop man , though not in ours . The only other valuable we had along with us was my grandmother 's wedding present to me , which had been my grandfather 's wedding present to her ? a glorious old-fashioned breast-pin . We were allowed fifty dollars on it , which saved the day : What will my grandmother ever say when she knows that her bridal gift resided for some days in a Boston pawn-shop ! We moved out to Cambridge in due time and settled at Bromley Court , on the very edge of the Yard . We thrilled to all of it ? we drank in every ounce of dignity and tradition the place afforded , and our wild Western souls exulted . We knew no one when we reached Boston , but our first Sunday we were invited to dinner in Cambridge by two people who were ever after our cordial , faithful friends , Mr. and Mrs. John Graham Brooks . They made us feel at once that Cambridge was not the socially icy place it is painted in song and story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wash strung on an improvised our back and forth from one end of our apartment to the other . Just as I hung the last clamp garment , the bell rang and there stood an immaculate gentleman in a cutaway and silk hat who had come to call ? an old friend of my mother 's . He ducked under wet clothes , and we set two chairs where we could see each other , and yet nothing was dripping down either of our necks , and there we conversed and he ended by inviting us both to dinner ? on Marlborough Street at that ! His house on Marlborough Street ! We boldly and excitedly figured up on the way home from it that that one meal had cost more than it cost us to live for two weeks ? it honestly did . We did our own work , of course , and we lived on next to nothing . I wonder now how we kept so well that year . Of course , we fed the baby everything he should have , ? according to Holt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his broth and the beef after the juice had been squeezed out of it for him , and bought storage eggs for ourselves , and queer butter out of a barrel , and were absolutely , absolutely blissful . Perhaps we should have spent more on food and less on baseball . I am glad we did not . Almost every Saturday afternoon that first semester we fared forth early , Nandy in his go-cart , to get a seat in the front row of the baseball grandstand . I remember one Saturday we were late , front seats all taken . We had to pack baby and go-cart more than halfway up to the top . There we barricaded him , still in the go-cart , in the middle of the aisle . Along about the seventh inning , the game waxed particularly exciting ? we were beside ourselves with enthusiasm . Fellow onlookers seemed even more excited  - -  they called out things ? they seemed to be calling in our direction . Fine parents we were : there was Nandy , go-can and all , bumpety-bumping down the grandstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the big track meet . Every time the official announcer would put the megaphone to his mouth to call out winners and time to a hushed and eager throng , Nandy , not yet a year old , would begin to squeal at the top of his lungs , for joy . Nobody could hear a word the official said . We were as distressed as anyone ; we , too , had pencils poised to jot down records . Carl studied very hard . The first few weeks , until we got used to the new wonder of things , he used to run home from college whenever he had a spare minute . At that time he was rather preparing to go into Transportation as his main economic subject ; but by the end of the year he knew Labor would be his love . ( His first published economic article was a short one that appeared in the Quarterly Journal of Economics for May , 1910 , on ' The Decline of Trade-Union Membership . ' We had a tragic summer . Carl felt that he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . Three terrible , wicked , unforgivable professors assured him that if he could be in Germany six weeks during summer vacation , he could get enough German to pass the examination for the A.M. We believed them , and he went , though of all the partings we ever had , that was the very worst . Almost at the last he just could not go ? but we were so sure that it would solve the whole A.M. problem . He went third class on a German steamer , since we had money for nothing better . Oh , the misery of that summer ! We never talked about it much . He went to Freiburg , to a German cobbler 's family , but later changed , since the cobbler 's son looked upon him as a provision of Providence sent to practise his English upon . His heart was breaking and mine was breaking , and he was working , working at German ( and languages came fearfully hard for him ) , morning , afternoon , and night , with two lessons a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a cake of soap and a towel , to a secluded waterfall he discovered . He wrote a letter and a post-card a day to the babe and me . I have just re-read all of them , and my heart aches afresh for the homesickness that summer meant to both of us . He got back two days before our wedding anniversary ? days like those first few after our reunion are not given to many mortals . I would say no one had ever tasted such joy . The baby gurgled about and was kissed within an inch of his life . About six weeks later we called our beloved Dr. J ? from a banquet he had long looked forward to , in order to officiate at the birth of our second , known as Thomas-Elizabeth up to October 17 , but from about ten-thirty that night as James Stratton Parker . We named him after my grandfather , for the simple reason that we liked the name Jim . How we chuckled when my father 's congratulatory telegram came , in which he claimed pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautioned us never to allow him to be nicknamed . I remember the boresome youth who used to call week in week out , ? always just before a meal , ? and we were so hard up and got so we resented feeding such an impossible person so many times . He dropped in at noon Friday the 17th for lunch . A few days later Carl met him on the street and announced rapturously the arrival of the new son . The impossible person hemmed and stammered , ' Why ? er , when did it arrive ? ' Carl , all beams , replied , The very evening of the day you were at our house for lunch ! ' Wenever laid eyes on that man again ! We were almost four months longer in Cambridge , but never did he set foot inside our apartment . Wish someone could have psycho-analysed him ? too late now . He died about a year after we left Cambridge . I always felt he never did get over the shock of having escaped Jim 's arrival by such a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J ? . He was recommended as the best doctor in Cambridge , but very expensive . Carl said , ' We may have to economize in everything on earth but we 'll never economize on doctors . ' So we had Dr. J , had him for all the minor upsets families need doctors for , had him when Jim was born , had him through a queer fever Nandy developed that lasted some time , had him through a bad case of grippe I got ( it was at Christmas-time ; Carl took care of both babies , did all the cooking , ? even to the Christmas turkey I was well enough to eat by then , ? got up every two hours for three nights to change an ice-pack I had to have ? that ' s the kind of man he was ! ) , had him vaccinate both young , and then , just before we left Cambridge , we sat and held his bill , scared to open the envelope . At length we gathered our courage and gazed upon charges of sixty-five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we would be inconvenienced in paying that , he would not mind at all if he got nothing . Such excitement ? we had expected two hundred dollars at the least ! We tore out and bought ten cents ' worth of doughnuts , to celebrate . When we exclaimed to him over his goodness , ? of course , we paid the sixty-five dollars , ? all he said was , ' Do you think a doctor is blind ? And does a man go steerage to Europe if he has a lot of money in the bank ? ' Bless that doctor 's heart ! Bless all doctors ' hearts ! When we left for Harvard we had an idea that perhaps one year of graduate work would be sufficient . Naturally , about two months was enough to show us that one year would get us no place . Could we finance an added year at , perhaps , Wisconsin ? And then , in November , Professor Miller of Berkeley called to talk things over with Carl . Anon he mentioned , more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a year 's study in Germany , ' and proceeded to enlarge on that idea . We sal dumb , and the minute the door was closed after him , we flopped . ' What was the man thinking of ? to suggest a year in Germany when we have no money and two babies , one not a year and a half and one six weeks old ! ' Preposterous . That was Saturday afternoon . By Monday morning we had decided we would go ! Thereupon we wrote West to finance the plan , and got beautifully sat upon for our notions . ' If we needed money , we had better give up this whole fool University idea and get a decent man-sized job . And then we wrote my father , ? or rather I wrote him without telling Carl till after the letter was mailed , ? and bless his heart ! he replied by a fat God-blessyou-my-children registered letter , with check inclosed , agreeing to my stipulation that it should be a six-per-cent business affair . Suppose we could not have raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience ! Bless fathers ! They may scold and fuss at romance and have good sensible ideas of their own ' on such matters , but ? bless fathers !
