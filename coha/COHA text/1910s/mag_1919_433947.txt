JESSIE LEE aus , the writer of the letters from which the following excerpts are taken , is the wife of Dr. Wilder Prince Ellis , a missionary physician in the American hospital at Urumia , Persia . A little over three years ago the young couple , then only a short time married , managed to reach their station in Persia . There they were associated with a group of medical and teaching missionaries who , with their predecessors on the ground , have strongly influenced the life of West Persia for more than two generations . In addition to the well-equipped hospital , there is , or was , a college , and there are also an orphanage and other centres of work in the city and on the Urumia plain . From the very beginning of the war , all the elements of disaster were present . The native population is part Moslem and part Christian ? Persians and Syrians . From the western edge of the Urumia plain rise the rugged mountains of Kurdistan , from which have issued , even in peace-times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not subject to any constituted authority , the conflict gave them their supreme opportunity for brigandage with all its attendant horrors . Further , this western arm of Persia lay directly in the path of the contending Russian and Turkish armies . Three times the tides of war swept back and forth over the Urumia plain . The waves of the conflict broke all about the wallsof the hospital compound ; but for some reason it was never submerged until those fateful days of July and August , 1918 . In the midst of battle , murder , rapine , pestilence , and famine , this group of American missionaries all stuck to their posts . For four long years , with hardly a scrap of news from home and only rumors of how the Great War was going , they continued steadfastly caring for the sick and wounded , friend and foe alike , feeding the hungry out of their scant stores , and furnishing a refuge in their compound , now for the Syrians from the Moslems , and again for the Moslems from the Syrians , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , with their tragic record of heroism and devotion , is yet to come . Mrs. Ellis 's letters constitute a fragment of the little that has filtered through . Her story begins on that memorable day in July , 1918 , when a daring English aviator of the British forces far to the south of them landed in their midst . THE aeroplane visited us on July eighth . The fourth of July had been a fearful day , and we felt impending disaster , with bad news from all around . Suddenly , one morning about seven o'clock , like a white-winged messenger from heaven , that aeroplane dropped down among us and brought us the first news from the outside world in months . Can I ever describe to you the thrilling sight as that daring English airman swooped in his machine down among the hospital sycamores , after circling over Urumia ! Shots had rung out from the city and from the neighboring hills , for the Syrians had thought it an enemy plane at first . But , when we saw the flag of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy , and like a great wave rose the shouts and cheers of the people . When the plane lighted , the aviator was worshiped like a god ; his feet and hands were kissed for very joy . I do not suppose that in these clays there was ever a more worshipful reception than these poor beleaguered people gave that young hero . Later in the day he was brought to the hospital compound ; and when he reached our home , we heard of his plans for the Syrians and something of what the world was doing in the war . We were greatly cheered , for we had heard nothing but terrible tales of murder , and seen nothing but rape and bloodshed and robbery , with starvation stalking at our doors . Things at that time seemed unbearable . We thought they could not go on that way , and they did not ? they just got steadily worse . The expected succor from the south did not come , because of the failure of our own Syrian armies to meet their agreements . Meanwhile , pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can never adequately describe the little I saw of it . We retired at ten o'clock of the night of July 30 . Dr. Packard called through our bedroom windows at two o'clock the next morning that he wanted to speak to us . We slipped into dressing-gowns and coats , and were soon assembled in the Packard parlor . In our house at that time were Miss Lamme , Miss Schoebel , Miss Burgess , Dr. Dodd , and Mr. and Mrs. Richards . After a brief conference , we decided the momentous question and determined not to flee . Indeed , it was impossible for us to do so . Our boy Edwin was sick , our carriage was very old , and our horse aged twenty ! and I was scarcely able to walk after my recent operation . Then , too , we did not want to be mixed up with an assortment of cutthroats and robbers such as made up a part of the Syrian army . At daybreak , Dr. Packard , Dr. Ellis , and Mr. Richards went into the city to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monies for Dr. Shedd to carry , and help him to get off . I did not see Wilder until the next day . Those early morning hours witnessed the removal of the Syrian nation from their homes ? many of them , alas ! never to return . It was a pathetic sight to see the ox-carts , donkeys , Red Cross wagons of the Russians , and every conceivable kind of vehicle , bearing away our native friends . The little children were on donkeys or on foot . Slowly the creaking wagons , some drawn by oxen , moved out . What took place in our yards was of course not a circumstance to what was to be seen on the roads . About half-past nine , from the neighboring hills , shots and wild noises began . Prom the roof , with Edwin in my arms , I listened , but could not believe that things were to happen so soon . By the time I got downstairs , Dr. Dodd and Miss Schoebel were desperately engaged in making a Turkish flag to hang with our American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shots and noises increased . Past our compound gate rushed wild horses , with mad Kurdish riders . Shots rang over our heads and whizzed through our great trees . The poor frightened children , and the infirm , the old , the helpless , and the servants , ? in all a company of two hundred , who had come to our yards for protection , ? began to run into our houses . Some crowded into the parlor where I stood , and clung to my knees beseeching me to save them . You can never know the awful terror these people experienced . They know too well the frightful cruelty that will be meted out to them ; at the mention of a Turk or a Kurd they are pallid and shaking , and fall on their knees before their torturers , imploring mercy . A few minutes later , ? I do n't know how it happened , ? our family found themselves all together in the parlor . Mr. Richards and Dr. Dodd had had a terrible experience with the Kurds and had nearly lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I had finished bathing and nursing little Paul , there came a mad rush up our kitchen stairs . The door between the kitchen and dining-room was bolted , but it was burst in with blows before Dr. Dodd and Mr. Richards could open it . In rushed three wild Kurds , armed , and the most terrifying men I have ever seen , with fringed turbans surmounting faces as black and evil as could be imagined . They were filled with lust and madness and came in pell-mell with guns drawn , shouting ' Pool ! pool ! ' ( money ) . We showed them the room where Wilder 's treasury safes ( recently brought from the city in an attempt to save the money ) stood , and in they rushed . I shall always be thankful that Wilder was kept in the city that morning , for I fear he might have resisted the attack , and in that event he would certainly have been killed . We in the other room heard the shots and shouts and pounding , and wondered what was happening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the keys , the Kurds attempted to blow open the safes by shooting into the keyholes . In the meantime those who were busy breaking open and looting Wilder 's desk turned over the safe-keys without recognizing them . Three times these men rushed out upon us and , leveling their guns , demanded our jewels and money . Each time , as we looked down the gun-barrel , we were sure our last hour had come . When we held out our hands and proceeded to give them our watches , rings , and so forth , and then said we had no money , they insisted on searching for it . It was horrible , but the perfect calm with which their handling was received I think amazed them , for they are in the habit of seeing women fall before them in an agony of terror . I shall never forget Miss Schoebel 's face as a vile Kurd ran his hand into her bosom . She did not flinch , nor did the expression of calm leave her face ; but she stood her ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul was asleep in my arms , but little sick Edwin , who was being held by Miss Lamme , clung to her terrified when the shots were thickest . The Kurds demanded my rings . I wore three ? the little Utah turquoise that guarded my wedding-ring , and a little gold band that had been Wilder 's mother 's . I took off the turquoise , and then they asked for the other ; but just at this minute Dr. Dodd began frantically to direct their attention to his cufflinks , in order to save me from such a loss . For the time they forgot me , and in the few moments that elapsed I drew off my wedding-ring , and , as I was standing near a big pot containing a lemon tree ( my anniversary present from my husband ) , I pressed the ring down into the soft earth . Three days later , all danger for the time being over , I unearthed it . The Kurds then proceeded to smash up our sixty-dollar typewriter , and would have broken my desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown them how to get into it . They ripped the rugs off the couch and some deleted material CAN THESE pouring money before them . The Kurds tried to take Miss Burgess , but she was hastily escorted over the roof to safety by Tamar , the faithful Kurdish servant of the Packards . The rest of the day was one of great strain , for our protection was in the hands of enemies and we knew not at what moment they might choose to turn upon us . Our ragged crew was well filled from our board at dinner-time . We stayed closely huddled together in the parlor all that day , and did not even venture into the dining-room for dinner . Outside , the shooting continued irregularly , but was often so close that I heard the singing of the bullets outside my window . Finally I moved Edwin 's bed to the other end of the house , into the room occupied by Dr. Dodd , and there my little boy dropped off to sleep . That night I talked with Wilder over the telephone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my little ones with a steadier heart , but we had rather a restless night . Miss Lamme stayed with me , and I do n't think we slept one wink . We could hear the constant cry of the guards , ' Kim galur ? ' ( Who comes ? ) and in the morning learned that a Kurd had tried to enter one of our downstairs doors and was caught . How good the next morning 's light was ! I had another little telephone talk with Wilder , and the day wore on . The thing that haunted me was that Wilder and Dr. Packard might be held for ransom and not allowed to come home . Late that afternoon , however , they arrived ; and though at first the escorting officer would not say whether they could remain , they were finally allowed to . II All the busy activity that Wilder had had for months now came sudden- // ly to an end , and it was very hard for him . For about two months he had carried on both hospital and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversight of about one hundred and fifty wounded Syrians and managing an immense treasury business . Now , in an instant , all that was over . He could no longer ride in each morning to the city to business , but instead , we all sat quietly at home . The horses and cows had been taken , and the carriages too . I really thought I could not bear it when they took the cows , for to buy the dirty stuff that the Moslems called milk was unthinkable . I remember how I paced up and down the lawn with poor little sick , weak Edwin in my arms , and my heart was filled with anguish . But the Lord was truly caring for us . We had brought some condensed milk from the hospital before the occupation , and we secretly got the rest ? Mrs. Cochran so managing it that the marauders did not get the keys to the supply cellar where the milk was kept . We had got it from the one-time Russian hospital . It saved the day , I truly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some two-thirds-water stuff carried on a Jew 's back in an earthen jar through the dust and dirt clear from the city . Edwin was so emaciated that we greatly feared for him . We could not get him to eat the things that he should , and he cried for bussra ( Syriac for meat ) and for toast . It truly hurts me now to write of the agony of those days . In the meantime , Mrs. Cochran and Miss Burgess were asked to vacate their rooms in the hospital , and we invited Mrs. Cochran to take our bedroom downstairs , which had a big balcony opening from it . We moved upstairs to the ballakanna , as they call it . Miss Burgess went in with the ladies in a large room that Dr. Dodd had occupied all summer , and he took the front balcony for his sleeping quarters and used a small back room near the kitchen for his bedroom . The Richards had the other ballakanna room upstairs , and with servants and dependents numbering about twenty , we sandwiched ourselves in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the yard , they would hide themselves in our closets and pantries and lie hidden often for several days . It was truly nauseating to open one 's pantry of a morning and find a whole family of six or seven , with their dirty quilts and clothes , the air so awful that one could cut it , and all huddled on the floor round the cupboards where the food was kept . It nearly finished what little appetite I had left . And yet you can not imagine how hard it was to say , You can not stay here ' ; for the poor frightened people were in real danger of being taken . Our roof was a veritable village ; all sorts of operations went on there for weeks . Children died on our balcony and languished at our doors ; a large number died on our back lawn , and there was no place one could step where one did not see the sick , the dying , the sorrowing , and the starving . We stood it all pretty well until our servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , for they lay everywhere and there was no place I could take the children except Dr. Coan 's garden . But , in spite of all the tragedy that was about us , our big family was really a happy one , and for people of so many varied tastes and dispositions we got along famously and made the most of every occasion for a little fun . If we had not done so , we could not have stood the strain . Miss Sehoebel , Mrs. Richards , and I took turns at housekeeping , and it was some family to prepare for ! It was a fortunate thing that we had had enough faith to plant our gardens in the spring ; for after the occupation we might have been put to serious straits from lack of food . I must not forget to tell you of the Orphanage tragedy . One afternoon , three days after the Turkish occupation , as I was wheeling Edwin down the avenue in his go-cart , I noticed a strangely familiar group approaching . As I got nearer , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orphanage . Walking a little unsteadily , and resembling little the happy woman who had been with us the previous Sunday , was Mrs. Pflaumer . Beside her was Miss Bridges , for whom Mr. Pflaumer had laid down his life . They wore no hats , for little was left them save life . Scarfs had been given them by some Persians . Mrs. Pflaumer 's face was haggard and drawn , a look of helpless anguish was in her eyes , though she was outwardly calm ; Miss Bridges 's face was bruised and purple . Clinging to their skirts and in their arms were the little ones , who , homeless like themselves , were seeking safety . A Red Crescent officer came out of the hospital , demanding to know who they were ; and slowly and painfully , yet with infinite fortitude , those two brave women told their story . I listened with growing pity and amazement , and found myself choked and weeping , for never was a more tragic tale wrung from human hearts . It seems that , on the day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was visited by Kurds and Turks , who looted and carried off all the possessions of the inmates . The Kurds killed a number of the children , then decided that Miss Bridges , who was young and good to look upon , was desirable as a wife , and proceeded to kidnap her . Mr. and Mrs. Pflaumer at once sprang to the rescue , and clung with a grip that was not relinquished till death took Mr. Pflaumer . Stripped of most of his clothing and bruised by blows from the brutal foot of a Turkish officer , he had clung to the end , undaunted , and had been cruelly shot when he refused to let go . The Kurd then took Miss Bridges and placed her on his horse outside the gate . But the Lord 's hand spared a greater calamity than death ; for about this time some Turkish officers arrived , saw what was going on , and ordered the Kurd to relinquish her . Mrs. Pflaumer and Miss Bridges were then taken to a camp across the river , where they were treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city . Here they were kept for three days , and at the end of that time brought to us . The summer moved along . About the time Edwin began to mend , the rest of us became ill . Everyone in the yard took sick , either with typhus , smallpox , dysentery , typhoid , or malaria , and finally with a terrible kind of influenza which , we have since heard , swept practically the whole world . Some people died because they saw nothing further to live for ; some died from fright . All the children in our yard died except Edwin , Dwight , and the little child of one of our native doctors . This includes all the small children of two and three years and under , of whom there were very many ; and in the Orphanage every child under nine years of age , of whom there were twenty or thirty . Every morning a stretcher passed our house carrying three or four dead children . It was most depressing , when I felt as though I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . Then , too , the continual sicknesses of ourselves and our servants became very disheartening ; for we wondered if some morning might not find us all in bed with fever and no one to care for the children . The way never seemed so dark as in those days , yet always a light shone out which gave us hope . One day perhaps half of us would be in bed , and another day it happened that Miss Schoebel and I were the only ones without fever and able to attend supper . We looked at each other rather seriously that night . The Turks had brought a very virulent kind of malaria and it infected all the mosquitoes . Wilder had several attacks , but after the one I had at Paul 's birth , I never had another . No one in the house appeared to have any fatal trouble , but each day brought increased depression and weakness . Finally , Miss Schoebel was prostrated with her third attack of chills and fever . She was ill only ten days , and during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she told me of the great suffering she had endured and of its being the most severe experience she had ever had . That was the last time I saw her till she lay freed from pain and suffering forevermore . III We had been in the garden about five weeks . It was October , and rapidly becoming unsettled weather . Wilder and I still had a dread of the house , but saw that it was inevitable , so decided to clean the rooms thoroughly . Wilder beat rugs for two days , for there was no help to be had at that time , every mien , woman , and child either just taking the fever or recovering from it . We decided to wind up our stay in the garden by celebrating Edwin 's birthday and recovery . Wilder was busy finishing up the rugs and I was setting a long table in the garden , when the sound of heavy automobile trucks came to my ears . I was so busy that I did not investigate until Dr. Dodd came running over and exclaimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' I asked . Perhaps Stamboul , perhaps Kars , perhaps Tabriz . ' I simply would not believe it . If I only had ! But no one did , and Wilder and Dr. Packard started on foot to the city , to try to interview a high official . They were turned back , however , because of the scheming of the Shatan doctor at the hospital . It was then dinner-time , and no one had prepared the meal , all our friends expecting to eat it with us . Consequently there was nothing ready to take on a journey . And I had planned so for this day , as one of particular gladness for us all ! We stood round the table with white faces and bated breath , while two brutal Turks ordered us to go and climb on the wagons at once . You have fifteen minutes , ' said they . We implored , protested , and accused , but nothing but some gold and some heaping plates of chicken and pilau softened the decree . We were then given five hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . My heart failed me at the thought of the journey , particularly as the wet nurse I had for my baby was having the most severe of her numerous attacks of fever , and I felt that I could not take her with me . I sent word to another Syrian woman in our yards , the wife of a wealthy native doctor who had been forced to flee and had come to us . I had been letting her have some of our very insufficient supply of milk for her little child , who was just Edwin 's age . She was a lovely woman , and I was anxious to save her , for her own sake as well as Paul 's . But more of her later . Meanwhile I hurriedly got together all our silver which had been brought over for the dinner , collected the children 's clothes which were in the garden , and some bedding , and then tried desperately to find an able-bodied person to ' carry it over to the avenue . It was some time before I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working away at packing our clothing in the big trunk . I packed the steamer trunk with all the condensed milk , Nestle 's and Mellin 's Food that I had , and the rest of the semolena ( a sort of Russian cream of wheat ) . The remainder of the dinner and what little food-stuffs we could carry were also packed , but all my lovely canned fruit , catsup , gallons of beans , which we had put in brine for the winter , parsnips , squash and so forth , had to be left behind . As I look back on it now , it seemed as if I should have done more than I did ; but really you can not conceive our plight . Our house was filled with Syrians who were weeping over our departure and begging for things . Honestly , it was hard to move about , let alone collect one 's scattered goods and wits . We did not know whither we were bound , and so could not tell whether to take winter or summer clothes . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , all my trousseau linen , my trinkets , ? precious because of wedding associations and of memories of friends from whom we were so widely separated , ? and took only what I thought was necessary to sustain the lives of my children and Wilder . If it had not been for Wilder , I myself would have had nothing . As Mrs. Packard said , so say I : ' I shall certainly go crazy if I think of my things that were left behind ' ; and the only way of stopping regret and grief over them is to think of the hour of our departure , and how we prayed , and vowed that , if God would only spare the lives of our precious ones and bring us to a haven of safety , we would praise Him all our days . Some Turkish officers stood waiting to seize loot as soon as they could decently do so , and the thought of those men makes me wild even yet . Some rough springless wagons were waiting for us outside , piled so high that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my baby . Finally , however , I found a seat deleted material little go-cart in which he lay comfortably , shielded by its hood . Fortunately my wits were working when I packed the baby 's things ; for I had not forgotten the net that protected him from Hies and other insects all the way . His splendid constitution and regular habits , kept up as nearly as possible throughout the journey , helped greatly . I bathed him every day but one , I think , and Edwin too , although I had only a small bowl . The Kurds were greatly impressed by this performance and thought it wonderful to give a baby such care . They frankly told me that it made little difference to them if their babies died : they could always get some more . They marveled that Paul did not cry , and especially that he was not nursed every five minutes . Three days later our boat steamed in to take us on the next unknown stage of our journey . We were not allowed on the little steamer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towed barge . There was a small , square hole over the section where we were , which afforded some air when the boat was in motion . The rest of the captive crew , Kurds and Moslems , were packed into our small corner , too . The remainder of the hold was crowded with the worst mess of sick people returning to Stamboul . The barge 's deck was packed with Turkish soldiers and German rapid-fire guns . It was nearly evening before they got the engines running , and the sickening movement of the boat upset our Moslem and Kurdish neighbors completely . Dr. Packard said that the best aid against sea-sickness was a full stomach , and not one of our mission party was ill ; but a crack in the floor all too near us was the serve-all of our friends , who kept it busy all night . And such a night ! But there was even worse to follow , for the sleeping quarters were even more abbreviated the next night . All the fleas and other vermin had acquired families , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that the children were able to sleep peacefully , notwithstanding the deafening music , the jests , and stomach-evacuations of our companion Kurds . It was noon before we had anything to eat the day we arrived in Sherifkhana , and we were all nearly starved . The Turks escorted us from the boat to a very decent bungalow , built by the Russians , with a high board-fence round it . Dr. Dodd , Hubert , and Wilder stayed on the dock with the things , and had such a hard time getting them moved to where we were that we did not eat till noon . We spent one night at this very clean and pleasant spot , and had a chance to stretch out , for each family had a place of its own . To our surprise , the next morning the Turks told us that the train which , since the Russian evacuation , had run only occasionally , had arrived and would leave in a few hours . We still did not know where we would be sent , for again Kars , Stamboul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressing to us all , but let me tell you that for cheerfulness this crowd could not be beaten . There was no grumbling or glumness , even though we had to carry a large portion of our own baggage , including some trunks , to the track . Dr. Packard , not long up from a very hard sickness , came along with a heavy trunk on his back , and Wilder helped a Moslem carry our big four-hundred-pounder . We were all placed in a box-car , quite a little smaller than the American kind . Fortunately for us , the Kurds and Moslems were put somewhere else . It now looked as if we were bound for Tabriz , though we could not be certain , and we hoped to reach there by night . But alas ! When we were only a little way from Dofian , the first stop out of Tabriz , the oil fuel ran out and they started men on foot to bring some back . These latter must have been so glad to arrive that they quite forgot us who were perched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tired of waiting and having enough oil to run the engine alone , disconnected and went off . Meanwhile we got down and strolled up and down the track , and , as evening approached , the men built a fire . Here we could heat water to warm up some semolena for the children , and they were fed and put to bed . Edwin had fever all night and asked for water regularly every fifteen minutes . We were in pitch blackness , for our small candle was nearly exhausted . This was the crowning experience in point of discomfort . I had a terrible place to sleep , directly before the door , which was shut , to be sure , but a perfect gale was blowing outside and the wind sifted in everywhere . My head reposed on a samovar , and my feet stuck out somewhere in mid-air . I was still quite wide awake when a big Russian samovar came tumbling down on my head . That was the one and only time I really felt like crying . But it was not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bothered with sympathizing over such a simple matter . I had just got uncomfortably settled once more when Edwin from his perch , about as unattainable as Pike 's Peak in s.o . 1700 , began his water-wagon ride . To climb up in the darkness over fifteen pairs of tired legs mingled with heads , to change places with Wilder , was the feat of an acrobat . I finally got there , leaving Paul in charge of Laya down below . I had to have Paul hoisted up to me several times ; and when the two of them had a short concert over having my sole attention at one and the same time , I was nearly desperate , for Mrs. Packard was having chills and fever and the servants were almost out of reach in the darkness ! During the night we reached Tabriz , and wished for the day . Next morning we were unloaded about eight o'clock and set down beside the track under guard . It was some time before we were removed from the heat and dust of the road ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriages , the bills for which we had to pay ourselves . Our servants and baggage followed in some wagons , and we were driven eight miles into the city . We were certainly curious about our destination , and each one in his heart was praying about it . On reaching the city , we drove through the great bazaars and passed the high walled-in gardens and residences of European and Persians , and still on and on we went . Finally we halted before some high , fine gates , and were told that this was our destination . It was the home of the Russian bank people , now gone , and we were ushered up into big , clean , empty rooms . It was good to know that at least the first stage of our journey was over , and that we should have two or three days ' rest before going on ; for we still thought we were to go to either Stamboul or Kars . The common comforts of civilization ? beds , ticks , washbowls , and chairs ? were lacking here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we found sweet repose . After the second night , the Turks furnished us with two meals a day : black bread with sticks and stones in it , and sometimes soup or beans or /awash soaked in a greasy stew . One of the first things that we heard after our arrival was that Dr. Vanneman and Mr. Jessup had been in jail for forty days . After a week of this life , suddenly and most unexpectedly we were set free . No reasons were given for our having been brought to Tabriz , and of course , as we see it now , it was only an underhanded trick of the Turks , a mild sample of what had happened all over Turkey and everywhere their armies went , as taught them by their leaders the Hons . They have looted and carried off all we had . Records of years and priceless manuscripts are lost . Soon after our release , we and the Packards moved down to the girls ' school , where Dr. Jessup had fixed up four very comfortable rooms for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that we would open up the hospital here , which had been entirely looted , together with the residences and property ; and soon masons , carpenters , glaziers , and other workmen had the place in a habitable condition . Dr. Dodd and Wilder have opened the hospital and already have as much work as they can handle with their limited supplies . We are living in the beautiful residence of Dr. Laraine , who as you know has returned permanently to America . We enjoy this big , lovely , sunny house , especially after coming from our unsanitary one in Urumia . All our station are hoping that it will tumble down this winter , for it is not fit to live in , and after the war we hope a new one can be built . Our compound in Urumia is in a sad state of filth . It is like a great cemetery , and the whole surface of the ground should be turned over after the residence there of so many sick and filthy people who knew little , and cared less , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not draw a wholesome breath for months . Here the sunlight pours into the rooms of the house nearly every day , and the whole building is planned so beautifully . The compound is out from the city , or rattler on its edge , and away from all charcoal fumes . Edwin and Paul have both thriven since coming .
