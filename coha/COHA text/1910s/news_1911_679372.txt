txt Referring to your dispatch of last night , addressed to The Republican . I made no reply by wire because I had no definite or clear recollection of the matter referred to by Mr. C. A. Conant in his testimony before the House Committee . I have since learned that Mr. Conant read to the committee on Monday the following communication , addressed to him by me , under date of December 19 , 1898 : I the . you for your frank statement of the 18th inst. in regard to the Spanishcube question . We are not radical on the subject , as you know , and I think you should be able to serve us satisfactorily in Washington without praludice or partiality . No doubt this letter was authentic . It Is perhaps needless for me to add that The Republican received no money directly or indirectly for any articles published concerning the relations of Spain to Cubs , or of the United States to Spain or Cuba , or the conditions in Cuba .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
