txt GERIVLANY 'S DECISIONGermany must now decide whether the will propose terms of peace the Allies can accept or continue to fight subject to the great risk and probe ' bility that at no distant time the United States will be compelled to enter the war against her . That is what the President 's note means to iermany . It will be so understood ty the Imperial Government , and what Germany understands , what Germany says , will be understood and said by her allies . That is the only meaning the note can have when it shall be read in the light events Will cast upon it . Why are the President 's words misunderstood , why is there much doubt and discussion as to their meaning ? Because here and abroad the tongues and pens of men discussing it have been influenced by preconceived beliefs , by an emotional jumping at conclusions , by the motive of partisan criticism , by anything and everything save the deliberate study of the document in the light of the attending circumstances . That is the easier way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound conclusion is a Painful process for most minds . If we accepted Mr. Virteseasitam 's conclusion that the note means that " the " policy of acquiescence in invasion " of American rights , " and he specifies Belgium . the Lusitania , the Sussex , and the German submarine U-53 , t ' is new bringing fruition by ranging Us ' on the side of Germany , " THE  --  " res would condemn the President unsparingly . As we have said , it is easy to take such a view , if one shuts out of his - mind all consideration of the plainly visible circumstances that called forth the note . Mr. Wicalaasitil-at makes much of a passage in the note in which the President apDears to make no distinction , see no difference , between the objects for Which the Allies are fighting and those for which the Teutonic Powers are fighting . Certainly the failure to Make that distinction would immensely please all pro-Germans in this country , it would deeply offend every Man among us who is an American in heart and feeling . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of phrases that please the wrong persons . He yielded to this propensity when he said at a most inopportune moment that there is such a. thing as being too proud to - fight , and again that with the objects and purposes of the war we have no concern . But what he said in the note was that the objects the statesmen of the belligerents have in mind are virtually the same " as stated in ? general terms to their own people and to the world . " It is an unfortunate phrase , since it has been Misunderstood , but its justification Is that German statesmen have said these things , they have said what Mr. Asqurrn and the present British Prime Minister have said . What they have In their minds the President could not know . He inferred it only " as stated in general terms to their ' own people and to the world . " The United States at the present Moment is a neutral Power . The ; President could not address his note . to Germany alone , demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfriendly act , a threat , it could have been construed only as a prelude to war . The note was sent , had to be sent , to all the belligerent Powers . Sending it to Great Britain , Prance , Italy , and Russia was in fact superfluous , since from the repeated ' Utterances of their statesmen we know perfectly well the terms on which they would make peace . To ? tend the note to them was nevertheless necessary , it was made necessary by diplomatic usage and practices If aarities of the President 's action will ? take that Into account , their understanding will be enlarged , their vision it Is amazing that the English press ** have so completely misunder*the note , that the newspapers ' ; there almost without exception should have construed it as a sort of intervention , as meddling , as an attempt ear pull Germany 's chestnuts out of r-irtile , fire by using the influence of our ; ' ' Government to secure for her an im ! lee - eea- e- te'peaee . The German Governineat II 7.10. ot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country have no more idea of what it really means than they have of the nature of loyal ' and faithful allegiance to the Government may indicate that the newspapers of the Empire will see the communication in its true light , since Germans here and Germans In Germany are often miles apart in such matters . But , at any rate , the German Government will read the note as a plain warning that it must strain every point to make peace now , or accept the almost inevitable consequences . The wild conjecture , it would be unjust to call it an opinion , that the President 's move was prompted by a desire to help Germany out of her predicament , to bring the war to an Immediate end , with the great principles for which the Allies are fighting not established , with peace had for the present but not guaranteed for the future , with Germany free to cherish the ambitions and pursue the policies that have made her a menace to the world , is so preposterous that if it were reasoning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , although an intelligent child would reason better . We have had differences with the Allies growing out of restrictions upon our trade , but we have had much graver differences with Germany growing out of her wanton slaughter of Americans . The President has declared , he has shown by his acts , that he puts the right to life of a human being above the merchant 's right to trade . If , as Mr. LaaTstso said in his first statement , afterward discreetly modified , that " we are drawing nearer the verge of war ourselves , " It is war with Germany . The United States may be compelled to go to war with Germany , the President does not want war with Germany , therefore he asks her to submit terms of peace the Allies can accept , including essential and adequate guarantees against future war . With the Allies we can have no thought of war , they are fighting our battle . They are fighting for our principles , for human liberty , for the rights of nations small and great . War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . If it is forced upon us our resources added to Ithe resources of the Allies will brir.g the struggle to a quick determination . It is not merely because we sympathize with Great Britain and France 11 in this struggle , not merely because I we honor the principles for which they contend that we desire their triumph . We know that the victory of Germany would be a peril to us . If we enter the war that thought will be in our minds . Should we be provoked to action it will be better for us to spend five billions or ten billions now than to be forced to spend twenty-five billions later on in a war against Germany waged by ourselves alone . We have no army , we have no great navy , but we have available resources greater than those of all the Allies put together , and we have a prodigious and developed capacity for the manufacture of munitions . All that the German Government knows very well , all that will be taken Into 1 account when the answer to the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies , is prepared in Bar-lin Of the reply the allied Powers will make to the President we may be said to have ample foreknowledge . , All depends on Germany 's reply . If she offers terms of peace acceptable ! to the Allies she will act with the highest wisdom . She will have emi braced what is probably her last opiPortunity to make peace on terms in the making of which she will have something to say . She has had her warning . We are confident that she will not misunderstand the President 's note .
