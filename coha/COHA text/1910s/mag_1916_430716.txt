 |p546  " WELL , what 's the war news ? " asked an old resident of Golden 's Bridge , New York , of the brakeman of the branch line train , which consisted of two freight cars and a battered coach . Every morning since August 1 , 1914 , the old resident had asked that question . And every morning the brakeman had given him a verbal comprehensive bulletin before handing over a second-hand copy of a metropolitan daily , the " Bulldog " edition , which went to press late afternoon of the day before . This time the farmer-brakeman drew himself up like a man intrusted with a personal message from his king . Waiting a minute for effect , he drawled : " You do n't have to go to Europe for your war news no more . The President 's called out the militia . " " Well , I swan l " remarked the old citizen ; " seems like the hull world 's got the war fever . " There are a few countries still neither at war nor threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe it . For there is not a remote hamlet or a secure interior city in the United States that has not now felt the " war fever . " The Middle West , accused of indifference to the great war abroad , has been second to no community in its response to the President 's call . Scenes that most Americans had seen only in the moving pictures or in the illustrated supplements of their Sunday papers and had never thought to view otherwise are now common in all sections of the country . Men and women leave their work or their meals to rush to the main street of their " home town " and rake with scorching cheers the passing ranks of men in khaki . From Market Street on the Pacific to Broadway in the East city canyons reverberate with the rolling wheels of artillery . In the lesser towns that do not boast even a company of militia men and women gather at the railway station to " see off " the only " local boy " in uniform and cheer till their lumpy throats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Nevada , which has no National Guard , feels a vicarious thrill as temporary residents leave for the training camps of their own States , and a very solid pride as the reports come home of Nevada boys who have joined the regulars . No Paul Revere is needed to-day . Newspapers do his work . And the minute-men of 1916 have not lagged behind the minutemen of ' 76 in their response . A whole coun/ try has rushed and the hackmatacks of Maine . the prairies of Dakota and the hills of Tennessee . from Colorado smelters and the New York Stock Exchange , come nephews of Uncle Sam . Mr. Bryan did not misjudge the split of Americans when he declared that at war 's alarum a million men would spring to arms between dawn and dusk . If the President had wanted a million men instead of a tenth of a million for Mexico , he could have had them in a flash . Mr. Bryan 's mistake and the mistake of all the professional pacifists lay in believing that every man would have a musket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man did in ' Th . Probably . like other professional pacifists , Mr. Bryan believed war so remote for the United States that he did not think of the slight detail of training and equipping his million men . Now that most of the militia has mobilized it is time to analyze what has happened . One thing has not happened , and that is the fulfillment of the boasts of the various directing officers of the militia of various States as reported in the newspapers on June 19 , the day after the President 's call for the militia was flung over the land . " Major-General O'Ryan informs me. " said Governor Whitman , of New York , ' that the mobilization will be completed within three days . " - " We are ready , " said Colonel Henry G. Mathewson , Chief of Artillery for the National Guard of California . " We can leave for the front at any time , " said Adjutant-General George McL . Presson , of the Maine National Guard . Similar expressions came from responsible officers in other States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State was ready to entrain for the border till a week after the President 's call . It is quite natural that these officers and men were overconfident . Personally they were just aching to serve their country , and they mistook their enthusiasm to act for their ability to act ; they confused the will and the deed . Their ready spirit was commendable , but their unready material condition was deplorable , and would have been calamitous had a foreign enemy been landing on our shores . It is unnecessary to tire the reader with a long list of specific deficiencies . One item of deficiency reported in the National Guard was three hundred and eight machine guns , but the actual shortage in these weapons is much greater than that , if we are to learn anything from the war in Europe . Blankets , leggings , hats , shirts , rifles , horses ? there was a shortage of all these things . Practically every militia regiment in the country was below war strength , and the recruits , who volunteered with splendid patriotism , found themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain the full numbers of our National Guardsmen in time of peace , can we not at least maintain the equipment on hand for the emergency drilling of recruits ? Not under the present system of State control , it seems . As this is written , for the second time in eighteen years we are on the verge of a war with a people who speak Spanish . Now , as in 1893. the crisis has found us unready . Not so unready as when the Maine blew up , but nevertheless unready . This is the dark side of the situation . The bright side is very bright . It is the glory of our country to-day that our citizens have not shirked the call to arms . Some jingoes here and some foreigners who have failed to understand our non-participation with them in the European war have misjudged us . They have thought that we had become decadent , that we had lost our National nerve and ' punch . " But America 's heart seems to be all right . The sights of 1898 are being repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again abroad . City streets are parade grounds for men in khaki who march there through volleys of applause from sidewalks and from batteries hidden in high office windows . Crowds of recruits in the clothes of civil life and the pallor of the desk-worker crowd about armory doors clamoring to be enrolled . Railway stations are filled with the tramp of marching feet and the sobs of the Girl He Leaves Behind Him ? sweetheart , sister , mother , wife . License bureaus are crowded , issuing marriage licenses to America 's wouldbe " war brides . " Park lawns are torn by the hoofs of swerving horses and rutted by the wheels of the rumbling guns . Military music is in the air wherever you go . All this is the thrill of war . If we have war , the agony and the deadening pain will come later . A good deal of the dull routine of war , the antipode of the glamour , has been felt already by the Guardsmen . The mobilization camps  |p548  are full of it . At one of these forty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York 's main camp of mobilization is Camp Whitman . It is in the township of Beekman , but the railway station is Green Haven . The traffic does not support a ticket agent , and you pay your fare in cash on the train . The camp site was selected with an eye to seclusion from the general public , and the selectors certainly succeeded well . Although less than twenty miles from Poughkeepsie and the teeming commerce of the Hudson River Valley except for the automobiles of tourists the little town looks like the heart of New England forty years ago . You get your mail at the store from a tiny post-office screened off by chicken wire , and if you seek a meal at the " hotel " they kill you a hen while you wait . My first view of the camp was from the railway tracks to the east of it . The train shot out of a canyon in the high wall of the Pawling Mountains that immure Beekman on east and south , and there . across a broad . rolling sweep of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and colored with smears of buttercups . daisies , and purple flag , were the conical tents of the militia . Some were drab , like the tents of the regulars ; some were an unwarlike white that could be seen for miles and miles . The camp lay along the left of the road that dipped back into the country from the station . Along the other sides were canvas dwellings also , but these proved to be the shelters of the enterprising merchants who have been filling their money belts with the proceeds of the sale of tobacco , candy , sarsaparilla , ginger ale , and all those multicolored beverages known generically to children as " pop . " Of these , the nearest to an alcoholic is ' ? nearbeer , " for John Barleycorn is stopped by the sentries at Camp Whitman . The camp is a new one , and the difficulties encountered in getting a satisfactory water supply have led the soldiers to dub it jocosely " a water-wagon without water . " The men to have the honor of first pitching tents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put the camp in shape for the others ; but the first tents to be seen from the tiny railway station were the tents of the Fighting Sixty-ninth " ? the regiment that has never lost a flag . Irish is this regiment from Colonel Conley to Private Flynn , and it wears the blue hat cord of the infantry . Passing up one of the company UTLOOK 5 July streets between groups of Haggertys , O'Briens , Hogans , Flannerys , and Quinns . I noticed the regimental standard fluttering on the breeze . The staff was ringed with bands of silver , and each of these bands recalls some daring exploit of this famous New York City regiment . " Bull Run , Fair Oaks , Antietam , the Wilderness , Cold Harbor , " chanted a newspaper man ; " there 's a record for you , believe me . " " It ai n't finished yet , mister . " said a private who held a clay pipe upside down between two jaws like the bluff bows of a canal-boat ; " there 's room on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant Chihuahua . On beyond the Sixty-ninth was the Twentysecond , living mainly in white tents that made one believe at first sight that the circus had come to town . The hard routine work of war which these men , assisted by the men of the Sixty-ninth , encountered in this camp without any of war 's excitement to offset it was the work of laying out company streets , digging drains , sinking wells , laying pipes for water , chopping wood , and all the ordinary chores of camp life . Stone walls were torn down ruthlessly to supply the material for aqueducts and streets . Opposite the headquarters of the Twenty-second was an old farm-house , used when the soldiers first arrived by prisoners from Sing- Sing , who named it " Camp Kirchwey , " after their warden . In fact , Camp Whitman is on the State Industrial Farm , and when the soldiers.came to lay out their camp they found a number of convicts working on State roads . Some wag , who noticed how much harder the men of war were working than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like convicts and the convicts work like soldiers . " And a big Irish corporal carrying rocks as he chanted to himself , A big one and a little one , a big one and a little one , " stopped his refrain to offer to change clothing with a prisoner . But from morning to dark the work did not stop , not even for a few minutes at that drowsiest of all times in a country summer , mid-afternoon , with the roosters crowing lazily over the hill . Probably the militia of New York is fairly typical of the militia of the whole country . There are all sorts of men among the National Guard of the Empire State . Pale clerks whose eyes wince under the full sun , college athletes as tanned as any regular in Mexico , hard-handed bricklayers and farmers ,  |p549  taxicab drivers from the city , anaemic waiters. and spectacled millionaires . There is a great democracy about this arming of citizens Plutocratic polo-players in Squadron A rub shoulders with the sons of the " peepul " on the drilling green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a great rush of recruits to the militia , the number of the men who have had a year or more in the Guard is high . But probably in most regiments less than one per cent have ever been under fire . Men like Private Baird. of the Sixtyninth , whose leg was torn by a shell at Gallipoli , are few and far between . Of course . in comparison with the regulars the militiamen do seem thin-chested and anaemic in many cases , and the percentage of men with horn rims about their eyes is larger than one would like to see it . Moreover , a good many of the horses of the militia that I have seen appear too " leggy " and soft for the border country . But the weakest men and the weakest horses are being weeded out by the Federal officers in charge of enrolling the militia as a Federal force , and a month on the sunny , sandy stretches of the border will transform the others . And even as they are , just after donning their uniforms at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more than an equal force of Mexicans . The process of enrolling the National Guard in the Federal service seems to have been misunderstood by a good many citizens . Under existing law at the time the President called out the militia it could be used by him only in subduing rebellion or repelling invasion . Before any Guardsman could be sent into Mexico , supposing emergencies should call for such action , the President needed the specific authorization of Congress . This authorization Congress must give . In order to be used in Mexico , however , each Guardsman must take the oath required under the new Army Reorganization Law . No Guardsman is forced to take this oath , but those who decline to take it can not be used outside of the United States . Each man who does take it becomes automatically a volunteer soldier in the United States army for the term of three years or for the duration of this Mexican emergency , if that proves to be less than three years . Thus far few Guardsmen have refused to take the oath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( Company , Troop , Battery ) in the National Guard of the United States and of the State of I do hereby acknowledge to have voluntarily enlisted this day of 1916 , as a soldier in the National Guard of the United States and of the State of ( ) , for the period of three years in service and three years in the reserve . ender conditions prescribed by law , unless sooner discharged by proper authority . And I do solemnly swear that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the United States of America and to the State of ( ? ) , and that I will serve them honestly and faithfully against all their enemies whomsoever , and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and of the Governor of the State of ( ) and of the officers appointed over me according to law and the rules and articles of war . This oath is subscribed with the understanding that credit will be given in the execution of this contract for the , period which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State of ( ) . All the forty-four States whose militia was recently called out have shown a praiseworthy zeal in responding . New Jersey claims the honor of being the first State to get its men out in uniform , and Oregon claims the honor of having the first company to take the oath of " federalization . " I was at Camp Whitman the afternoon that word came of the order for the militia to go to the border as soon as ready without waiting for complete mobilization at the various State camps . The news was first received by a newspaper man in a telegram from his office , and he passed it on to two privates who were drinking nearbeer " at a refreshment stand by the roadside . They dropped their unemptied glasses and ran through the camp spreading the news , which was taken up by others and carried down each company street to the remotest canvas domicile . You would have thought they were carrying reports of another Marathon instead of the word that meant certain service in a country of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-Indians . The spirit of our citizen soldiers is splendid . Were their material equipment and their training , which the country has neglected , half as adequate as the spirit . we would have no cause to reproach ourselves ? we , the great body of non-fighting citizens who are to blame for this unreadiness . Were our heads only as reliable as our hearts , what a Nation we Americans could be !
