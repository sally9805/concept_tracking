txt VENEZUELAN REPORTS . For Action Against the Dictator if German Plots Are Found . If the . reports of the activity of German agents in Venezuela are correct , and our Government is apprehensive of trouble from that quarter , a short , swift stroke against General Juan Vicente Gomez , the Dictator-Presidentelect , would clear - up the atmosphere . It would not take much to bring General Gomez to terms . He is unpopular with many of his people , and they would welcome a change . My opinion of General Gomez is based on a personal study of the man , made some ten or eleven years ago in Caracas , where I had gone to " cover " an expected revolution . At the time , Castro was lying ill at Macuto , a little watering place just east of Caracas , and it used to be frequent happening that men would sit up all night in the Club Concordia , in the ? capital , waiting for news that his end had come . Gomez was then Vice President , and as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I determined to get an interview with larn . It was a difficult matter , but through friends he consented to give me his views provided I should not use his name in the interview . The sequel was a scene from comic opera . At a certain hour in a dark afternoon I was standing at an appointed nlace . A closed carriage drove up . Out jumped one of my intermediaries , a close personal friend of the Vice President . He grabbed my arm and hurried me into the vehicle . The blinds were put down , and for a quarter of an hour we drove madly through the streets of Caracas  --  to shake off Castro 's spies  --  until finally we stopped at a house which was not three blocks away from our starting place . As the carriage stopped the door of the house opened cautiously . Quick ! " urged my companion , in a hoarse whisper ? I darted across the sidewalk , followed by him . The door , shutting , caught his coattails . We were shown into a darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . Finally we were conducted into another room , where , after some minutes of waiting , the Vice President appeared . He spoke in whispers . Every few moments he looked suddenly at a door or window . He told me he had it from Castro 's doctor that the latter had no chance of getting well . He was extremely courteous throughout the interview , but at every few words he made me repeat my promise  --  not to quote him . But he was in great fear . Outwardly he was the - close friend of Castro . However , he already had his organization formed , and if he had had a spark of courage he could have seized the Government . But the spell of the shriveled little Andean at Macuto , sick almost unto death as he was , paralyzed him into abject terror . The Government does n't need any advice , perhaps , but a warship or two and a regiment of marines would work wonders . There are several thousand Venezuelan exiles in this country who would be very glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gran Hotel Klindt and who would like to see their country governed in a fashion that would give them life and law and enable them to pursue happiness at home , and some of them are ready to go upon the word .
