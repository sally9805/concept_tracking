NOT long ago I saw a college professor drop into a chair at his club , glance over the table of contents of a well-known periodical , and fling it down in disgust . " I ca n't read the magazines , " he snorted . " What is the matter with American literature ? " In the trolley that night I sat next to a business man who was studying the pictures in the same monthly . " Do you read that magazine ? " I asked . " Part of it , " he said , indifferently ; " I suppose all of it is trash . " I can not see that such critics have a right to ask , What is the matter with American authors ? Superciliousness and indifference were never friends to criticism or to literature . The worst way to improve a national literature is not to read it ; and the next is to read it badly . I hought the magazine , and read it , all but the advertisements . It was not great literature ? some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly not " trash . " A task in research once led me to read with thoroughness the magazines of the mid-nineteenth century , when English literature was , so the critics say , greater than now . They were not so good as this modern periodical ? they were not nearly so good in average of content , even though here and there a poem or a story or an essay since become famous lightened the toil of reading . My professor , if he had lived in the mid-century , would never have grappled with the diffuse , sentimental writing that filled so many pages . He would have stopped with the table of contents , and missed perhaps a chapter of Vanity Fair , a sonnet of Longfellow 's , a story by Poe , or an instalment of The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table . Andmy philistine business man would infallibly have skipped these good things , read the bad , and proclaimed that most modern stuff was trash . What is it that makes us contemptuous when it comes to current literature , and especially to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Is it hypocrisy ? Do we sneer at our reading ( for most of us do read the magazines , and with some interest , too ) lest some learned critic or scornful foreigner will laugh at our taste ? Or is it timidity , because we lack confidence to discriminate between the good and the had in current publications ? Lowell said that there would never be an American literature until there was an American criticism . If he meant that there must be great critics before there are great writers , the history of many literary periods is against him . But it is certain that until we are ready to stand by out- hooks and periodicals ? to be honest in our praise and blame , and intelligent in our discrimination ? American literature , in spite of occasional achievement of distinction , must , as a whole , remain second-rate . To sneer at contemporary literature , whether native or foreign , because most of it must disappear m the test and trial of time , is more than ridiculous ? it is dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor ones are less important than a single paragraph from Fielding or Thackeray , and yet the ten remaining may mean more to ! is than all but the best works of earlier centuries . We are partners in the literary speculations of our own age mere in-vestors in the established enterprises of earlier periods . In the works of our best writers the speech is our speech , the mode of thought our mode , the clothes , the streets , the events , the philosophy , our clothes , our streets , our remembered history , our philosophy . If it is to the so-called " classics " that we must go for eternal human nature and perfection of expression tried and sure , it is in the " newest books , " in the newspaper on its way from the press to the kindling-box , in the supposedly ephemeral magazine , that we must seek a record of ourselves as others see us , and find the self-expression of our age . If literature is to be taken seriously at all , current literature is in some respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the comic supplement . It is like the breakers on the shore-front : the ocean lies behind , but it is in them that motion , energy , and life are concentrated and made manifest . Few take seriously our current literature , and that is why the bilious query of the supercilious and the indifferent , " What is the matter with American literature ? " is so irritating . It is because I , for one , do take it with enormous seriousness that I dare to ask the question myself . That there really is something wrong ? at least with current American writing ? the evidence proves only too readily . A comparison of American stories , articles , plays , poetry , with the product of Europe need not inspire a native reader with the despair which English critics profess to feel for us . Our writers are the cleverest in the world , barring only the French ; and in their special field of fiction and journalism , the most skilful and most vigorous . They have energy , versatility , promise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decadence visible in English paradox and French morbidity . But depth , truth , sincerity , are not so evident ; nor is the craftsmanship which completes a perfect work . The best foreign plays are better made than our best native drama . The best English fiction strikes deeper , means more , is truer , than what we are accustomed to put forward as our most representative work , ? although one must except three or four of our chief writers if the scale is to tip against us . English poetry , on the whole , is more vital , more beautiful , more perfect than ours . And the cultivated American reader not only recognizes these differences , he exaggerates them . Much of the humor that he laughs at he believes to be cheap , even when it is not ? unless , like Mark Twain 's , it comes in hook form with its prestige stamped on the cover . Short stories , more clever than anything being written in England , he delights in but does not wholly admire . Plays that hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose , " at the end ; and he calls the best sellers " virile , " " wholesome , " " stirring , " or " sweet , " without supposing for an instant that they are true . Current literature may tickle the current American reader , and it often plays successfully upon his emotions and his sentiment ; but , like current religion , it seldom stirs him to faith . Its roots are not about his mind and his heart . ' there are two fairly well- marked extremes in American literature ? the strenuous and the delicate . Between them is to be found that writing of the first order which , in despite of critical sneerers , we have for a century been producing , and the mass of featureless publication which has neither form , content , nor significance . The bulk of our circulating library and news-stand literature belongs to the first extreme ? that which I have called the " strenuous " order . It is loud-voiced , aggressive , exuberant , and appeals frankly to the multitude . In articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It deals in paragraphs of three lines ' length ; its subject-matter is interesting , but it has little accuracy and a minimum of thoughtfulness . In fiction , it acquires such head-lines as " A Virile American Conquers the Love of a Beautiful Balkan Princess , and Wins Her by a Method which must be Read to he Appreciated . " Its stories are built like cantilever bridges , and their construction is quite as evident . The characters are like the clothes they wear in the illustrations ? ready-made ; and the advertising pages , devoted to the ideal American as he dresses in New York , presents them quite as fittingly as the picture in color on the cover . Sometimes the theme is adventure , in which case the pace is rapid beyond hope of realization in this jaded world ; sometimes it is business , and then we learn how luridly romantic are the lives of our hankers and brokers ; sometimes it is pathos ? then the tears are never far from the surface , and the honest American heart , he it never so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes it is humor , and , as the quotation from the press notice describes it , " you roll in excruciating delight upon the library rug , and only save yourself by herculean self-control from falling into the fireplace . " I do not intend to be sarcastic . On the contrary , one must admire the abounding vitality of this literature of the democracy . It may not be " virile , " but it certainly is vigorous . It may not be " literary , " but what remains when you skip the " dramatic openings , " the " happy endings , " with " uplifts , " the mere adventures , and the conventional characterizations ? what is left after this contains much real literature , in which American conditions are mirrored with humor and with genuineness , and with a shrewdness that almost makes up for depth . The magazine that advertises , " This is the best number ever published in America , " may be as disappointing as certain " boosted " towns of the West , but it is likely to contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that the merely " literary " may never accomplish . In fact , the strenuous , extravagant , aggressive school of American literature ? the popular school ? is as full of strength and confidence and promise for the future as American business . But it is far cruder than American business . It has less brains behind it . It is a plant that runs to vigorous stems and over-abundant leaves . It is lush in growth and not highly productive of valuable fruit , because as yet it is deficient in roots . The strenuous school is certainly preferable , however , to the other extreme ? the delicate , scented variety of writing , which , though not hardy in our practical America . is replanted annually in astonishing abundance . This is a flower of art that the multitude who make popularity are ignorant of , and vet it , too , is typically American . In occasional contributions to the general magazines , in a hundred " paid-for-by-the-author " books , and in thousands of essays , stories , and poems read before clubs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly personal , highly polished style of composition which , if not literature , is certainly literary . People with no story to tell write it excellently and call it art ; people with nothing to say polish their style and call it literature . As if by some survival of the curse of Babel , careful writing , discrimination in words , restraint , grace , beauty ? all that goes to make a style ? have become associated in America with the privately printed or the sparingly read . It would be invidious and merely confusing to single out examples . The kind of writing I have in mind is not restricted to individuals , nor to given essays or stories . It is a tendency rather than a method , and shows its empty , graceful head as unmistakably when the commercial writer turns the spotlight upon his purple patches , or breathes soft sentiment , as in the labored mannerisms of the cultured dilettante . Nevertheless , there is an astonishing production of American work whose only recommendation is its " literary " form , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vice is prevalent ; in truth , there seem to he as many poets as there are readers of new poetry ; and a discouraging percentage of their verse is mere graceful flower and leaf . The scribbling itch , of course , is common to all nations ; but the depressing factor i here is that so much of what is really well written , artistically written , so much of the thoroughly civilized writing in our current literature , is of this fragile order ; so much of what has real juice in it , real promise ? fresh thought , keen observation , cogent truth ? is slipshod , ? vulgar , ugly , or warped i by sensationalism and the fear of reality into a sentimental or exaggerated imitation of what the public is supposed to consider life . The one school runs to lush and wasteful growth , because it sends no roots down into the heart of America . The other , for all its grace and perfect form , is not hardy , is not at home among us , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one will deny that we lose by this ; those least who know and admire the work of the many American writers who , in the face of discouraging conditions , are earning more discriminating praise than has yet been given them . Only the supercilious can fail to regret the vigorous imagination running waste in our " popular " productions ? so little of it directed to any end which may serve art and truth . Only the indifferent can sec without regret that the study of perfection which leads to art is bestowed chiefly upon subjects which contain little promise and no hearty life . Let us take from the comparison the few writers of whom we may well boast ; let us confine ourselves to pure literature ; ? and then admit that in the drama , in fiction , and in poetry we are just neither to our talents , to our needs , nor to our desires in literature . Excuses are as plentiful as blackberries ? and , to a critic with some national pride , as sour . The commonest of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreams of culture : commercialism . It is a fallacy . Venice was commercial and had Giorgione and Titian . The Florence of Boccaccio was the center of fourteenth-century commercialism . The Holland of Rembrandt was commercial to the core . There is sure to be a vast output of low-grade literary ware when , as with us , the vast majority of readers are money-makers necessarily intent on their gains , and deprived of the leisure necessary to form a taste ; exactly as there is an enormous production of the common conveniences of life ? shoes , newspapers , collars , and phonographs . But this is no necessary deterrent to high-grade work . The more money , the more chance for the artist with high ideals to live . Surely our industrial development since the Civil War has brought us to the level of old New England of seventy years ago , when the exploitation of the seaboard states had ended in an accumulation of wealth and a freeing of time and energy for our one great literary period . Commercialism may be a proffered excuse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediocrity in literature . America is too heterogeneous , too shifting , for mature literature , say others ; it is so various in blood , so transitional in its civilization , as to offer few subjects for finished work . This is the critics ' excuse . The thousands of writers who are satisfying the growing clamor for " something to read " do not presentit . They are not troubled by lack of subjects , nor are they confused by the complexity and movement of our national life . It is true that they do not seem to get to the heart of this life ; and it may be that they rush in where the wiser and less vigorous fear to tread . But what arrant nonsense it would be to hold off until New York and Chicago and the Pacific coast are " finished , " as an Englishwoman put it , asserting that they would be worth looking at when that time came . The scientist nowadays does not wait for his specimen to be full-grown or dead before he begins his examination . Nor should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races here than among classes in Germany . There is as much significance in our mental and material development as in English pessimism or Russian melancholy . I admit the difficulty of making literature from towns that change their populations as they change their pavements , and a country still largely unassimilated . But if we lose one way , we gain another . Forests and mountain wildernesses , emigration and immigration , the clash of racial habits and ideals in an amalgamating society ; industrial , moral , social transformation ? these are assuredly subjects for literature ; and that they challenge originality and the interpretative imagination does not make them less interesting . And yet American literature does not live up to its opportunities . It is not so good as American machinery . And the trouble is neither commercialism nor a dearth of subjects ; it is a lack of proper soil . It is the fault of the soil that our novels , plays , poetry , articles ? unrefined and over-refined ? lack the roots which would make them better literature . The soil from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever , it is shrewd , and it is not wanting in imagination ; hut , with due and grateful exception , it falls short in the meditated experience and thoughtful observation that spring from intelligence . Its art is less bracing , less vital than the best in our lives . The best English novelists are superior to any group of Americans ; England has better dramatists than we have : her poets are better than ours ? not , I think , because they have more brains , more art , more imagination , but because they use more . They strike deeper , perhaps because it is easier to do so in old soil , but also because deeper striking is required of them . The deficiency , however , is not , I believe . primarily with the writers . By all the laws of probability , we should have more than our share of literary genius . The American has shown himself more fertile in literary talent than in any other of the arts ; and , furthermore , wave after wave of restless intellect has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the great Welsh poets , says George Borrow , died in New Brunswick in North America . If the soil had been right , Henry James , Whistler , Sargent ? to look at the matter differently ? might have flourished here . If the soil were right , there would be genius to grow here . What we chiefly lack is intelligent readers . Good readers make good soil . No actor can act his best to a cold audience or an empty house . Nor can a writer write his best when there are none or few who will read him . It is true that there have been independent geniuses , such as Browning and Shelley , who seem to have defied the neglect of the reader . If we could call forth such men , might we not make an American litera-ture , regardless of what America wants ? Unfortunately , rare spirits like theirs do not come at call ; and even they are not entirely i independent of the cir-cumstances in which they must write . Shelley , it is true , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as fit ; but then his best work is the purest of lyric poetry , the most personal form of literature , the least dependent upon a circle of readers . As for Browning , his isolation was a prime cause of his obscurity when , as so often , he was needlessly obscure . Great writers do not come ready-made . Good readers help to make them . We are the greatest readers among the nations . Everybody in America reads ? from the messenger-boy to the corpora- tion president . It never was so easy to read as now in America . A journey is measured by discarded newspapers and magazines . Fifteen minutes on a trolley-car without something to read has become a horror . We read so much that the publishers , who do not expect us to think of what we are reading , crowd their magazines with explanatory illu strations in order to save us from embarrassment . This hunger and thirst for the printed page has resulted in a flood of writing that is good , but not too good ; clever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , lest the unintelligent reader be confused ; lest the intelligent reader have to waste his reading-time in thinking . A year of such indiscriminate perusing and a man of good natural taste will swallow anything rather than be left without something to read . And we have been doing it for a generation . Hence it has come about that , while we are the greatest readers in the world , we are also the worst . We read too much to read intelligently . We are had readers , some of us , because , like Benedick , we have " a contemptible spirit " for the books we spend our time over ; but most of us because , if we have intelligence , we fail to use it when we read . If as great an exercise of sheer brain power were demanded from our novelists and our playwrights as from our engineers , superintendents , architects , and lawyers , a real literature would follow . But we can not stop reading long enough to make such a demand . We have no time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made happy by their novels . They do n't care about truth . " " Any old stuff ' in a play will please the public , if there are laughs enough . " So long as this can he said of the intelligent , educated men and women who determine true popularity , good writing in America will come only by accident . We are had readers ; and that is what is the matter with American literature . I do not mean to excuse either author or publisher . The author ? so many think ? underestimates the quality of his audience . Like Oliver Wendell Holmes , be does not dare to be as funny as he can . Often he is unwilling , often unable , to pass the mark of " good enough . " The publisher is certainly over-timorous , and much prefers the rear to the van of progressing taste . Nevertheless , the root of the difficulty lies elsewhere . Supply in literature may not be created , but it is inevitably ' conditioned , by demand . In the past a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made the American voracious and superficial in his reading . And this is true to-day , with the addition that France , England , and Germany are threatened by the same evil . There is only one remedy : education . How else can you prepare for intelligence ? Education in the broadest sense makes a good reader . In one of its departments ? knowledge of life , shrewdness , common sense ? we Americans are abundantly competent to read . It seems that in another department ? the will to think , to interpret , to appreciate ? we lag behind . Our colleges are blamed for their failure to turn out the authors of a great American literature . The charge is unjust , for not the most Utopian of universities could produce a great literature before it was wanted . Let them be blamed rather for their failure to produce good readers . Great writers they can , at best , train and encourage . Good readers they can make . In our society it is the college graduates who must make the soil fur literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the generation now under way , the majority of those who by competence or opportunity become readers of good writing ; they will determine the policy of the better newspapers , the quality of the best magazines , the success of most books worthy of consideration . Are they reading better books than men and women who have never been to college ? Are they asking that their fiction shall be truer , their plays more dramatic , their wit wittier , their articles more intelligent , than all that is purveyed for those without a degree ? In some measure , yes , especially among the women ; in the proper measure , emphatically no . And the reason is that the college graduate , while in college , was too busy with other things to acquire intellectual interests . The undergraduate of to-day is certainly possessed of a reasonable amount of intelligence ; the criticism most justly made is that in intellectual matters he often fails to use it . It is easy to present him with information , and get it ? not seriously damaged back again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , developments , conclusions , ideas . But it is hard to make him think . He will spend enormous sums on tutoring ; he will memorize whole pages ; sometimes he will even forego his degree , rather than think . And as good reading demands a certain amount of thinking as a prime requisite , his books suffer in proportion to the laziness of his mind . If he enters business in after-life , this defect in thoroughness is remedied by a stern necessity , and what intelligence has accrued to him he rapidly puts to work at full efficiency . In preparation for law and the professions generally , he passes through a period of higher training , when thinking is forced upon him . But when it comes to reading for pleasure , there is no such compulsion . If he was lazy-minded in studying in college , he will be lazier in reading afterward . If he was content with a sixty-per-cent. efficiency , he will scarcely seek a higher ratio of appreciation when there is only his own pleasure to consult . And how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? be run for a man who does not care to comprehend more than , say , sixty per cent . It is not a duty I am urging . I suppose that we have a moral obligation to become better readers , but such an argument is quite unnecessary . If , crossing the hotel corridor to the man who is reading a novelized photo-play to rest his mind , I should say , " Dear sir , ought you not to be reading good literature ? " I should expect the retort that Francis Thompson made upon the shoemaker who asked if he were saved . I have neither the right , nor the desire , to put such a question . I am more concerned with the pleasure and inspiration which the man in the hotel corridor , and his hundred thousand companions , are losing . What stories the really able American authors might write for him , if he were sufficiently interested in life to read them ! What plays they would produce . if he would take the trouble to discriminate between drama and melodrama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What essays they would compose if they believed he thought ! And I repeat , I do not know how this is to develop except through the colleges ? unless it is to begin in the schools and the homes that send us an undergraduate already predisposed to regard matter as more important than mind . Every modern nation has depended upon its schools and universities not , it is true , to create literature , for genius has never required a degree , but to spread that intelligence , and still more that interest in intelligence , by whose warmth good hooks ripen into literature . We shall get a distinctive literature when we are willing to appreciate one . We shall be willing and able to appreciate one when our education arouses intellectual interests as well as trains character and disciplines the mind . And this will happen when , among other things , boys and girls are sent to college to become intelligent . I shall probably be scoffed at by the professional writer who has learned his trade in the school of experience , and condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life . The one will laugh at the idea that upon education can depend so unacademic a thing as creative literature . The other is too contemptuous of the masses to believe that our artistic welfare is bound up with theirs . But the facts are against them . The lack of art which foreign critics is against our professional liter-ature s due , in part at least , to the lack of an audience that will demand it . The lack of vitality which is evident in our merely literary compositions is the result of writing for the sake of writing , in despite of those who will not read . No author is independent of his readers . He can distance them , but he can not escape their influence . I have no formula for genius . But when we have good readers , we shall get that American literature of which now we have no less and no more than we deserve .
