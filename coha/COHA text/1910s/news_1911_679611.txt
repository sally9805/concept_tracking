txt Dear Mother : Do n't think of letting Sis stop her muslo lessons on my account . I 'll be able to manage things up here until I connect with a friendly pay roll , so please do n't think of sending me any money . You 'll have enough to worry about in putting up blackberry jam sufficient to supply me when I come home to visit next fall . That is now your sole mission in life , so far as I ant concerned . Just settle back in your arm chair and swat the hot spell with a large palm ' eat fan , and when you think of me , which I hope is often , just picture me on the trail of a swollen fortune , such as will make John D. and Pierpont turn green with envy , I am designing a ten cylinder touring car for you and a beautiful new plug hat , model of 1911 , for Dad . His present hat is about due to come back in style In another year or two , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just one short of meeting the demand . I had hoped to chronicle the pleasing Item that C. Dawson , Esq. , Journeyman Fortune Hunter , had accepted lucrative employment on the sunny side of a roll top desk , or a bench , but such is not the fact at the time we go to press . The Eternal Law of Economics has decreed otherwise . Fortune is trying me out in her crucible a little longer , so that by the time I got my opportunity I will not only greatly appreciate it but will work twice as hard to make the most of it . I ' am like the crude iron ore that is going through the furnace before It becomes steel . The weather has been open to some much needed criticism during the last week . When your shoes stick in the asphalt and the sun kisses with the ardent passion of a busy mustard plaster , it is no nice way to do , to say the least . Consequently the crusade for employment has languished somewhat . Last Monday I invited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was just on the point of putting an " ad " in the paper when the twelfth man dangled a rose colored bunch of Hope before me . He told me to come in Wednesday and he 'd see what ho could do . I felt sure I had a place landed , but when I went back Wednesday he was out playing golf ; on Thursday be was at a directors ' meeting and sent out word for me to come Friday without fail , and on Friday be went to New York . His office boy said he 'd be back in a week or ten days . For about three minutes I was somewhat disheartened , but , then Hope , like Atlas rising from the sea , sprang up with a loud cry and swatted Despair a staggering jolt , and Optimismonce more reigned supreme . You have no idea how beautiful the parks are . The moon is beautiful and hundreds of young couples are out looking for jobs as husbands and wives . It reminded me of the campus in June . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't written to her because I did n't like to write until I could tell her I had succeeded . When you see her , write and tell me everything she said . I saw " Scads " Alcott on tho street last week . He is going to Wisconsin for the summer and intends to try for a position here in the fall . Well , I guess that is about all this time . I have spent a lot of time in the parks ; it 's so much cooler than my room . And I 'm trying a new dietary system . I think people eat too much in the summer . The body does not require much food to create the heat necessary to the system when the weather supplies quite enough , 00 I am going light on heavy foods . However , if you should happen to have fried chicken , just please remember me lovingly to a couple of bites in the second n ? ntAnt trAnttnnnt an my A noAtito . Love to all . and do n't worry about me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
