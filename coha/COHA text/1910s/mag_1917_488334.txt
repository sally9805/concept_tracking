A VOLUME of President Wilson 's war-writings  --  diplomatic notes and messages to Congress  --  has recently been published in London . To the book a preface was contributed by Lord Grey of Falladon  --  better known to Americans as Sir Edward Grey , Foreign Secretary when the war began . It has been said of him that he possesses a power of lucid statement second only to that of Mr. Asquith . He is , besides , a Liberal of the old stock . This appears in what he now says of the new Russia . The Russian Revolution and the entry of the United States into the war are , declares Lord Grey , the two great events of 1917 . He holds , differing in this from many timid folk in England and elsewhere , that , despite military setbacks , the Russia of to-day " is more powerful in the war for freedom " and will be " far more helpful in the making of peace " than a reactionary Russia could possibly have been . In words which may be commended to Tories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberal asserts : " A free Russia is a splendid increase of the freedom of the world , and whatever the immediate and passing effect upon the progress of the war , the future effect upon democracy in Europe and upon international relations generally must be most favorable and of incalculable value and benefit . " Discussing the immediate effect of the coming into the war of the United States , Lord Grey insists that it at once and forever/ made impossible a " German peace . " No conceivable military success could now bring this about . The resources and determination of America being what they are , Germany can not get peace , and the economic restoration which is her vital need , except on conditions which the United States deems essential . " It is impossible to get round this fact , " argues Lord Grey ; and he asserts that German statesmen know this perfectly . Not being able to face the fact , they turn their backs upon it , for that is the real meaning of the " organized silence " in Germany about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must bring herself to seek a peace agreeable to the United States , where is she to look for its definition ? In the utterances of President Wilson , says this British statesman , because they " satisfy and carry conviction . " Lord Grey , out of office , thus aligns himself with the official representative of the British Foreign Office , Lord Robert Cecil , who has just explained that it was not necessary for England or France to make a reply to the Pope , since President Wilson had been the " clear and powerful spokesman " for the Allies . Pursuing this thought , Lord Grey contends that the President 's view of what must come after peace is the main thing that makes it worth while to fight on  --  namely , to bring about " something constructive , " some " moral change in international relations , " with the admission by the whole world that " militarism and civilization have now become incompatible . " Towards a peace based on such conceptions , and towards a League of Nations to bring it about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look ; and Lord Grey writes in language of the greatest significance : When it is evident that at a peace conference table the Allies will meet German plenipotentiaries who will accept and share in letter and spirit , and will represent German authority that also accepts and shares in letter and spirit , the views of national policy and the aspirations for the future of the world that are contained in President Wilson 's public declarations , then therewill rightly be the strongest movements here and in the Allied countries to discuss peace . Americans have been asked not to " speculate " about peace . But they may at least note with pleasure that their own President 's terms of peace have been endorsed as right by the other nations at war with Germany . Nor need they conceal their satisfaction when , even within Germany and Austria , evidence appears that the principles laid down by the American Government are getting slow recognition . The best Liberal opinion in England hails it as a fact of enormous importance that the German and Austrian replies to the Pope clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome of the war . That there must be democratization of the German Government , too , is to-day as stoutly asserted by Scheidemann as it was by Wilson . All this does not mean that peace is coming soon , but only that the ideas essential to peace are gradually making their way . Many things must come first . There are cruel wrongs which Germany must acknowledge and repair . The blood of Belgium still crieth from the ground . But with the finger of the whole outside world now pointing Germany to the indispensables and the inevitables , it may be hoped that the German Government will soon take the needful steps towards meeting the desperate longing of the German people for peace . The German Fleet and Petrograd IN the editing of its war bulletins , the new Russia has I adopted revolutionary principles . In contrast to the policy of optimism in every other War Office , Petrograd puts the darkest complexion on the news it utters . This may be nerves , or an exaggerated method of preparing the public for the worst , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through fear . Thus it is hard to see why , close upon the first announcement of the naval battle in the Gulf of Finland last week , the decision to remove the Government to Moscow should have been announced . The statement gave the impression of a much more serious defeat than seems to have been the case . The main Russian fleet is as yet safe in the Gulf of Finland . But even if the whole Russian fleet had been put out of action , it is not easy to see why that should have forced the immediate decision to remove the Government from Petrograd . The Russian fleet by itself could never defend the capital against the Germans . It is doubtful if the Russians have more than a couple of Dreadnoughts and half a dozen older battleships in the Baltic . The safety of Petrograd lies in the mined waters of the Gulf of Finland and in the fortifications of Cronstadt , twenty miles from the capital and described in the textbooks as impregnable . If the Provisional Government really fears for the loss of Petrograd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an extraordinary tribute to German efficiency and morale , and a confession of demoralization among the defenders of Cronstadt . The Germans would then be attempting a feat which the lessons of the naval war hitherto have been thought to demonstrate as impossible , and that is to bring warships into play against mines and shore defences . What the Allies disastrously failed to accomplish in the Dardanelles , the Germans would be risking against Cronstadt . Or it may be that the adventure is not so reckless as would appear , and that Germany is counting upon a collapse of fighting power among the defenders of Cronstadt , where Bolsheviki doctrine and mutiny have flourished . Yet until events show the contrary , we must refuse to believe that this is the fact . Bolsheviki doctrine limits itself to denying the necessity of attack ; it has not repudiated the necessity of resisting attack . The Soviets have denied that the famous break in the Russian lines in Galicia last July took the form of a cowardly abandonment of trenches . They have published documents to show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 in reality perished under German gunfire in the trenches . The men on the Baltic ships fought well in the recent battle in the Gulf of Riga . Until further evidence is at hand , therefore , we may assume that it is not anticipation of a fleet attack on Cronstadt and a cowardly surrender of the fortress that is the direct cause of alarm at Petrograd . We get a hint of what the real danger may turn out to be in the evacuation of the fortified port of Reval , at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland . This event suggests an elaborate German plan for joint naval and land operations in which the fighting on sea is subsidiary . The main object would be to land troops on the shores of the Gulfs of Riga and Finland so as to take in the rear the entire Russian front now lying northest of Riga . Such points of disembarkation would be Pernau on Riga Gulf and Hapsal on Moon Sound . But Hapsal in turn is about sixty miles from Reval , and a rapid advance would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans would have attained a double success . They would have forced a Russian retirement to the line of the Petrograd-Pskoff-Dvinsk railway , involving the abandonment of the provinces of Livonia and Esthonia with an area of 25,000 square miles . They would have shifted their base of operations against Petrograd from Riga , which is 360 miles from the capital , to Reval , which is 230 miles from Petrograd . Furthermore , whereas the direct advance from Riga would lead through a difficult lake and marsh country , the advance from Reval would be across the much more favorable terrain along the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland . It is not to be supposed that such an advance would be undertaken at the beginning of winter . The operations are preliminary to a spring campaign ; but the danger is considered pressing enough at Petrograd to call for immediate action . Aside from the military results which would thus follow upon the German naval victory in the Gulf of Riga , the moral effect is not to be discounted either in Germany or among the Allies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes this dramatic demonstration of the effectiveness of the fleet . The German people will be invited to take notice that the German fleet has succeeded , where the Allies have failed , in solving the problem of mined waters and shore fortifications . It will be cited as an effective reply to the British taunt about the Kaiser 's Dreadnoughts skulking in the safety of the Kiel Canal . And unquestionably the force of the ' rejoinder will be felt abroad . The naval party in England and in this country which has been calling for an attack on the German bases will be encour-aged . Not that the argument will have gained in soundness . A naval attack on Russian fortifications is not an attack on German fortifications . The loss of capital ships to Germany would mean almost nothing ; the loss to the Allies might be fatal . Nevertheless , the outcry for more drastic naval action is pretty sure to come . The Menace of Mitteleuropa THE Kaiser 's journey to Constantinople by way of Sofia is plainly intended as a visible demonstration of Middle-Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interpreted in Allied quarters according to temperament and outlook . It may be regarded as the triumphant affirmation of a fact , or as an attempt to put life into an idea that has shown a declining vitality . For the moment we may take the view of the pessimists who find that the menace of Mitteleuropa is real and will continue to be real unless the Allies obtain a crushing military decision . This is the thesis of M. Cheradame , who insists that Germany might eschew all annexations and yet emerge victorious from the war as the head of a virtual empire of 150 millions . It is the menace recently emphasized by the Bohemian patriot leader , Professor Masaryk , in his criticism of the formula of peace without annexations . That phrase , according to Masaryk , is nominally a return to the status quo ante . In reality it will mean " the surrender to Germany of that which she has already annexed , " namely , Austria-Hungary , Turkey , and Bulgaria . " It is an annexation surpassing even the dreams of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply has been made that Middle-Europe is only a temporary military expedient which will fall apart with the coming of peace . It has been pointed out that Austria chafes under German military domination and resents the schemes for her economic absorption after the war . The proud Magyars would not tolerate the hegemony of the Berlin Junkers . The Bulgarians might not be content with their humble part in the Middle-Europe , but , counting on their strategic position as masters of the land bridge between the Black Sea and the lEgean , might pursue their own ambitions of a great Balkan state under Bulgar leadership . The Turks , with no love lost for the Germans , might conceivably be found on the other side in a future test of strength . But in all cases the rejoinder would be that these are mere possibilities which the world dare not weigh against the present fact that Germany does control Middle-Europe . The Austrians may chafe , but they can not forget that German armies have saved them repeatedly from destruction . So with Hungary and Turkey . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Cheradame and Masaryk ask us to contemplate is the result of an Austro-Hungarian army brought up to the level of German efficiency , of Turkey reinforced with strategic railways and German military leadership and money ; in short , of a population of 150 millions mobilized by the General Staff at Berlin . For a really convincing refutation of the peril of Middle-Europe we must turn to what men are now saying , not in sanguine Allied quarters , but within Middle-Europe itself . No less a person than the protagonist of the Middle-Europe idea , Dr. Friedrich Naumann , is now beset with serious doubts as to whether his ideal of an economically self-sufficient Central Europe is attainable or desirable . Naumann has recently been arguing for the old Free Trade doctrines , for the interdependence of nations , and against the Allied policy of the " organization of economic death . " As a writer in the New Europe argues , the advocates of Middle-Europe have been living for three years in just the kind of self-sufficient economic block they have contemplated , only todiscover " that life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool , silk , leather , and jute , of animal and vegetable fats , of lubricating oils , of tea , coffee , and cocoa , of copper , tin , nickel , not to speak of foodstuffs , is so squalid and lowering as to be almost unendurable . " We know from experience how little relief the people of Germany have obtained from the abundant food supplies which they have been so frequently invited to contemplate , first from Turkey , and then from Bulgaria , and then from conquered Rumania . Even here a rejoinder is possible . It may be said that Middle-Europe will not remain economically isolated ; that we can depend upon immediate self-interest in Allied countries to assert itself when the first heat of enmity has passed with the coming of peace , and that England and Russia will not refuse to do business with their best customer . It follows that Middle-Europe would be only a fiction economically , but a very dread reality in a military sense . Middle-Europe will not starve in times of peace , and when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 150 millions . But we may admit all this , and yet maintain that once war has broken out Middle-Europe will not be much better off than Central Europe is to-day ; not better off economically and not better off in the field . This confession is virtually made by Gen. von Freytag-Loringhoven , deputy chief of the General Staff in Berlin , in his new book , " Lessons from the World War , " of which the main thesis has been summed up by a reviewer in the following words : " The armies have lost the power of bringing about a radical decision in the war , and the strategic situation depends on economic conditions . " Of Germany 's enemies FreytagLoringhoven plaintively remarks that they " have new possibilities of resistance constantly opened up to them , because the sea is theirs , and so victories which would once upon a time have been absolutely decisive , and the conquest of whole kingdoms , have not brought Germany any nearer to peace . " The moral is obvious . Germany may practice domination in Middle-Europe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hapsburg armies ; she may build strategic railways in Turkey ; she may begin another war with a more formidable rush than the one on Paris ; but so long as " the strategic situation depends on economic conditions " she can not impose her will on the considerable fraction of the world outside the frontiers of Middle-Europe . What Do the Soldiers Read ? NO small part of the keen curiosity that the world has felt concerning trench warfare relates to the use of idle time . In an army that was never on the march , never free of the foe , how was the strain relieved in the hours off duty ? Specifically , what would one who formed a bit of a living wall against a wall of fire and steel feel like reading ? Few subjects could be more tempting to the speculator in psychology , who in such a matter could make out a most plausible case for any conclusion he chose to reach . But it is not necessary to rely upon guessing , masquerading as reasoning . We have a mass of particulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the war . The night after hostilities were declared between Germany and England , an Englishwoman , Mrs. H. M. Gaskell , lay awake wondering how she could help in the struggle . Recalling how much a certain book she had read during a recent illness had meant to her , she was taken with the idea of providingreading matter for the men at the front , in hospitals , and elsewhere . In a few days Lady Battersea lent her mansion for the work . Lord Haldane officially approved the plan , and the first call for books went out . The response was immediate  --  and mixed . Empty wagons had to be hired and kept at the door for the refuse that people had seized the opportunity of sending under the pretext of being charitable . Old parish magazines were received and sent to the pulp-makers by the tens of thousands . Enterprising householders were soon raking up copies of Punch bearing the date 1846 , " Hints to Mothers , " " How to Cut a Blouse , " " Guides to English Watering-Places , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the Tombs , " and patriotically dumping them upon the volunteer distributers . Yet the first call brought a full million well-selected books , which included rare editions of standard authors . The latter were sold , and the proceeds invested in volumes of the kind most needed . So was started an activity that speedily grew and branched until it has become one of the great departments of war-work . Merely to collect adequate information about it is a task of no small size , but this has been done , and the facts organized into an interesting story , by Theodore Wesley Koch , chief of the Order Division of the Library of Congress . His account , which has been appearing in the Library Journal of the New York Public Library , is now reprinted in enlarged form in a pamphlet having the title , " Books in Camp , Trench , and Hospital . " A glance at these pages suggests that the question of soldiers ' reading should be revised to run , What do the soldiers not read ? " Boswell and Pepys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , the Bible , Nat Gould , Words-worth 's ' Prelude , ' ' Famous Boxers , ' the Koran , Miss Austen , Mark Twain , Marie Corelli , Macaulay , London Opinion , the Round Table , go side by side . " And this not by any chance arrangement , but in response to expressed preferences from the front . Mr. Koch tells of a German soldier and his son who had been sent from Verdun to the Russian front , where they were wounded and captured . In adjoining beds they were furnished by the Y. M. C. A. with a copy of " Oliver Twist " and a Russian grammar . In the same ward was a young Berlin professor who had done research work in the British Museum . His brooding was relieved by the gift of the " Christmas Carol " and the inevitable Russian grammar . A count who was a prisoner in a Russian camp asked for a good American story . He received " Black Rock , " and pronounced it one of the best novels he had ever read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send him ten others of the same kind from America " after the war . " A visit to Petrograd enabled the secretary to gratify this desire earlier than the date the count had named , and Ralph Connor , Gene Stratton Porter , and Jack London never had more grateful readers than the count and his companions in adversity . But surely , some one will say , there are books that most soldiers like better than they like others . This is true . " Detective stories are shouted for . " The " favorite " authors " come in grand procession of favor , " Kipling , Jacobs , Florence Barclay , John Oxenham , Rider Haggard , Dumas , Stevenson . According to this , soldiers are very much like noncombatants . The parallel goes further . Like non-combatants , they have their " highbrows . " Whether or not it is these that called for the " Hundred Best Poems " and even the " Hundred Best Love Poems " may be matter of controversy , but there is no mistaking the " smart young soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy of Browning . He had profited by three weeks in the convalescence camp " to read for the first time the whole of Keats and Wordsworth , and was just beginning Browning . " The ambitious soldier was a musician , but " you ca n't bring a ' cello with you on active service " and so he had " fallen back more on reading , " of which he was always fond , but of which he had done more in ten months in camp than in any ten months at home . He was looking out for a copy of Shelley or Francis Thompson . He must have been related to the man who was reading Macaulay 's " History of England . " A sergeant asked for half a dozen copies of Omar Khayyam to give his men at Christmas . One soldier who knew nothing of Dickens before he enlisted except the " Tale of Two Cities " had read in France " David Copper-field " and " Great Expectations " and was deep in " Our Mutual Friend . " All this takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent in a request for " The Agricultural Holding Act , a Motor Manual , Practical Navigation , Bee-Keeping , and Furniture ( periods and styles ) . " No armies ever read like the armies of to-day , because no armies could read as they can read . Just why and how the struggle affects literary inclinations is less important than the fact that among the items on the credit side of the terrible balance-sheet are better acquaintance with literature , major and minor , and a stronger tendency to turn to it as to a better world . High Comedy and Low Brows T HERE are regularly recurrent moments in the amusement season when the orbits of the lowbrow and the highbrow touch . The circus is one such instance . The advent of Fred Stone is another . Sporadic contacts occur when Broadway imports some European example of super-clowning or fairy tale like " Sumurun " or " Kismet . " Then the way is made easy for the lowbrow  --  and proud of it , sir 1 ? to confess that there is something in this thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share in the elemental tastes of our common humanity . Yet such contacts , regular and irregular , are still too rare in the theatrical solar system . When it comes to the drama we are a pitifully hyphenated nation . The very zest with which we acknowledge the primitive art of Fred Stone only emphasizes the normal cleavage . We need not be so cruel as to insist that in the enthusiastic tributes to Mr. Stone there is a touch of condescension or at least of self-consciousness , testifying to a lingering sense of doubt as to whether one is , after all , doing the proper thing . With all such reservations , we can only be thankful for the fervor with which the creator of the Wizard of Oz is regularly received ; for the warmth that greets the perennial return of Maude Adams and Peter Pan ; for minor signs which give basis for the hope that we shall not always , in the field of the drama , remain a divided nation . Before this tious boredom of poetic drama or high comedy . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Intimate Theatres which have marched to the attack of the " commercial " drama under the banner of Dunsany , Chekhov , and , let it be said frankly , even Maeterlinck . It is wrong in the fact and disastrous in the result to assume that only the proletariat can guffaw in the theatre , but that the better sort of drama must be received with polite laughter . The mischief is double . It means that the masses who insist on laughing aloud can not be won over to the higher forms of the theatre , and that the select audiences can not be permanently kept ; for even in the very best circles the need for full-mouthed enjoyment must be frequently felt . Strange , that precisely among us , where cultural distinctions are at a minimum , the outward symbols should pretend to extremes . London , Paris , Berlin , Moscow , know how to combine gusto with imagination , " pep " with esthetic enjoyment , the " punch " with intellectuality ; but for us it is apparently a choice between vaudeville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for high-class fooling , but not superfine fooling . Our difficulties are much like the trouble which Mr. 0 . W. Firkins finds with English poetry , in his admirable article in the Atlantic . He feels that poetry has been refined , gemmed , and beautified away from contact with the common life and the limited capacity of the normal man for sustained esthetic sensation . Not that we have anything in the drama which lies open to the charge of being too beautiful and uplifting for the normal man ; but the efforts for a national " drama " do suggest some such ideal . Mr. Firkins is driven to find in the " Biglow Papers " the synthesis he longs for , " the capacity of dialect to set forth lofty purpose and vigorous thought , and to skim lightly up and down the long scale that divides the grotesque from the sublime . " That is the problem , how to be lofty without ceasing to be vigorous , how to make use of the ladder of the grotesque in our commendable efforts towards higher things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true nature of the problem . It is something that the art of Joseph Urban has been enlisted in the service of musical comedy and " girl shows . " It is something that theatrical managers are developing a taste for the unusual play , unusual , that is , in its combination of the lost art of dialogue with whimsy , audacity , buffoonery , it does not matter what , so long as it is zestful . Of this new promise in the theatre , the name of Clare Kummer will instantly occur as the most encouraging example . In the short space of two years she has done more for the reunion of laughter and taste than all of our pretentious Leagues , and Intimate Theatres , and Repertory Theatres . But in the path of Clare Kummer the old danger is looming up . Her work , never very robust in structure , though hearty in appeal , is getting " thinner . " She seems to be in peril of succumbing to the filmiest of dressmaking for popular " stars . " But there is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at paradox , in the very praise which has been bestowed on Miss Kummer as a creator of " high comedy . " High comedy is being too easily accepted as the study of manners among a sophisticated and well-moneyed class . High comedy without the quotation marks is by no means that exclusively . Let us mention only Moliere . Concern with the doings of " polite society " will in the long run prove fatal . In the first place we have only the simulacrum of such a class , and the product is bound to be artificial . In the second place , even if we had that class , it would be necessary to pass it by in our search for that elemental vigor combined with intellectual grace which is our greatest need . The solution lies with the playwright , and he will ultimately find his task easier if he assumes that he can get the material for fun , with thought , in the broad spaces of our national life , instead of looking for it in the limousine class .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
