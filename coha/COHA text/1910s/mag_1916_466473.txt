IT is surprising what a large number of us never see the sky , never see it intimately , that is to say , if such a word may he applied to our relations with immensity Dwellers in cities or towns , travelers of illuminated highways , we never hobnob with Orion nor feel the earth ball swinging east below the still procession of the stars . We make our plans for the morrow , when they depend on the weather , not by consulting the heavens , but the newspaper . The sunset means little to us , and the sunrise we never see . A high flotilla of little wind-clouds on a summer day , a vast Himalaya of cumuli piled against the blue , a scudding cloud-wrack where the moon rides like a golden galleon in a heavy sea , the great downward swoop of the Milky Way , are magnificent handiworks of space we do not know , meaningless and unobserved . Poor bond-slaves to our canon walls and municipal illumination , we yet walk in our pride and have quaint pity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yankee farmer who watches the clouds after sunrise , the action of the mist curtain on the mountainside , to see if he shall cut his hay that morning . Yet those of us who dwell in the open have our pride , too , and our pity for those who do not know how the firmament showeth His handiwork , those to whom the simple question , " Well , what 's it going to do to-morrow ? " is not fraught with profound importance . In the old days before the government took a hand at prophecy and gave its weather reports each day to the papers , every rural community boasted its own " weather prophet , " who read the heav- , , ens for signs and very often displayed an uncanny shrewdness in prediction . Such a one was Levi Beebe , who lived on Bear Town Mountain in western Massachusetts , and whose fame is still perpetuated by a tablet beside the Berkshire County street railroad . These old-time prophets shared , of course , in the common weather lore of the countryside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it no doubt brought from England by the early colonists , but still more of it the slow accumulation of rural American observers . Not a little of it persists to this day , and the farther back you get into the country the larger it bulks in the speech , even in the belief , of the natives . Was there ever an American boy who did not learn that Mackerel sky Never leaves the earth dry ? Is there a country child , even to-day , who does not hope to see the new moon over his right shoulder , which will bring him good luck , and , if he makes a wish , will cause that wish to come true , especially if it is a wish for money and is accompanied by the jingling of some loose change in the pocket ? Weather superstitions are no less deeply ingrained than this one . The moon , indeed , is vastly important . Not only was it once supposed that all crops , especially onions and beans , did better when planted in the old of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would run to vine ) , but even in this day of popularized science you will hear farmers say , as they look at the young crescent , " It 's goin ' to be a dry month , " or " It 's goin ' to be a wet month . " In the city you will never see the new moon ; some tall building will i always hide it . But in the country , as the sunset glow is dying out , as the bird songs are hushed and the night insects have not begun their antiphonal chorus , in " the still time of the world , " you will suddenly become aware in the west of that sweetly curved , golden crescent , dropping down , perhaps , into a feathery tree-top , or hung over quiet water , or poised on the tip of a pointed fir . It was " an old Injun sign " that if you can hang your powder-horn on the new moon , it is going to be a dry month . If you ca n't , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to some primitive belief that rains come from the moon . If the crescent were tipped up enough to hold the powder-horn on one point , it meant the crescent would hold water , too ; otherwise , the water would spill out . Though nowadays this primitive prediction is made with a smile , as I listened to the farmer who made it I have more than once been reminded of a little cousin of mine who stoutly affirmed there were no fairies , but when she went to " Peter Pan " she applauded as loudlyasanyat MissAdams'sappeal fora ! ! who believed in fairies to clap their hands . " But I thought you did n't believe in fairies ? " said her mother . " I do n't , " she answered . " But I do n't want Tinker Bell to die . " The skipper of the Hesperus was wise to another belief about moon signs . Therefore , he argued , they were in for a storm , and events certainly proved him right . It has always been a common belief that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be further added that the number of stars visible inside the moon ring indicate the number of days before the storm will come . There is a good deal of sense to this belief , of course , for the ring means thick atmosphere , and the thicker it is , the fewer stars will be visible inside it ( or , for that matter , anywhere else ! ) . The moon ring is still used by country weather prophets as a basis of prediction , and in this past winter I have several times seen it prove a reliable prognosticator of snow . However , I believe the scientists now say that if the storm comes , it is merely a coincidence . When the moon is riding high and small through a d riving cloud-wrack , the farmer , on his way in from his last trip to the barn , pauses to contemplate it , and is aware of the curious alternation of moonlight and shadow over the landscape , almost like slow lightning flashes indefinitely prolonged . The distant fields , the tim- be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly they are obliterated again as a dark cloud sweeps across the moon , and the world seems to shiver . Then the farmer says to himself , " Open and shet , Is a sign of wet , " and looks , perhaps , to see if the spout is adjusted over the rain-barrel , or thinks of the hay he had to leave out in the field . Or is it only in the morning that this sign holds ? Opinions differ in different sections . Whether " open and shet " is a sign of wet depends , of course , on the quality of the clouds and the direction of the wind , whether by night or morning , and to read these more intricate signs aright was the province once of the weather prophets . That they could tell so unerringly , as many of them often did , whether the clouds were " wind clouds , " or were shredded off from some storm that would not advance farther , whether they threatened actual precipitation , or whether changes of temperature were due which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their powers of observation and deduction . I once knew an old woman who lived under the shadow of the White Mountains , and whose instinct for weather changes was almost uncanny . She did not have barometrical bones , either , as so many old people maintain they have . Her deductions were all based on observation . Once , I recall , she was taking in some clothes from the line at ten o'clock at night ? a still , starlit night without a cloud . I saw her shadow bobbing about huge and fantastic on the barn wall , thrown from the lantern she carried in her left hand , and went out to ask her whly she took the clothes in . " There cloud in the sky all day , " she said , " and to-night the mountain 's talkin ' . " I listened carefully , and , sure enough , in the silence I could hear , three thousand feet above us , the steady rush of wind through the stunted spruce forest at timber-line . Up there the wind was roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the noisy hurricane rushes silently through the upper spaces where there is nothing to oppose it ? that force by itselfis silent . There seemed to me something almost Celtic , too , in this old Yankee woman 's imagery . And her prediction proved correct ; the next day came a deluge . In this connection , I wonder how many boys used to do what we lads did twenty-five years ago in eastern Massachusetts . We would lay our ears to the telegraph-poles , and if the wires were buzzing , " as we put it , we felt sure we Were in for bad weather . This quaint superstition could not have had an ancient origin , surely , for the telegraph is a nineteenth-century creation . Yet it is equally certain that we did nut invent the superstition for ourselves . it was handed down to us from our elders. - - Akin to the saying that " open and shet is a sign of wet " is the ancient saw that if you can see enough blue sky to make a pair of Dutchman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found this saving almost universally familiar to young and old , in various parts of the country . flow well I remember , in my childhood , the wide divergencies of opinion which used to develop between me and my parents regarding the exact amount of material required for a Dutchman 's nether garments ! Standing at the western windows , or on the veranda , I would gaze hopefully at the cloud dome overhead , looking for a rift , and when one appeared I would rush to my mentors with the information . It did no good to look for it in the east , for unless the west cleared my father affirmed that no dependence could he placed even on the bluest sky . Dragging my parents back to the window , I would point to my rift of blue , and triumphantly affirm it would make at least six pairs of breeches , only to be told that I had n't the most rudimentary knowledge of Dutch fashions . Before I was allowed to venture forth on my fishing-trip or i hunting expedition , it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the parting cloud-wrack . Never did proverb have a more annoying flexibility of interpretation than that one ! The farmer , the dweller in the open , rises early and looks at once to the sky . Quite aside from any material considerations , indeed , the weather to each of us seems of as much importance as the temper of our companions , and almost as intimate . We look at the thermometer as soon as we descend the stairs , just as we look at it the last thing before going to bed . We gaze at the eastern horizon , at the portent of the sky , and often take our mood therefrom . We step out , perhaps , to see if the " cobwebs " are on the grass , or if there has been a heavy dew ( both prophecies to the weather-wise ) , and in the freshness of the new-waked world we lift our heads to the great dome of the sky ? felt only as a dome when the eye can rove the full horizon ? and see there the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun which has not yet chased the shadows from the world about our feet , riding to meet the dawn . The sun heaves up above the world rim , the shiver of night chill suddenly departs as the long , golden rays stream over the mountains and across the valley to our feet , the birds redouble their song , and , look- ing aloft again , we see the army of little white clouds , like spiritsof the night , vanishing mysteriously away as if they melted into the blue . Such is the dawning of a fair summer day . But there are other mornings when the clouds hang heavier , and low in the heavens , and those of us who are not weather-wise are in doubt , asking the first neighbor we meet , " Well , what 's it going to do to-day ? " Invariably , then , both questioner and questioned come toa pause , and both lift their faces and study the sky , once more aware of it as something near and intimate . If the sun goes into a cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rapidly " clouds up , " we are told that the rain is certain to arrive , and most of us have come by experi- ence to believe the saying . Connected with this bit of weather-lore , of course , is the familiar rhyme : Another early-morning sign to look for is the action of the cattle . If they liedown as soon as they are turned out to pasture , they are supposed to feel rheumatic weariness in their hones , like the old folks , due to an approaching storm . However , this superstition about the cattle is not confined alone to their early morning actions . If at any time of the day the cows are seen lying down , some one is sure to say , " It 's going to rain . " But the true weather prophets know that only in the first hours of the day is the sign significant . Parenthetically , we might suggest that a delightful essay is yet to be written on " Bones as Barometers . " Almost every family has at least one member who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the fact that rheumatism is now known to be a muscular complaint having no effect on the hallowed phraseology . And in my boyhood there was not a village so small but it boasted a veteran whose honorable bullet-wound throbbed at the approach of a storm . During the day there are a thousand signs to observe , if you are wise in weather-lore , quite too numerous to mention here . There is , for instance , the whirlwind , a little spiral of dust and dry leaves which so often springs up mysteriously and goes waltzing across a road or field . If it revolves from right to left , the weather will continue fair , butif it revolves the other way , rain will soon follow . Then , too , if you see the sheep feeding more eagerly than usual , look out for rain , or if the frogs arc jumping with unwonted liveliness in the meadows . If the chimney-swallows flock high and dart about excitedly , watch for thunder-showers or high wind , while if the barn-swallows fly very low , rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chickens . If they stay under cover , the storm will not last long . If , however , they go out into the yard or runway , in spite of the wetting , the storm may be expected to continue for some time . Evidently the theory here is that they say to themselves : " Oh , what 's the use ? It 's going to last all day ! ' and plunge out into the rain . The heavens , too , must be constantly observed . Select a single cloud for observation , and if it grows larger , that is a had sign If it diminishes , fair weather may be expected . On the other hand , it is very suspicious if the sky is absolutely cloudless all day . Perhaps there is a hint of Puritan pessimism in this belief ; nothing so perfect can long endure in this vale of tears ! Again , watch the direction the clouds are taking , or keep an eye on the vane , and , if the wind is backing around into the fair-weather quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go around into the west by the full route before fair weather can be hoped for . When sunset comes , the summer boarders go out on the pasture knoll to rhapsodize , the farmer scans the west carefully to predict therefrom to-morrow 's weather . A red sun-ball means a hot day coming . If the westering sun is " drawing water , " look out for rain . Drawing water , perhaps we should explain , is the Yankee phrase to describe the shining of the sun through distant clouds so that it sends down fanlike ribs of light toward the horizon . As a matter of fact , it is a bad sign in general if the sun sets in a cloud . ( In New York State , I have been told it is a bad sign if the sun sets clear . ) Certain other sunsets are portentous of cold , perhaps because they look so cold . It is chiefly in winter that the sun sinks through a belt of pure , cool amber , leaving a still cooler green above , which melts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked tree will stand out in startling , lacy silhouette , disclosing all the intricate beauty of its limbs , but looking chill enough the while . Such a sunset , for all its loveliness , makes us turn gratefully to the red window squares in . the house hehind , and sniff the pungent smell of wood smoke from the chimney . In autumn , too , and more rarely in summer , when we see such a sunset claim , " It 's going to be a cold morrow " ? and generally it is . After sunset , the stars , as well as the moon , may still tell you something of the weather . A neighbor of mine who used to be an almost unerring weather prophet till he began taking the Federal weather map and tried to predict scientifically , since when he has been flagrantly unreliable and has lost his former delightful assurance , used to startle me sometimes on a vivid , starry night by gazing up into the spangled sky , through an opening between our elms , and wisely affirming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning rain ) . Time after time his prophecy was fulfilled , to my admiration and wonder . Finally he let me into the secret . He always made the prediction when the southeast branch of the Milky Way could be plainly seen , in its great downward swoop . After all , then , his lore was the same as the common saying that a day of unusual atmospheric clarity means foul weather ahead , for our rain-storms come so generally from the southeast that he was nearly always safe in his boastful little flourish about the direction of the wind , put on to increase my admiration . The weather sharps in old South County , Rhode Island , have a similarly mysterious method of prediction . Looking out across the blue water to the line where it meets the paler sky , on a brilliant , cloudless day , they mournfully predict rain , and shake their heads when you ask for an explanation . The prediction is always based , however , on the fact that Block Island can be seen with unusual distinctness . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many summers have taught me that it is extremely low . Old South County ! The mere name calls to my mind the pictures of wide horizons and a great , blue , doming sky , an " inverted howl " so spacious that not even Omar could feel " cooped " or compelted to " crawl " beneath it , and out over the sea to the eastward , in the level light of afternoon , cloud ships of pearl and sea-shell pink riding peacefully at anchor . How good it is for the soul to look into those deep sea spaces , those leagues of upper air ! How good it is for the soul to look out into the open , anywhere , when the world is still and the heavens imminent and familiar ! I love to go out to a point of vantage in our mountain valley and watch the snowstorm coming , wiping out the distant summits first with its great white battle-smoke , the upper edges of its clouds feathery and vague so that they melt into the silver-gray sky , and then pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon us and hurling in our faces the first cool , stinging shot of its beneficent shrapnel . I love to watch some great thunderhead , dark as a cannon 's mouth , mass behind a steep , wooded mountain wall , a cloud with an ominous glitter in its sharply defined edges , edges so sharp at first that they would seem almost cut out of sheet-metal and laid against the blue were it not for the fact that we are aware of the immense aerial perspective behind them , between the thunderhead and the roof of the sky . Against such a cloud an ancient white birch will often stand out with startling distinctness , like a white lightning stab . The vast mass seems to swell and grow from within itself . The ominously glittering rim moves up toward the sun , crosses it , wipes half the light off the landscape , and then suddenly , from the under side , comes the white mist of the rain , obliterates the distant mountains , walks down their slopes , marches up the valley , and we dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn , perhaps , just as the great drops hit the drive , kicking up little puffs of dust . I love ? and only too well , I fear ? to sit in my garden summer-house , forgetful of the task before me , and gaze out on a summer day over the beds where the bees are busy in the blue veronica and the goldfinches are swaying in the cosmos , to the doming hardwoods on the hill beyond , which throw their leafy outlines against the lower slopes of vast mountain ranges , mighty Himalayas VOL . CXXXIII. ? No. 793. - 14robed in eternal snow , but with no terror in their billowy ravines ? the ethereal heights of the cumuli . A great , snowy , pink-tipped cumulus cloud above a doming green hill , rising into the blue of the summer sky , the hum of bees , the scent of flowers , and far off , perhaps , the sweet shrill of children at play ? who for such a picture would not neglect his work ? Who , indeed , but would let even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " It is very like a camel , " would reply , " By the mass , and ' t is like a camel , indeed , " and when he said , " Or like a whale ? " would answer quite as cheerfully , " Very like a whale . " After all , camel or whale or Mount Everest ? what does it matter ? It is a great white cloud on a summer day ! But it is when we leave the city abruptly , where we have scarcely been aware of moon or stars , sunsets or sun-risings , and go into camp , perhaps , on the shore of some forest lake , or on the shoulder of a mountain , that we become most startlingly aware of the importance of the weather and the beauty and imminence of the sky . What camper , rising in the night to poke a dying fire , or waking on the ground with unaccustomed aches , has not looked up in sudden astonishment to the vault of stars , amazed at their number , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they are shedding a perceptihle radiance around him which he had never detected on his electrically illumined pavements ? What camper on the mountainside , as he turned over on his back and looked up , nothing in his field of vision but the spire of stunted spruce and the great garden of the stars , has failed to sense with something akin to awe the eastward swing of the earth ball , a sense so sharp sometimes that all the stars seem the torches of a great procession marching by the other way , far aloft in tht midnight ? It is at such moments that the little cares and perplexities and ambitions of our human life seem most to fall away , to shrink into insignificance , and we feel new springs of power pouring in from the silent places ; or , at the very least , we wonder if , after all , the life which is lived close to the earth and the sky does not hold something we have lost in our hurry , our herding , our unrest .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
