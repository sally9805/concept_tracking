Zfie NeW REPUBLIC A Journal of Opinion VOLUME XVII New York , Saturday , December 21 , 1918 Number 216 Contents honld be dispelled by the record of the President 's reception in France . The French people have f ' und an occasion for an immense release of send-1:lents of friendship towards America . The French 11d the American nations have thereby been made more acutely conscious of their fundamental fellow feel ' fig , ' in the future as well as in the recent past . It is to be anticipated that , as the formal negotia ti:ns of the peace conference proceed , we shall hear less of agreement and more of dissension between f ! nations . The voices of politicians clamoring and the satisfaction of nationalistic and partisan d class aspirations will be heard above the mur-41wrs of world brotherhood . But the politicians cognize that in a world in which popular feeling is so alive as has been demonstrated in If reception accorded to the President , it will ti Well to place a curb upon selfish aspirations . th ? c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the peoples are capable of g the work into their own hands . RESIDENT POINCARLI 'S address most adroitly raised the points in which the views of the French representatives may oppose those of the American , while keeping them in apparent subordination to the points in which the nations are at one . President Poincare intimated that he was not overconfident in the ability of the nations to abolish war . Therefore he looks to a peace settle-ment that will inflict exemplary punishment and make further aggression on the part of Germany impossible . He does not speak of strategic frontiers , punitive indemnities , commercial boycotts . But there is room for all of these under the French President 's moderate phrases . But President Wilson was equally adroit in his reply . He accepts the justice of imposing punishment upon those who have been responsible for acts of terror and spoliation . But the peace of the world , the President intimated , is to be secured , not by the character of the peace treaty alone but " by the constant ' association and cooperation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace through the organization of a league of nations appears as clearly as peace by power appears under the phrases of President Poincare . R. McADOO 'S recommendation of a five years ' experiment of unified governmental operation of railways appears reasonably fair to all concerned . The interests of the railway stockholders and bondholders would probably be safer under an extension of the existing agreement than they would be under such arrangements for the return of the railways as are at present politically practicable . So far as we know , very few railway men would care to have the railways returned to private , control without a thorough revision of the system of governmental control . But such a revision is sure to encounter tremendous popular opposition if put through before all the rights and wrongs of the case have been thoroughly aired , in Congress and outside of it . A five year period would give full opportunity for making the matter clear to the whole people , and for devising a new system , fair to both the railways and the public , under which the railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned ? That is indeed a contingency to be taken into account . If the government proves able to run the railways efficiently for five years , the demand for public ownership may become irresistible . If the government manages the railways as badly as the railway men prognosticate , the five year experiment will put a final quietus upon the agitation for public ownership . T HERE is at least one body of Christians who are not in a time of sore moral temptation joining the cry for revenge . The Joint Commission on Social Service of the Protestant Episcopal Church has issued a Peace Message which , if it could be read on Christmas from every pulpit might break down some of the barriers which now separate so many professing Christians from Christ . It begins by calling on all thoughtful men in the solemn hour of victory to turn away from the past and towards the future . Civilization , having just been saved from the menace of military autocracy , must now be saved from no less dangerous internal perils . It is a time for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in the great catastrophe no nation is entirely blameless and all may share repentance . " Penitence should be crystallized in the resolution to secure at any sacrifice " a new world order where mutual distrust , imperialistic ambition , exploitation of backward peoples , competition for markets should be replaced by international comity and cooperation . " The treatment of the Central Powers after the war should " aim rather at reformation than at retribution . " The treatment of the problems of domestic reconstruction should seek to plough up the roots of the unsocialism and the improperty , which furnish the great threat to civilization . The Commis .. sion " earnestly urges the Church at large to study the programme of the British Labor Party , characterized by Bishop Brent ' as the one great re. , ligious utterance of the war . ' " The four pillars of this programme , that is , the guaranty to all members of the community of the essentials of healthy life and worthy citizenship , democratic control of industry , a revolution in national finance in the in. terest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common good are endorsed as the probable " bases for reconstruction policies in many countries . " The commission follows the Bishop , rat Oxford in favoring " property for use , " and in deploring " property for power . " If Christians fail to seek in the spirit and message of Christ the cure for social maladies , the needed changes are likely to be accomplished not by " general consent " but by " revolutionary methods . " // INDEMNITIES for damage to shipping in : I flicted by the naval forces of the Central Powers is complicated by the difficulty of deteraiin. ing to whom the money shall be paid . Assume that an American ship carrying grain to Sweden was torpedoed by a German submarine , and that the German government has paid for the loss . Shall the money go to the owner of the ship ? Unless extraordinarily negligent , he had taken out war risk ' insurance , and has already been paid the full value of the ship by the insurance company . Shall it go to the insurance company which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the company has received premiums from shipowners which have much more than made up the loss . Why not then refund out of the indemnity the war risk premiums which the shipowner has had to pay ? But the she owner is hardly entitled to this , for he has already compelled the owner of the cargo to pay a freight rate which covered all his expenses including war risk premiums , and a fat profit besides . Shall the money be paid , then , to the Swedish exporter of grain , to make up for the fantastic freight rate that was forced upon him ? Assuming that the goer- osity of our statesmen extends to Sweden , even this will not be pursuing the matter far enough , for the Swedish grain importer has already prudently eluded the high freight rate in the price of flour ' and passed it on , via the retail dealer , to the bre ! ' eaters of Sweden . The truth is that , excepting sporadic cases of loss in trades not yet adjusted to war conditions , damage inflicted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; tributed so widely throughout the commercial lab ? of the world that any attempt to trace its incidencei to individual persons will be futile . The corrinaulit/ has suffered the loss , not the person on whom it pened in the first instance to fall . Any comPerlsao ton made by the Central Powers should be paid ts the government , to be used to make good the los which the nation as a whole has suffered . Any othe course will lead to an unseemly scramble rival rival claimants , and to the unjust enrichment of 0 ' most successful . ITT-I the resignation of Fremont Older , ai5 managing editor , the San Francisco PuLe letin , long our foremost liberal advocate on the Pacific coast , seems in the one transaction to hale lost its head completely and sold its soul to the Chamber of Commerce . Greeting the Presidelltis message before Congress as an admission for ? , po own lips that the fourteen points and all boul'if and social reforms to which he has pledged hill/se were mere tools of strategy , to be discarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomes r President back to the fold of one hundred per cell Americans who have no use for " impractical idealism , " and " Utopian reform . " In other words we begin again where the war interrupted us , setting aside our gains and knuckling down to the old " tried and true course of unrestrained competition . " " ( And who , " the editorial continues , " will deny that it was a pretty good old world after all , leaveing out of account a few agitators and kickers ? " C ONCRETE shipbuilding is still beset with unsolved problems ; yet it would be difficult to point to any other industry that has made so promising a beginning . The Faith , whose construction evoked the laughter of the incredulous , has inade her way from the Pacific to New York , with many thousands of profitable freight miles behind She may be heavy and ungainly , but she has borne the stresses of weather well . We have yet to hear complaints from the men who risked their capital in her . Apparently she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , the Atlantus , has been launched from a Georgia yard . In design and construction the . Atlantus represents a great advance ? er the Faith . The new ship is light , as compared With ships of wood or steel of equal capacity , and She is beautiful , which probably does n't matter . She was intended to cost less than a wood or steel Ship , but the Emergency Fleet Corporation used her to work out all manner of technical problems Whose solution is a necessary first step toward a prosperous development of concrete shipbuilding . It Is too early to forecast that development , but no o that who has observed recent progress will affirm cilat the monopoly of the steel ship is secure . We may yet live to see the oceans dotted over with stone nibs ? OING justice generally at the expense of Germany is an idea so popular nowadays that there is is even a measureable current of opinion in al'or of returning Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark . phis would diminish Germany 's population by a million and a half , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kiel Canal in neutral hands . That canal , like our Panama Canal , was of vast 1p ? tential naval value in the period of competitive armaments . Without the Kiel Canal Germany Iv 341d have been compelled to maintain two fleets , it ne in the Baltic and one in the North Sea ; just as , Without later the Panama Canal , we should sooner or ' tel. have been compelled to maintain a fleet in the kt , lantic and another in the Pacific . It is therefore ; 1111te natural that statesmen seeking a means to keep Seriously Germany permanently weak should consider e , riously all possible methods of depriving her of the Kiel Canal . But before accepting the plan of rlle turning Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark , it may be worth while to inquire into the wishes of the Danes . Do they want to become guardians of the Kiel Canal ? No more than a sensible citizen living among thugs wants to wear a priceless diamond . If ever there should be another European war , Germany would strike for the Kiel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Belgium . And to what end ? The greater part of Schleswig-Holstein is German , not Danish . If the duchies were annexed to Denmark , there would be two Germans under the Danish flag to every seven Danes . That is a kind of national adulteration no people gifted with common sense would desire . Denmark wishes nothing but the return of the Danish section of Schleswig , and even this she does not want unless the population immediately affected desires it . If the nations want the Kiel Canal taken away from Germany they will have to find some other victim to hold it . HAT there is a " reign of terror " in Russia nobody disputes . A great many persons are being done to death , some of them on very flimsy charges . The Bolsheviki are killing not only counter-revolutionists , but also traitors , grafters and common thieves and robbers , and the aggregate of executions must be appallingly great . Whether it is so great as that of the French revolution nobody knows as yet . All the avenues of information have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have been equally generous in their allocation of space to reporters who have seen things by day and reporters who see things by night . The truth is hopelessly beclouded in propaganda and lying . But of one thing we may be absolutely certain . For every person who will have perished at the hands of the revolutionary tribunals , a hundred will have perished by starvation . And America and her Allies have not only done nothing to relieve the menace of famine , but they have actually looked upon it with a certain grim satisfaction , believing that famine would lead to the overthrow of the Bolsheviki . We may have excellent political and economic reasons for hating the Bolsheviki . But so long as we admit mass starvation into our tactics , let us not make too prominent a point of our humanitarian objection to their policy . MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAM C. GOR-GAS , redeemer of the American tropics from the curse of yellow fever , is the next candidate for a place on Mr. Ralph Easley 's little list . If Mr. Easley can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to evidence of Bolshevism . Speaking of the evils of overcrowding the General has declared : " In practice we are now putting into effect the most important sanitary measure for the correction of this evil . I refer to the increase in wages that has occurred all over the United States . My experience has taught me that increase in wages of a community is the most important measure that can be taken for the correction of overcrowding . " General Gorgas was dealing only incidentally with the effects of increased wages . Else he might have committed himself to the doctrine that increase in wages would also prove the most important measure that can be taken for the correction of the evils of tuberculosis , excessive infant mortality , juvenile delinquency , prostitution , anarchism and an indefinite array of other afflictions that Mr. Easley would exorcize by incantations pronounced over the Civic Federation 's overloaded dinner tables I T is good in these days of poignant uncertainty and passionate conflict to come across words of ripe and serene wisdom touching the ever-recurrent fundamental issues of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of our daily job . This the reader will find in a short but most weighty article on Natural Law by Justice Holmes , in the last number of the Harvard Law Review . A veteran of the Civil War , Justice Holmes is today the most distinguished representative of the older liberalism that valued both intellectual freedom and courage , that fought valiantly for its convictions yet not without tolerance or the chivalric courtesy due to foernen worthy of our steel . We can not undertake to give an account of an article every paragraph of which is compact with many thoughts ; but we may indicate the scope and the manner by quoting the first and last sentences : " It is not enough for the knight of romance that you agree that his lady is a very nice girl ? if you do not admit that she is the best that God ever made or will make , you must fight . " " Philosophy does not furnish motives , but it shows men that they are not fools for doing what they already want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw ourselves away , the vista of the farthest stretch of human thought , the chords of a harmony that breathes from the unknown . " W E note with profound regret the untimely death of Prof. Hohfeld of the Yale Law School . Prof. Hohfeld was one of the very small number of scholars working in this country for the transformation of our law in accordance with modern scientific standards . Although a very young man , he had made notable and promising contributions in the direction.of clarifying legal ideas ; and his address a few years ago before the American Association of Law Schools , on a Vital School of Jurisprudence , was a powerful call to our Uni versities to realize their responsibilities in the matter of legal education , to teach law not as a trade or preparation for the art of winning cases , but as a science in the service of public needs . We understand that previous to our entry into the war Yale University was making certain plans for the establishment of such a school of jurisprudence , and in calling Professors Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering a proper faculty for such a purpose . It is to be hoped that Yale University will find means to develop the original plans along this line . The Greatest of These T F there was ever a day since the advent of Chris : tianity on which Christians had reason to kneel before the image of Jesus and pray for a second coming , it is the Christmas of 1918 . Christians need the Christian spirit as they have not needed it since they were killing one another during the rely gious wars in the name of Christ . They need it for their own integrity of mind and for their own personal salvation . They need it in their transac ' dons one with another , no matter whether those transactions concern peace among nations or peace within nations . Christian faith and Christian wnri ? , can render to mankind a unique service in a mornen ' of sore distress , of imminent danger , of momentous decision .
