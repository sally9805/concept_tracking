txt THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS . A Marylander Scoffs at the Senate Objections to It . To the Editor of The New York'Times : " The Monroe Doctrine , " " Entangling Alliances , " " Surrender of Sovereignty . " These are the three subjects adverted to.by the " willful Senators " who are floundering around in their darkened or perverted vision to find some objection to the proposed constitution of the League of Nations . These Senators have given us the published reasons of their opposition . It would be interesting to know the real reasons why they are opposing the greatest opportunity the world has ever had to bring peace on earth and good-will among men . There is something that does not appear on the surface . What is it ? The Monroe Doctrine ? How can that he when the whole instrument breathes inhibition against the acquisition of territory by one nation from another , not only on the American Continent . but throughout the civilized world ? Entangling alliances ? Is it possible the great ' Washington was so bloodthirsty and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an-y relations with a foreign nation he ' preferred to spend billions of money and shed . oceans of blood in international strife ? . No. no : Such a thing is beyond belief . Did he not himself make an " entangling " alliance with France during our own Revolutionary . War , when Lafayette came over to - help us ? Surrender of sovereignty ? Can at treaty be made on any subject without  --  the surrender of some . right ? Do we get no ctin'Mde:ration for our concession or waiver of .. aome power we before had ? Does riot every nation which is a party to the League give to its what we concede to it ? in every valid contract between individual persons ' each party to the agreement gives up a right or a certain " sovereignty " he before possessed . Rut he gets something of value , a part of the other pereon 's " sovereignty " In return . It is the same with nations as with perSOIS . How utterly futile  --  and may T not say silly ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it would seem that the Republican Senators ( but not all of them . thank God I ) arc making a football of the peace of the world that they may play partisan politics . The American people love peace . Theywant no more wars . They have had enough . That . is my opinion . I may be wrong . I may mistake the temperament of  --  the people of this country . But I venture to predict that any Senator of the United States who shall vote against the treaty to bring an enduring peace to our distracted world will be serving his last term in Congress . GEORGE MARTIN UPSHCR , Chairman of Committee League to Enforce Peace , Worcester County , Md . Snow Hill , Md .. March I , 1919 . Sentiment for the League . To the Editor of The New York Times : I wish to congratulate you on the splendid assistance you- are giving President ' Wilson and ex-President Taft in their advocacy of a League of Nations .
