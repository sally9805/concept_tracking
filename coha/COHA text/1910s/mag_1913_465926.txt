TO help the poor is a traditional British impulse . The most essential task England has undertaken confounds that tradition . It aims at the discovery of means to obviate the need of charity . England is beginning , constructively at least , instead of remedially , to work her way toward a perfected organization for finding work for every man with the least waste to him and to the state . She begins at a time when for every man who owns , nineteen do not own . " All that the nineteen possess is their working power . The effort to give every human being his chance to employ this power , reinforced by a vigorous campaign for the abolition of poverty , proves that socialization of feeling is in progress . Facilities for obtaining employment , scientific study of destitution , insurance against the irremediable fluctuations of industry , minimum wages in some trades , and a Development Commission which may serve as a balance to the labor market are important parts of the system already established . In Great Britain more than poverty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets overflow with money . Never was such an era of ship building . Yet in this fruitful hour of prosperity we face a host of working men and women with no jobs , having no share in the general well-being . Destitution undermines the physical and mental health of the nation ; two million of her population , under employed or unemployable , are on or below the line which separates poverty from pauperism , destitution , and degeneracy . Most of them are living testimony to the fact that England has heretofore neglected her equity in a large proportion of her citizens . The strongest cog in the machinery so far set in place is the National Labor Exchange . It is therefore to the local branches that one must go to observe the basis of the work . At one of these , in a sordid quarter , before a dingy row of store buildings , was gathered a waiting throng of shabby women . Overhead hung a sign with the name of the organization , and in the windows were placards , " Register here for unemployment insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclosed counters where many clerks wrote rapidly . Here was the man who had been out of work two months and could yet come up with a swing , sign his card , and hand it back to the clerk with a gay " Righto , old boy ! " Behind him followed his cringing. vigorless , hopeless , unclean brother in misfortune , who slouched up and made his mark where the clerk had placed his initials . Two thousand registered at this one exchange that morning . A scene uninviting and commonplace , it is important to England and to us . It marks at a typical location the operation of two new institutions which Great Britain has established , in a fine spirit and on a large scale , in order to deal preventively with the deep fog of poverty which rests on our times . Overhead the pale sun was breaking through the thick , smoky mist of a frosty winter morning in London , emblematic of new light penetrating to the lives of the toilers . Among the crowd was a man of fifty , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good workman . " I 'm a p'inter , " he said . " I 've been out of a job twelve weeks , now . That 's extraordinary for me . I 've not in memory been out of work more than four weeks at one time . It 's been rainin ' now for three months steady . Makes my sort of work bad . It 's hard on Polly and Bob the three kids at ' ome ? Sally and Bob and Lizy ? with no p'y cumin ' in . ' Keep ' em out in the fresh air , ' said one of these county visitors ; but what good is fresh air when there 's nothin ' to eat , scurcely ? I 've been comin ' in here every day , and I 've asked about outside , and not a job 's offered yet . I 'm a good p'inter . I get good wages . There simply is n't enough work to go round . W'en you 're out of work the rent goes on , the gettin ' hungry goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money you may ' aye laid by do n't last long . W'en you 've been out twelve weeks you ' ave n't paid many contributions , and your unemployment insurance do n't run long , either . Them that has just stopped after a good job gets quite a spell ; but then it 's only seven shillings a week . Even at that we 're glad enough to get it but what lastin ' good is seven shillin 's for a wife and three when it 's only for two or three weeks ? " " Excell , " said a voice at his shoulder , " they sent me out to get you . There 's a job you might fit . A West End place telephoned . It 's inside painting , but it pays the same wages . " Excell started for the office at once , and never looked back . He came by five minutes later with a new light in his eyes and a card in his hand . " I 'll get it , " he said , cheerfully . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there 's somethin ' I do n't understand about it , " he added . " Every one of these men has a right to a job . The Exchange is all right . It helps . But it needs more than that . " With a ? puzzled expression he hurried out after his own new employment . The other countries of Europe have alI established labor exchanges where master and men may come together with convenience . These , however , are not national , but communal or municipal . In Germany they gain a national character by being linked together by telephone . telegraph , and mail . England had nothing but her local Distress Committees to deal with unemployment . Today , from its central office in London , the Board of Trade , an adjunct of the government , operates a whole system of exchanges , and connects , through some four hundred branches , all the industrial regions of England , Scotland . Wales , and Ireland . Individually and through the central office these function in sympathy . Labor , crude or specialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one region can be called from any other without delay . Listed situations are either filled directly by the agency in which they are filed , or , lacking the proper applicants , they are put " in circulation . " Every trade has its - number and decimal divisions . On the application card a cipher uniformly used by the exchanges records the last work the man had , the job ho wants now , his age , the employers he has been sent to , whether taken on , bow long retained , and the general impression he makes . Usually the steady and efficient men can be recognized . Employer and applicant arc filed under the same trade number in separate boxes on differently colored cards . Instant reference can be made for either side . This simple device , being universal , enables the number wanted to be wired to the central office and sent out to the branches . When he is located , the reply can briefly present the character of the applicant . In case of need this man is furnished with a pass or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given time to repay . This arrangement has objectionable features , since the laborer must both bear the brunt of the expense and take the whole chance of the job lasting long enough to make it possible for him to refund the money to the government . In spite of this discouragement to long journeys , the exchange tends to fluidize the movement of labor throughout Great Britain , and furnishes a reliable , neutral medium of information about supply and demand . The administrators of the law planned from the first to make the act advantageous to both employer and worker . In this they have definitely succeeded . Since it is not compulsory to register either vacancies or applications for work , as it is in some European communes , the record shown by the third year of operation demonstrates that they are doing good service . Of the vacancies listed by employers , approximately eighty per cent . were filled . Tn four weeks of last . November more than fifty-four thousand adults , of whom fortyone thousand were men , were found situations . In the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between fourteen and seventeen , were given jobs . Of casual laborers ? cotton - porters in Liverpool , cloth - porters in Manchester , dock - laborers , sandwich-men , and others ? four ? thousand two hundred and forty men were given thirty - nine thousand jobs . Three thousand of the dock-workers received more than twenty-five thousand jobs . This is because of the systematic handling of this class of labor in the exchanges where they are not union men . At this time in all the textile trades there was a scarcity of adult women and of skilled men for the engineering and metal trades , and many places could not be filled . In the twelve mouths ending at that time more than seven hundred thousand places had been filled by adults and children ; not a bad record for a voluntary service still in its beginning . Trade - unions and employers looked askance at this experiment . The natural fear that the government would send strike-breakers to fill the places of strikers antagonized the unions . The employers , familiar with the large body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent would be unsatisfactory . Both were quickly reassured . The policy of the Exchange has been from the first to keep out of all trade disputes and to supply only efficient men , specialists if desired , in any sort of work where they are needed . When there is a strike , both sides may send a statement describing the situation to the nearest exchange and renew it every seven days . The applicant for a job is permitted to read these and determine for himself what course he will follow . Out of the calamitous class with which England 's Poor Law continually and vainly battles , one hundred thousand registered at the start , the worst of the casual , unskilled and incompetent . The Exchange had to fight its way through the whole mass to get the desirables . It does not intentionally send a man to a situation he is not capable of filling . When recognized , the Exchange must let the horde of helpless pass by , however sadly , only noting them as they go on their way to the Poor Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this class diminished of its own accord because it was too onerous a task to appear at the exchange and register , according to the requirements , every day . Their cards lie in the " dead " box . Laboring - men of the sturdy type found profit in registering their names with a machine in which the majority of the jobs of the entire nation were dropped , classified , and handed out . Efficient men all over the country were enlisted . In the early days of the operation , an engineering firm which needed a particularly skilled man whom they had been unable to find by the old methods wrote to the Exchange and described exactly what it wanted . The manager immediately sent out an inquiry for such a man , went to great trouble to search for him , and in a short time located him in another part of England . He proved entirely satisfactory to his employers . That firm thereafter used the same source to fill all its vacancies . Several hundred great industrial corporations now set up at their gates metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the National Exchange . There is sound and practical reason in this . While it relieves the manufacturer , it also puts an end to the weary tramping of unemployed labor , rain or shine , day after day , from factory to factory . The Exchange sends the best choice of the applicants , but the manager can come himself to select men from the lists or the waiting crowd . " By luck or merit " the National Labor Exchange has won favor in its primary function . It has possibilities greater than this , clearly proven in the ease of the Liverpool dock - workers . There it was utilized as a regularizer of the market . No means for solving the difficult problems of the casuals has ever worked so successfully . Transport-workers , where they are not tightly unionized as they are in London , cotton-porters in Lancashire and Yorkshire , unskilled labor , men without trades , constitute a force to be dealt with by some system worked out to the satisfaction of both sides concerned . The Liverpool " dockers " presented this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous number of casual workers , in the main unorganized , requiring some skill for their trade ; they were overwhelmed by the horde , often farm-laborers , lured to the city by the five shillings a man might earn by a day 's work on the docks , making the condition of lathe . " I liked that , " he said . " Stayed there six months ; but the boss found a younger boy for less money . " It took much telephoning to other exchanges to locate a job on the lathe . James was giveu.4q. official card and sent off cheerfully to ' seek his new chance . His experience with the smaller boy and the lesser price is undoubtedly the same experience other lads have bad , for James worked his way up . Every year forty or fifty thousand children who come to the adult wage period , particularly in the textile factories where they have learned no trade , are dismissed to make room for the incoming " fourteens , " as they are industrially known . Unless they have some self-directing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at twenty they arc dispensable . " Sammy ' Adler. " as he called himself , age fourteen , followed James . He had found himself a job with a tailor the first day out of school . He did n't like that trade , but he did n't know what he wanted . The customary thumb-nail report which the head-master is supposed to furnish the Exchange with every " leaver " read ; " Fair capability , somewhat deterred by lack of interest in exerting himself . Father in the mortuary line , mother decent . " Questioned by the young woman in charge , Sammy testified that he had earned eight shillings and wanted that again , that he would n't go to another tailor , and that his parents did n't know what he ought to do . The officer , in an undertone , consulted her assistant . " The father 's trade is a close trade , " she suggested . " Perhaps he would take the boy into the undertaking business . " Sammy shook his head when this was proposed to him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacancies . There was a job listed at Robinson 's drapery - shop with eight shillings , but it meant " living-in . " " Mother 's decent , " she commented to the assistant . " The boy would be better off at home than living-in . He 'd nut suit Robinson , either . He likes them sharp . " She turned to Sammy . " What do you say to being a butcher 's assistant ? " Sammy was silent and unmoved . " Can you ride a bicycle ? " His dull , VOL . C.XXVII. ? No. 737. - 23 gooseberry eyes gleamed for the first time , and his manner was almost enthusiastic . " Yes , : miss , I can ride a bike . " " Well , then , you would deliver for him , and in the time at the/ shop you could learn boning-out. ' it 's a good trade ; seven shillings a week to start with . " Sammy hesitated an instant over the money , but sooCicparted . The butcher 's trade 14-ed 1f him like a profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three days later he was back for another try . To carry a full basket on the handle of a bicycle and dodge taxi-cabs and busses on a slimy street requires nerve and skill . Sammy lacked them . After lie had spilled three or four loads , his chance to learn " boning-out " and other parts of the butcher 's trade vanished .. His mother , sent for on his first application , appeared at the evening conference which the Junior Department has established . Sammy seemed to her quite clever . " When ' e was a toike , " she said , " ' e used to draw wot ' e knew about , an ' that was ' earses , ' is farther being in the business , I s'pose . " The exchange officer duly recommended courses in drawing at night school ; but Sammy had had enough of school . It was too late for that . He was provided with a new place as page in a store . The affinity between Sammy and the men down-stairs was plain . In the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ranks in this trade are apprentice , improver , and assistant . She was sixteen , and expected ten shillings a week , considered good pay for that age . The officer went through the list of jobs . " Let me see ? you 're gentlemen 's trousers , are n't you ? " she was asked . " Yes 'm , " replied Maggie , unoffended . " Do you do anything else ? " " No , miss . " " I have n't that now . The tailoring trade is slack . You have never done anything on coats ? " " No 'm , only once I filled in on ladies ' . " The officer called up the other exchanges . One had a job at buttonholes . " I ca n't do them . I know it pays better . I have an aunt who does ' odes . She 's too tired at night to teach me . " Come in to - morrow , then . I will notify the General Office . It 's a little sad waiting , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One little girl in London , and all the branches of the National Exchange looking for the one specific set of seams she could sew ! A wonderful new agency ; but the heart of the matter is that Maggie knows neither what comes before nor what follows her piece of work . The Exchange officers do their best , often a very good best wider the existing conditions . To alter these is beyond their reach . It must be done long before the children come into their hands . It is behind the boys and girls with the one specialized task , and no training even for that at fourteen . It is in the period which precedes their appearance on the labor market , fourteen years , iu which the little they acquire beyond reading and writing has no connection with their later work . Not yet at the springs of youth where the children begin their education for citizenship , neglecting for the time the reservoiring at the fountain-head , scarcely touching the upper reaches where they are being stunted and deformed mentally and physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been plunged into the flowing torrent of unskilled labor , England has begun her attack upon her greatest problem , the permanent proportion of unemployed . Systematized over the entire country , the labor exchanges attest the beginning of a struggle to grasp and master at its climax the great body of possibly employable , and prevent it from sweeping on into destitution . By the mobilization of labor which is thus far advanced she is providing a solution of the problem of the working-man who can not be employed in his own neighborhood and has no way of his own of getting advice of any but the immediate local demand for his ability to work ; the man who slips gradually into poverty and unless rescued drops into the unemployable . To - day the country of Great Britain with all its labor offerings is in the manufacturing centers within an hour 's walk from his lodging-place . The state has gone even further than this , and is also creating and mobilizing special jobs to keep a man employed until he can be permanently placed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Development Commission , to which have been given unique powers which it will test at the next marked trade depression This remarkable commission occupies a strategic position on the stream of the unemployed . Posted some distance below the Labor Exchange , it is constructing sluices through which to turn the surplus men over new fields of industry in time of distress and use them on necessary projects . The commission has power to create on its own responsibility great public works , and is intrusted by the government with an ample income . Being specifically required to carry on these projects " with regard to the state of the labor market , " the commission may arrange them to meet those crises when there is great congestion of the unemployed in the cities . By the work offered on these big enterprises it will be possible to decentralize the pressure of the surplus of labor . This surplus is in three divisions : the seasonable labor which is out of work for a part of each year , like Excell , the painter , by slacking from climatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when the world market is overstocked and the whole trade world is depressed ; and the unskilled , efficient or inefficient , who have too little to do unless contractors are busy with big work . For each of these classes this Development work will offer a new chance of occupation . Reforesting the rocky hills , moors , and heather lands , building new ports , reservoiring destructive rivers , developing waterpower , draining and settling farm-lands , are within the scope of the plans . The commission in its relation to the labor market is a pioneer in a new field , and may serve as a great diversion channel . In the light of such efforts , from the dusky background of neglect to which it has too long been relegated , comes forth the fact that every man possesses the right to have work ; he has an equity in a job . No effort to cure labor and poverty can be fully successful until this correlative of the state 's equity in a man is acknowledged . Truly a provocative statement , it is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . Hand in hand with it goes the old faith of the aristocracy that the natural inequality of man , which no amount of law , of course , will prevent , will continue to create rich and pans . Herein the differentiation between the grades of poverty , destitution , insufficiency , and comparative lack of riches is not made . Poverty in the last sense can not be exorcised . Destitution and positive insufficiency can . The state must , then , while working upon its own equity in a man , acknowledge his equity in his job . Efficient or inefficient , the equity of the individual exists , but when he is incompetent it is so badly damaged as to be of slight value . His taxes are in arrears . The outstanding mortgage on his abilities held by society makes it impossible for him to realize anything on this neglected property . Likewise the equity of the state is rendered useless . It then becomes a question what sort of bankruptcy court he must enter . The old refuges of human insolvency , poorhouses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation . Tabor colonies have only a limited usefulness . For the state this is unprofitable business . It has left two things entirely undone . Bound by the traditional fear of destroying individual initiative and responsibility . it has neither delivered the job nor begun to develop its equity in the children so that they will be able and fairly certain to make proper returns on society 's investment when they have matured . With enormous work to be done , it has thrown youth , unprepared , unskilled , pellmell into industry . It has been compelled to maintain in institutions the men and women who result from this lack of foresight , and to pay heavily besides in marked physical degeneration , crime , and insidious disease . The waste of the system is appalling . To a loss it is impossible to estimate , both in England and our own country , must be added the debit of equally widespread and increasing human misery . The state needs its men . Every effort to increase , to protect , and conserve a man 's working power must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be saved by a re-education to simple trades . In the Midlands the quarries are filled with shoe-operatives , exhausted for factory work by the vibration and speeding-up . They fortunately find here at hand this simple labor , easily learned , out-of-doors . In the cities such change of occupation is less easily effected . If the state intelligently undertook , before he became hopeless , re-education and replacing of the individual , possibly providing separate maintenance for the family while the trade was being learned , it would logically attack destitution and crime , and cost at least no more than our present wasteful system . " The back of England 's poor is broken , " said Hilaire Belloc . The government alone can do that marvelous surgery which makes it possible to live and work with a fractured spinal column , an operation until recently believed both physically and economically impossible . Mending the present generation with humane legislation has led to the invention of new instruments , now somewhat clumsy , rudimentary , and inefficient , but the evolution of which is like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far greater plan . Wages boards and arbitration courts , to provide that adults shall receive sufficient compensation , are now operating in some few trades and bid fair to be extended . Planned as a fine humanitarian relief , social insurance against illness , accident , old age , and unemployment is a brave attempt at social justice . At present the unemployment section involves the back - handed settlement of questions demanding constructive rather than involuntary attack . The task of dispelling the enveloping fog of poverty , while tremendously difficult and only just begun , is well undertaken . The similar though less congested mass of out-of-work men which exists in the United States renders England 's method of grappling with the problem pregnant with suggestion for us as we set out on the task of first protecting and then improving our equity in a man , a necessary part of the great " welfare war " which represents the rising spirit of America .
