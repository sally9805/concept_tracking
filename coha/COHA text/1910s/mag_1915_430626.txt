 | THE first intimation that I was to be ordered to Panama for duty in connection with the Canal came to me on the morning of February 18 , 1907 , in the form of a telephone message from the Secretary of War , William H. Taft , saying he desired to see me . In compliance with this message I called upon him at once . He catechised me about the localities where I had served , the character of the duties in which I had been engaged since graduation from the Military Academy , and also concerning my antecedents . He then informed me that the President had decided to accept the resignation of Mr. John F. Stevens , chief engineer of the Canal , and had concluded to turn the work over to the corps of engineers , United States army . He had just returned from the White House with General Mackenzie , Chief of Engineers , where , after discussing this question with the President , they had recommended me for the position of Chief Engineer . He could not assure me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the White House that evening and should be prepared for such a call . In the meantime nothing was to be said concerning the matter to any one . In the course of the evening a call came from the White House , and at 8.45 I reported there to President Roosevelt . He stated that he had sent for me to talk over some matters in connection with the Panama Canal . Expressing great regret that he found it necessary to make a change in the management of affairs on the Isthmus , he said he had concluded to accept Mr. Stevens 's resignation , since no other course was open to him . He considered any change in the administrative head of a work unfortunate , for it always unsettled the force and resulted in delays , and this was especially so with the work on the Isthmus . He was very desirous of having the Canal built as expeditiously as possible , and in order to avoid upsets and delays from similar causes in the future , he had decided to place the work in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting in charge persons who would be obliged to remain . With this object in view he had decided to reorganize the Isthmian Canal Commission ; to detail three army engineers , with one civil engineer of the navy , as members , and to require all the members to reside on the Isthmus . By such an arrangement each one of the engineers would be familiar with conditions and would be known to the personnel . Then , @#  | should a change occur in the management , no delay or confusion would follow . He had decided to appoint me Chief Engineer , as well as Commissioner . He believed that Mr. Stevens had stayed too continuously on the Isthmus , and that the effects of the tropics combined with the heavy responsibilities imposed by the work had got on his nerves . By the arrangement of having four engineers , all commissioners , residing on the Isthmus , he thought it would be possible for me to get away from the work , to throw off the cares and responsibilities for at least three months each year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate , he considered it advisable that I should endeavor to do so . Speaking in regard to the other members of the commission , the President went on to say that the law required that one should be a civil engineer of the navy . He had great respect for Admiral Endicott , then a commissioner , would like to retain him , and would do so but for his age , which would make it a hardship for him to live on the Isthmus . He had thought of retaining the admiral in charge of the Washington office , but this would interfere with his plan of having all the commissioners together on the Isthmus , so his inclination was to select a younger man as better fitted for the active work that would be required . He would consider the question further after inquiry as to the men available for the duty . Mr. Stevens had spoken in the highest terms of the services rendered by Mr. Jackson Smith , and urged his appointment . Mr. Smith had charge of recruiting , of housing the employees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government doing the feeding without resorting to contract , and he had concluded to act on Mr. Stevens 's recommendation and appoint Mr. Smith on the commission . The American Medical Association had been pressing him to advance Colonel Gorgas , in recognition of the work he had done on the Isthmus , and , now that a change was to be made , he had concluded to comply with their wishes and make him a member of the commission . A civilian should be appointed as governor , to take charge of the civil affairs within the Zone , and he was seriously considering the appointment of Senator Jo C. S. Blackburn , of Kentucky . The commission always had and would require the services of a secretary , and he regarded Mr. Joseph Bucklin Bishop , then holding that position , as the best qualified and most suitable man for the work ; Mr. Bishop had been of the greatest assistance since his connection with the Canal , and his services fully warranted his continuance in office . He regarded it as unfortunate that the existing law required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or executive body of seven men . This had been a source of trouble and friction , but , as he had failed in his endeavor to get the law changed , it was necessary to work under it . He thought he could ease matters somewhat by combining two of the offices , chairman and chief engineer , in one person , and this he contemplated doing when Mr. Theodore Shouts , then chairman of @#  | the commission , should leave office , on the 4th of March following , by making Mr. Stevens chairman in addition to his present duties , and continuing this arrangement after he also should retire . This would result in the elimination of the friction that had at times existed between the holders of these two positions . I had served long enough in charge of work to know the desirability of having a buffer at headquarters on whom I could rely , and my experience while on duty in Washington had only added to my conviction in this respect . This led to the suggestion that as the work was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be made chairman of the commission and the Chief Engineer report direct to him , the latter taking up the affairs of the Canal with the Secretary of War direct . The President , however , did not look upon this idea with favor , and I have since been glad that his better judgment led to its rejection . The President thought that by the combination of the duties already decided upon , that with two of the commissioners members of my own corps and all located on the Isthmus , the trouble and friction which had been due , in a measure , to the majority being so far from the work might disappear , and hoped that things could run more smoothly in the future than they had in the past . He thought that the commission should organize in a way analogous to the President and his cabinet . Each commissioner should be placed at the head of a department of the work and held responsible for the work in his charge , but should subordinate himself to the chairman , who would be responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal condition , and it was possible that it might be worked out along these lines . I said that if I understood the law correctly certain duties had been assigned to the commission and decision was made by majority vote . He ad-  | mitted that this was true , but said that Mr. Stevens had strongly advocated that the veto power be given to the chairman , and he was fully in accord with Mr. Stevens 's view and thought this might be arranged , thereby making the final decision rest with the chairman . The President said that at a conference he had had that morning with the Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers , the latter had suggested Major D. D. Gaillard as an efficient officer eligible for detail whose services could be spared for the purpose . I knew Major Gaillard well , had served with him at various times , and his appointment was agreeable and satisfactory to me . No other names had been mentioned at the conference , and the President had none to suggest . I expressed the desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures and competent to design them , and suggested Major Harry F. Hodges , explaining his connection with the Sault Canal and the design of the gates for the Poe lock . He thought such a selection very desirable , and advised me to take up the matter with the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of War , as he did not want to handicap the engineer department 's work and desired that the Chief of Engineers be consulted . Later , when consulted , General Mackenzie objected to the relief of Major Hodges , on the ground that his departure would cripple the work of his department , Major Hodges having been his principal assistant during his entire term as Chief of Engineers , which was within a year of its close , and during that period having had charge of the various projects in connection with rivers and harbors . He suggested Major William L. Sibert , then in charge of the Pittsburg district . He had been in charge of lock work on the Kentucky River and at Louisville , and similar work on the Monongahela , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in connection with the construction of locks to warrant the assumption that he was fully competent and capable of taking up their design in all their details . Though I knew him but slightly , I accepted General Mackenzie 's suggestion because of his greater familiarity with the personnel of his corps . I mentioned Ma- jor Sibert to the Secretary of War , and his appointment was settled . Mr. Stevens had built up an organization that had shown good results , and under these circumstances the President thought it would be a great mistake to make any change until the necessity therefor became apparent . As soon as Mr. Stevens 's resignation became known it would have a baleful influence upon the organization , and if changes were made the effect would be very much worse . He did not intend , however , to make any announcement for the present , but if , at the time he did , the force on the Isthmus could be assured that there would be no changes in the organization and that things would continue under the new regime as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce to a minimum the demoralization that would naturally result through a change in leadership . To this I readily and gladly assented , being desirous of having things run as smoothly as possible until I could get a grasp of the situation . The Secretary of War took up the question of compensation of the various commissioners . I had certain advantages accruing by reason of my commission in the army which did not fall to the lot of civilians ; I had not been tried out in a work of such magnitude , for which reasons he concluded not to give me the same salary received by Mr. Shonts and Mr. Stevens , viz. : $30,000 , but thought $15,000 , including my army pay , would be about right . With this as a basis , the other engineers of the commission he thought should have $12,000 , while the remaining members should receive $10,000 . If I were to take three or four months off each year , as both the President and Mr. Taft had suggested , it followed that each of the other engineers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climate more or less of the time , and they should receive the same privileges and be compensated correspondingly ; he therefore consented to fix the salaries of the engineer members at $14,000 . The veto power over any action of the commission was to be given to me . It was subsequently decided to relieve Admiral Endicott at the same time that the other members of the existing commission were retired and to replace him  | by Admiral H. H. Rousseau , recently appointed chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks , who willingly consented to accept the place and to relinquish his position with the Navy Department . Senator Blackburn was notified , and indicated his acceptance of an appointment as a member of the commission and governor of the Canal Zone , but , as he would require time after the adjournment of Congress to attend to private matters , he would not be able to sail for a month or six weeks . This fixed the new commission . Before starting for the Isthmus I requested Mr. F. B. Maltby , who was principal assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States on business connected with Canal work , to come to Washington for a consultation , as I desired to talk with him about conditions on the Isthmus . The resignation of Mr. Stevens had come as a surprise and unpleasant shock to him , and his account of the hold that Mr. Stevens had on the force , of the demoralizing and disorganizing effect that the news of his intended departure would surely have , was neither cheering nor comforting news to his successor . Mr. Maltby did not think that the assurances of no change in the organization given in a statement by the President would have any effect at all . The Secretary of War had informed Mr. Stevens by cable of the change in Canal management and of my intended departure for the Isthmus in March , adding : " The President desires me to reiterate that he wishes me as far as possible to retain the present organization . . . . The President relies on you to use your every endeavor to assist in the substitution of Major Goethals for yourself with as little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you have created as circumstances will permit . " Mr. Stevens replied : " Certainly will remain long enough to advise Major Goethals thoroughly with understanding I am supreme in authority , reporting to you after March 4 , until I leave the Isthmus . " As this was in accord with the understanding of the President , Mr. Stevens was so advised , and he was to remain supreme in authority until such time as might be mutually agreed upon for him to turn over the work . Major Gaillard had reached Washing- ton in time to prepare for his departure on the S. S. Panama on March 6 , so we sailed , together with about fifty members of Congress as travelling companions , and had a very pleasant trip . Time was spent in posting ourselves on the plans of the Canal and , naturally , receiving suggestions from some of our fellow passengers on what should be done , and how . We arrived at Colon on the morning of March 12 , and the party was met by Mr. Stevens , Colonel Gorgas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and escorted to Panama . This committee had been organized to meet delegations of various kinds coming to the Isthmus , and was in attendance on all trips of sightseeing that the delegation took . On Saturday evening , March 17 , the congressional party was invited to a smoker gotten up by the employees and given at the Corozal Hotel . I concluded to accept the invitation to be present , as it was urged that the men desired to become acquainted with the new man . The large dining-hall had been cleared of tables and was well packed with men , and women were admitted to the porch . Mr. Maltby 's honest statement to me in Washington prepared me for the rather cold reception extended . Mr. Stevens was not present , but the favor in which he was held by the men was clearly shown by the cheers that the mention of his name elicited and by their absence at any reference to his successor . There were singing , speeches by some of the men and by some of the congressmen , and finally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the work suddenly dropping their tools , or stopping their work , standing erect with heels together , shoulders back , little fingers at the seams of their trousers , and then saluting or practising the military salute , it was not to be inferred that the men were " loco " ; on the contrary , they were perfectly sane and they were merely preparing themselves for what was coming the advent of the army to control the work . After additional observations about the ordinary relations of the army and the laboring man , I was called upon for some remarks . I must confess that the slurs and insinuations were not relished , and in replying I attempted to make it clear that the army per se was not in charge in a military sense : that there was to be no militarism , no salutes ; that I had left behind me all my military duties and would command the army of Panama , fighting nature for the accomplishment of the end that had brought us down here . Their cause was mine , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the completion of the Canal would be our victory . I intended to be the commanding officer , but the chiefs of divisions would be the colonels , the foremen the captains , and no one who did his duty had aught to fear from militarism . In the army the commanding officer was the father of his men ; when I commanded a company I knew my men , their trials and troubles , and so would I treat the men here , giving a ready ear to their complaints and grievances , and any one could come to meat any time , or detain me as I went about the work , to explain their particular trials or to make suggestions as to the work , and they could be assured of audience . This was the start of the subsequent setting aside of Sunday mornings for the hearing of complaints and grievances of all kinds and descriptions . After the departure of the congressmen time was spent , in company with Mr. Stevens , going over the work more in detail , meeting the various department and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting Mr. Stevens 's idea of the prosecution of the work and organization under the new arrangement of having all the commissioners on the Isthmus . In going over the work its magnitude seemed overpowering , and as the details were disclosed matters only became more confusing and overwhelming . A time was reached when nothing further was to be gained by guidance or discussion , and the same thought must have occurred to Mr. Stevens , for he proposed that I relieve him on April i , to which I assented . Major Sibert arrived on the Isthmus on March 18 , 1907 , and Mr. Rousseau on March 21 , so that the engineers were all assembled before the date fixed for the change in management . In my conversation with President Roosevelt , on the evening of February 18 , various matters connected with the Canal were discussed , including the question of building the Canal by contract . Bids @# had been invited and four had been received . Only one of these met satisfactorily the requirements of the specifications , but it was considered too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while higher than had been considered reasonable , was not exorbitant , and the proposer had requested permission to revise it to conform with the specifications , and this had been granted . A delay in reaching a decision had thus been caused , and the President desired me to make a careful study of the plan proposed and give him my conclusions . Speaking of the general question of doing government work by contract , I expressed the view that if the contractor is competent and is receiving a return which insures him a profit , the contract method , as a rule , is easier for the administrative officer , provided the work to be done is clearly known and can be clearly and explicitly stated ; otherwise , I much preferred to do work by day 's labor , for I had never held the opinion that it is , generally speaking , more economical or advantageous to the government to do its work by contract , basing my conclusions not only on experience gained by doing work in both ways but from handling all matters relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbors under the Engineer Department at Large , during upward of three years , while on duty as assistant to the Chief of Engineers , United States army . As to the method that should be adopted for the Canal , I was not in a position to discuss the matter intelligently , for I knew relatively little about conditions on the Isthmus ? the labor supply and kindred subjects , which have a bearing on such a question ? and I knew nothing at all concerning the specifications on which the bids had been invited . Since this question had first been raised , the President had consulted various contractors and others , and he called attention to the fact that the general opinion was against me , the claim being made that when the government performs work it lags , the cost is uncertain , and the time of completion indefinite . From the information he had he seemed to think that by the contract method not only would the cost be definitely ascertained but a  | time could be fixed within which the work would be completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contractor might be induced to make extra exertion so that time might be gained and the cost reduced . In his estimation the time element was a very important one , as he was desirous of securing a completed Canal at the earliest possible date . Under these circumstances , and as those in charge of the work had so recommended , he thought the contract method offered the best solution and accordingly had provisionally adopted it . I had obtained a copy of the proposed contract after leaving the President and made a careful study of its provisions . Summed up briefly , the proposal was for the government to supply the plant and operating machinery and buildings of all kinds , including quarters , hotels , messes , and kitchens for the working force , maintain at its own expense and with its own forces the government and sanitation of the Canal Zone , and pay to the contractor a fixed percentage upon the cost of the actual construction work as determined by an engineering committee of which the contractor was to name two members and the Canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the Canal presented to it , make such investigations as might be necessary on the ground , and arrive at a conclusion both as to the time within which the work was to be completed and also an estimated reasonable cost , with premiums in case the contract was completed within the time and cost , and penalties in case of failure to meet the time and cost . It was further stipulated that should any material change be made in the plans at any future time affecting these elements , the committee , or one similarly constituted , should be reconvened and be empowered to amend the original estimate as to time and cost . It followed that an alteration might be made in the plans at a time when it would not be possible to get together even a majority of the original committee , and the original basis for estimate might not be followed . The impression created by my talk with the President was that hefeltvery strongly in favor of the contract method because it seemed to assure a completed Canal in the shortest time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifications convinced me that it would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , for the proposed engineering committee to fix definitely in advance either the cost of the work or the date of completion , due to lack of detailed knowledge on many points , especially the locks and the character of the material to be excavated . Furthermore , it did not seem possible that the contract method would make the administrative part of the commission 's work any easier , while the doubtful points in the contract ( and they seemed legion ) offered so many fruitful sources for friction that constant wrangling would undoubtedly result . The supervisory and auditing forces that would have to be maintained to exercise supervision over the contractor 's work and expenditures would be expensive and troublesome . On the whole , since the contract would not insure a fixed cost and a definite time for completion , and as the specifications clearly indicated a number of snags ahead , I could not regard it with favor . These conclusions were laid before the President at the next interview . I then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure an association of contractors , each a specialist in some particular line of work , who would execute that part of the Canal construction which required such experience ? as , for instance , contractors with experience in heavy excavation would handle the Culebra Cut ; others with experience in dredging would handle the channels at either end ; others experienced in masonry construction would handle the locks , etc. , and that this combination of contractors would have the necessary finances to carry on the entire work to a satisfactory conclusion . In perfecting his bid , the lowest bidder had secured the co-operation of other contractors with the view of complying with the intent of the specifications , but the specifications required that the contractor should have an available capital above all debts and encumbrances of $5,000,000 , give a security with the bid of $200,000 , and a bond for the faithful performance of the contract of $3,000,000 . In order to meet these financial requirements , it was necessary for the bidders to make arrangements with bankers at rather high rates of interest , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contractor would have to pay by dividing his profits with his financial agents . Mr. Stevens had strongly advocated the contract method when first considered . In his report to Mr. Theodore P. Shonts , chairman of the commission , he stated : " This is no small undertaking , but one that calls for the united and untiring efforts of the best brain and muscle that the United States can produce , and there is no one capable , either physically or mentally , of carrying in all its details this stupendous work to a rapid and successful conclusion ; but by associating with us the best of all the needed elements , we can do the work quickly and well . " To secure the assistance and co-operation desired he had proposed that steps be taken to interest experienced contractors of repute in the various lines of work that would be involved in the construction of the Canal , with a view to having them organize a construction company , with a capital stock of about $25,000,000 , for the specific purpose of building the Canal . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis , the cost and time to he determined by a board of engineers as already outlined . Before making his recommendation he had conferred with various contractors on the subject , and felt convinced that no difficulty would be experienced in effecting such an organization or company . If this plan were adopted , it naturally followed that a contract would have to be made without advertisement , for in no other way could the desired end be obtained . While President Roosevelt was favorably disposed toward such an arrangement and willing to enter into a contract with such an organization , the Secretary of War , recognizing that the act authorizing the construction of the Canal gave very broad powers to the President , felt that on a work of such importance some form of competition was necessary , as the law governing contracts required advertisement . This view was also held by leaders of the House and Senate ; the plan proposed was a novel one , had never been tried on government work , and they feared the effect that a contract made without competition might create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the results already noted . When reference was made to Mr. Stevens for his opinion , he recommended the rejection of all bids , claiming that the whole matter had drifted into an entirely different proposition from the one he had originally recommended ; that the contractors forming the combination did not have the necessary experience , and that he considered the rate too high . He felt also that the lowest bid as modified would result in one man having control of the work , which in his opinion doomed it to failure . Under these circumstances , and also in view of the contemplated change in the administration of Canal affairs , as well as his desire not to hamper a new administration with a contract that it did not view with favor , the President concluded that he would reject all bids . While taking such action , however , he maintained an open mind on the contract question , and desired that , after familiarizing myself with the work , I should give the matter careful consideration , reporting to him fully in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in favor of the contract method , the necessary specifications were to be prepared and forwarded in order that a contract might be entered into as early as practicable with a view to getting the contractor started toward the completion of the work . Soon after my arrival on the Isthmus , and before taking charge of the work , I received from the Secretary of War , for consideration in connection with the general subject of contract versus hired labor for the Canal , a letter written to him by one of the parties in the competition for the award , strongly urging him to adopt the contract method , the contract to be drawn along the lines proposed by the original advertisement . The President 's action in placing the work under the army engineers created some feeling and criticism ; the work was going to lag and suffer from lack of initiative . The very fact that they were to be placed in charge was held up in the letter referred to as one of the principal arguments in favor of the contract method . Army engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their very training , dictatorial and many of them martinets , and it was predicted that if they , rather than contractors , were placed in charge of the actual construction the  | Canal project was doomed to failure . Their training was purely technical ; they had never made a success as executive heads of great enterprises , and few if any of them had any construction ability . It was claimed that proper headway in the construction of the Canal had not been secured thus far , and that the chief obstacle in the way was government " red tape , " which the employment of army engineers would increase rather than decrease . On the other hand , with a contractor in charge , the first thing he would do would be to abolish this " galling red-tape system and introduce business methods . " The further criticism was made that the government engineers did not know the kind of machinery to employ and that experimentation to find that best adapted to the work would be expensive both in cost and time . A contractor , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hesitate in such matters , and the contrary would be the result . The main objection , however , to doing the work by government forces , and one not usually considered at its full value , was the inability to foster esprit de corps among its employees . It was stated that " It is a physical impossibility for the government to secure team-work amongst their employees , for the very good reason that there is no personal relation between the employer and the employee . High salaries will not give this result , nor will comfortable quarters and good food , as there must enter the human factor , which is entirely lacking in the government . This feature is one in which the contractor will always have the advantage over the government , and no government employee , whether he be of the army or a civilian , can cultivate the spirit of good feeling . or instil into the employee a spirit of enthusiasm as can a private employer . " The statements of the letter naturally had effect on the Secretary of War , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight in the consideration of the subject . Thus it had come about that I was confronted , in taking charge of the work , with the necessity of determining whether the task could be accomplished as well by hired labor , through the application of government methods , as it could be by contract . Not only were the President and Secretary of War prejudiced in favor of the contract system , but the former had assured me that the general opinion was on the same side . The convictions which I had expressed to the President before starting for Panama were strengthened after I had arrived and had looked over the situation . Indeed , what most surprised me was that Mr. Stevens , with the results before him that he had achieved through the force he had built up , could still favor the contract method . He had , it is true , advocated the rejection of all the bids , but his objection had not been to the contract system itself but to the form it had finally taken . Under the circumstances , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the established government methods , but I was quite willing to do this . After a careful study of all phases of the situation , and after consultation with my colleagues and various other officials , I reached a conclusion strongly in favor of the existing method , and about three months after my arrival so reported to the President , giving my reasons . The report was necessarily an academic discussion . The President had been influenced by certain lines of argument , and these had to be taken up and answered . It was claimed by those advocating the contract method that the various contractors who would associate themselves for the prosecution of the work would be in a position to furnish immediately the necessary experienced superintendents , foremen , skilled mechanics , and others , from the organizations which they already controlled , and thereby secure the teamwork which would insure the completion of the Canal in a shorter time and for less money . It was also contended that the government would not be able to hold its forces , for the completion of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment , whereas under the contract system the men would remain , with reasonable assurance that their services would be utilized elsewhere by these contractors on other work ; that this prospect also gave contractors the advantage of securing better classes of skilled labor . The unprecedented magnitude of the Panama Canal and the conditions under which it was to be built made it entirely different from similar classes of work in  | any locality of the United States . There was no contractor or syndicate of contractors that by any combination could have brought to the Isthmus an organization ready for team-work on any of the parts of the Canal into which it could be subdivided . In each instance an organization would have had to be perfected before any team-work could have been secured . While it might have been possible for several contractors to combine forces , assuming that a sufficient number of men could have been got together in that way , there still remained the necessity of whipping this force into shape in order to secure an organization that would produce the team-work so advantageous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foremen , mechanics , and skilled labor of all kinds must be secured from the United States whether the work be done by contract or by the government . The keen competition then existing in the United States because of the large amount of work in progress or contemplated militated against the argument that contractors would have superintendents , foremen , and others available for work on the Isthmus , for they would not break up their organizations , already engaged , for this purpose . So long as work was plentiful the dread of the tropics would deter men from seeking work on the Canal in preference , consequently the contractors would have been obliged to recruit the greater part of their force from other sources than the work under their supervision in the United States , and so would have little if any advantage over the government in the matter of time necessary to build up a suitable organization . Aside from skilled labor , it was not possible to secure an adequate supply of common labor from the United States , as objections had been raised to recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtaining it abroad . Laborers secured from the West Indies by the French Canal Company were at the time of the company 's liquidation left stranded on the Isthmus , and some of the island governments raised money to repatriate them . It naturally followed that the island governments were strongly opposed to the recruitment of labor , and some of them finally consented only on the understand- ing that the laborers would be employed by the United States Government and not by a contractor . A representative of the Italian Government recommended to the authorities that Italian labor be permitted to accept employment under the government , but that such employment by contractors should not be allowed . A similar experience was had with respect to Chinese labor . As a consequence , with the large force of common labor that would be needed for construction purposes , the contractor would have been at a disadvantage . It is true that in some cases the contractor might have an acquaintance which would enable him to secure men more easily than a government agent , and , again , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as the more important parts of the Panama Canal were concerned , this advantage was not apparent . In any case the knowledge of the specialist in the particular work that is to be done is the element that will accomplish the most satisfactory results , and , so far as dredging and lock and dam construction were concerned , the government 's experience had been , if not greater , at least as extensive as that of any contractor or association of contractors that could have been secured in the United States . For these units of the work the government 's acquaintance was equally extensive , and experienced men could be and were drawn from the engineering forces of the government itself . For these classes of work , therefore , the government had the advantage . So far as related to excavation in the dry by steam shovels and cars , the advantage at the start might have been with the contractor , yet the government had secured one of the best experts in the country for this class of work , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surpassed by any contractor , and had , it is claimed , effected this organization in as short a time as could have been done by an association of contractors under the circumstances . When the government does work in the United States the wage scale is determined by the amount paid similar classes of labor in the locality where the work is being done ; there is no pressure brought to bear on higher authority for any in- crease over the salaries or allowances offered . Conditions on the Isthmus are peculiar . It is contended by employees that service in the tropics saps the energy , and that a man is incapable , after a time , of performing the same amount of work that he would be able to accomplish had he spent the same period in a cooler climate . In support of the reasonableness of their claims , they point to the fact that the leave privilege to employees was established on recommendation of the sanitary authorities , who claimed that such a change was necessary for the preservation of health . This creates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally hard work on the return to the United States ; consequently , the demands for increase in pay are frequent , and to accomplish this , when denied by those immediately in charge of the work , recourse has been had to higher authority . This is a condition that a contractor would have been obliged to face as the government did , and in some respects the latter has been in a position to handle the situation more satisfactorily than the former ? as was plainly indicated by the trouble with the steam-shovel men in May , 1907 . It was claimed by the steamshovel men that representations were made to them when they first came to the Isthmus that eventually their pay would be three hundred dollars per month . Their demand was not granted by the authorities on the Isthmus , and the question was taken up at Washington by the leaders of their union in the United States . A hearing was given the men by the Secretary of War in April of 1907 , and his report recommended against the increase , which report was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent , was crippled in consequence , had a contractor refused to consider the demand a strike undoubtedly would have been declared , and the matter could not have been so successfully handled by a contractor under conditions as they actually existed . With the settlement by higher authority of the demand for increased pay on the part of the steam-shovel men , locomotive engineers , and conductors , a fixed wage scale was adopted , and the authorities in Washington decided that all questions of pay would thereafter be left for the commission to handle , and that no appeals to higher authority would be recognized . The wage scale adopted for the government employees would have had to be accepted and maintained by the contractor , and , if payment to the latter was based on a percentage of the cost of the work done , the demands for increases would be granted more readily than under government control . The views which I expressed to President Roosevelt previous to taking charge of the Canal work , as to the effect of contracts in fixing definitely time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The records of the office of the Chief of Engineers of the army show that the letting of a piece of government work by contract is by no means a reasonable assurance that the task will be completed in a definite time . On public works , including buildings , the records show that in a majority of cases the time limit is exceeded . An examination of the contracts awarded by the commission for material for the Canal , so far as the time limits proposed by the contracts are concerned , clearly showed that there is no assurance of completion of any contract in a definite time . The cases considered were large contracts for material and machinery ; the contractors were specialists in their lines , and , as the work was done in the United States , they must have been familiar with the conditions surrounding it . Even when the time for completion of delivery was left to the contractors themselves to specify , they failed to meet the dates . No strikes or " acts of God " could be cited as excuses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be met , it certainly could not be supposed that in an enervating climate like that on the Isthmus , and with labor below that in the United States for efficiency , this timefailing record for contract work would have been changed . When all the conditions surrounding the work are known in advance , a reasonable definiteness in cost is usually obtained by contract when based on unit prices . This would be equally true if the contract were on a basis of percentage of the cost ; but in either case , so far as the Canal work was concerned , all the conditions were not known in advance . So far as concerned the determination of this question by a board organized as provided by the specifications of the proposed contract , it has @# @#  | been demonstrated that this could not have been done with assurance of its holding for any length of time , because of the change that was made in the location of the locks on the Pacific side and unforeseen difficulties in connection with Culebra Cut . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned soon after my arrival on the Isthmus in talking with members of the supervisory force , was the fear of politics in the appointment of officials and in other ways , if the work were done by the government , which would be entirely eliminated if placed under contract . It was contended by many of these persons that in another year a political campaign would be in progress and debts would have to be paid , and there was no place which offered better opportunities for this than the Canal , for there was no limit in positions available for this purpose , since relatively few of them were then under civil-service regulations . Up to that time the work had been conducted on a non-partisan basis ; in the selection of the new commission no word or question was mentioned or asked as to the politics of any of its members , and the appointment of a leading Democratic senator by a Republican President showed pretty conclusively that politics would not enter . The necessity for the Panama Canal and for its early completion was fully realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be secured only by the application of business and non-partisan methods . This has generally been the case in all government work wherever undertaken . The Canal , as a whole , has been built by hired labor , but a number of small contracts were made at various times during the construction period with resulting economy . In some instances , due to the isolated locality of the work , the housing and feeding of the force engaged would have been very expensive ; while the commission , following the policy that had been adopted , would have been obliged to provide such facilities , a contractor was not , and recourse was had to the contract method . In other cases the excess labor supply enabled ex-employees to do work cheaper by contract , as the contractor was not obliged to maintain the same wage scale and working hours as the commission . Again , the fabrication and erection of the lock-gates and steel frames of buildings were contracted for ; the contractor controlling the shipment of the various parts could supply the artisans to meet the delivery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually the case , nearly all of the contracts thus made exceeded the time limit fixed for completion . Considering the work as a whole , were it to be done over in the light of the experience gained by its construction , I would advocate employing again the method that has been followed . From the very nature of the case it is impossible to say whether the work has been done more cheaply or more quickly than it could have been done by contract if the plan favored by lair . Stevens had been adopted , for comparison is impossible . All that can be said is that the work has been completed within the time limit fixed by the International Board of Consulting Engineers in 1906 , notwithstanding the increased dimensions of the locks and the unexpected difficulties which developed in excavating the channel through Culebra Cut . Also , that leaving out of consideration the accessories undertaken in 1912 , and not originally contemplated , it has been built within the estimated cost . As bearing on this question , it is interesting to record that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest of the four bids offered , and who visited the Isthmus after the work was well under way , declared frankly that it was being done more cheaply and more expeditiously than would have been possible under the contract system , and expressed the opinion that he and all other financial backers of the proposed contract method would have been ruined if their bid had been accepted , and would not have been able to complete the task . Actual experience has refuted nearly or quite all of the criticisms and objections which were made at the time of the transfer of the work . At no time during its progress after I took charge was there any difficulty in securing competent and experienced men for the various positions , though it must be admitted that these were not always selected . Though I endeavored to impress upon all the necessity for selection of men with special fitness for vacancies or new positions , in  | many cases the personal element determined the employing official in making the appointment or promotion , with the inevitable result of increased cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational purposes . This , however , could not be an argument in favor of the contract method , for on the percentage basis the contractor or some of his subordinates , being human , would be influenced by similar considerations . Nor was there any difficulty in retaining the men till the completion of the work . In many cases advantageous offers were rejected , and it must be so in any work which appealed so strongly to the imagination as did the Canal . The charge made in the quoted letter to Secretary Taft concerning the inability of a government official to secure teamwork among employees received only amused consideration at the time it was made , for the managers of government work are men , like the managers for corporations , and the development of esprit de corps in any organization depends on other conditions than the ultimate power behind it . Those who looked into the work during its progress and who were competent to judge agreed in the assertion that the team-work and the esprit de corps developed in the organization have never been surpassed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who could do such work with so much spirit . I am free to say that were I to do it over again I could build it more cheaply , and such a result could have been secured had I received the loyal support and cooperation of all my associates . The enormous proportions of the work made it impossible for one man to see to it personally that all details were executed properly , and in this respect the quoted statement of Mr. Stevens concerning one-man control is correct . In any aggregation of contractors , as in any commission or board , there will always be , sooner or later , a directing head ; the strongest or most dominating personality will assume supreme authority , resulting , finally , in one-man control . If this does not result , the management will be weak and irresponsible , with failure as the outcome . Under all circumstances execution of all details must depend upon the co-operation and loyalty of associates and subordinates . The utmost that a directing head can do is to see to it that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subordinates , and they must be relied upon to be loyal to the trust . @#
