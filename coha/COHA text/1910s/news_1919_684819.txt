txt The ' problem of the declining birth rate has taken an added significance since the war , as a result of the in- , creased living costs and the shortage of labor ; but as yet the older States , held fast in a traditional and complex life , have done little or nothing to-. ward solving it . The first plan comes from Australia , which has so often served as an experimental laboratory in sociology . In the idea of a maternity benefit , to be sure , there is nothing new . It has even been put.in operation in various parts of the world , and with results that seem to be fortunate in direct ratio as the law is ably and honestly administered . What distinguishes the Australian plan is its quite too elaborately scientific thoroughness . All necessary data as to living costs and the cost of raw materials are to be ascertained by the Board of Trade and made the basis of new schedules of wages and prices . The question of children and of the future supply of labor is- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted to be a service to ' the State  --  and the State has suffered sorely .. from the tardiness of this admission  --  then the just wages of a bachelor and of the father of a family are quite different things . The ' new bill , which has passed , the Legislative - Assembly of New South Wales , provides a substantial benefit for each child in addition to the father 's regular ' wage . The fund from which the benefit . is to ba paid will be collected in monthly payments made to the State by employers of labor and is to-be administered by the Government ; so it is really a tax laid upon employers to provide a prize fund for parenthood . Obviously there will be ample opportunity for the abuses that have so often beset the State in administering affairs that are largely individual and private . But if we are to accept sociology as a science , Or capable of becoming so , the world laboratory mist be open to all sorts of experiments . A significant feature of the plan is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not exceed $2,000 a year . The benefits will accrue mainly to wage earners , and the resulting increase of population will be mainly in their own class . Salaried brain workers , who are themselves educated and who naturally aspire to give their children advanced schooling , will be in no wise benefited . Yet these are the people who have suffered most severely from the rising costs of life , and among whom the birth rate has fallen most alarmingly . If , as seems inevitable , the cost of the new benefits falls upon them as upon all others in the community , their plight will be rendered only the more painful . In the long run the growth of one class will he gained at the expense of atrophy in another class  --  a class which is at least equally indispensable to the vitality of any State . Unless the reform ' advances beyond its present stage it will remain essentially class legislation  --  socialistic rather than social . It would never have been accepted in Utopia.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
