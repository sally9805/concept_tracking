txt Five policemen were hurt , probably fatally , and more than 200 striking brass workers were removed to hospitals tonight in a riot which extended throughout Brooklyn , a suburb of this city , following a walkout of employes of five large manufacturing plants . A panic developed throughout the city as fusillades of shots were fired In the Brooklyn section after all apparatus of the fire department had been called and the home guard hurriedly mobilized . Not until the city guard had put its machine guns in position at the entrances to all the factories involved in the strike were the police able to halt destruction of property and get the situation In hand . At least half of the injured strikers are suffering from Dul-1 wounds . The firemen turned the water upon the crowds at different points . Many of the firemen were badly mauled and in some instances the crowd got possession of the hose and turned them upon the police .
