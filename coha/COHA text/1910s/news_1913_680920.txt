txt The first serious friction over appointments that the Mayor-elect has faced since he began making up his slate has brought about complications that I are giving Mr. Mitchel embarrassment . It became known yesterday that he has about decided to abandon his first choice for Corporation Counsel , who was George V. Mullan , his former law part ' ner , and that he is looking about for some one else for the office . One of the first applicants for the place was Montgomery Hare , an Independent Democrat who took an active part in Mr. Mitohel 's campaign . Shortly after he returned from his vacation , it was reported that Mr. Mitchel intended to appoint Mr. Mullen to the place . Mr. Hare 's friends at once became exceedingly active and brought every argument possible to bear upon the Mayor ' elect to have him change his mind . When they received no encouragement , Mr. Hare 's friends made a trip to Washington and told President Wilson 's representatives of the situation . ' It was pointed out that the selection of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans , but to the Independent Democrate , who worked hard for Mr. Mitchel and who hoped to have his aid in bringing about a reorganization of Tam ' many Hall . A week ago last Wednesday Mr. Mitchel went to Washington to attend the dinner given by the President to his Cabinet . It was said that the President 's secretary , Joseph Tumulty , and Secretary of the Treasury , who are keeping close watch on New York ' City politics , hinted to Mr. Mitchel that the National Administration would be more pleased if Mr. Mullan was not appointed to so responsible a place as Corporation Counsel , but that an hide- ' Pendent Democrat of the type of Mr. Hare should be selected . Mr. Mitchel , upon his return to the city , immediately held a conference with Mr. dare and . suggested that he take , the ' 7ffice of ' President , pf ? the , I Board of ** new held " by ' , Charleti , Strlitistr . Mk . Hater it-ls-zald , told Mr. Mitchel flatly that he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation Counsel and would be satisfied with nothing else . At the same time Samuel S. Koenig , President of the Republican County Committee , . and other Republican leaders informed Mr. Mitchel that they felt that either the office of Corporation Counsel . or that of City Chamberlain should go . to the organization . Mr. Mitchel had already selected Henry Bruere , one of the Directors of the . Bureau of Municipal Research , for City Chamberlain , and the fact that Mr. Koenig was told that the Republican organization would not get either place led to the rumor of a break betweeh Ala Koenig and Mr. Mitchel . ' The result of the activities of the Republicans on . the one hand and the friends of Mr. Hare on the other , backed up by the hint from Washington , is said to have convinced Mr. Mitchel that it would be impolitic to appoint Mr. Mullan . Mr. Hare , it is said , has made up his mind that he can not get the place , but his friends say he is satisfied so long as Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hare was asked about the matter last night he refused to affirm or deny anything . " I have nothing whatever to say , " was his only comment . Neither would Mr. Mitchel discuss the situation . He said he would not discuss appointments in any way until he was ready to make public his selections on Dec. 31 . Although Mr. Hare 's friends say they have won a victory even if Mr. Hare is not appointed , the Republican leaders , on the other hand , are as much dissatisfied as , ever and are strenuously urging Mr. Mitchel , now that Mr. Mullan is eliminated , to ignore the independent Democrats and appoint a good Republican as Corporation Counsel . The Republican leaders are about convinced that there is no hope for them in the City Chamberlain 's office . One of Mr. Mitchel 's friends said yesterday that the Mayor-elect had offered the place to Mr. Bruere and that the latter had accepted . If Mr. Bruere is made City Chamberlain he will make many reforms in that office . It will no longer be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berth with a Ware of $12,000 a year . tinder the new administration the place will be almost that of a Vice ' Mayor 's office . The City Chamberlain will perform a great deal of general supervisory work over the other city departments , and the City Government will be more than ever ' centralized in the Mayor 's office . Mr. Mitchel is said to be even considering the advisability of having a staff of investigators attached to the office so that much of the work done by the present Commissioner of Accounts will be performed by the Chamberlain . It is not improbable that Mr. Bruere may have a desk in the Mayor 's office so that he can be consulted on all matters of administrative policy . It is known that Mr. Mitchel talked over this reform with Borough President and Controller Prendergast , and that both opposed the plan on the ground that it would he too expensive .. Mr. Mitchel has clung to the idea , however and in appointing Mr. Bruere he as hopeful that all his ideas along this line will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When asked if he had . been aininted.he replied : am not thinking ( Such about it . " " Does that mean that you have refused it ? " " No . " " Will you accept it ? " " You can understand that I can not talk about It at this time . " When it was suggested to Mr. Bruere that he might want to- get into an office where he could carry into effect many of the reforms that he has advocated through the Bureau of Municipal , Research . he said : " I , believe that there is a great opportunity for constructive work in the office of City Chamberlain , Heretofore the place has been regarded simply as a sinecure . There ought hi be in the city government at place for the training of administrative officers , a place where the administration of the city 's affairs can be centralized .

In the event that neither Mr. MuIlar nor Mr. Hare gets the place , it was said yesterday that the appointment may go to Cyrus C. Miller , Borough President of the Bronx . Mr. Miller was not re-elected . He is an independent Democrat , and when Mr. Mitchel and Mr. Mullen dissolved partnership he I offered the use of his office , which was next door in the building at 55 Liberty Street , to Mr. Mitchel , and the latter ! readily accepted . Mr. Hare has long taken a prominent Part in political affairs in the city from an independent Democratic standpoint . He was one of the leaders in the fight against William F.

The Question came up over the report that the Mayor-elect intended to appoint F , J. H. Kracke , former naval officer and Republican district leader of Brooklyn . to an Important position . Mr. Mitchel was quoted as saying that he would not appoint a district leader under any circumstances . " I did not say that , " said Mr. Mitchel . " I will appoint any district leader if he is the kind of a man I am after . The fact that he is a district leader will not militate against him . I did not say that I would n't appoint Mr. Kracke because he happened to be a leader in a political organization .
