Zhe New REPUBLIC A Journal of Opinion VOLUME I New York , Saturday , December 26 , 1914 NUMBER 8 IF men must hate , it is perhaps just as well that they should make no Christmas truce , that the stench of battle should rise above the churches where they preach good-will to men . A few carols , a little incense and some tinsel will heal no wounds ; a love that men have not yet learned to live for they will not create by celebrating its glory . Yet as they turn away from their devotions this Christ ? mas time , sick with the irony of it all , facing , it may be , another year of war and the revengeful decades that may follow , they will not long admit that they are beaten . The festival , so empty to-day that it jeers at us , may still appear like a finely-wrought chalice fit to contain a splendid wine . It is a re ? minder of the saying that there is a pathetic ca ? pacity in men to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WE publish this week as Part II of THE NEW REPUBLIC a description by Dr. John Andrews of a national system of labor exchanges , the first of a series of expert studies designed to supplement the running comment of our ordinary columns . In working week by week all journals face the difficulty of handling any one subject with sufficiently comprehensive detail to make the re ? sults available for the immediate test of practical life . A weekly like THE NEW REPUBLIC is not a technical magazine in which specialists work out their intimate problems . It is rather a representa ? tive of the layman who meets the expert , acknow ? ledges him , and endeavors to relate his work to the larger issues and more generalized business of ordinary living . For example , we have repeated insistently that a national system of labor exchanges is the way to begin an organization of the labor market , and that without such organization un ? employment will be permanently baffling . But we have not the space to work out the details of such a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , it is , as Dr. Andrews himself points out , not the whole of the story . Unemployment is a disease requiring more heroic treatment than is implied in a system of labor exchanges . But anytreatment to be effective must rest on something more than a few generalities , it must work with the careful technique and the long experience which Dr. Andrews brings to the discussion . We offer his study as a part of this journal , not only to perform what seems to us a useful and timely service , but to present an example of the kind of effort which should lie behind the agitation of reform . NO matter how sincerely desirous a President may be to cooperate with Congress , the time always comes when the interests of his great con ? stituency oblige him to enter into a fight with one or both branches of the legislative body . Per ? haps that time has come for Mr. Wilson . The Senate has begun to reject his nominations for cer ? tain offices , not because they are unfit , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those states in which the patronage is situated . The newspapers declare that the Presi ? dent does not intend to yield . He certainly ought not to yield , for he is fighting in a good cause , but good as is the cause , he will have to be something more than a good fighter in order to win . No Pres ? ident has ever succeeded in persuading or forcing the Senate to accept Presidential appointments against the will of a reluctant Senator . On other questions the Senate may be an irresolute and a discordant body ; but in the matter of defending its illicit control over government patronage , it is as resolute and united as a regiment of German soldiers . All differences of party , of section , of social training and of economic interest are wiped out by the terrifying threat of Presidential freedom of appointment . On this question the Republican Senator votes with his Democratic enemy , the im ? maculate Progressive with the grimy Penrose , the farmer from North Dakota with the manufacturer from Pittsburgh , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all brothers in patronage . President Wilson knows how to fight with courage and tenacity , but if he proposes to see this business through , he will need more of both than any President has yet been able to muster . THE unanimity which is shown by the Senate in defending its control over patronage is a most formidable fact . When a body of men who are divided one from another in every other con ? ceivable respect unite and remain united upon a single question , that question evidently involves one of those issues which lie almost too deep for words . The issue involved by the present fight is the funda ? mental one of administrative independence . The American bi-partisan democracy has since the days of Jackson always disliked and resented any as ? sumption of independence on the part of adminis ? trative officials . It has always been morbidly afraid of the gradual creation of an official class , which would escape popular control ; and the system of rotation in office and Congressional nomination of Federal appointments was invented for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the administration . During a period when democracy was essentially local and partisan in its nature and when administration was not pri ? marily a matter of expert training , this method of democratizing the administration had certain ad ? vantages . But during a period in which the party organizations have ceased to be representative of popular aspirations , and when administration is becoming increasingly scientific in its standards and methods , the old system of appointment has lost its propriety . What the system means now is the partial sub ? jugation of the Federal administrative system to merely local interests and needs . Just as Con ? congress log-rolls in order to secure local appropria ? tions , so it log-rolls with greater effectiveness in order to control local appointments . The official who owes his appointment to a Senator rather than to the President will be far more solicitous to please his unofficial than his official master ; and the Senate is fighting at the present time for precisely this right to interfere with the administration and divide its allegiance . The only hope of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of the future depends upon the de ? struction of Congressional influence upon adminis ? trative officials . President Wilson is too well-in ? formed a student of American politics not to under ? stand the importance of the issue , but he also must understand the strength of the opposition . He must know that he has arrayed against him both the Con ? gressional and the two-party system , as well as strong local prejudices and interests . He can not carry this fight through without becoming as alien ? ated from Congress as were Presidents Cleveland and Roosevelt . But he needs Congressional co ? operation for his legislative program , and in the long run he is not likely to assume any attitude with respect to patronage which will prevent him from obtaining it . ET us not be discouraged about low wages in America . What though half our working girls can barely maintain life ? What though many unskilled workmen fail to support themselves even with the work of daughters and perhaps of wives ? Conditions are improving . For , according to Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still lower in the age of Diocletian . The unskilled workman of the year 301 A.D. earned only fifteen cents a day and even the house-painter had to content himself with a beggarly wage of forty-three cents . Prices also were lower , to be sure , for beef and mutton cost less than five cents a pound and eggs could be bought for five cents a dozen ; still , conditions were undoubtedly worse . If then , in the short space of 1611 years we have advanced so far , may we not hope that in another 1611 years , say by December , 3525 , we may have at last reached a stage where we can confidently look forward to a gradual approach through the millenniums to a real living wage ? THE New York Sun published this week some correspondence from Rome in regard to the Pope , which is interesting even if it is untrue . It is reported that the Catholic emperor of Austria-Hungary may be excommunicated for making an alliance with the Moslem caliph who has declared a holy war on Christianity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Joseph is the only Roman Catholic left at the head of a Great Power in Europe , and he finds himself fighting on the side of the Moslems against the Christians of the near East . All this is somewhat complicated by the persistent rumor that Great Britain is again to send an Ambassador to the Holy See . It would be in ? teresting if the excommunication followed , for it would show us Protestant England , which rules Egypt and India , whispering to the Pope that he should defend the faith . We are happy to reflect that the tangle is not for us to unravel , and we leave it with the reflection that while religion may count in diplomacy , religion certainly does not guide it . ABSOLUTE Prohibitionists are said to take great comfort from the fact that though their amendment failed to muster the necessary two-thirds , it did receive a majority vote in the House . Let them not base too many hopes on the Hobson 's choice which the Representatives faced . Those poor bewildered men had to choose between voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laying themselves open to the charge that they were supporting the liquor interests . On one side all the emotions of home , purity , and mother ; on the other , the sinister lobbying of Dem ? on Rum . On one side , the easy way of voting for righteousness in general ; on the other , the difficult task of meeting a complex problem with intelligence . Using this dilemma as its weapon , it is not difficult for a persistent group of Prohibitionists to stam ? pede a legislature against its instinct and its good sense . For to oppose prohibition in the United States is to run counter to a sulky vein of Puritanism which succeeds in befogging every " moral " question with the blankest unreason . It is so much easier to pass a sweeping law than to consider the enormous problem of regulating personal habits ; it is so much easier to legislate goodness than to achieve it . But in a democracy it is futile , for no law so intimate in its effect can achieve anything but dishonesty and evasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming public opinion . DURING all the discussion over the military unpreparedness of the United States , the aspect of our national policy which does most to disqualify this country from fighting under any cir ? cumstances has been wholly ignored . We refer to the Federal system of military pensions . A nation which has not fought an important war during forty-nine years and which is still paying approximately $160,000,000 a year to its surviving veterans and their widows ? such a nation simply can not afford to go to war . Modern warfare is costly enough in ma ? terial , equipment and all manner of preparation , but if to these necessary costs is added the obliga ? tion of a service pension , the nation would grad ? ually be drained of its economic vitality for the bene ? fit of a comparatively small class . People with an aroused social conscience object to war not merely because it brings with it so much agony and brutality but because it diverts to essentially wasteful pur ? poses the product of so much good human labor . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest available power , and as in other cases of economic waste , the excessive costs are only the outward sign of a grave spiritual disability . By practically declaring that American citizens must be bribed with partial subsequent sup ? port for having served their country , they imply a moral unpreparedness for war far more dangerous and less remedial than any lack of physical prep ? aration . Of course neither these physical nor moral disabilities would prevent the American na ? tion from going to war on any sufficient provoca ? tion , but under the circumstances the economic and social consequences of such a step are nothing less than terrifying . KINDNESS of heart is certainly never to be chided , but has not someone spoken of the danger that in excess of virtue lies ? The recurring discussion of the use of force takes us back to ten ? der sentiments expressed by Patrick MacGill in " Children of the Dead End . " " I never saw Joekill an insect , " says the author of this semi-auto ? biography . " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' If we think evil of insects , what will they think of us ? ' he said to me once . As for myself , I have never killed an insect knowingly in all my life . My house for so long has been the wide world , that I can afford to look leniently on all other inmates , animal or human . Four walls coffin the human sympathies . " For those of us whose hands are imbued in the blood of countless mosqui ? toes , this standard seems to put Mr. MacGill on a pinnacle almost alone . What would he think of a callous country whose motto is " swat the fly " ? But the rich humor of Mr. MacGill 's philosophy is not best tested by references to the Hackensack mead ? ows . It needs to be lined up with Mr. Roosevelt 's startling tales of those Brazilian insects that de ? velop the ill-bred habit of dining on his shoes and socks . THE late Mark Twain proved from statistics that the only safe place to live is on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the most dangerous place in the world is in bed . The number of deaths upon railroad trains is small ; you may travel no one knows how many hundreds of millions of miles before , on the law of probabili ? ties , your train dashes over an embankment , where ? as the number of deaths occurring in bed is simply appalling . By much the same use of statistics , op ? ponents of workmen 's compensation seek to prove that if you want industrial accidents , all you need do is to compensate for them . Enact a good law and your accidents increase . They quote the re ? cent report of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to show that during the last five years the number of Federal employees insured by the government in ? creased only 20% ( from 82,650 to a trifle over 100,00o ) , while the number of reported accidents increased 122.7% and the amount of compensa ? tion paid , 6% . But does this show that there are more accidents , or merely that more accidents are reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portentous , for in the fiscal year 1913 the total cost of compensation was under $400,000 , or less than eight cents per week per employee in ? sured . SAYS Mr. George W. Perkins to the National Civic Federation , " Before laboring men had the advantages of our broad educational system , before they could think well , could reason well , they approached the subject of wages about like this : ' We are getting $2.00 a day . We would like $2.25 a day , and we are going to strike for it . ' And they did . When they got it , the $2.25 looked good for a while , and they then struck again in the same way for $2.50 . But , suggests Mr. Perkins , when the laborer does finally begin " to think well , " " to reason well , " he will not ask for higher wages , but will content himself with a share of the profits , if there are any , and that share will not be deter ? mined by strikes but by an employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantages of our broad educational system . " Of course before any profits at all are made , fixed charges must be met , and these fixed charges will be based upon a capitali ? zation , fair or excessive , but over which in any case the wage-earner has no control . If there are no profits , or seem to be none , the wage-earner natu ? rally loses his share . We doubt therefore whether laborers will not continue to prefer their present ignorance and their strikes for higher wages , to shadowy profits which may never eventuate . AN idea persists that Harry K. Thaw does wrong in using his wealth to hire lawyers who can take advantage of the law 's technicalities . It may be worth remembering that Thaw is mak ? ing a fight for his life , and that if society is foolish enough to leave great wealth in his hands , foolish enough to swaddle justice in legalism , it is expect ? ing a good deal of Harry Thaw to ask that he should proclaim himself a social reformer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's lives where they see in a flash the uselessness and horror of poverty . They may for years have felt a certain pity for the poor , and known in a leisurely , abstract way that poverty was a " prob ? lem . " It was a subject to be considered along with civil service reform , boy scouts , and Ibsen . Then suddenly , perhaps for reasons too intimate for analysis , the idea of what poverty means begins to burn into them , they are tortured with the thought of it , they can no longer be easygoing about it , they resent it and hate it and want to end it . The feeling goes deeper than their reason , draws upon desire within them that is stronger than theory , and makes the war on poverty the central passion of their lives . Every bedraggled slum they visit is a per ? sonal horror , every record of wretched wages and overwork and under-nourishment becomes part of their own indictment against society . And all those who do not feel as they feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediate veil . They snatch at hope . When the desire to do has become strong enough , obstacles seem small ; the difference between what is possible and what is impossible sinks out of sight , and the mind will en ? dure no interruption in its course from the horror of what exists to the promise of what should be . Almost anything begins to look feasible , and almost any theory which seems to consider the present evilcan command them . The reason why socialism is capturing the ablest and most imaginative students in colleges to-day is that socialism alone seems to have the evil thoroughly in mind , and to offer a way out of it . It has literally no competitors . In the ordinary courses on economics the pupil is taught a great deal more about what can not be done than about what can be . In the ordinary speeches of politicians he hears almost nothing about the things he most wishes to hear about . In the ordinary newspaper he finds either silence or platitudes about the poor . Of course he turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a large and generous and sensi ? tive scheme of reconstruction , it commands his loyalty . He goes about preaching it , and for the most part he is able to annihilate the objections which other people raise . The real gulf , however , is not one theory , but of will and desire . The bent of all his prejudices is determined by his revulsion against existing facts , and by his faith that they can be changed . But the people he meets do not have this revulsion , feel only in a faint way about these facts , and are not preoccupied with changing them . They are busy with other things ; the propagandist 's voice seems shrill to them , and it does become shrill in its desperate effort to break through their indifference . A creed reiterated too often becomes mechanical , a belief battered against brute opposi ? tion hardens and becomes inflexible . Then , if the propagandist sets out to apply his theory , he meets the relentless complexity of the real world . No theory fits the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme must be distorted and compromised in its realization . He has to choose between the symmetry of his idea and the intractable nature of the facts . He begins to see that anything so vast as a reconstruction ? tion of society can only be accomplished by an im ? mense number of little steps , a constant readjust ? ment of theory , and a depressing amount of com ? promise . The dilemma is a hard one . If he clings to his well-ordered doctrine he must insulate him ? self against experience , and he becomes a doctrin ? aire , becomes that terrible nuisance , a man with a fixed idea who is incapable of learning , and he gives up his effort to change the world in order to coddle his theory . Yet if he faces the facts and sets about loyally adjusting himself to them , he may easily be smoth ? ered in detail . Little questions of procedure absorb him , technique perhaps fascinates him , and he be ? comes utterly impatient of the people who think that big changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may become a specialist who is grudging , niggardly , and complacent . He , too , gives up the large effort to change the world in order to back and fill within some petty phase of it .
