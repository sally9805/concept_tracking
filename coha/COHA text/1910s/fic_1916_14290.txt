After a second 's stillness , a door closes out at the right , and immediately Mrs. Aldrid enters through the archway , carrying several parcels , which she hastens to deposit on the center-table ; then she straightens up and draws a deep breath . She is a trim blonde , in her late twenties , wearing a tailored coat-suit of fawn-colored serge , a toque of champagne silk , and a waist of very pale pink silk . Her slippers and stockings are of the lighter shades of brown , and she wears a quite long string of freakish black-and-yellow beads . Before she has had time to take the second breath , the bronze clock on the mantelpiece , at the left , strikes five . She glances at it . MRS . ALDRID Heavens ! five o'clock ! ( She hurriedly removes her coat and hat , lays them on the sofa in front of the mantelpiece , and , with a glance at herself in the mirror over the mantelpiece , vanishes through the door at the left . Then there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the right , carrying a roll of blue-prints in one hand , and the evening paper in the other . He is a tall and thin , very intelligent-looking man of perhaps thirty-three , wearing a dark-blue , double-breasted business suit , dark shoes , and a dark tie . He sets the roll of blue-prints down on the center-table , and then Mrs. Aldrid speaks to him from the room out at the left ) Is that you , Gene ? p. 3 ALDRID ( looking toward the left , and then starting over towards his desk at the right ) Yes . MRS . ALDRID You must have been right behind me . ALDRID ( laying the newspaper on his desk . ) Did you just get in ? MRS . ALDRID ( coming into the room from the left , adjusting a bungalow apron ) This minute ,  --  I 've been in town shopping ; I had no idea it was so late . ALDRID ( picking up a telegram from his desk , and opening it ) It 's after five . MRS . ALDRID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ready ; you 'll have to wait a while for your dinner . ALDRID ( with an exaggerated sigh of resignation ) Ah  --  ho ! ( Reads the telegram . ) MRS . ALDRID Did you come out on the four-fifty-three ? ALDRID ( without looking up ) Yes ; you were n't on it , were you ? MRS . ALDRID No , I 'd intended coming out on the train , but  --  something happened that made me change my mind . p. 4 ALDRID ( looking straight ahead , thinking ; and tapping the telegram , which he has finished reading , against his hand ) Spaulding . ( Turning suddenly to Mrs. Aldrid . ) What ? Why  --  what happened ? MRS . ALDRID ( assuming an air of great confidence ) Wait till I tell you ! ( She steps to the back of the room and looks keenly out into the hallway , to assure herself that no one is within hearing  --  then comes down to the left of her husband , who watches her curiously . ) You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crepe for that new blouse of mine . ALDRID Yes . MRS . ALDRID Well ,  --  as I went into the Market Street entrance of Blum 's  --  you know , there 's a glove-counter right inside the Market Street door . ( Aldrid nods . ) Well , I went over to ask the saleslady where I could get the Crepe ; and , as I leaned over to ask her , I stepped on something : it felt like a bracelet or something  --  rather soft  --  and yet it was metallic . ALDRID Yes . MRS . ALDRID Well , I did n't pay any attention to it at first ,  --  I thought it might be a joke or something ,  --  you know , they 're always doing that sort of thing in those Department Stores . p. 5 ALDRID Yes , I know . MRS . ALDRID But , as I started away from the counter , I just glanced down at the floor ; and , what do you suppose it was ? ALDRID What ? MRS . ALDRID A purse  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it ? MRS . ALDRID Well , now , wait till I tell you . I did n't open it right away ; I was afraid someone might be looking ; so I waited till I got up to the writing-room before I opened it : and , what do you suppose was in it ? ALDRID What ? MRS . ALDRID Four  --  hundred  --  dollars . ALDRID ( after a slight pause ) Four hundred dollars ? MRS . ALDRID Hum  --  hum . ALDRID ( incredulously ) Where is it ? MRS . ALDRID In my pocketbook . ALDRID Well , are you sure it 's real money ? MRS . ALDRID Of course it is ; I 'll show it to you in a minute.xs You know , I could scarcely believe my eyes at first ; because , you know , I 've never found anything in all my life ; and then to suddenly pick up eight fifty-dollar bills . Positively , Gene , I do n't know how I ever got home . p. 6 ALDRID Were they all fifties ? MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as though they 'd just been taken out of a bank . ALDRID ( turning suddenly and leaning on the chair in front of his desk , then looking at her ) Can you imagine losing that ! MRS . ALDRID Losing it ? Can you imagine finding it ? I thought I was seeing things . ( She starts towards the door at the left . ) ALDRID Did you say anything about it ? MRS . ALDRID ( stopping , and turning to him ) How do you mean ? ALDRID At the " Lost and Found " ? MRS . ALDRID No , of course I did n't ; what do you think I am . ALDRID You might have gotten in touch with the owner . MRS . ALDRID ( smiling indulgently ) Positively , Gene , you talk like a boy from the country . ALDRID Why so ? MRS . ALDRID ( with a touch of impatience , and coming to the left of the center-table ) Because you do ! Do n't you know that if I were to turn that amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd stand just about as much chance of ever seeing it again as I would of seeing the North Pole ? p. 7 ALDRID Well , you would n't expect ever to see it again if it were returned to the owner ? MRS . ALDRID And , how would I know that it had been returned to the owner ? ALDRID Oh , everybody is n't dishonest ! ( Glances through the telegram again . ) MRS . ALDRID Well , you let people get their hands on four hundred dollars  --  you 'll find out how many of them are honest ! Turn that amount of money over to one of those " Lost and Found " clerks  --  he 'd soon find an owner for it , believe me ! ( She starts for the door at the left . ) ALDRID ( crushing the telegram in his hand ) What are you going to do with it ? ( She stops at the door and looks back at him . He gracefully tosses the telegram overhand into the waste-paper basket below his desk . ) MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho ! MRS . ALDRID ( surprised that he should ask such a question ) What do you suppose I 'm going to do with it  --  throw it away ? It 's as good in my pocket as it is in anybody 's else ! ( He turns and looks at her in a way that disconcerts her slightly , but , as he withdraws his eyes in turning to his desk , she regains herself , and comes a step or two farther into the room . ) I can get awnings for this whole house for that  --  and a Victrola , too ! p. 8 ALDRID ( coming over to the center-table for his blue-prints , after looking for them on his desk ) You 'd better not count your chickens before they 're hatched . MRS . ALDRID ( after looking at him for a second ) What do you mean ? ALDRID ( picking up the roll of blue-prints from the table , and speaking rather abstractedly ) Why , there 'll very likely be an ad for it in one of the morning papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ALDRID ( looking at the blue-prints ) Nothing , only you 'd simply have to return it , that 's all . MRS . ALDRID ( after thinking for a second , and with an expression of sullen calculation ) I do n't see why I should . ( He raises his eyes from the blue-prints and looks at her quizzically . ) ALDRID You do n't see why you should return lost property to the person who lost it ? MRS . ALDRID That depends . ALDRID ( in a level tone ) Upon what ? MRS . ALDRID ( looking straight ahead ) Whether or not I was sure he 'd lost it . p. 9 ALDRID Could n't you make sure ? MRS . ALDRID ( after turning and looking at him ) How ? 21 ALDRID Identification MRS . ALDRID Not in this case . ALDRID Why not ? MRS . ALDRID Because there is n't a solitary thing about it , Gene , by which it could possibly be identified : not a card or a paper of any kind ! ALDRID How about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it ; a plain , gold , mesh bag . ( Indicating the desk at the right . ) I 've had one in that top drawer there for the past year . ALDRID Could n't the money be described ? MRS . ALDRID That would n't be any identification . ALDRID Why not ? MRS . ALDRID Why , because  --  money is simply money !  --  unless it 's marked ; and this is n't , because I 've examined it very carefully . ALDRID ( resting one end of the roll of blue-prints on the table , and leaning his elbow on the other end ) So you do n't see any possible way by which this money could be returned to its owner ? p. 10 MRS . ALDRID Not unless I took his word for it ; ( turning and looking at him ) and , really , I do n't see why I should do that . ALDRID ( evenly ) What are you trying to do , make yourself believe it belongs to you ? MRS . ALDRID ( turning her head away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . MRS . ALDRID I suppose so . ALDRID Possibly some poor man or woman . MRS . ALDRID ( with a little toss of her head ) Now , do n't get sentimental , please ! ALDRID ( with a touch of impatience , and taking a couple of steps in front of the table towards her ) That is n't sentiment at all ! MRS . ALDRID ( turning to him sharply , and speaking incisively ) No very poor man or woman has any eight fifty-dollar bills to lose . ( She turns away , and secures a hairpin at the back of her head : he looks at her steadily . ) And no matter who lost it , it 'll be a very good lesson to him to be a little more careful in the future . p. 11 ALDRID I see . Well , why should he pay you four hundred dollars for that lesson ? MRS . ALDRID Nobody 's paying me any four hundred dollars . ALDRID You 've often lost things yourself , have n't you ? MRS . ALDRID ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got them back , either ! ALDRID Whose fault was that ? MRS . ALDRID ( turning away again ) I do n't know whose fault it was . ALDRID Well , try and think . MRS . ALDRID Unless the people who found them were n't honest enough to return them . ( The door out at the right closes . ) Who 's that ? ( She starts for the archway at the right , tossing her apron onto the sofa as she goes . ) ALDRID ( turning and crossing to his desk ) Somebody at the door . MRS . ALDRID ( in a lowered tone ) Do n't say anything about this . ( She reaches the archway . ) Oh , it 's you , Mrs. Hampton ! ( Aldrid half glances towards the archway , then picks up the evening paper and flips it open. ) p. 12 MRS . HAMPTON ( in the hallway ) Yes , it 's me . MRS . ALDRID ( rather effusively ) Come right in ! ( She extends her arm and hand , and leads Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , with a pale but lovely face , and a certain Madonna quality about her generally . She is of the same build as Mrs. Aldrid , and , apparently , of the same age . She wears a coat-suit of good black , a white-silk waist , with a little string of purple beads at her throat , and a medium-sized hat of very dark , purple-colored straw , trimmed with an ornament of itself . Her slippers and stockings are black . ) MRS . HAMPTON Good-evening . MRS . ALDRID Good-evening , dear , how are you ? ALDRID Good-evening , Mrs. Hampton . MRS . HAMPTON Oh , good-evening , Mr. Aldrid , I did n't see you . I hope you 'll both excuse me for coming in without ringing . ALDRID ( tossing his paper onto the desk ) Do n't mention it . MRS . ALDRID ( standing back of the center-table ) Saved me the trouble of answering the door ; it 's the girl 's day out . p. 13 MRS . HAMPTON Well , I do hope I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear , really ; I 've just gotten in from town . MRS . HAMPTON I 've been in the city , too ; I came out on the four-fifty-three . ALDRID ( placing a chair , which he has taken from above his desk , about mid-way between the center-table and the archway ) Wo n't you take a chair , Mrs. Hampton ? MRS . HAMPTON No , thank you , Mr. Aldrid , I ca n't stay a moment . ALDRID I 'm sorry . ( He moves down to his desk again and picks up the paper . ) MRS . ALDRID Why not ? MRS . HAMPTON ( obviously troubled about something ) Oh , I 'm too upset . MRS . ALDRID Are you ill , dear ? MRS . HAMPTON No ,  --  but  --  I 'd like to ask your advice about something . MRS . ALDRID Well , do sit down for a minute . ( Mrs. Hampton hesitates , then sits . Mrs. Aldrid takes a chair from the back , and , placing it above the center-table and slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands at the lower corner of his desk , reading the paper . There is a slight pause . ) What is it ? p. 14 MRS . HAMPTON ( speaking directly to Mrs. Aldrid ) I 've lost some money . ( Aldrid lifts his eyes over the top of his paper and looks straight out ; Mrs. Aldrid looks straight into Mrs. Hampton 's eyes for a second , then rises quietly , still holding her eyes , and moves to the center-table . ) MRS . ALDRID Much ? MRS . HAMPTON Quite a bit , yes . ALDRID ( without turning ) Where did you lose it , Mrs. Hampton ? MRS . HAMPTON ( turning to him ) I have n't an idea ; ( Mrs. Aldrid has been looking intently at her , but , at this , she shifts her eyes to Aldrid , with a shade of relief. ) but I think it was in town . ( Aldrid turns and glances at his wife , but she shifts her eyes back again to Mrs. Hampton . ) ALDRID How much was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( quickly ) I suppose you do n't know the exact amount , do you , dear ? MRS . HAMPTON ( turning to her ) Four hundred dollars . ( Aldrid looks at his wife , but she 's looking blankly at Mrs. Hampton . ) Is n't that dreadful ! Of course , I know it would only be an item to some people ,  --  but , to me ! I feel terrible about it ! ( She breaks down and cries . Aldrid turns and looks at her ; then , tossing his paper onto the desk , and thrusting his hands into his trousers-pockets , he turns and strolls towards the back of the room , looking significantly at his wife. ) p. 15 MRS . ALDRID ( advancing and placing her hands on Mrs. Hampton 's arms ) Now , do n't cry , Mrs. Hampton , it is n't that bad . MRS . HAMPTON Oh , I think it 's dreadful to lose all that money ! MRS . ALDRID I know it is , dear ; I do n't wonder you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Aldrid is frozen into stillness . Aldrid steps forward eagerly from the archway , where he has been standing . ) ALDRID Eight fifties ? MRS . HAMPTON Yes . ALDRID ( straightening up , and looking at his wife with an ingenuous smile ) Eight fifties . MRS . HAMPTON And brand-new ones , too ! It 's awful ! ( She begins crying again . ) ALDRID ( to his wife , voicelessly , and indicating Mrs. Hampton with a nod ) Why do n't you tell her ? ( Mrs. Aldrid lifts her chin and looks at him icily ; whereupon he indicates Mrs. Hampton again , with an austere point of his finger . ) MRS . ALDRID ( choosing the better part of valor , and leaning over the back of Mrs. Hampton 's chair ) Come now , Mrs. Hampton , you may not have lost it at all ! ( Aldrid , who has been watching his wife narrowly , breaks slowly , and goes to his desk , where he espies a large scribbled note fastened to the desk-light , to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower corner of his desk and reads it. ) p. 16 MRS . HAMPTON ( tearfully ) Oh , but I have , Mrs. Aldrid ! MRS . ALDRID I know , my dear , but , you know , sometimes we think we 've lost a thing , and we find out later that we have n't lost it at all . MRS . HAMPTON But , I 've looked everywhere , and it 's lost , I tell you ! MRS . ALDRID But , you may find it again , honey . MRS . HAMPTON Oh , I do n't think so ! MRS . ALDRID Or someone else may find it . MRS . HAMPTON But , that would n't do me any good . MRS . ALDRID It would if the person who found it were honest . MRS . HAMPTON I 'm afraid very few people are honest , if it cost them four hundred dollars . ( Aldrid finishes reading the note , and sits looking out , thinking . ) MRS . ALDRID Well , now , it may be one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't expect ever to get it again . ALDRID Nonsense , Mrs. Hampton ! MRS . HAMPTON I don't. p. 17 ALDRID Nonsense ! Now , you wait and see . ( There is a pause : Mrs. Hampton touches her handkerchief to her eyes . ) MRS . ALDRID ( looking away off ) Of course , you 'll have to advertise . ( There is a second before Aldrid grasps what she has said ; then he turns his head sharply and looks at her ; but she is still looking away off . ) MRS . HAMPTON Yes , that 's what I wanted to see Mr. Aldrid about ; ( She turns to him. ) which would be the best paper for me to advertise in . ( He sits looking at his wife until she turns and meets his eyes : then he abstractedly extends his arm and hand in a gesture of interrogation , to which she responds by a sudden and taut pressing of her closed hand against her breast . He rises , to divert the attention of Mrs. Hampton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his desk-chair , starts slowly across the room in front of the center-table . As he passes Mrs. Hampton , she rises also . ) Now , do n't let me worry you , Mr. Aldrid ! ALDRID ( abstractedly ) No , no , it is n't that  --  I was just  --  wondering  --  MRS . HAMPTON ( turning to Mrs. Aldrid ) If I 'd thought it would bother you folks , I should n't have told you at all . p. 18 MRS . ALDRID That 's perfectly all right , dear . MRS . HAMPTON But I was so troubled when I got home , I simply could n't stay in the house ! I just had to come out and tell someone ! And , my dear , I do n't know how I 'm ever going to tell Frank when he comes home tonight ; because he said to me this morning , when I told him I was going to town  --  he said , " Can I trust you to deposit this money for me ? " And I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well , " he said , " you 're always losing things ! " " Well , " I said , " there 's no danger of my losing four hundred dollars . " " Well , " he said , " I hope not , or we 'll get a guardian for you ! " ( Starting to cry again . ) And then I go straight into the city and lose it ! ( She cries a little , Mrs. Aldrid stands watching her ; and Aldrid , who is leaning on his elbow on the mantelpiece , over at the left , watches Mrs. Aldrid . ) And , mind you , to make sure that nothing would happen to it , I did n't even put it with my other money ! MRS . ALDRID ( eagerly , but without moving ) Where did you put it ? MRS . HAMPTON In one of those little , gold , mesh purses . ( Aldrid accidentally tears the note-paper which he still has in his hand. ) p. 19 ALDRID Mrs. Hampton ! MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ? MRS . HAMPTON When I was going up the steps into the bank . ALDRID Which bank ? MRS . HAMPTON The Franklin National . MRS . ALDRID Where 's that ? ALDRID Broad and Chestnut . Where had you been before that ? MRS . HAMPTON Why , when I came out of the station ,  --  after I got off the train ,  --  ALDRID Yes ? MRS . HAMPTON I went over to Wanamaker 's  --  to get some gloves . ( Aldrid looks at her keenly . ) MRS . ALDRID Wanamaker 's ? MRS . HAMPTON ( turning to her ) Yes . ( Mrs. Aldrid gives a significant look at Aldrid , but he is looking at Mrs. Hampton . ) But they did n't have my size in what I wanted at Wanamaker 's , so I crossed over to Blum 's . ALDRID ( quietly ) Blum 's glove-counter ? p. 20 MRS . HAMPTON Yes . ( Aldrid glances at his wife , but she is coughing into her handkerchief . He moves rather thoughtfully to the left of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on its end on the table and leans upon it . Mrs. Hampton is standing on the opposite side of the table , and Mrs. Aldrid has moved quietly down to a point in front of Aldrid 's desk . ) ALDRID You had n't missed this money up to that time ? MRS . HAMPTON No , and I 'm quite sure I had it up to that time : because I had n't opened my pocketbook from the time I left the house ; and the money was in the big pocketbook . ALDRID I see ; and you went directly from there to the bank ? MRS . HAMPTON Yes , directly . ALDRID Then you think it was somewhere between Blum 's glove-counter and the bank steps that you lost it ? MRS . HAMPTON It must have been : I imagine I must have pulled it out without knowing it , when I was paying for the gloves at Blum 's . ALDRID Very likely . MRS . HAMPTON Or else , possibly , someone opened my pocketbook and took out the little purse ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( She begins to cry again , as she turns back to Mr. Aldrid . ) You know they do that , Mr. Aldrid. p. 21 ALDRID ( abstractedly ) Yes , I know they do . MRS . ALDRID ( standing at the right , quietly toying with her beads , and looking straight ahead , with a calculating expression ) There was n't a card or a paper of any kind in the purse , was there ? MRS . HAMPTON ( turning to her ) No , there was n't a thing in it but the money . MRS . ALDRID That 's too bad : ( Aldrid watches her narrowly. ) no initials on it ? MRS . HAMPTON No , I 've always been going to have my initials put on it , but ,  --  Oh , I do n't know ,  --  I never seemed to get round to it . MRS . ALDRID That makes it bad . MRS . HAMPTON ( with the threat of a few more tears ) Dear me , I wish I had , now . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of forced sincerity ) Yes , because if someone find it , and answer your advertisement , he 'll naturally expect you to be able to identify it  --  definitely ; that is , before you could reasonably expect him to return it to you , I mean . MRS . HAMPTON Yes , I suppose he would ; but , then , I could describe the purse and the money . p. 22 MRS . ALDRID ( with a tolerant smile ) I know , my dear ; but there may be a million purses exactly like it  --  MRS . HAMPTON That 's true , too . MRS . ALDRID And , as far as the money is concerned , why ,  --  money is simply money ; unless it 's marked ; and this is n't , ( checking herself ) as you say . MRS . HAMPTON No , it is n't . MRS . ALDRID So that , really , a person would be more or less obliged to take your word for it , would n't he ? MRS . HAMPTON I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot for us to expect of people , is n't it , dear ? MRS . HAMPTON Too much , I 'm afraid . MRS . ALDRID Especially , when there 's four hundred dollars in the bargain . ( She gives a little mirthless , self-conscious laugh , and settles the lace on Mrs. Hampton 's lapelle . Aldrid , who has been watching her steadily , turns his head away slowly , and his eyes wander about the floor . ) MRS . HAMPTON ( turning to the chair from which she arose ) You 're right , it is rather a poor prospect . ( Sits down. ) p. 23 MRS . ALDRID Oh , well  --  MRS . HAMPTON Unless someone who is really honest find it . MRS . ALDRID ( looking curiously at one of the beads in her necklace ) Of course , the only thing you can do is to advertise . MRS . HAMPTON ( rising ) Yes , I must , right away . ( Moving to the right of the center-table . ) Which paper do you think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldrid ? ( He does n't hear her . ) Mr. Aldrid ? ALDRID ( turning to her suddenly ) I beg your pardon , Mrs. Hampton , what did  --  MRS . ALDRID She wants to know which paper you think it would be best for her to advertise in ? ALDRID ( directly to his wife ) None of them  --  ( To Mrs. Hampton , with a change of tone ) until she hear from me . MRS . ALDRID ( quickly , and laying her hands on Mrs. Hampton 's shoulder and arm ) He means , he 'll look up the circulations later . ( Aldrid looks at her for a rather long pause , but she avoids his eyes ; then , as Mrs. Hampton turns and looks at him , he speaks ) p. 24 ALDRID I 'll telephone you after dinner , Mrs. Hampton . ( He starts towards the back of the room . ) MRS . HAMPTON Well , that 's very charming of you , Mr. Aldrid . ALDRID Do n't mention it . ( He passes out through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taut , general movement of desperate irresolution , turns , and steps back in through the window again ; where , gripping the draperies in his hands , he stands watching his wife with an expression of stony suspicion . ) MRS . HAMPTON ( to Mrs. Aldrid ) And I really feel that I owe you both a genuine apology for bothering you with my troubles . ( Starting for the archway at the right . ) MRS . ALDRID ( turning , and following her ) That 's what neighbors are for , dear . MRS . HAMPTON Good-bye , Mr. Aldrid . ALDRID ( coming a step or two out of the window-alcove ) Good-bye , Mrs. Hampton MRS . HAMPTON I 'll be waiting to hear from you . ALDRID Right away , I 'll call you . MRS . HAMPTON ( turning at the archway ) And , be sure and ask for me , when you telephone , wo n't you ? p. 25 ALDRID Yes , I shall . MRS . HAMPTON Thank you very much . ALDRID You 're very welcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , followed by Mrs. Aldrid , who has been standing at the back of the room , just to the left of the archway . ) I do n't want Frank to know anything about this , if possible . MRS . ALDRID No , there 's no need of annoying him . MRS . HAMPTON I suppose he 'll have to be told soon enough . ( Aldrid , standing at the back of the room , watches his wife out into the hallway ; then he turns sharply , and comes forward several steps , in a panic of indecision . Suddenly the impulse to recall Mrs. Hampton whirls him round into a literal spring in the direction of the hallway , but at this point , the definite closing of the front door arrests him , and he stands taut and still for a second , gripping the back of the chair which Mrs. Aldrid occupied earlier in the action of the play . Then he shifts his position ; and , gripping the chair with the other hand , leans upon it , and waits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently she darts into view between the archway portieres , and stands regarding him with an expression of amused calculation . But he does n't see her : so , after a glance over her shoulder into the hallway , she speaks ) p. 26 MRS . ALDRID Did you see that ? ALDRID ( in a repressed , ominous tone ) What ? MRS . ALDRID ( with a nod toward the hallway ) She must have heard . ALDRID Have you told anybody ? MRS . ALDRID ( coming a little farther into the room ) No ! ALDRID I suppose the walls have ears ? MRS . ALDRID Not necessarily . ALDRID ( turning to her sharply and searching her with a look ) Then , how would she know ? MRS . ALDRID She must have heard me  --  there in the hallway ! ALDRID ( mercilessly ) When ? MRS . ALDRID ( becoming slightly disconcerted under his gaze ) A few minutes ago  --  when I was telling you I 'd found a purse . ALDRID ( after a fractional pause , and tilting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her more quizzically ) How would she overhear you  --  she was n't in the hallway ? p. 27 MRS . ALDRID Was n't she ! ALDRID ( whipping the chair upon which he is leaning out the way , and coming forward in a trembling rage ) You know very well she was n't ! ( She crosses the back of the room towards the left , watching him . He stops in the middle of the room and forward , and continues speaking , but without looking at her . ) What are you trying to do , kid yourself , or me ! ( He goes towards his desk at the right , and she comes forward at the left . ) MRS . ALDRID ( picking up her apron from the sofa ) I suppose you did n't take notice of the fact that she came in without ringing , did you ? ALDRID Well , what of it , what of it , what of it ! MRS .

ALDRID ( turning sharply , and looking at her ) Yes ! ( Starting across towards the back of the center-table , and indicating the departed Mrs. Hampton with a wide gesture . ) I want to know whether or not you intend to return that woman 's property ? MRS . ALDRID Her property ? ALDRID ( enraged , and lifting his voice ) You heard me ! MRS . ALDRID ( lifting her hand to silence him ) Sh  --  sh !

He crosses to her rigidly , and , seizing her by the arm , turns her sharply to him and looks knowingly into her eyes. ) p. 29 ALDRID ( after a pause ) If my eyes are not opened after this , it is n't your fault . ( She attempts to move , but he pins her to his side with another quick grip . She shows a trace of fright . ) I want to know whether or not you intend to return that money ? MRS .

Speaking together  --  ALDRID ( turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ) God ! how I hate that attitude ! MRS .

You must think I 'm a  --  ALDRID ( whirling fiercely upon her , as he passes in front of the center-table ) Please ! ( She is instantly silenced . ) Do n't drive me out of the house ! ( He goes blindly up towards the hallway. ) p. 30 MRS . ALDRID ( regaining herself , and half crying ) What do you think I am  --  some school-girl ! ALDRID ( stopping abruptly just inside the archway ) No ! ( Turning to her . ) I think you 're a thief ! MRS . ALDRID ( freezing with resentment ) you , really ? ALDRID More contemptible than the out-and-outer , for he at least does n't try to justify himself . MRS . ALDRID And I 'm not trying to justify myself either . ALDRID You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . ALDRID There does n't need to be any . ALDRID And there is n't  --  among honest people ! MRS . ALDRID ( sarcastically ) So you do n't consider me honest ? ALDRID ( moving a little nearer to her ) You 're like a million other people in this world , honest , as long as you do n't lose anything by it ; but as soon as you see where the principle of honesty is going to cost you a dollar , you begin to hedge !  --  just as you 've been doing in this . p. 31 MRS . ALDRID I 've been doing nothing of the kind ! ALDRID ( bitterly ) You 've been tinkering with honesty . MRS . ALDRID ( advancing a step or two towards him ) I never took a cent in my life that did n't belong to me ! ALDRID There are rafts of people can say that . But they would n't walk back a block to return ten cents overchange that some clerk has given them . ( She sniffs contemptuously , and turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've heard you do ,  --  when the conductor on the trolley does n't ask them for their carfare ! ( Swings down towards his desk . ) MRS . ALDRID The trolley companies have enough ! ALDRID There you are ! ( Turning to her . ) That 's the psychology of a thief ! ( He goes up to the French window at the back of the room , and , after glancing out to see that no one has heard them , closes it . ) MRS . ALDRID ( ready to cry with madness ) Have I ever stolen anything from you ? ( Evidently , he does n't hear her , and starts back down towards the right of the center-table . She advances a bit towards him . ) Have I ? p. 32 ALDRID ( stopping on a line with her , and looking at her witheringly ) Now , do n't start that , please . ( He continues on down to the right of the center-table , and stands , leaning upon it . ) MRS . ALDRID ( stepping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it ) Answer me ! Have I ever stolen anything from you ? ( There is a slight pause ; then he sits down on the edge of the table  --  very weariedly  --  as though weighted with the conviction of having married an inferior woman . ) ALDRID ( with a complete change of tone ) Listen to me ! ( He takes his left hand in his right , and looks at the back of it , with a kind of vacant curiosity ; then he drops his clasped hands onto his leg and looks up and out and away off . ) A man 's home , in the majority of cases , is founded upon his belief in the honesty of his wife ; you 've stolen that from me to-night . MRS . ALDRID What ? ALDRID That belief  --  that I had in you , as an honest woman . ( With an impatient toss of her head , she crosses over in front of the table to the desk , and straightens the desk-pad ; then stands with her back to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other on her hip . ) You know , there 's a line in a book somewhere that says : " What a little thing makes the world go wrong ! A word too short , or a smile too long:Then comes the mist , and the blinding rain , And life is never the same again . " Your  --  ( He feels for the word. ) attitude  --  in this affair to-night is that mist and blinding rain : it has shown me that my wife is not strictly honest  --  for the sake of being so ; and honesty is such a passion with me that , as far as you are concerned , life will never be the same again ; because I could never  --  absolutely trust you again . ( He rises slowly , and moves around in front of the table . ) Never . ( He continues to the window at the back , then stops and turns to her . ) I 'm very sorry we found that out  --  ( He steps into the window-alcove and quietly pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he leans against the side of the window-alcove and says , half to himself and half to her  --  ) I 'm sorrier  --  than if I had lost a million dollars . ( There is a rather long stillness ; then Mrs. Aldrid , who has been finding it difficult to encompass the situation , abandons the effort and crosses the room towards the door at the left. ) p. 33 MRS . ALDRID ( as she turns and starts across the room ) Well , Gene , if you had n't been so strictly honest all your life , we might have had a million dollars now . ALDRID ( picking her up ) Very true ; but we 'd have gotten it the way you are getting that four hundred . MRS . ALDRID ( about to leave the room , and with a return to her former manner ) And the way I 'm going to hold on to it , incidentally . ( She starts to go out at the left ) ALDRID ( in a sudden rage , and seizing the telephone at his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She stops , and turns to him . ) I want you to hear this ! ( He works the telephone hook violently . ) Give me Wayne one  --  three seven  --  D.  --  Wayne . Please ? ( She recognizes the number , evidently , and takes a couple of frantic steps towards him ; but he meets her startled expression with a look of quiet defiance , so she stops dead and turns away , waiting . ) Hello ! Hello ? ( He lowers the telephone again , and there is another pause : then , suddenly , he is answered . ) Hello !  --  Mrs. Hampton ?  --  Is this Mrs. Hampton ?  --  Mr. Aldrid . ( Mrs. Aldrid turns , and their eyes meet . ) I have some very good news for you . p. 34 MRS . ALDRID ( advancing in a panic ) If you tell her I found that money , I 'll deny it ! ALDRID ( into the telephone , and bitterly ) Your money has been found ! MRS . ALDRID ( raising her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , you silly fool ! ALDRID ( into the telephone ) I found it . MRS . ALDRID ( looking frantically among her parcels on the center-table ) Well , if you did , you 'll pay it ! ALDRID ( into the telephone , and half smiling ) I wanted to give you a lesson . MRS . ALDRID For I 'm very sure I wo n't ! ( Glancing under the center-table . ) Where 's my pocketbook ? ( Hurries over to the desk and looks . ) ALDRID ( into the telephone ) I know , but I imagine you must be rather careless to drop that much money . MRS . ALDRID ( hurrying back to the table , and becoming more excited every minute ) Where 's my pocketbook ? p. 35 ALDRID ( into the telephone ) All right , Mrs. Hampton , come ahead  --  it 's here for you . ( Hangs up , and sets down the telephone . ) MRS . ALDRID ( turning to him excitedly ) Listen ! Have you seen anything of my pocketbook ? ALDRID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , breathlessly ) I ca n't find it ! ALDRID Where 'd you have it ? MRS . ALDRID Right here among these parcels ! ALDRID ( disinterestedly ) I have n't seen anything of it . ( He comes down to his desk . ) MRS . ALDRID My God ! I wonder if I 've lost that ! ( She looks again for a second , then stops dead and taps the table as though she has suddenly come to a conclusion . ) I wonder if she could have taken that  --  ALDRID ( turning to her ) Who ? MRS . ALDRID Mrs. Hampton . ALDRID I 'll ask her that  --  when she comes over . p. 36 MRS . ALDRID Do n't you dare ! ALDRID ( bitterly ) Hum-hum . ( He shakes his head from side to side . ) MRS . ALDRID Well , it 's gone ! ALDRID Maybe you left it in the trolley-car . MRS . ALDRID Oh , would n't that be awful !  --  And that four hundred dollars is in it ! ( Aldrid gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrusting his hands into his trousers-pockets , starts across the room towards the left . ) I do n't see anything to laugh at ! ( He throws his head back and makes another little sound of intensely derisive laughter . ) And twenty-six dollars of my own ! ( He laughs again . ) God ! what 's the matter with me ? ALDRID ( turning in front of the sofa ) Maybe you dropped it out there in the hallway . MRS . ALDRID Call up the Rapid Transit " Lost and Found , " and see if a lady 's pocketbook has been turned in . I 'll look out here . ( She vanishes into the hallway at the right . Aldrid stands still for a second , then picks up the telephone . ) ALDRID ( into the telephone ) Information , please . ( To Mrs. Aldrid ) Do you see anything of it ? p. 37 MRS . ALDRID ( in the hallway ) Not a sign ! ALDRID Why do n't you light that light ? ( He stands looking into the hallway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone ) Hello ? Information ? What is the number of the Rapid Transit " Lost and Found ? " Yes . Kensington one three  --  hundred ? Will you ask the operator to ring it , please ? If you please ? ( He lowers the telephone , and Mrs. Aldrid appears at the entrance to the hallway , searching frantically . Aldrid laughs dryly . ) MRS . ALDRID ( glancing up ) Funny , is n't it ! ( She disappears again into the hallway , and immediately there is the sound of a chair being knocked over , as though she had flung it aside in her anger . Aldrid looks sharply toward the hallway , then shakes his head slowly and conclusively . ) ALDRID ( shifting his attitude , and sighing rather wearily ) Ha , ho-ho  --  ( Into the telephone ) Hello ? Information ? ( Glances toward the hallway . ) Oh , this is " Lost and Found ? " I 'd like to know whether or not a lady 's pocketbook has been turned in there this evening ? MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is n't out there ! What do they say ? ( He silences her with a gesture ; then , after a sligh pause , speaks suddenly into the telephone again. ) p. 38 ALDRID This minute ? MRS . ALDRID It has been turned in ? ALDRID ( to her ) Yes . MRS . ALDRID ( turning and sinking onto the chair at her hand ) Oh , thank God ! ALDRID ( into the telephone ) , No , my wife did . MRS . ALDRID ( turning to him ) A regular , lady 's , black-leather pocketbook ! ALDRID ( into the telephone ) Well , can you wait a minute ? Please ? ( To Mrs. Aldrid ) They want to know whether or not you can identify this ? MRS . ALDRID ( impatiently ) Oh , certainly I can ! It 's a regular , lady 's blackleather pocketbook , with my initials E. A. on the outside ! ALDRID Yes . MRS . ALDRID ( illustrating with her hands ) There 's a small , gold-mesh purse inside , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side pocket , there are twenty-six dollars . Then , there 's  --  ALDRID ( to Mrs. Aldrid ) Wait a minute . ( Into the telephone ) Hello ! p. 39 MRS . ALDRID A gold , mesh purse , with  --  ALDRID ( to Mrs. Aldrid ) Wait a minute ! ( Into the telephone . ) A lady 's black , leather pocketbook , with the initials , E. A. , on the outside . There 's a gold  --  E. A. No , no , no , no ! E !  --  Yes .  --  Well , that 's right . Why  --  ( He looks at his wife . ) MRS . ALDRID A gold , mesh purse  --  ALDRID ( into the telephone ) A gold , mesh purse , with four hundred dollars in it ; and in the side pocket there are twenty-six dollars  --  of her own . ( Mrs. Aldrid looks at him suddenly . ) MRS . ALDRID Five fives and a one . ALDRID ( into the telephone ) In bills , yes . ( He looks at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one . One minute . ( To his wife ) What else ?  --  quick ! MRS . ALDRID ( becoming very nervous ) Why , there 's a silver vanity case  --  ALDRID Yes . MRS . ALDRID And a gold bracelet  --  with the clasp broken  --  ( He makes a movement of interruption , but she continues ) and a tax receipt , and a  --  Aldrid and Mrs. Aldrid , speaking together  --  p. 40 ALDRID ( to Mrs. Aldrid ) Wait a minute , now , till I get that ! ( Into the telephone ) Hello ? MRS . ALDRID Sample of Georgette Crepe , and a face veil , and a handkerchief , and two packages of hairpins , and  --  ALDRID ( to Mrs. Aldrid ) I ca n't remember all those ! ( She stops , and relaxes ; then he speaks into the telephone ) Hello ! There 's a silver vanity case and a bracelet  --  MRS . ALDRID Broken ! ALDRID ( into the telephone ) Broken !  --  A broken bracelet . ( With a touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there 's a  --  ( He stops gradually and listens attentively  --  his eyes wandering to his wife 's . ) I see . MRS . ALDRID ( rising slowly and apprehensively ) What is it ? ALDRID ( silencing her with a deft gesture , and continuing into the telephone ) Why , yes , that is rather funny . MRS . ALDRID ( impatiently ) What does he say ? p. 41 ALDRID ( into the telephone ) How about tomorrow afternoon ? No , no , I 'll call for it myself . Well , if you will , please ? Tha  --  nk you , very much . Thanks . ( He sets the telephone down . ) MRS . ALDRID Is everything all right ? ALDRID Yes . MRS . ALDRID ( sighing with relief , and leaning upon the center-table ) Oh !  --  can you imagine if I 'd lost that ! ALDRID ( coming down thoughtfully towards his desk ) Everything but the money . MRS . ALDRID ( turning and looking at him ) What 'd you say ? ALDRID ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the person who found your pocketbook took all the money out of it before turning it in . MRS . ALDRID ( aghast ) What ! ALDRID ( indifferently , and turning to his desk ) That 's what he says . MRS . ALDRID ( morally and physically indignant ) Can you imagine anybody being that contemptible ? p. 42 ALDRID ( turning and going up to the archway ) Please do n't make me laugh  --  I 'm not in the mood . MRS . ALDRID You wo n't laugh when you have to pay that woman four hundred dollars out of your own pocket ! ALDRID ( turning to her sharply ) I 'd have had to do that anyway !  --  there did n't seem to be very much chance of getting it away from you ! MRS . ALDRID Well , you 're not going to give her four hundred dollars of your own money ? ALDRID That 'll do ! And , when she comes here , do n't make it necessary for me to tell her who found her money . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts slightly , then steps quickly towards his desk . ) Where is that gold , mesh purse of yours ? MRS . ALDRID There in that drawer  --  what are you going to do ? ALDRID ( speaking directly to her in a level tone ) I 'm going to give you a lesson in honesty . Where is it ? ( Opens the middle drawer of his desk . ) MRS . ALDRID Right where you 're looking : what do you want it for ? p. 43 ALDRID ( whipping a little gold , mesh purse out of the drawer ) Never mind ! Is this it ? MRS . ALDRID Yes ; what are you going to do ? ( He slams the drawer shut , and , simultaneously , there is a sharp ring at the front door . He lays his hand on Mrs. Aldrid 's arm , and they stand still for a second ) ALDRID There she is . ( Then turning and urging Mrs. Aldrid across in front of the center-table towards the door at the left . ) Go up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newest you can find ; and , hurry ! ( He starts back towards the archway . ) MRS . ALDRID ( recovering herself ) I 'll do nothing of the kind ! ALDRID ( whirling upon her , and indicating the left door with an imperative gesture ) Quick ! Now , you 've lost enough tonight , I think ! MRS . ALDRID ( turns and goes to the left door , then stops again , defiantly ) I will not ! ALDRID Very well , then ; I shall be obliged to tell this woman the particulars . MRS . ALDRID ( bitterly ) Oh , I 'll get them ! But I never knew , Gene , that you were such a fool ! ( She starts to leave the room. ) p. 44 ALDRID Wait ! ( She stops and looks at him . ) Wait a minute . ( He starts across towards her , passing back of the center-table . ) I 'll get them myself . MRS . ALDRID Why ca n't I get them ? ALDRID ( looking at her steadily as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd rather get them myself . ( She stands very still , realizing the implication , until the doorbell has rung three times ; then with a rather slow , general gesture of sullenness and defeat , she moves up and across towards the archway to answer the door. )
