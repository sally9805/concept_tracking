txt One of the subordinate bodies or bureaus or the British Astronomical Association , a company of learned and industrious men who find more pleasure and profit in the investigation of extramtindane affairs than in the study of politics or art or other trivial earthly things , is devoted exclusively to the observation of Mars . We are grieved to note that these gentlemen have carried on their studies Since 1909 , when the planet was comparatively near the earth , separated only by a narrow space of 39,000,000 miles , with a lack of the fine imaginative qualities which distinguish the popular astronomer . Their vision is restricted , their conclusions are too practical , they lack the breadth and the speculative charm which lend to the reports of investigators of the heavens a strong appeal to the common mind . A summary of a recent report of this " Section for the Observation of Mars " appears in the Magazine of THE SUNDAY TIMES today , and will interest persons who approve of divesting science of all the charm and occasional humor that an inventive mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canals on Mars are optical illusions . Thus it aims to destroy with one blow the vast and beautiful edifice of Martian conjecture ingeniously and laboriously constructed by SCHL ' . PARELLI , CA MILLE FLA M MA RION , and our own Professor PERCIVA L LOWELL of Flagstaff , the latest and most ingenious of Martian observers . We have no further criticism to offer of this able and practical report signed by Director ANToxiwni except to say that if they are optical illusions the Martian canals occupy a place of their own among such phenomena . To no two observers have they ever seemed exactly the same . The report suggests a graver thought . We hope that Professor LOWELL will heed the warning it conveys . Some years ago , with the best intention , we advised the Professor to stick more closely to his job , with the idea that if he continued to wander among the planets somebody would try to steal Mars from him when his back was turned . These British astronomers have now made a bold attempt to that end . Professor LowELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely its system of channels , had reached so many interesting conclusions in regard to its climatic conditions and its possible fitness as the abiding place of sentient beings , that we ? were beginning to fancy that he had annexed the planet to our own possessions , when he , suddenly started on his heavenly rambles through ** miles of unI charted space to the planet Saturn . 1 The attractions of Saturn to the inquisitive , astronomer are not to be denied , but no man can serve two planets . Professor LOWELL has brought Saturn no nearer ' to the human understanding , while we were beginning to believe that we knew something worth kndwing about Mars and were on the eve of knowing still more . As recently as Jan. 0 , Professor LOWELL was still idling around the larger planet . He had discovered then that there had been changes in its color and brightness . The body of Saturn was a pinkish brown . A brown planet is a novelty , and the color of this , resembling that of the adobe walls of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest to alert minds that Saturn 's surface is composed of hardened cement . But another reasonable inference is that the brown tint is imparted by the presence of huge quantities of nitrates , and this may suggest the possibility of getting future supplies of that substance from other planets instead of vitiating our own atmosphere by robbing it of its nitrogen for industrial ant agricultural purposes . Any such undertaking , however , like the establishment of universal service In this country , or the realization of the agreeable dream of international disarmament , must be left for the future . Meanwhile Professor LOWELL 'S neglect of Mars for the sake of Saturn has Put both Mars and American astronomical science in a perilous position . Seriously speaking , live have , no doubt that the conclusions of the observers at Meudon can easily be refuted by the observers at Flagstaff . The charts of the surface of . Mars . made by . Pro-. fessor LOWELL from authentic photographs are too distinct to be ignored . The markings on the surface may not be channels dug , by living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been propounded . The Mare will no return to ' his to It
