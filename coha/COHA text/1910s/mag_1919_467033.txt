IN a recent ingenious and original vol- ume on some eminent figures of the Victorian period the author at the very outset says that the difficulty in writing the history of that time is that we know too much about it . " Ignorance , " he goes on gravely to assure us , " is the first requisite of the historian ? ignorance which simplifies and clarifies , which selects and omits with a placid perfection unattainable by the highest art . " These phrases arc hastily borrowed to set at the head of this article , not so much because they shine more brightly than other epigrams with which the modern literary firmament is studded as because they seem to give courage to a celibate author about to put a rash pen to paper for a description of the American child . The bachelor , unless employed in a medical capacity , knows almost nothing of the birth or extreme infancy of the personage in question . And even of that time when the child begins to prattle , and wit and wisdom cascade from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian , unless , as Mr. Lytton Strachey says , ignorance be an equipment . It is singular how easy it is to forget stories about other people 's children . In these pages can be promised none of those anecdotes of little Herbert or Eva which enrapture the parent and indeed lead him into an emotional morass from which he can never clearly see the whole race of children , the majority of which are inevitably not his own . Here indeed has been made , almost before it was intended , the plea of the writer 's competence . Child-study ? amajestic term ? is nowadays a leading , perhaps the leading branch of American learning , and in investigating a great subject many workers are desirable . Close observation , such as a parent can give , of the individual specimen is indispensable . But a more disengaged eye will perhaps better trace , through the nation 's history , the rise of children to their present eminent position , and judge the processes by which they grasped power . The disinterested celibate may also possibly best judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the race of children , the ways in which they themselves are made victims of this new wide-spread science of child-culture . The American child is not merely a small individual , straight or curly haired , and agreeable or disagreeable as the case may be . He is a great and epic figure . On his small , unconscious shoulders he bears the nation 's future ; and as a eat may look at a queen so long as those anomalous figures decorate the world , so may a man who presumably knows little enough about children still observe them , discreetly and from a respectful distance , and believe that his contribution to the knowledge of them has its small value . it might , too , be urged that a bachelor , even in the forties , may conceivably like children . But doting parents find it so difficult to believe in even this restrained and temperate affection that the point will not he unduly pressed . In the early days of the Republic the child , though produced freely , had no great vogue , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost invariable accompaniment of marriage , and that they were generally liked there can be no reasonable doubt . But no one made any great fuss about them . They were sometimes , to quote the language of the period , limbs of Satan , and this , though it distressed , puzzled no one . The doctrine of original sin still prevailed , and affectionate parents resigned themselves to beating the Evil One out of their offspring . " Spare the rod and spoil the child " was a maxim on the tenderest parental lips . Religion held out some hope of retrieving these poor , small lost ones . The early volumes of the admirable Poole 's Index to Periodical Literature had an astonishing number of entries under the title " Conversion of Children . " There were , of course , the incredible Sunday-school stories with painful heroes and heroines , convinced at a tender age of sin , but , on the whole , children appeared very little in literature . Not much was written for them and comparatively little about them . In their social aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline of their elders , seen but not heard . A grim picture , every one must admit . And , though under this regime many an unpromising child turned into an admirable grown-up ? yet as certainly many a little one of rare gifts and promise was crushed into hopelessness by its harshness . The pendulum has swung as far the other way now . There was , of course , an intermediate period . Little Eva in Mrs. Stowe 's pages is of course a Sunday-school survival , but she was followed by Peck 's Bad Boy and then those immortals , Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn . Even Henry James , who at first blush seems out of place in this galere , made Daisy Miller 's naughty little brother famous . And a tale called Helen 's Babies was , as late as the early ' seventies of the last century , one of the first phenomenal best-selling successes . It was the bad child 's moment , the era of the enfant terrible . Scenting no danger and pleased with its new spirit of tolerance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom . The child , which had been an inferior , almost inhuman creature , was now welcomed as an equal and a brother . No one saw in how few years it might become a superior and a master . Henry James , always oversensitized as to the American child , felt early something ominous about it . In some story of a Europeanized American returning home the hero hears in a hotel , and notes with fear , " the high , firm note of a child . " And there is another hotel passage of equal significance which is worth transcribing : Then there are long corridors defended by gusts of hot air . Down the middle swoops a pale little girl on roller-skates . " Get out of my way ! " she shrieks as she passes . She has ribbons on her hair and frills on her dress . She makes the tour of the vast hotel . Is one mistaken in detecting here the creation of a Frankenstein ? There are many possible reasons for the rise in the value of children . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds . As families grow smaller , children , now more rarely produced , come to have a scarcity price put on them in the marketplace of sentiment . We now vie with one another in finding expression for their worth . A poet and essayist who is even more widely read here than in her native England drove the point home when she asserted that , rather than that one child should ever die of hydrophobia , she would exterminate all the millions of dogs , pet and otherwise , of the world ! Is it to he wondered that it became increasingly difficult to discipline a race so well thought of ? An English visitor in the middle ' eighties notes with grave consternation the difficulty American parents have in keeping children from swearing and from calling their parents by their given names . It would he hard to say to-day just how general swearing has become among our best children , but in any case we may be sure that if they swear it is considered part of their charm as it is of parrots . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes without saying . And old gentlemen who in the early nineteenth century would have belched fire had they been addressed as anything but " Sir " will now fawn upon children , pleading with them to be called " Cousin Howard " or " Scootums . " Anything as formal as the old modes of address seems rigid and chilling , and likely to lose to their elders that approbation by children which is now so essential to any self-respect . The advance of the child was gradual and insidious . As no one realized the momentous nature of the change , no one noted it . Of course there were outward signs which should have warned . Children 's dress , for example , which had been extremely ugly , became pretty and picturesque . The Kate Greenaway books which came with the " art revival " of the ' eighties , made children 's clothes delightful and children themselves adorable . The effete continent of Europe began to send its styles . Small dashing sailors began to appear , and ravishing little girls with short socks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Books about children for children , and , more dangerous , about children for grown-ups , began to appear . Perhaps it was Little Lord Fauntleroy who started it . But there was , too , that enchanting volume , The Golden Age . The stage played its part , too . Child actresses and actors became an important feature of theatrical life ; their bleating voices may still occasionally he detected , though they have grown and now assume maturer roles . Societies for the protection of children intervened . But the public would not be balked . Dwarfs were discovered who assumed infantile roles ; closely shaven ( twice on matinee days ) they even assumed the parts of the unborn children in The Blue Bird . Once you begin to see that a little child may lead you , you are its hopeless and infatuated slave . You are , as to the young of the race , on the way to being a confirmed Barrieite or a Maeterlineldan . VOL . CXX.XIX. ? No , 831. - 46 Barrie has made us see childhood anew . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lay like diamonds on the grass at the world 's dawn . There is no witchery like his , no such tenderness , no such foolish , lovely jokes . We break our hearts for some lost , half-forgotten Arcadia . We hear the bells that ring in some happy city where all saints and angels and little children that have died now are . And this poor world , as we listen to him , would be , so it seems , like Paradise itself , half laughter and half tears , if we could only rightly value its youngest and fairest inhabitants . Maeterlinck , speaking another language for another civilization , does not , perhaps , ever come so intimately near to us . But he would lead us even closer to the mysteries . In his dim regions , lit by lovely unearthly lights , little children , all blond and shimmering , wait to be born . And he would have us vaguely apprehend the process by which each small wandering soul seeks out the mother who shall in divine tenderness love it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is because they are the high priests . There is indeed something of the quality of a new religion in the modern exaltation of the child . Once , when men felt the need of something gentler and more merciful , there grew up in the Church the cult of the Mother of God . To-day , does not the child , sitting on his mother 's knee , smile more engagingly , and seem to hint persuasively that in his innocence is the salvation of the world ? Sympathy and liking are duly and sincerely recorded here for anything that can make the world more sensible of the fragile , evanescent beauty of childhood . Yet we have a right to examine even new religions and see how their tenets are to affect our daily lives . If children are human at all it may be dangerous to burn so much incense before them , dangerous alike to them and to those who swing the censers . Children were once thought well of chiefly because they would grow up to be men and women ; nowadays men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Growing up is only falling from a once proud estate . Children come to us trailing clouds of glory , and gifted , too ? this is the curious point ? with some antique instinctive wisdom more cosmic than ours , more directly drawn from the hidden divine fountains of the universe . To adepts of the new cult a child at the breakfast-table consuming its cereal nourishment sits oracularly like the Delphic priestess . A gentleman prominent in national affairs took this view of his blameless little yellow-haired daughter and gravely put to her the problems which were distracting the world . " I believe so and so , " he would sometimes say , " but Gracie and the chief justice of the Supreme Court think I 'm wrong . " That he often was wrong does not , somehow , to one heretical as to childhood 's supreme wisdom , prove that Gracie was as often right . Of course the father 's moderation inallowing Gracie 's inspired words to prove the chief justice rather than himself right must be praised ; it is more often the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted : " I say , and God agrees with me ? " Some of the more rapturous child-worshipers seem a little like this . They say , and children agree with them ; the coincidence being as sure proof of children 's wisdom as to the soap-box exhorter it was of God 's . Under the influence of such sentiments education has of course been trans-formed . No one can doubt the harshness and too often the stupidity of the old school system , and no one can help wish-ing that the acquisition of knowledge might be a pleasure rather than a tor-ment . And yet the object of education is presumably still to educate , its power to amuse being supplementary wholly , and we must deal with the fact . that children in our schools do not nowadays much care towork . If things do not suit them , they strike ? even New York has al-ready seen this . From Bolshevik Russia comes almost ideal news to children . The scholars there establish the curriculum and dismiss at their pleasure unpopular teachers ! They see to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recess-time , but by establishing well-equipped smoking-rooms for the upper classes ! Of course this last provision may not seem much to the children of New York and New Jersey , who , according to recent astonishing revelations , are accustomed to securing their supply of cocaine fresh each day from enterprising merchants who are at hand just outside the school gates at the closing-hour . But this is only a measure of what improvements we may expect when American children take the schools in hand . Even teachers sometimes , in moments of discouragement , admit that children do n't work as hard as they used to and do n't learn as much . Is it possible to trace a connection between these two facts ? Is work really necessary ? Will children , even under the most modern system , ever learn the multiplication table in sheer ecstasy of joy ? Foreign children seem to know more than their American confreres . Just as grown-up foreigners so often seem better educated than we ourselves are . Is the difficulty that we still make lessons a little irksome , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , which would doubtless , when the time came , give him knowledge as if by miracle ? There is a singularly pleasant legend ( which should be a great favorite with child-worshipers ) concerning the offspring of a distinguished American authority on painting . These children , so it is alleged , passed their early years wholly art-free , unmolested by any knowledge of paintings and their value . Their ignorance was abysmal , considering whose children they were . Yet their bodies were healthy and their minds virgin soil , and their parents confident that when the time came The time at last did come . When they were fourteen and twelve , respectively , the little boy and girl were , in accordance with their parents ' theories , solemnly taken to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence . There they were placed successively in f ront of the masterpieces of the painter 's art while gently and lucidly , in simple words , it was explained to them why these were great and noble pictures . Their little minds , unsullied by art-knowledge , free from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to understand at once , to swallow art at a gulp . They returned home , where a hot bath , a wholesome supper , and a night 's sound rest invigorated them and prepared them for the morrow 's test . At about eleven in the morning they were taken to the Pitti Gallery and , as it were , loosed . And then ? oh , lovely miracle ! ? like homing doves they flew unerringly to the masterpieces there housed , and proclaimed their merit in choice English such as their own father might have used ! This is the kind of a story every one would like to believe . It seems to take some practical advantage of the child 's intrinsic superiority to the man , and to dispense with all annoying and expensive study . Unfortunately for the comfort of children , few parents have the perfect faith of these just noted . The education of children , though transformed , still goes on at terrific tension . But the work now seems to be piled on the mothers rather than on the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child must now be thoroughly familiar with all its reflexes , complexes , and inhibitions . While she is washing the dishes she must prop up the latest volume on prenatal influences against the pan . She must swim out upon a vasty ocean of science and theory . She must search her soul to know whether breakfast contained a safe blending of proteins and vitamins , and she must be sure that the union suit of underwear she has chosen for her darling puts no strain upon the dorsal muscles . With Freud in hand she must read her child 's dreams as did priests of old the entrails of the sacrifices , trying to discover whether the pain in the little one 's heel is there because his great-grandmother , in girlhood , dreamed of Achilles . Such labors and such devotion immediately suggest that motherhood has now perhaps become a greater thing than childhood . May it he , after all , that the child 's chief value in our American life is that it brings into being the American mother ? When you see in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress of Mothers , you realize how serious a matter it is to go into the profession of child-bearing . There is perhaps a good deal of mock heroics in all this talk of the mother sacrosanct ? peasant women accustomed to plow a field the day after a child is born might well think it a confession of the frailness and cowardice of the modern city-dwelling female . Yet it is well to read over occasionally the pages in which Theodore Roosevelt , never a puling sentimentalist , ennobles and dignifies motherhood . And no one can seriously quarrel with any Better Babies campaign . ( The law and practice as to child labor in some parts of the country are crying for the attention of the merciful mothers of America . ) Even Malthus , a much-maligned philosopher , did not preach race suicide ? o n 1 y fewer , and so better , children . In deed , to hand a better world on to a better generation is succinctly the great and holy duty of mankind , and the most bemuddled mother over her scientific volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a figure of fun . Nevertheless , it may be permissible to s o u n d a warning . Scientific knowledge on the mother 's part must not be allowed to rub the remaining bloom from child-hood . The cabbage , even when it begins its career under a bell glass , and has its roots warmed with hot-water pipes within the soil , probably does not much mind being kept from sounding its native field - note wild . The incubator babies , too , at Coney Island or the county fair , do not concern themselves as yet with the romance and poetry of their rearing . ( What a character the incubator baby , free from all sentimental memories of parents , makes for Mr. Bernard Shaw ! ) But most other modern children , though they be potentates , find life by no means all near-beer and skittles . They are pestered at every step by new theories learned in the child-study course for mothers . Once upon a time there was a very beautiful little girl with golden locks who lived like a princess with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large house upon a little hill where many wild straw-KHODA berries grew . A well-meaning CliAS but unscientific grown-up guest ( a wretched bachelor , of course ) suggested one day , when he happened to be breakfasting alone with the little girl , whom he very much liked , that she and he should spend the morning blissfully gathering the sweet-perfumed little berries which they would eat at lunch with the thick cream which came from the nice cow in the barn . The lovely little girl said , " No , thank you , " but her lip trembled . Then the foolish old bachelor again explained and urged his delightful plan , upon which the lovely little girl burst into tears and rushed from the table . The scientific mother a little later explained that by the doctor 's orders the lovely little girl had never in all her life been allowed to eat any uncooked fruit ! Now the doctor may have been right ; indeed , an amendment to the Constitution of the United States prohibiting the eating of raw fruit by minors may be urgently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking wild berries in the activities of childhood . It is humbly suggested that perhaps if the stewing of the fruit might have occurred on a brick stove which the childhad helped build , over leaves and twigs she herself had gathered , something of the old glamour of wild-strawberry adventure might have clung to it still , as the grown-up had remembered it from his own boyhood . Especially in reference to rural pleasures it is to be hoped that the children of to-day may , when they are older , have some of the romantic memories that their elders now have . Perhaps it is only a trick of advancing age , but the swimming-hole in the brook seems to have a quality which no bathing establishment with a pool and pergola and hot and cold showers can ever have . During last autumn 's war thrills one of the great metropolitan newspapers for days filled columns with letters from elderly contributors who debated about the corn-silk cigarettes of their youth , or those they made of the dried leaves of the wild grape . It seems somehow as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course in the country nature study pursues the child . A parent or other instructor at his elbow forces him to learn how to tell the wild-flower from the bird s ? the phrase is by now traditional . And one suspects that , although they provide delightful Indian and cowboy suits , they even want him to learn from some handbook how to play the Sioux brave and from some recommended diagrams how to build a robber 's cave . But childhood and the country are an almost invincible combination ; it would be hard to ruin them . It is very pleasant to think of all the summer throughout the land boys , and girls , too , both rich and poor , may learn something of woodcraft and simple living and open - air sleeping . Nothing can be more agreeable than to see a company of Boy Scouts starting off for a weekend hike to the country , where they will camp , and catch and fry their own fish , and perhaps lie on beds of pine needles . On the whole , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the country have a moving-picture theater fairly accessible and a soda-water fountain at hand , so that the most exacting child who is not content with the simple pleasures of field and stream may not lack its evening amusement . There is , however , quite seriously , the definite danger that all this psychic mode of educating may kill every little eccentricity , every little imaginative quality in a child which may be different from the standardized imagination for children as found in Barrie and Maeterlinck and recommended in the mothers ' handbooks , and so in the end produce a monotony of personalities . It can not be too pleasant fur a child to be too closely studied , especially when it comes into the odd , delicious , happy , sad days of adolescence - it is not pleasant , when a fellow is embarked upon his first love-affair , to find mother at hand with Chapter XIII of her favorite volume on child-psychology , demanding the most awkward and embarrassing confidences , a n d studying her son as Fahre might an amorous insect under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes very unhappy because no one was trying to understand them ; they must nowadays be sometimes unhappy because every one is trying to . Privacy , both of person and of thoughts , may be as much their right as ours . We must he careful how we fumble with their souls . Apprehensive grown-ups must , of course , remember that some of the simplicity and romance of their childhood has necessarily gone forever . No danger can now threaten a child equal to that of the old high bicycle . No little boy to-day can make it the goal of his ambition to drive the horse-car down the tracks in Main Street ; there will soon be children who have never seen a horse . These same nervous people may also safely count on the resistance , conscious and unconscious , of the American child itself . It is amazing how racy of the soil that person is . He reverts to type as do the lower animals or garden flowers . Train him with foreign masters or governesses as you like , he has moments when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may for a few of the tenderer years , if he is carefully isolated , be master of the low , well-modulated tones of England . But the moment he goes to school his speech gains at once the tang of the streets , or of the gutter if you wish to be emphatic . His nasal tones cut the circumambient air and his R 's rasp . It is something stronger than himself , some germ that floats everywhere . Later , at college or after , he may discipline his tongue into the best manner of our own pleasant American language . But he must have sown his linguistic wild oats on the Bowery . The American child resists manners , too , and sometimes even growing up does not alter this frame of mind . Here in America little boys shake hands and little girls courtesy very much in the way of animals trained by fear . And no American child will , of its own volition , ever say , " Good morning , " or , " How d'ye do ? " to any grown-up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the Latin languages , elegant and concise , give children speaking them an exaggerated appearance of poise and polish . There was an undue amount of clamor and shouting in a uniformed line of Venetian school-boys on their way to church , and a child of perhaps ten spoke up . " La calms , signori ! " he urged , with . CI-1AG t ? mock seriousness . " Calmness , gentle-men ! " An acid little girl of six , on the tramcar at . Rome with her nurse , passed by a building where huge posters advertised an exhibition of modern painting . " That would n't interest me , " remarked nurse . " It interests others , " answered the little girl , coldly . Perhaps we may be glad that our children are more natural . There is a kind of wildness still in the American soil . And children , who are burn conservatives , have a deep-seated love for what is indigenous . They are the custodians of the American note . A little ten-year-old boy at our most fashionable seaside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millionaire babies , fabled in the Sunday supplements , reared in luxury , domiciled in palaces . And when the Fourth of July came there was a terrific scene ( from which he emerged victorious ) because the one thing he insisted on doing was to sell a pale , watery lemonade for a cent a glass from a small stand which he was going to erect outside the great gates of his father 's place on Bellevue Avenue ! Within hint deep called to deep ; by instinct he knew that he could not rightly grow up as an American unless he had at least once performed all the traditional rights of American boyhood , as poor boys and country boys and slum boys were everywhere performing them . Has the statement been too long delayed that American children are the finest in the world ? They are not to be held responsible for the theories and follies of their elders . They want their own way ? naturally , if they can get it . They are not much concerned with their complexes . They probably do not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barefoot on the greensward , but they probably think it silly to speak of it as expressing their personalities . If they have more liberty than they once had , let us merely hope that it makes them happier . And let us start a modest catalogue of their merits . To begin with , they arc probably the cleanest children in the world . We are the most bathing race since the Romans ; we exceed them in the number of tubs if not in the fervor of our ablutions . St. James the Less , so the Golden Legend records in his praise , from childhood " never baigned " and was by this known to be holy . Even among his fellow-buys he would obtain less recognition now . American children should be the healthiest in the world . They are the most generously fed , and nowhere in the world is the battle more fierce against the germs that threaten them . Latin children may sit up with their parents and make a good meal at nine in the evening , enlivening it with a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But our darlings , though we allow them great liberty in manners , are in bed early . They resemble St. James the Less in that he never drank wine , mead , or cider . Their milk is certified and their water boiled . Their food is chosen for them according to articles by popular doctors in the women 's magazines . It would be sheer perverseness on their part not to be well . And we adore them , frankly and without embarrassment . It may safely be predicted that children will never be nationalized in America , however much their bringing up by government agencies might , scientifically , be to their advantage . Free love , that goal of so many radical futures , may have to be given up just because parents , both men and women , want their children for their own . Of course everywhere in the world there are to-day women who are inclined to wish children were possible without having undignified recourse to a father , so high above all other loves does , with them , the maternal stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Marie Doro go insane over this wish of the young girl , not at all to have a. husband , but to have children . But American fathers , though little inclined to the miracle of motherless children , value their offspring with a spontaneity and a lack of self-consciousness which in many parts of the earth would be astonishing . In short , no one in America need apologize for making a fool of himself over children . The American army has given us an engaging proof of this . In all the reports that came from France one of the most charming things to hear was the way our boys had made pals with the French children . The little ones adored these strange , good-natured , good-looking men , who had such a passion for washing in cold water and smelled so nice . The boys wanted to help the mothers of these children ; they were not too proud to offer at once to do " chores " about the house . They made Franco-American friendship a real thing . Individuals , companies , regiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to America , and the prettiest , sweetest sentimental comedy will be played as the French boys and girls grow up ? La Fille du Regiment done over to suit our case . Even in the occupied districts of Germany our army , which has been able to resist everything else , has found it hard VOL . CXXXIX. ? No. 831. - 47 to resist the children . Perhaps little Hans and Gretchen when they grow up may find it fairly easy to think well of us , if they are only allowed to cling to their childhood 's memories of a good-looking khaki-clad American boy holding them upon his knee . At home the war taught us something about our children . They were so sensitive to patriotism ! They were so generous of their small funds and their little strength ! Thousands of orphans in France have been adopted by schoolchildren here . Across the seas go letters , and , when the postal regulations allow , shoes and clothing , sometimes sewed by little American girls ' fingers .

Little stands along our streets where on Saturday afternoon lemonade and rather withered nosegays are sold " for the French orphans " make you smile , and for that instant believe in international friendships and the future of the world . Whatever his family may be , the child of foreign parents is an American . And he is the great Americanizer . The doctrine he carries home from school he imposes upon them . We may feel sorry that when they might have two languages these foreign children are willing to have only one ? American . But the sturdy impulse to he real citizens of the country where they are to live is worth more than the dual ornament of tongues . Little Giovanni , who insists on being called Joe , and Ignaz , who would like to be known as Mike , we should be proud of . Are we not proud of them ? as of all American children ?
