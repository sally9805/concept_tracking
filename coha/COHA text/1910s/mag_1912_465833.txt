DING back to the eighties , I see myself at the age of short frocks and sashes , in a fever of excitement as I am dressed for my first evening concert ; overwhelmed at the honor of being allowed to take part in the pleasure of grown-ups , and quite dazed with delight at the prospect of seeing the composer of the Melody in F and of the Op. 13 D Major Sonata for Piano and Cello , both of them the clbefsd'cruvre in my small repertoire . I remember that May evening as if it were yesterday . I can still hear the voices of my mother 's guests in the diningroom , their careless laughter and chatter as they finished dinner , lingering over their liqueurs and coffee , while I stood on the staircase above , a bundle of impatience , watching the hands of the eight-day clock as they neared eightthirty , the hour for the concert to commence . When the half-hour chimed , I could stand the strain no longer , so , hurrying down the stairs , I flung open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my own audacity as with the haste of my entrance : " Mamma , do come . It is half-past eight ; the concert has commenced . " There was a pause of surprise , a slight frown from my mother at the internuntion ; then , taking pity on my impatience , she nodded to the woman of highest rank , and with a laugh the party rose from the table ; carriages were ordered , and five minutes later we were driving from our town house in Kildare Street , Dublin , to the Exhibition Palace , where the concert was to take place . As we took our seats , a man emerged from a side door on the platform and crossed to the pianoforte . A vague feeling of disappointment came over me . Could this be Anton Rubinstein , ahout whose personality his own wonderful music bad conjured up so big a romance in my child 's imagination ? Deliberately the man opened the lid , raised the stickfor its support , and then walked off . I breathed more freely . When the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loomed up in the aperture , and at once my ideal was satisfied . In an instant the magnetism of that presence seemed to capture the house , and an actual shout of welcome , always inspiring and spontaneous when given by Irish throats , greeted the man who advanced with apparent indifference to bow his acknowledgments . I gazed up into that face fascinated , yet frightened . Sphinx-like , satanic , the power of the square jaw , the ruthless severity of expression , the high , wide brow of the poet and dreamer , the bloodless complexion , the steely glance of the half-closed eyes , the lips so sternly drawn , were as a mask concealing gigantic forces of thought and emotion . I was too young to reason discriminatingly , but I could feel and understand that here indeed was one who was truly worthy to pose as the Genius of Music . With a gesture of impatience Rubinstein waved his hand and took his seat . Tossing back his head , like a war-horse about to take the field , he touched a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one who has ever heard Rubinstein can forget the magic beauty of that wonderful touch . lie could draw from the pianoforte the inmost soul of its sweetness and poetry , summoning at will powers either celestial or demoniac , for in the whole gamut of human emotions there was none over which , as a performer , he bad not absolute and infinite control . Truly a wizard of tone , all the wild abandon of grief and joy , the fierce utterances of hate and scorn , the groans of despair , the exaltation of love , the airy whisper of romance , the charm and witchery of coquetry ? all these he could mirror in exquisite perfection . Not for a moment during that concert did Rubinstein notice us ; engrossed in his work to the exclusion of all other considerations , he gave to the music he interpreted so grandly the best that was in him . Amid the thunders of applause that greeted the maestro , not once did that face lighten or change . Sphinxlike he sat before his instrument , sphinxlike he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion disturbed the stone-like calm of his facial expression . That night we heard him in the music of Bach , Handel , Mozart , Beethoven , Schumann , Chopin , and of some of his own compositions . After the concert was over and he had finally refused to come back to the platform , a crowd of musical enthusiasts unharnessed the horses from his carriage and drew him in triumph through the street to his hotel in St. Stephen 's Green . It was the custom in Dublin for professional men to have their chambers in their town residences , and although we had dinner in Kildare Street , we were to sleep that night at Dundrum , where we lived in summer ; a beautiful suburb at the foot of the Dublin Mountains , within view of the famous Three Rocks , near the summit of which stood the ruins of the historic Hell Fire Club . At Harcourt Street station I entered the railroad carriage and crouched in a corner by myself , determined that no one should break by idle conversation the spell of the wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train sped along I went number by number through the programme , noting the difference of interpretation , and living again through the joys of the evening . Yet I was unhappy . I was the disconsolate peri without the gate . Never again , perhaps , should I have the opportunity to listen to such music ; and as this thought struck home , my soul rose in wild rebellion and my native island home became a prison . Then and there came over me a fixed determination to leave it . How , I could not then perceive , but I had no doubt my will would sooner or later find a way . As soon as I reached home I went to the pianoforte , although it was midnight , and with the damper down commenced going over as much of the programme as I knew , until peremptory orders were given me to retire . I obeyed , but sleep was out of the question . Over-excited , restless , at last I stole into the night , and , sitting under a hawthorn bush , gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emotions conjured up by the music of Anton Rubinstein . When the wild and fragrant beauty of the spring dawn began its transformation of light and shadow , a thrush in a nearby apple-tree commenced its melodiously melancholy piping , and was answered by a blackbird from a lilac bush , till in a few minutes the whole valley was alive with sung . The tones of the thrush and the blackbird had been depicted in a Chopin ballade the night before , but I should never have noticed the beauty of either had not the genius of Rubinstein enlightened my soul . I had put away childish things forever , and stood at the threshold of the great tone world of Art . I hurried to the city that morning as usual to my lessons , my head teeming with plots and plans , my impatience increasing until it was two o'clock , when the Rubinstein matinee was given . The moment I entered the concert-hall I knew Fate was about to be kind to me . A chair having been placed on the platform , Sir Robert Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianoforte-teacher , came and sat down on it . Again I lived through a delirium of enjoyment , and , when the concert was over , hurried to the artists ' entrance and ran into the arms of Sir Robert , with whom was Rubinstein . The soul of kindness and good nature , Sir Robert , knowing my enthusiasm for Rubinstein 's music , said , quickly : " Herr Rubinstein , here is a little girl who plays your D Major Piano and Cello Sonata excellently . " " So , " Rubinstein said . amusedly , as he caught hold of my hair and twisted my face toward his ; then together the three of us walked toward his hotel , and I would not have changed places with the Queen of England , for Rubinstein caught hold of my hand and swung it to and fro as be puffed at his cigarette . At the hotel we parted , but I had made lip my mind not for long . Running around the corner to the Kildare Street house , I hastily packed a few things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose readiness to be obliging I could depend . I *do not remember what arguments I used with him , but the first boat that left Kingstown for Holyhead carried the two of us , and , although I had not seen him , I knew it also carried Rubinstein , ' who was booked the following day for a concert at Liverpool ; nor did I see him during the voyage , for Rubinstein was a miserable sailor and always kept close to his cabin while at sea . Just before sailing I sent a telegram to Dundrum and Kildare Street dated from the boat , with the laconic sentence : " Do n't worry . Am going to Rubinstein concerts. ? Lil-lien , " At the very first concert Rubinstein spied us , and sent an usher to tell me to come to the artists ' room during the intermission . " See here , young lady , " he said , threateningly , although he was laughing as be handed me a telegram , " you and your cousin will get something when you get home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Look after my little pupil , L. MeA . She will be at your concerts . With cousin has run away to hear you . Family will come after the truants . ? R. P. Stewart . " As an instance of Rubinstein 's kindness of heart , let me say that , busy man as he wag , and in spite of his duties ? and they were legion , for he was making arrangements for the production of his works as well as giving concerts ? until we reached London , when one of the family took us in charge , he kept us under close observation , had us travel with him , saw that we had the best seats at his concerts , almost every evening made us dine with him , and had us very often to luncheon . What I saw of him during this tour , going from Liverpool , Sheffield , Leeds , Birmingham , and London , convinced me that the life of a traveling virtuoso , be his triumphs what they may , was anything but to be envied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that literally swept away all the staid , matter-of-fact characteristics of the Anglo-Saxon race , yet he was horribly lonely , homesick , and unhappy . During our little dinners and luncheons together he spoke in endearing terms of Russia and of his family , particularly of his daughter Anna , whose picture he carried about in a locket and used to put down on the table beside him to keep before his vision . All the triumphs given him were as nothing in comparison to the pleasure he knew when the post brought him a letter from home , and on the day when the post brought him nothing he was always cross and moody . When the hour of parting came I wept bitterly , tears of actual rage , for 1 knew I had come to the end of my resources ; but when Rubinstein said , " Now be a good girl ; go back and study hard ? harmony , counterpoint , languages ? and then come to me and I will give you lessons , " I dried my eyes and made the beat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . a programme of work with an enthusiasm nothing could dampen . It was not until I had passed my fifteenth birthday that I was able to overcome the bitter opposition of my family and begin my music studies on the Continent . Then , strange to say , I did not go direct to Rubinstein , but to Frankfort-onthe-Hain , to the Ralf Conservatorium , for in the mean while I had come under the spell of Hans von Billow 's intellectual gifts , and was deep in the study of the last sonatas of Beethoven as he had edited them . I went to Frankfort , because Billow gave a course of lessons there each year . I think my Goethe studies , too , had much to do with this divergence , for I had a longing to live amid . the scenes of the great poet 's childhood , scenes that had inspired so much of his muse . But I bade adieu to all this one night , and started northward along the banks of the Rhine on my three days ' journey to Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something Rubinstein marveled over when lie learned I bad brought with me two boxes filled with manuscripts . It was at a rehearsal of the Symphony Concert that I first greeted him again . With that formal politeness so characteristic of him , he recognized me , rose and kissed my hand , saying in German : " Nun. , Titian Head , so you have come , after all . I am very glad to see you and welcome you to Russia , but what have you done with your hair ? " I quickly explained that I had cut it off on leaving Ireland to save the trouble of arranging it ; to which Rubinstein replied , " Why , the police will be after you ; you look just like a nihilist , " a sally pretty well true , as I was to find out later . We sat down together , and this time I would n't have changed places with the Tsaritza . During the intermission in the artists ' room Rubinstein asked me if I had heard of the insult tendered him by Hans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubinstein 's " Ocean Symphony " on the conductor 's desk , had tossed it aside , saying , " I will not conduct this music ; my hair is not long enough . " " But I , " said Rubinstein , with the consciousness of one who has had the best of the encounter , " replied that although Billow had had time to measure my hair , I as yet had not had time to measure his ears . " Then he added , maliciously , " We have no ' Tr in Russian ; we use G ' instead ; so we have to write him down Gans von Billow . " When the concerto rehearsal was over , Rubinstein hurried away , telling Mr. Petersen to bring me to dinner , and warning me that he dined at six sharp , and would wait for no one , a threat I was later to find out was true , for on one occasion he began dinner although a grand duke was expected . I spent the rest of the afternoon practising , and a little before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amid all his intimate associations , touching the books and music that belonged to bim , sitting before the piano he played on , glancing over tho pages of manuscripts that he had just finished ; in short , at home with him . I found then that be was no longer the sphinx-man of the concert platform , but a. genial , gracious host , asking after the friends I had recently left in Frankfort , making inquiries after those in Ireland and England , especially after all young artists , for whom he had a heart flowing over with kindness and sympathy . Possibly his own student days in Vienna , when he had literally starved , had something to do with this . At the dinnertable I found out he was thoroughly a an vivant , enjoying the Russian dishes before him and the different wines with the zest of a connoisseur . After dinner I had to go through the ordeal of playing for him , and when I had finished , his man-servant brought in a card-table , and we sat down to a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the present-day bridge . Rubinstein and I were partners , and lost shamefully ? hardly to be wondered at , for I had just learned whist ? but he insisted on playing again and again . Matve , the servant , then brought in tea in the long Russian glasses with their silver holder , lemon , not cream , being served ; and one of the ladies present , knowing I was a new-comer and ignorant of the fact that it was an unwritten law as unalterable as that of the Medea and Persians that his guests should not ask him to play , whispered to me to make him go to the piano . Cheerfully and innocently I went up to him , and , running my arm through his , said , coaxingly , " Do come and play something . " His face changed in a moment , an ominous silence fell on those present ; even the culprit who had led me into the trap looked disturbed ; as for Rubinstein himself , he gave me a scowl and fairly flung my hand away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never play . Do n't forget this . " The sudden change in his manner unnerved me , for the tears started to my eyes , and I stood gaping at him . As a matter of fact , I was thoroughly disconcerted and taken aback . As soon as Rubinstein saw this his face changed again ; and , laughing , he held out his hand to me apologetically . " Well , come ! give me a kiss and I will play for you . " I bad just reached the ago when my kisses were not lightly given ; besides , I was cut to the heart 's core , and I turned my head away in denial . " What ! " cried one of the women present . " Could you refuse Anton . Gregorie-witch ? " " Yes , " cried Rubinstein , " and just for that I am going to play for her , anyhow , for she is the first that ever did . " It was a fitting conclusion to a day of wonder . Rubinstein was in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present will never forget the ineffable beauty of the Chopin F Major Ballade as he started the opening theme , one of the wonder-pieces of that composer whom Rubinstein had designated " die Seele des Fortepiano . " When he had finished the ballade , he passed , almost without a pause , to the preludes , four of which he played ; then he dashed into his favorite Mazurka , and ended with the heroic F Sharp Minor Polonaise . Across the room I could see some figures huddled , as it were in fear and terror ; the thunders of that music rang through the room ; it was as if the Polish legions were marching , swords outstretched , banners flying , hastening to die like heroes for faith and country , singing their love-songs gallantly , although the funeral dirge was to follow . When Rubinstein had finished , his face was ashen white , his breath was coming in gasps , and he was laboring under the excitement caused by that malady which , alas ! a few years later was to carry him off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of build , impatient of sympathy , scorning all bodily weaknesses , he hid his sufferings from those about him till too late . He had almost reached his sixtieth year ; for fifty years subjecting himself mercilessly to the fierce and absorbing joys and sorrows of the artist ; and the hour of reckoning was not far away . After he had puffed at his cigarette for a few minutes , he stood up ? the signal that it was near eleven o'clock and time for us to go . That dinner was the first of hundreds to succeed it , for during the three and a half years I made my home in Russia , at least five evenings out of the seven I dined with him , except during the two months of the summer vacation which he spent at Peterhof , when I used to go once a week , or oftener if he sent for me , for I had taken on myself the task of answering all his English and American letters , one of his friends answering Russian letters , and another German letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who attended regularly to his enormous mail ; for Rubinstein , like Chopin , detested letter-writing , at least during his later years . It was principally at Rubinstein 's dinner-table that I gathered materials for my biographical sketch , which was the first biography of Rubinstein to be published . It was a daring task for a girl still in her teens ; it , however , pleased 761. -6 Rubinstein , was favorably received by the Russian press , and on my part was a labor of love . During all my time in St. Petersburg we were a company of seldom less than a dozen persons , often more , excepting on very rare occasions , when the severity of the Russian weather made travel difficult . Only once have I a distinct recollection of dining with him alone , about which I shall have something to say later . A raconteur gifted with remarkable powers , he made his dinner-table a scene of brilliance . Conversation never flagged , embracing all subjects but one ? home politics . As the director of the Conservatory , Rubinstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this reason , if for no other , any political discussion would have been injudicious , if not positively dangerous . Artists of all kinds , not only distinguished musicians , but painters , sculptors , writers , and poets , always kept the ball rolling ; and statesmen , rich merchants , distinguished public officials , members of the imperial family , and many charming , aristocratic women were among the gatherings . On one occasion Count Tolstoy graced the board , and I sat wondering who the rough-looking moujik could be , till Anton Gregoriewiteh ? for so they called Rubinstein in Russia ? whispered to me that the new-comer was the author of the Kreutzer Sonata , as the Russian author had named his latest book , which at that time had been prohibited by the censor , but of which Rubinstein had managed to secure a manuscript copy , and had read it to us a few evenings previously . Always outspoken , especially where music was concerned , Rubinstein told the distinguished author that he had altogether missed the meaning of Beethoven 's music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Tolstoy replied with a shrug : " Nun , nitchero " ( " No matter " ) , " one piece of music or another , I have written a romance . " " True , " Rubinstein replied , almost hotly , " but no matter how great you may be in your own line , it does n't give you the right to distort the work of another artist . " For a moment it almost looked as if the two great men were about to grow angry with each other ; but some one gave a quick turn to the conversation , and peace was kept , although Rubinstein could not restrain himself from shaking his fist as the door closed on his distinguished guest , and saying , vindictively : " I never knew a novelist yet who could write anything but trash about music . " If I had had power to see into futurity , I could not have timed my arrival in Russia more opportunely . Rubinstein , a year previously , had assumed the directorship of the Conservatory , doing this from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davidoff , the great cellist whom Rubinstein , with his characteristic severity whenever it was a question of art , had deposed , although the latter was his most intimate friend , the great Russian school of music which in 1862 had been founded by Rubinstein with the help of the Grand Duchess Helene and others , had lost something of its prestige . No word of censure ever fell on Davidoff , except it be that owing to his too gentle and kindly nature he had allowed himself to be grievously imposed upon ; but there were others whose presence there as professors caused the mothers of young girls to refrain from sending their daughters for instruction ; and one of the first innovations Rubinstein made in the building was to put glass doors in every class-room . In one of the comic prints of the time Rubinstein is depicted in the garb of a dvornile , or porter , with a broom in his hand , sweeping out a medley of figures from the Conservatory steps . This he practically did , for the whole faculty was changed under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a broken heart , and Rubinstein thereby made for himself a host of enemies who created difeulties for him at every turn . However , by the time I reached St. Petersburg matters had quieted down somewhat . Twice a week Rubinstein had a pianoforte class , which I attended as an onlooker , twice a week an orchestral class , and twice a week he played for the students , going through the entire literature of the pianoforte . He played informally , with the music before him , pausing frequently to illustrate the meaning of this or that passage , and always preceding his playing with explanatory notes on the intention of the composers he was interpreting , as well as giving historical data connected with their lives . It was a treat no money could buy ; for only the Conservatory students and myself ? I was the only stranger ? were given passes . Among the former I remember Ossip Gabrilowitch , so well known to American audiences , then a boy young enough to wear a lace collar over his blouse suit . At these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had noticed in his playing on my first meeting him . He was as a father among his children , at home among those who could understand him . He smiled and joked with us , took the trouble to be witty , and told us endless anecdotes of his meetings with Mendelssohn , Chopin , and Liszt . At these reunions , for so can I best term them , Rubinstein never failed to impress on us the dignity of the artist and his profession , as he tried to instil into our minds a devotion worthy of our work . There was a camaraderie about him that spoke volumes for the innate modesty and greatness of his genius ; a modesty that has frequently and maliciously been denied him by those who knew little about him , or else had obtained their knowledge at second-hand and prejudiced sources . At the conclusion of one of these concerts he wound up with the remark : " I am old and must go the way of the old ; therefore it can be understood that I love best the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do not wish to turn you from young composers . Love them and study them if you will , but do not forget the old ones , the great ones . " This was in particular an allusion to the new Russian school , for which , as a firm adherent of the classics , he had very little sympathy . He feared the innovators because of what he supposed would be the detrimental effect on students ; yet lie was not against them . He contended that the music student should first grasp the prescribed forms , and then break away from these if he found his peculiar genius so demanded ; but a formless art , based on the mere whim or caprice of the student or of the teacher , seemed horrible to him , spelled artistic shipwreck . Any one who has had experience in the working of art cliques knows how high party feeling can run and what vituperation hot-headed brains can foment . The Russian party in St. Petersburg took a mean advantage in referring to Rubinstein 's Jewish parentage . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his family were received into the Russian Orthodox Church following a ukase of the Tsar : as a boy Rubinstein had diligently studied his catechism , and as a man he went through all the observances of the Orthodox Church faithfully . It was not a question of faith with his adversaries ? many of them were avowed free-thinkers ; it was simply that the term Jew , which stands for all that is unpatriotic in Russia , was a strong point against him , one calculated to raise bitter ill-feeling in the breasts of unthinking Slavophiles . Rubinstein , as they well knew , never meddled in politics , and cared nothing about it ; but he loved Russia passionately , believed in her musical future , and served his country devotedly . No Russian has done as much for Russian music as Anton Rubinstein . He was the moving spirit in the foundation of the great institutions that in future will be the best monument to his genius , giving his time , money , and experience with prodigal liberality . " The Christians call me a Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once remarked , sarcastically and truly ; but let them call him what they might , he went his way , believing , as he so often privately boasted , " the future lies with us . " Intrigues and the cry of " Russian music for the Russians " prevented his operas from being performed at the imperial opera-houses ; but in spite of this the imperial family recognized his generous disinterestedness and sacrifice for his country , the Tsar raising him to the rank of General , so that he was addressed as " Your Excellency " ? " V asitiprevosk : - adit elstvo " ? a mouthful not easy to utter when one is in a hurry or excited . The Tsar and Tsaritza sometimes attended the Conservatory concerts , and an amusing incident happened on one such occasion . Alexander III . was a man of enormous proportions , and it was rumored that he wore beneath his uniform a complete suit of chain armor to protect him from the knife of the assassin . Rubinstein had been notified that their Majesties would attend the concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness . I always sat either beside or behind Rubinstein at ordinary concerts , so I took my usual seat , which was beside the Gorodnachalnik ( Mayor ) , who , with an aide-de-camp , sat immediately behind the Tsar and Tsaritza , Rubinstein being to the right of the latter . As the two imperial personages entered , the Conservatory band played the national anthem , all standing ; at its close the Tsaritza sat down ; so , too , did the Tsar , only to rise immediately . Rubinstein grew red in the face , not understanding the delay ; there was an awkward pause , and at once I saw what was the trouble ? the arms of the chair were not wide enough apart to permit the entrance of the enormous bulk possessed by his Majesty . As no one seemed to understand and no one did anything , I pushed forward my chair , took back the arm-chair for myself , the wide apace between the first and second row of seats permitting this , and received an amused smile from the Tsar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a " Thank you " in English . Rubinstein as a teacher was a martinet . He accepted no excuses and would listen to none . Many a time when I was playing for him and did not do as he wanted , he would bring down his two hands on my shoulders with a jar that made me fear the dislocation of my entire anatomy ; for him to sweep one off the piano-stool with whirlwind force was nothing . I have seen him in rages that were absolutely diabolical ; nor do I wonder at this in my own case , for I was too ambitious . Besides writing his biography , I attended all the concerts I could as music critic , I was doing special work for a New York newspaper under the pseudonym " I was writing short stories , and studying nihilism and Russian . As a matter of fact , twice a week I bad to sacrifice my night 's rest to catch up with all my work ; so Rubinstein must be excused in my ease . I always had my lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival from the Conservatory , which was at five o'clock . One such lesson stands out vividly in my memory . I had brought the C Minor Chopin Nocturne Op. 53 , and had no sooner started it ? I was playing horribly ? than Rubinstein began to abuse me , until I jumped up from the pianoforte . The day was an off-day for me ? a letter from home had given me a bad attack of nostalgia ; the leaden sky of St. Petersburg , which had lain for months without a break , had taken all ambition out of me , and Rubinstein 's scathing remarks , so justly deserved , broke down all my reserve , and I wept Iike a baby . After a few minutes he pulled down my hands from my eyes and said , an-grily : " What arc you crying for ? " " Because I am tired of life , I am lonely , and I wish I were dead ; besides , " I added , defiantly , " what is the good of trying to be a piano-player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See here , " was the sudden retort , as he shoved me back on the piano-stool , " do n't waste words on me . Go and make your instrument say all that , make it sing out your Heimweh and your soulsickness , make it growl out all the contempt and hatred you have for that old curmudgeon Rubinstein , who , you regret , has ever been born . Kill him with your scorn . " I had to laugh in spite of myself , Rubinstein 's manner was so comical ; and I started in to play as he told me , although without the music , for I could not see on account of my tears . When I had finished , he said , solemnly and slowly : " Now , you have played like an artist , because you have learned the secret of art . You have made the pianoforte the mirror of real suffering , real emotion , therefore your work is good . " Rubinstein had a horror of methods and of " canned " pianists , as he termed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , " he often remarked , sotto voce , after he had listened to the playing of a new-comer from one of the celebrated conservatories . With his own pupils his one endeavor was to bring out individuality and , when possible , ternperament . Mere technique he despised ; at the same time woe betide the pupil who brought him a piece badly prepared , or slurred or mangled any of its passages . One 's fingers had to be in perfect control , otherwise the dogs of war were let loose with a vengeance . Sometimes , I will allow , his whims and his moods were puzzling , but the great axiom of his teaching was , " Play as you feel ; but feel right . " It was usually his special delight when a pupil ventured to differ from him on any matter of interpretation ? that is , if he or she gave him some sufficient or even plausible reason ; then he was all attention and interest . " I do the passage so , " he would often say , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he presided in the Conservatory ? in his own home he had but the one instrument ? " but if it appeals to you so " ? and he would illustrate the difference ? " why , play it so . Do not imitate any one ; play as you understand , provided you do no violence thereby to the conception of the composer . " It was the hardest thing for a pupil to get Rubinstein to hear him or her in his own music at the Conservatory . I never heard him give a lesson there in any of his own compositions ; and it was only by dogged insistence on my part that I made him hear me go over one of his own pieces at each lesson . From my earliest childhood T had loved Rubin-stein 's music ; it suited my hand , - which was broad and fleshy like his uwn , and I could always play it con amore , be my musical mood what it might . After a time I broke down his reserve in this direction ; I was the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Josef Holman , who studied with him two years later in Dresden . He had one constant regret ? his bygone youth ? and was always telling us of the treasure we possessed , which youth only realizes in the losing . He had a sort of sarcastic delight in making remarks about his age . Knowing that I could always secure his attention , knowing also that Rubinstein was at the time pressed for money , several times American impresarii wrote me to arrange for a series of concerts in the United States . Sometimes the money seemed a temptation to him , and he would even go so far as to sign a conditional contract ; but he always backed out , with the remark , Mc4 was ! An old fellow like me playing Chopin nocturnes and ballades to the ladies ! No , no ; it would be too ridiculous . " To such an extent was his sense of personality interwoven with the execution of his work . In his youth Rubinstein had memorized practically the entire classic literature of the pianoforte ; during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over eighty pieces , one or all of which he was ready to perform at a moment 's notice . Tone study and tone production were his particular hobby . " Bring out that note , boy ; do n't slur it ; that note is worth your whole soul and body , " he once said to a pupil who was playing one of the numbers from Schumann 's " Carnival . " He often told us he used , when a student , to spend days acquiring the particular quality of timbre in a voice or in a bird 's song that pleased him . " This , not that , is what I want , " he would say sometimes in his lessons , as he illustrated the difference of touch with his own fingers on the back of the pupil 's hand . In tone nuance he always excelled ; even the unmusical and ignorant could distinguish the difference . So great was the beauty of his touch that I have seen the dvorniks ( porters ) , in the corridor of the Conservatory , outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they stood quiet to listen : " Anton Gregoriewitch egrait ! " ( " Anton Gregoriewitch plays . " ) On his fiftieth anniversary as an artist Russia offered him a magnificent tribute of appreciation and homage ; there was a " festival " of six days , during which , when he was not playing himself , others were playing his music , and the people , not the musical cliques , had a chance to show their love and admiration for the great artist whose renown was worldwide . Of the large sum collected , Rubinstein took no part for his own use , but donated it entirely to the coffers of the Conservatory . Moscow followed St. Petersburg in according him homage , and this was Rubinstein 's farewell to the concert platform ; fifty years earlier he had made his debut in that city , and it was here he took his 3eave . The heart of every true Russian lies in Moscow ; of St. Petersburg they are proud , but it is Moscow they love . With the proceeds of his tour in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net , Rubinstein built a home for himself ? he used to call it his American-dollar villa ? that was the dream of his life , on the lovely wooded shore of Lake Ladoga , in close proximity to the imperial palace of Peterhof . Here during the seventies he dispensed princely hospitality , and here he led an ideal existence . One wild and blustery night I found myself at dinner alone with Rubinstein , the weather being terrific even for St. Petersburg . The winds were howling round the house , and Rubinstein , who liked to ask questions , inquired of me what they represented to my mind . I replied , " The moaning of lost souls . " From this a theological discussion followed . " There may be a future , " he said . " There is a future , " I cried , " a great and beautiful future . If I die first , I shall come to you and prove this . " He turned to me with great solemnity .

Rubinstein 's face was close to mine , a countenance distorted by every phase of fear , despair , agony , remorse , and anger . I started up , turned on all the lights , and stood for a moment shaking in every limb , till I put fear from me and decided that it was merely a dream . I had for the moment completely forgotten our compact . News is always late in Paris , and it was Le Petit Journal , published in the afternoon , that had the first account of his sudden death . Four years later , Teresa Carreno , who had just come from Russia and was touring America ? I had met her in St. Petersburg frequently at Rubinstein 's dinner-table ? told me that Rubinstein died with a cry of agony impossible of description . I knew then that even in death Rubinstein had kept , as he always did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
