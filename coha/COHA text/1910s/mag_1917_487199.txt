DISPATCHES of Sunday and Monday brought us the first comments of the German press on President Wilson 's message . They have to be taken for what they are worth . Censorship and Government control of newspapers in Germany have to be allowed for in what they are permitted to say . Their general tone is hostile enough . The old adjectives are furbished up for fresh application to Wilson . There is a tendency to describe America as the " real enemy " of Germany  --  the one , we suppose , upon which " hate " is to be concentrated , as it was , successively , upon Russia and France and England . Anyhow , " Anglo-Saxondom " receives some rude buffets by the German editors . One of them sets forth the lesson which the United States must learn . It is , says the Kolnische Zeitung , that " a strong monarchy in the heart of Europe means no danger for American democracy . " Five years ago , most Americans would have agreed to that . They did not like German autocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we said that it was their own affair . And we did not dream of its being a direct or immediate peril to the United States . If all this has been changed by the war , it is not because of any alteration in the American view of monarchy in the abstract , but on account of what a particular monarch has done or attempted . The phrase " strong monarchy " is one that would have come trippingly from the tongue of Bismarck . But what would he have thought or said of some of the things which the strong monarch of Prussia is doing to-day to safeguard his power with his own people ? The Iron Chancellor set his face against political concessions . They were only , in his opinion , a sop to revolutionists . He was even against granting the Prussian Constitution , artfully contrived as it was to retain real power in the hand of the Junkers . Yet to-day we have the spectacle of the German Chancellor pressing the bill for electoral reform in Prussia  --  a bill abolishing class voting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remodelling even the Herrenhaus so as to make it more democratic and more responsive to the popular will . EVEN in war-time and partly as a war measure  --  even with the Chancellor 's statement that he is but carrying out the pledge and wish of the King of Prussia  --  the bill causes remonstrance and meets with opposition . The spiritual children of Bismarck ? Heydebrand , Westarp , and the other Bourbons of Prussia  --  protest that the step is one towartls Parliamentary Government . The next thing to happen may be a fairer distribution of seats in the Reichstag , with responsibility of the Kaiser 's Ministers to the Deputies , and that would be a most " unhappy " outlook for Germany . It is clear that in the minds of Prussian Junkers the reform of the electoral franchise in Prussia means that the " strong monarchy " will be shorn of a good part of its strength . When Napoleon III , in his talk with Bismarck just before the latter became head of the Prussian Ministry , warned of the danger of revolution if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " In Prussia , only the Kings make revolutions . " There was historic truth in this . Early in the nineteenth century , the " Emancipation Edict " was granted by a Prussian monarch . It was said to have filled the people with such new hope and energy that , coming after the terrible defeat of Jena , it made the victory at Leipzig possible . Another King of Prussia conceded the Charter  --  much to Bismarck 's disgust . There is warrant , therefore , for saying that reforms in Prussian political institutions proceed from the top down . This latest reform bill has the sanction of Wilhelm II , and has the appearance of being freely and graciously offered by him to his loving subjects . That it is not , everybody knows . On the contrary , it has been wrung from a reluctant monarch . Pr HE Mayor of Halifax addresses his appeal for between I $20,000,000 and $25,000,000 to the Dominion , which has already made a preliminary appropriation of $1,000,000 ; but it should be answered more liberally here than by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impoverished with three years of war . Gov . McCall has begun a campaign to raise $1,000,000 at once in Massachusetts ; Mayor Thompson has appointed a committee to raise funds in Chicago ; and these examples should be followed in other places . A resolution has been introduced in Congress for an appropriation of $5,000,000 , and we may be sure that the American Red Cross is giving as liberally as its resources allow . The disaster comes at a time when the always slight boundary between ourselves and Canada ought to be practically invisible . I public opinion in Britain and France being deliberately ' prepared for the possibility of a German offensive on the main western front , or are the forebodings in London and Paris the natural reflex of a black week marked by the reverses at Cambrai , the renewed Teutonic pressure against Italy , the growth in submarine sinkings , the catastrophe at Halifax , and , overtopping all , the menace of a Russian separate peace ? For the moment the safer conjecture is that anticipation is more gloomy than the facts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the North Sea and the Swiss frontier , but the probabilities are that before the German effort of 1914 against Paris and the Channel is renewed the Teutonic pressure will be directed against weaker sections in the Allied front . Should the worst in Russia come to pass and the Teutonic armies on the eastern front be released for duty in the west , the great crisis of the war will , indeed , be at hand . But months will elapse before that eventuality arrives , if it ever does . Until the signs grow clearer it is not necessary to enter into a study of the chances of a successful Allied defensive in France and Belgium . We may be content with the single reflection that , just as the numerical superiority of the Allies in the west has failed to break the German defensive so the advent of Germany 's troops from the east will no. establish the necessary superiority in numbers for the crushing of the main Allied front . ' THE little job of setting the President right has never 1 been listed among appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes to it as one to the manner born . " It is empty unwisdom , " he tells the diners at the Pennsylvania Society , " to give verbal encouragement to Rumania and Servia unless we go to war with Bulgaria . It is worse than folly to profess sympathy for Armenia unless we make war on Turkey . " How the ears of Senator Lodge must have burned as these words fell upon them ? Senator Lodge , the Colonel 's eleventh-hour candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination last year , who rose in his place in the Capitol the other day , and , admitting that he thought we ought to include Bulgaria and Turkey in the declaration of war with Austria-Hungary , basely added that he thought also that it was wise to defer to the President in such a matter and ended by meekly voting for a declaration that mentioned Austria-Hungary only . Let him return to Washington with the true view of things : " Austria-Hungary and Turkey are not nations . They are racial tyrannies . " Does Col. House know this ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parties at Washington standing by the President , instead of by an ex-President , without lifting its voice against so topsy-turvy an arrangement ? CONGRESSMAN FLOOD advanced fairly convincing reasons why the United States should not at present declare war on Bulgaria . There are no fronts on which Bulgarian and American troops will be likely to come into conflict in the near future . The Bulgarian Minister in Washington vouches for the fact that his country 's soldiers are fighting only on what they ( however mistakenly ) regard their own borders . He also maintains that his countrymen harbor the friendliest feelings for America . To a much greater extent than will be generally believed , this is true . Most of the men now high in Bulgaria 's councils , her Ministers and diplomats , are graduates of American schools in Turkey . Bulgaria of this generation is more or less American-educated . Hence the sincere regret with which the upper class would receive a declaration of war from us . Naturally , as against practical considerations , the Bulgarian Government will not allow sentiment to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulgaria stands or falls with our chief enemy , Germany . But in the meantime , since no necessity drives us , it would be well to keep alive whatever good-will and kindly feeling still exist towards us among the Bulgarian people . /VURKEY presents a somewhat different aspect . Our I Government , in refraining from a declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire , is actuated less by any consideration for the ruling Turks than for the unhappy peoples they misgovern . Mr. Flood spoke of the twenty million dollars invested by American missionary societies in Turkey which would be lost as soon as we declared war . Unfortunately , Mr. Flood put the case hindforemost . He should have said that it would be the oppressed Armenian , Greek , Arab , and Turkish populations which would lose this American investment , an investment devoted entirely to their education and aid . The Turkish Government would at once destroy the usefulness of these centres of civilization and enlighten-Wment . Moreover , our going to war with Turkey would cut off instantly the relief we are sending to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would doom them to a miserable death . The avenues by which our help can reach this calamity-ridden land must therefore be kept open as long as possible , lest , before the war has ended , the chief elements on which a hope for Turkey 's future can be built may be wiped out by starvation and disease . fr HE Cossack counter-revolution in southern Russia , 1 denounced by the Bolshevik Government , may be as formidable as the Leninite proclamation makes it out . But it is impossible to overlook the fact that the Bolshevik summons to a war of defence for the revolution against the Cossacks and the Milyukovs , the Rodziankos , the Gutchkovs , was issued on the eve of the day set for the meeting of the Constituent Assembly . Taken in conjunction with the arrest of the committee which has been in charge of the creation of the Constituent , the Bolshevik call for strong measures against counter-revolution savored strongly of an attempt to intimidate the Constitutional Convention or a preliminary step towards its postponement . The voting for delegates showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention , they were by no means assured of a majority , and certainly not of so overwhelming a majority as would enable them to put through their drastic internal policies without opposition . When one reads of Lenine 's edicts against the entire existing social system , the impression arises that the " bourgeois " no longer exist in Russia . This impression disappears when we hear of the party of the Milyukovs and Rodziankos polling 200,000 votes in the very citadel of Bolshevikism , namely , Petrograd . Very definitely Lenine and Trotzky are heading towards the " dictatorship of the proletariat . " THOSE have been long and complicated campaigns which have resulted in the clearing of Germans from their last colony , East Africa . Over a territory as large as Germany and France combined , and in great part a trackless wilderness , the fighting has swayed . The first German invasion of South Africa and its repulse by Smuts ; the forced internment of 15,000 German and native troops in Spanish Guinea ; the destruction of the KOnigsberg in the Rufigi River by British monitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans west of Kilimanjaro ; the subsequent fall of the coast cities of Tanga and Dar-esSaalam , were the landmarks in the steady erasure of German authority from the map of eastern Africa . At the beginning of this year the Germans were in control still of about one-fourth of the colony , and were no negligible fighting quantity . The credit for the operations which steadily reduced their personnel and equipment belongs to Gen. Van Deventer . Though East Africa is now wholly in British hands , some German belligerents remain in Portuguese Mozambique . GEN . LUDENDORFF on U-boat warfare and the entry of America into the war shows scarcely a grain more of humor than his Imperial master did when speaking of Britain 's military participation in the conflict . America 's negligible aid to the Entente is completely offset by the general effect on England of the submarine campaign , which quite comes up to expectations . A scarcity of coal-pit props in English mines has caused a corresponding scarcity of coal in Italy and , he might have added , in France . All the boasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that England would be starved , on her knees , within a month , two months , or at most six months  --  all depending on whether the Grand Admiral , the Chief of Staff , or Hollweg was making the estimate  --  were made for psychological effect . Nobody who knew really believed them . The real object was to knock the coal props from under England . HE country is roughly familiar with the remarkably 1 impressive facts given by Secretary Daniels to show the increase in size and efficiency of the navy under war pressure ; an increase in part traceable as far back as the act of August , 1916 , providing for a huge three years ' building programme and an immediate increase in personnel . With 270,000 officers and men , as against about 70,000 in January , 1917 ; 60,000 civil employees , as against about 35,000 ; about 1,000 commissioned ships , against about 300 ; a marine corps of 30,000 men , as against 10,000 ; and an average monthly expenditure of $60,000,000 , as against $8 , - 000,000 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest attaches to his emphatic repetition of belief that promotion should be upon the merit system , and that the " fetich " of seniority should be abandoned from ensign to admiral , coupled with a recommendation that the selective system be extended to staff as well as line . The chief complaint against the act of August , 1916 , in the navy centred upon its provisions for promotion by selection , some officers being emphatically opposed , some approving , and others demanding more careful methods of choice ; but the Secretary is determined to carry through the principle . FINLAND 'S appeal to the Scandinavian countries for food concerns us also . Her Government has sent a commissioner to solicit our aid in saving multitudes of its citizens from starvation . To the objection that any food that we sent might fall into enemy hands , the explanation is made that it is intended to ship such supplies to the Norwegian port of Narvik , whence they are to be carried across Sweden by rail to the Finnish port of Karungi , the process to be under American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for some time ago , it is added , but was commandeered by Mr. Hoover , so that the immediate question is of obtaining , not food , but a license for shipping it . Naturally , these alleged facts must be verified before we take any action , but in view of the pressing necessities reported from Finland with Finnish food-commissions issuing appeals , such verification ought to be made promptly and whatever we can do be done at once . SECRETARY HOUSTON 'S annual report , published last Friday , supports Mr. Hoover in his contention that more emphasis must be laid upon the rapid production of meat . His figures for the present condition , admittedly not precise , are partly encouraging and partly discouraging . The number of beef cattle in the United States , which after a long decline swung upward in 1913 , still advances : there are 43,300,000 now , as against 40,850,000 a year ago , and only a little over 36,000,000 in 1913 . This is all we could expect , but we must remember that beef had become scarce when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European war has aggravated the scarcity . Sheep still decline , the estimate being for 46,060,000 this year , as against nearly 48,500,000 a year ago and nearly 51,500,000 in 1913 ; the Government must continue its efforts to encourage the growing of sheep on small farms as well as the Western ranges . There has been a decline in the number of hogs , representing a fluctuation due to the high price of corn , and , we must hope , only temporarily marring the increase which has been fairly steady for years . fr HE annual report of the Secretary of the Interior is a 1 vigorous and sanguine blast by an official in close touch with the core of the nation . Mr. Lane is less interested in military operations than in the work carried on at home , of supply , manufacture , and preparation . From this point of view he , for one , will not admit that a democracy , such as ours , must necessarily be incompetent to wage war . In the present crisis , which calls for greatly increased production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process that has been going on for more than forty years . " If , indeed , " he says , " for the past forty years this nation had been planning to make war upon its neighbors , and to seize upon the continent , what more would have been done to make resources available for such an adventure ? . . . Modern industrialism may be epitomized as power plus iron . . . . It sounds almost boastful to say that the most paternal of governments , intent upon dynastic purpose , would hardly have found ways and means to supply itself more liberally with the fundamentals of the great war industries than has been effected by the quiet searching and working of this free people . " From the farmer , the oil driller , and miner to the engineer , the chemist , and manufacturer Secretary Lane finds the country well equipped to carry on war by a generation of peace . POSTMASTER-GENERAL BURLESON does well to hammer away at the extension of the merit system in the postal service . The principle having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation demands the inclusion of the officials he names : the Presidential postmasters , the Assistant Postmasters-General , and the purchasing agent of the Department . The recent scandals in connection with the appointing of new postmasters at the largest two cities in the country enforce the renewed recommendation , although the truckling to New York and Chicago politicians touched a higher position than that of Postmaster-General . Of the same good sense are his observations regarding post-office buildings . Not content with striking broadly at the pork barrel , he meets any demand for specific rules of procedure by suggesting that a building be erected only for offices the rental of which amounts to $1,000 or more and the receipts of which are $15,000 or the population served is as much as 5,000 . Lovers of the log-rolling method will not take kindly to such definite figures , but the adoption of them would be a simple and logical way of cutting off an extravagance that has long disgraced us . TESTIMONY that the wheatless and meatless days have been effective , and exhortation to maintain the observance of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports that certain Middle Western people think they impose an unnecessary sacrifice . He calls these statements either malicious or interested , and the live-stock associations and packers to whom they are ascribed will probably wince more under the latter term . Some Chicagoan " have observed that beef and mutton stocks are accumulating in the coolers ; Mr. Hoover admits that the meatless days are for the first time giving us a surplus , but states that it is a surplus only partially sufficient to meet Allied needs . As for wheat , we have already exported our small surplus above normal demands , and the amount we can add to these exports depends on the amount economized at home . CALIFORNIA fruit-growers want more labor , and they do n't mind if that labor is Chinese ! This is the news that comes from the State which in days past has been willing to bring the country to the verge of war in order to make the exclusion of Oriental labor from its farms and vineyards absolute . At the annual meeting of the California fruit-growers at Sacramento , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit the introduction of sufficient Chinese or other farm labor . " Naturally , this was advocated only as " a war measure , " and there was talk of the ease with which the Chinese could be " deported " after the emergency had passed . But all this does not disguise the fact that California is ready to abandon its old position of furious opposition to the immigration of Chinese laborers  --  and presumably of Japanese also  --  when even a temporary self-interest dictates that course . THE unexampled heat of the Canadian campaign is attested by the riot at Kitchener , Ont. , followed by the City Council 's refusal to offer apologies to Premier Borden for the breaking up of his meeting ; similar disturbances when Cabinet Ministers have tried to speak in Montreal , and the growing bitterness between extremist elements of Quebec and of the English provinces . The Government is so dissatisfied with the workings of the conscription machinery in Quebec that it has accused " a large number of exemption tribunals " of granting " exemptions in a very large number of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen to the filing of more than 5,000 appeals in Quebec city and Montreal . This and the weak response to the Victory Loan campaign throughout Quebec have pointed fresh quarrels between those who assert that the French are disloyal and those defenders of the French who have another definition of loyalty . No more dramatic contest has ever occurred in Canada . Balloting began among the Canadian troops in France several days ago ; polls are to be set up in New York , Boston , and other American cities ; preparations are being made to receive the first votes of certain classes of women and of Indians ; and campaigning has become furious , especially in the most disputed province , Ontario . ANOTHER significant academic report announces that the dining halls of Harvard , Yale , and Princeton are all losing money . Despairing housewives will take comfort in the fact that , although Harvard charged $5.50 a week and the others more than $6 , the deficit of the first last year was $15,000 , and of the other two more than $12,000 each . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is expected to bear fruit ( it is said ) in the elimination of fruit from the bill-of-fare ; or perhaps it will be possible to say that the greedy students get their deserts in being deprived of dessert . At Yale , a total deficit for several years of $51,000 would show that the students have literally been eating into the University 's resources . Of this sum V no less than $16,500 represents bills owed by students and former students , which veteran landladies will wish the University a sweet time in collecting .
