A garden in Provincetown . On the spectator 's right a two -- story house runs back from the proscenium  --  a door towards the front , a second  --  story window towards the back . Across the back runs a thick  --  set row of sunflowers nearly concealing a fence or wall . Back of this are trees and sky . There is a gate at the left rear corner of the garden . People entering it come straight toward the front , down the left side and , to reach the house door , pass across the front of the stage . A fence with sunflowers like that at the back closes off the left wing of the stage  --  a tree behind this left fence . The sun -- dial stands on a broad step or pedestal which partly masks the digging which takes place behind it . The position of the sun -- dial is to the left of the center of the stage midway between front and back . From behind the tree on the left the late afternoon sun throws a well -- defined beam of light upon the horizontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . On this shaft is the accompanying diagram : two feet high and clearly visible . On the plate of the sun -- dial stands the alarm -- clock . A huge shovel leans against the wall of the house -- corner at the back . IAN is at the sun -- dial . He sights over the style to some distant stake left rear , marking the north . He then sights over the east and west line toward the six o'clock sun . Looks at shadow . Looks at alarm clock . Is intensely pleased . IAN Turning toward house and calling excitedly . Eloise ! Oh , Eloise ! p. 3 ELOISE Inside house . Hello ! IAN Come quick ! You 'll miss it . ELOISE Poking her head out of the second -- story window ; she cranes her neck to look straight up in the air . What is it ? IAN Come down here quick or you 'll miss it . ELOISE Disappears from window . A moment later comes running out , one braid of hair up and one braid down . Again looks wildly up in the air . Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? ELOISE The airplane . IAN Airplane ? It 's the sun -- dial . It 's right . Just look at this six o'clock shadow . She goes around to the other side of it . It 's absolutely , mathematically  --  you 're in the way of the sun , Eloise . She steps aside . Look ! the style is set square on the true north  --  this is the fifteenth of June  --  the clock is checked to the second by telegraph with the observatory at Washington and see ! the clock is exactly nineteen minutes and twenty seconds behind the shadow  --  the precise difference between Provincetown local time and standard Eastern time . p. 4 ELOISE Then the sun -- dial 's really finished  --  and working right ! After all these weeks ! Oh , Ian ! Embraces him . IAN It 's good to get it right after all those mistakes . With vision . Why , Eloise , getting this right has been a symbol of man 's whole search for truth  --  the discovery and correction of error  --  the mind compelled to conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELOISE Going to it again . And to think that it 's the sundial which is true and the clock  --  all the clocks  --  are wrong ! I 'm glad it is true . Alice Knight has been here talking to me for an hour . I want to think that something 's true . IAN That 's just it , Eloise . The sun -- dial is more than sun -- dial . It 's a first -- hand relation with truth . A personal relation . When you take your time from a clock you are mechanically getting information from a machine . You 're nothing but a clock yourself . ELOISE Like Alice Knight . IAN But the sun -- dial  --  this shadow is an original document  --  a scholar 's source . ELOISE To tell time by the shadow of the sun  --  so large and simple . p. 5 IAN I would n't call it simple . Here on this diagram I have worked out  --  ELOISE Dearest , you know I ca n't understand diagrams . But I get the feeling of it , Ian  --  the sun , the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on the styleis set by the North star . Her right hand remains on the style , her left prolongs its line heaven ward . Why , if I could go on long enough I 'd get to the North star ! IAN Impressively . The line that passes along the edge of this style joins the two poles of the heavens . ELOISE pulls away her hand as one who fears on electric shock . Look at this slow shadow and what you see is the spin of the earth on its axis . It is not so much the measure of time as time itself made visible . ELOISE Knitting her brows to get this : escaping to an impetuous generality . Ian , which do you think is the more wonderful  --  space or time ? IAN Again sighting over his east and west lines . Good humoredly . Both are a little large for our approbation . ELOISE Sitting on the steps and putting up the other braid . Do you know , Ian , that 's the one thing about them I do n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can you ? They make you so humble . That 's one nice thing about a clock . A clock is sometimes wrong . p. 6 IAN Do n't you want to live in a first -- hand relation to truth ? ELOISE Yes ; yes , I do  --  generally . IAN I have a feeling as of having touched vast forces . To work directly with worlds  --  it lifts me out of that little routine of our lives which is itself a clock . ELOISE Catching his exultation . Let us be like this ! Let us have done with clocks ! IAN Eloise , how wonderful ! Can the clocks and live by the sun -- dial ? Live by the non -- automatic sun -- dial  --  as a pledge that we ourselves refuse to be automatons ! ELOISE Like Alice Knight . She takes clock from dial and puts it face downward on the ground . I shall never again have anything to do with a clock ! IAN Eloise ! How corking of you ! I did n't think you had it in you . Raising his right hand . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole truth and nothing but the truth ? ELOISE Her hand upon the sun -- dial . I swear . IAN Bring them ! ELOISE Bring  --  ? p. 7 IAN The clocks ! Bring them ! Seizes the spade over by the house ; begins to dig a grave behind the sun dial . Bring every one ! We will bury the clocks before the sun -- dial  --  an offering , a living sacrifice . I tell you this is great , Eloise . What is a clock ? Something agreed upon and arbitrarily imposed upon us . Standard time . Not true time . Symbolizing the whole standardization of our lives . Clocks ! Why , it is clockiness that makes America mechanical and mean ! Clock -- minded ! A clock is a little machine that shuts us out from the wonder of time . A large gesture with the shovel . Who thinks of spinning worlds when looking at a clock ? How dare clocks do this to us ? But the sun -- dial  --  because there was creation , because there are worlds outside our world , because space is rhythm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere ! Bring them , Eloise ! I am digging the graves of the clocks ! ELOISE swept up by this ecstasy , yet frightened at what it is bringing her to , hesitates , then runs to house . IAN digs with rhythmic vigor . A moment later ELOISE is seen peering down at him from window , in her arms a cuckoo clock . It begins to cuckoo , startling ELOISE . IAN That damned cuckoo ! A moment later ELOISE comes out , bearing cuckoo clock and an old -- fashioned clock . IAN 'S back is to her ; she has to pass the alarm clock , lying where she left it , prone on the ground . She hesitates , then carefully holding the other two clocks in one arm , she stealthily goes rear and puts the alarm clock behind the sunflowers . Then advances with the other two . p. 8 IAN While digging . Into these graves go all that is clock -- like in our own minds . All that a clock world has made of us lies buried here ! ELOISE stands rather appalled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave . Puts the old -- fashioned clock carefully on the ground . Gingerly fits the cuckoo clock into the completed grave . With an exclamation of horror lifts it out of the grave . Listens to its tick . Puts her ear to the sun -- dial ; listens vainly . ELOISE The sun -- dial does n't tick , does it , Ian ? IAN Why should it tick ? ELOISE Do you know , Ian , I TimidlyI like to hear the ticking of a clock . No reply . ELOISE holds up the cuckoo clock . This was a wedding present . IAN No wonder marriage fails . He moves to take it from her . ELOISE I wonder if we had n't better leave the cuckoo until tomorrow . IAN Flaming worlds ! A cuckoo ! ELOISE Eddy and Alice gave us the cuckoo . You know they 're coming back . I asked them for dinner . They might not understand our burying their clock . p. 9 IAN Their failure to understand need not limit our lives . Puts the cuckoo clock in its grave and begins to cover it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cuckoo ! I liked to see him popping out ! IAN Kindly . You will grow , Eloise . You will go out to large things now that you have done with small ones . ELOISE I hope so . It will be hard on me if I do n't IAN reaches for the other clock . ELOISE Snatching it . Oh , Ian , I do n't think I ought to bury this one . It 's the clock my grandmother started housekeeping with ! IAN Firmly taking clock . And see what it did to her . Meticulous old woman ! Puts it in its grave . ELOISE You were glad enough to get her pies and buckwheat cakes . IAN She had all the small virtues . But a standardized mind . Trampling down the grave . She lacked scope . And now  --  a little grave for little clocks . Takes out his watch , puts it in the grave . Your watch , Eloise. p. 10 ELOISE Holding to her wrist watch . I though I 'd keep my watch , Ian . Hastily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to let truth be your ornament , Eloise . ELOISE Nobody sees truth . With a fresh outburst . This watch was my graduation present ! IAN Symbolizing all the standardized arbitrary things you were taught ! Commemorating the clock -- like way your mind was made to run . Free yourself of that watch , Eloise . ELOISE reluctantly frees herself . IAN briskly covers the watches . Moves to the unfilled grave . Is there nothing for this grave ? ELOISE shakes her head . Sure  --  the alarm clock ! ELOISE Running to the sunflowers and spreading out her skirts before them . Oh , Ian , not the alarm clock ! How would we ever go to Boston ? The train does n't run by the sun . IAN Then the train is wrong . ELOISE But , Ian , if the train is wrong we have to be wrong to catch the train . IAN That 's civilization . Stands resolutely by the grave . The alarm clock , Eloise . The grave awaits it . p. 11 ELOISE Taking it up , her arms folded around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hat ! IAN The sun will fall upon your dear head and give you life . ELOISE About to cry . But no style ! It ticks so loud and sure ! IAN All false things are loud and sure . ELOISE I need a tick ! I am afraid of tickless time ! Holding the clock in both hands she places it against her left ear . IAN Spade still in his right hand , he places his left arm around her reassuringly . You will grow , Eloise . You are growing . He takes the clock as he is saying this . She turns her head backward following the departing clock with surprised and helpless eyes . Disconsolately watches him bury it . ELOISE An inspiration . Ian ! Could n't you fix the sun dial to be set and go off ? IAN Pained . " Set and go off ? " Pause ; regards the sun . Sine sole silio . ELOISE What did you say , Ian ? p. 12 IAN I said : Sine sole silio . ELOISE Well , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a Latin motto I 've just thought of for the sun dial . It means , " Without sun , I am silent . " Silence is a great virtue . Having finished the grave , he looks around , making sure there are no more clocks . Joyously . Now we are freed ! Eloise , think what life is going to be ! Done with approximations . Done with machine thinking . In a world content with false time , we are true . ELOISE Sitting on the steps . Yes , it 's beautiful . I want to be true . It 's just that it 's a little hard to be true in a false world . For instance , tomorrow I have an appointment with the dentist . If I come on sun -- time I suppose I 'll be twenty minutes  --  IAN Eagerly . Going to the sun -- dial and pointing . If you will just let me explain this table  --  ELOISE shrinks back . IAN gives it up . Oh , well , tell him you are living by the truth . ELOISE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when we ask people for dinner at seven , they 'll get here at twenty minutes of seven . Or will it be twenty minutes after seven ? p. 13 IAN Smoothing down graves . It will be a part of eternal time . ELOISE Yes ,  --  that 's true . Only the roast is n't so eternal . Why do they have clocks wrong ? IAN Oh , Eloise , I 've explained it so many times . You  --  living in Provincetown , three hundred miles to the eastward , are living by the mean solar time of Philadelphia . Venomously . Do you want to live by the mean solar time of Philadelphia ? ELOISE Certainly not . An idea . Then has Philadelphia got the right time ? IAN It 's right six miles this side of Philadelphia . ELOISE We might move to Philadelphia . Enter through gate , MRS . STUBBS , a Provincetown " native . " MRS . STUBBS Now , Mr. Joyce , this sun clock ,  --  is it running ? IAN It does n't " run , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STUBBS Oh . Well , is it being acted upon ? IAN As surely as the sun shines . MRS . STUBBS Looking at the sun . And it is shining today , is n't it ? Well , will you tell me the time ? My clock has stopped and I want to set it . p. 14 IAN Happily . You hear , Eloise ? Her clock has stopped . MRS . STUBBS Yes , I forgot to wind it . ELOISE Grieved to think of any one living in such a world . Wind it ! IAN Do you not see , MRS . Stubbs , where the shadow falls ? She comes up the steps . From its millions of spinn  --  You 're in the way of the sun , MRS . Stubbs . She steps aside . Its millions of spinning miles the sun casts that shadow and here we know that it is eight minutes past six . MRS . STUBBS Now , ai n't that wonderful ? Dear , dear , I wish Mr. Stubbs could make a sun clock . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , I must hurry back . They work tonight at the cold storage but Mr. Stubbs gets home for his supper at half past six . Starts away , reaching the gate . ELOISE Running to her . Oh , MRS . Stubbs ! Do n't get his supper by sun time . It would n't be ready . It  --  With a hesitant look at IANmight get cold . MRS . STUBBS stares . You see , Mr. Stubbs is coming home by the mean solar time of Philadelphia . p. 15 MRS . STUBBS Loyal to Mr. STUBBS . Who said he was ? ELOISE In distress . Oh , it 's all so false ! And arbitrary ! To IAN . But I think MRS . Stubbs had better be false and arbitrary too . Mr. Stubbs might rather have his supper than the truth . MRS . STUBBS Advancing a little . What is this about my being false ? And  --  arbitrary ? ELOISE You see , you have to be , MRS . Stubbs . We do n't blame you . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work by it ? MRS . STUBBS This is the first word I ever heard said against Johnnie Stubbs ' way of freezin ' fish . ELOISE Oh , MRS . Stubbs , if it were merely his way of freezing fish ! IAN Since you are not trying to establish a direct relation with truth , set your clock at five minutes of six . The clocks , as would be clear to you if you would establish a first -- hand relation with this diagram , Eloise , are slow . MRS . STUBBS You mean your sun clock 's wrong . IAN All other clocks are wrong . p. 16 ELOISE You live by the mean solar time of Philadelphia . MRS . STUBBS I do no such thing ! ELOISE Yes , you do , MRS . Stubbs . You see the sun ca n't be both here and in Philadelphia at the same time . Now could it ? So we have to pretend to be where it is in Philadelphia . MRS . STUBBS Who said we did ? ELOISE Well , After a look at IANthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Joyce and I  --  You 're standing on a grave , MRS . Stubbs . MRS . STUBBS jumps . The grave of my grandmother 's clock . In reply to MRS . STUBBS look of amazement . Oh , yes ! That clock has done harm enough . MRS . Stubbs , think what time is  --  and then consider my grandmother 's clock ! Tick , tick ! Tick , tick ! Messing up eternity like that ! MRS . STUBBS After failing to think of anything adequate . I must get MRS . Stubbs his supper ! Frightened exit . IAN Standing near house door . Eloise , how I love you when feeling lifts you out of routine ! Do you know , dearest , you are very sensitive in the way you feel feeling ? Sometimes I think that to feel feeling is greater than to feel . You 're like the dial . Your sensitiveness is the style  --  the gnomon  --  to cast the shadow of the feeling all around you and mark what has been felt . They embrace . EDDY and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He comes down . Ahem ! We seem to have come ahead of time . ELOISE Oh , Eddy ! Alice ! Moving toward EDDY but not passing the dial . We are living by sun time now . You have n't arrived for twenty minutes . EDDY We have n't arrived for twenty minutes ? Feeling of himself . Why do I seem to be here ? ALICE Approaching dial . So this is the famous sundial ? How very interesting it is ! ELOISE It 's more than that . ALICE Yes , it 's really beautiful , is n't it ? ELOISE It 's more than that . EDDY Is it ? ELOISE It 's a symbol . It means that Ian and I are done with approximations arbitrarily and falsely imposed upon us . EDDY Well , I should think you would be . Who 's been doing that to you ? ELOISE Do n't step on the graves , please , Alice . ALICE Starting back in horror . Graves ? p. 18 ELOISE Pointing down . The lies we inherited lie buried there . EDDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graveyard . So the sun -- dial is built on lies . ELOISE Indeed it is not ! ALICE Does it keep time ? IAN It does n't " keep " time . It gives it . EDDY Comparing with his watch . Well , it gives it wrong . It 's twenty minutes fast.IAN and ELOISE smile at one another in a superior way . ALICE You could n't expect a home -- made clock to be perfectly accurate . I think it 's doing very well to come within twenty minutes of the true time . IAN It is true time . ELOISE You think it 's twenty minutes fast because your puny , meticulous little watch is twenty minutes slow . ALICE Why is it , Eddy ? Comparing watches across the sun -- dial . No , Eddy 's watch is right by mine . IAN And neither of you is right by the truth . ELOISE Pityingly . Do n't you know that you are running by the mean solar time of Philadelphia ? p. 19 EDDY Well , is n't everybody else running that way ? ELOISE Does that make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast off standard time and live by solar time . ELOISE Lies for truth . EDDY But how are you going to connect up with other people ? IAN We can allow for their mistakes . ELOISE We will connect with other people in so far as other people are capable of connecting with the truth ! EDDY I 'm afraid you 'll be awful lonesome sometimes . ALICE But , Eloise , do you mean to say that you are going to insist on being right when other people are wrong ? ELOISE I insist upon it . ALICE What a life ! EDDY Come now , what difference does it make if we 're wrong if we 're all wrong together ? IAN That idea has made a clock of the human mind . Enter ANNIE . ANNIE Mrs. Joyce , ca n't I have my clock back now ? I do n't know when to start dinner . p. 20 IAN Consulting dial . By true time , Annie , it is twenty minutes past six . ELOISE Confidentially . By false time , it is six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looks around for it . IAN We are done with clocks , Annie . ANNIE You mean I 'm not to have it back ? ELOISE It lies buried there . ANNIE Buried ? My clock buried ? It 's not dead ! IAN It 's dead to us , Annie . ANNIE After looking at the grave . Do I get a new clock ? ELOISE We are going to establish a first -- hand relation with truth . ANNIE You ca n't cook without a clock . IAN A superstition . And anyway  --  have you not the sun ? ANNIE After regarding the sun . I 'd rather have a clock than the sun . Returns to her clockless kitchen . p. 21 IAN That 's what clocks have made of the human mind . EDDY Coming to IAN . Of course , this is all a joke . IAN The attempt to reach truth has always been thought a joke . EDDY But this is n't any new truth ! Why re -- reach it ? IAN I 'm reaching it myself . I 'm getting the impact  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all been worked out for us ? IAN And we take it never knowing  --  never feeling  --  what it is we take . ELOISE And that has made us the mechanical things we are ! ANNIE Frantically rushes in , peeling on onion . Starting the sauce for the spaghetti . Fry onions in butter three minutes . Wildly regards sun -- dial  --  traces curved line of diagram with knife . Looks despairingly at the sun . Tears back into house . IAN You get no sense of wonder in looking at a clock . ALICE Yes , do you know , I do . I 've always thought that clocks were perfectly wonderful . I never could understand how they could run like that . p. 22 ELOISE I suppose you know they run wrong ? EDDY What do you mean " run wrong ? " ELOISE Why , you are running by the mean solar time of Philadelphia ! And yet here you are in Provincetown where the sun is a very different matter . You have no direct relation with the sun . EDDY That does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't worry you , Eddy . You 're too perfect a product of a standardized world . EDDY bows acknowledgment . ANNIE Rushing out to look at dial . Add meat , brown seven minutes . Measures seven minutes between thumb and finger , holds up this fragment of time made visible and carries it carefully into the house . EDDY That girl 'll get heart disease . IAN Let her establish a first -- hand relation to heat . If she 'd take a look at the food instead of the clock  --  ! EDDY Trouble is we have to establish a first -- hand relation with the spaghetti . EDDY now comes down and regards the sun -- dial . Moralizes . If other people have got the wrong dope , you 've got to have the wrong dope or be an off ox . p. 23 IAN Perfect product of a standardized nation ! EDDY Pointing with his stick . What 's this standardized snake ? IAN That 's my diagram correcting the sun . EDDY Does one correct the sun ? ELOISE From behind the dial . Ian ! Correcting the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year when the apparent time is the same as the average time . ELOISE In growing alarm . Do you mean to tell me the sun is not right with itself ? IAN I 've tried to explain it to you , Eloise , but you said you could get the feeling of it without understanding it . This curve Pointingmarks the variation . Here today , you see , the shadow is " right " as you call it  --  that is , average . It will be right again here in September and again on December twenty -- first . ALICE My birthday ! ELOISE Ian , you mean to say the sun only tells the right sun -- time four days in the year ? IAN It always tells the " right " sun -- time , but here the said right sun -- time is fifteen minutes behind its own average , and here it is sixteen minutes ahead . This scale here across the bottom shows you the number of minutes to add or subtract . p. 24 ELOISE With bitterness . Add ! Subtract ! Then you and your sun are false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate . Merely not regular . Machines are regular . ELOISE You got me to bury the clocks and live by the sun  --  and now you tell me you have to fix up the sun . IAN It was you who said bury the clocks . ELOISE I suppose you have to do something to the North star too ! IAN Yes , the North star is not true north . He starts to point out its error , sighting over the style of the dial . ELOISE What is true ? What is true ? IAN With vision . The mind of man . ELOISE I think I 'd better have a clock . A new gust . You told me I was to live by the sun and now  --  after the clocks are in their graves  --  what I am to live by is that snake . She points at diagram . IAN You are a victim of misplaced confidence , Eloise . Sometimes when one feels things without understanding them , one feels the wrong thing . But there 's nothing to worry about . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregularities . p. 25 EDDY Take heart , Eloise . It 's a standardized sun . IAN It 's not a blindly accepted sun ! ANNIE Who comes as one not to be put aside . What 'll I do when it rains ? IAN You 'll use your mind . ANNIE To tell time by ? Looking to ELOISE . I think I 'd better find another place . ALICE Coming forward , regarding this as a really serious matter . No , do n't do that , Annie . ELOISE Tearfully . You do n't know the wonders of your own mind ! ANNIE No , ma 'm . After a look at the sun , becomes terrified . It 's going down ! EDDY Yes , it goes down . ANNIE How 'll we tell time when it 's dark ? IAN Sine sole silio . ANNIE Is that saying how we 'll know it 's time to go to bed ? IAN The doves know when to go to bed . ANNIE The doves do n't go to the pictures . p. 26 ELOISE Hysterically . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clock ! Exit . IAN She 'd rather have a clock than grow . ALICE Now why ca n't one do both ? IAN One does n't  --  that 's the answer . One merely has the clock . I 'd rather be a fool than a machine . EDDY I never definitely elected to be either . IAN One can be both without electing either . ELOISE I want to hear the ticking of a clock ! EDDY It 's a nice thing to hear . The ticking of a clock means the minds of many men . As long as the mind of man has to  --  fix up the facts of nature in order to create ideal time I feel it 's a little more substantial to have the minds of many men . ALICE As I 've told you before , Eloise , you ca n't do better than accept the things that have been all worked out for you . IAN You hear them , Eloise ? You see where this defense of clocks is leading ? ELOISE Ian , I 'm terribly worried  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one beginning a dirge . The sun has failed me . The North star is false . p. 27 IAN Going to her . I am here , dearest . ELOISE Sometimes you seem so much like space . I am running by the sun  --  that wobbly sun Looking at itand everyone else is running by Philadelphia . I want a little clock to tick to me ! IAN You will grow , dearest . ELOISE There 's no use growing . The things you grow to are wrong . Pressing her hands to her head . I need a tick in time ! IAN Striding savagely from her . Very well , then ; dig up the clocks . EDDY Now your 're talking ! ELOISE springs up . IAN Dig up the clocks ! And we spend our lives nineteen minutes and twenty seconds apart ! ELOISE is arrested , appalled . Dreadful pause . ELOISE You mean we 'd never get together ? IAN Time would lie between us . I refuse to be re -- caught into a clock world . It was you , Eloise , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first -- hand relation to truth . ELOISE I did n't know I was proposing a first -- hand relation with that snake ! p. 28 IAN It 's not a snake ! It 's a little piece of the long winding road to truth . It 's the discarding of error , the adjustment of fact . And I did it myself . And it puts me on that road . Oh , I know To EDDY and ALICEhow you can laugh if you yourself feel no need to feel truth . And you , Eloise , if you do n't want to feel time  --  return to your mean little clock . What is a clock ? A clock is the soulless  --  The alarm clock enters a protest . Smothered sound of the alarm going off underground . ELOISE screams . ELOISE The alarm clock ! It 's going off ! ALICE Buried alive ! ELOISE Oh , no  --  oh , no ! How terrible ! Ian , how terrible ! She runs to him . Alarm clock , being intermittent , goes off again . IAN Eloise , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How bravely it tries to function in its grave ! ALICE The death struggle  --  the last gasp ! With another scream ELOISE snatches spade , begins to dig ; alarm clock gives another little gasp ; spade is too slow for her : in her desperation goes to it with her hands . Gets it and , as she holds it aloft , the alarm clock rings its triumph . p. 29 ELOISE Holding it to her ear . It 's ticking ! It ticks ! It ticks ! Oh , it 's good to hear the ticking of a clock ! As he hears this , IAN , after a moment of terrible silence , goes and unscrews the plate of the sun -- dial . All watch him , afraid to speak . He takes it off , holds it above the grave from which the alarm clock has been rescued . ELOISE Ian ! What are you doing ? He does not answer , but puts the sun -- dial in the alarm clock 's grave . Ian ! No ! No ! Not that ! Not your beautiful sun -- dial ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished the burial of the sun -- dial , sees the alarm clock and puts it on the pedestal from which the sun -- dial has been taken . IAN We bow down , as of old , to the mechanical . We will have no other god but it . He then sits on the step , sunk in gloom . ANNIE appears , in her hand a panful of water . ANNIE This liver has to soak five minutes . I 'll soak it here . Sees the alarm clock ; with a cry of joy . My clock ! My clock ! Overcome with emotion . Oh ! My clock ! My clock ! Can I take it in the house to finish dinner ? ELOISE In a hopeless voice . Yes , take it away . Beaming , ANNIE bears it to her kitchen . ELOISE now kneels behind the grave of the sun -- dial. p. 30 EDDY Let us leave them alone with their dead . Leads ALICE to the corner of the house ; they look off down the road . ELOISE and IAN sit there on either side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those who mourn . ELOISE Looking at grave . I had thought life was going to be so beautiful . IAN It might have been . ELOISE Looking at empty pedestal . I suppose it will never be beautiful again . IAN It can not be beautiful again . Suddenly , with a cry , ELOISE gets up and darts to the house : comes racing back with the alarm clock , snatches spade , desperately begins to dig a grave . ELOISE Ian ! Ian ! Do n't you see what I 'm doing ? I 'm willing to have a first -- hand relation with the sun even though it 's not regular . But IAN is as one who has lost hope . EDDY and ALICE turn to watch the re -- burial of the alarm clock . ANNIE strides in . ANNIE In no mood for feeling . Where 's my alarm clock ? ELOISE I am burying it . p. 31 ANNIE Again ? Looks at sun -- dial . And even the sun -- clock 's gone ? EDDY All is buried . Truth . Error . We have returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I go . I leave .

You ca n't get anybody now . Oh , this is madness . What does any of the rest of it matter if you have lost your cook ? To IAN . Eloise ca n't do the work ! Peel potatoes  --  scrub . What 's the difference what 's true if you have to clean out your own sink ? Despairing of him she turns to ELOISE . Eloise , stop fussing about the moon and stars ! You 're losing your cook ! ANNIE comes from the house with suitcase , shawl -- strap and hand -- bag on long strings . Marches straight to left of stage , makes a face at the sun , marches to gate left rear and off . ALICE Eddy , go after her ! Heavens ! Has no one a mind ? Go after her ! p. 32 EDDY What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ALICE Well , get a clock ! For heaven 's sake , get a clock ! Eloise , get off the grave of the alarm clock ! ELOISE stands like a monument . To EDDY . Well , there are graves all around you . Dig something else up . No ! You call her back . I 'll  --  Snatches spade , which is resting against sun -- dial pedestal , begins to dig . EDDY stands at back , calling . EDDY Annie ! Oh , Annie ! Wait , Annie ! ALICE While frantically digging . Say something to interest her , imbecile ! EDDY Stick in one hand , straw hat in the other , making wild signals with both . Come home , Annie ! Clock ! Clock ! Giving up that job and throwing off his coat . You interest her and I 'll dig . They change places . ALICE She 's most to the bend ! Eddy , do n't you know how to dig ? EDDY , who has been digging with speed and skill , produces the clock with which ELOISE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 33 ELOISE Dully . That clock does n't keep time . Annie hates it . IAN As if irritated by all this inefficiency . What she wants is the alarm clock . Get off the grave , Eloise . He disinters alarm clock and with it runs after ANNIE . ALICE draws a long breath and rubs her back . EDDY brings the clock he dug up and sets it on the pedestal . Then he looks down at the disturbed graves . EDDY Here 's a watch ! Lifts it from the grave ; holds it out to ELOISE ; she does not take it . He puts it on the pedestal beside the clock . Here 's another watch . Holds up IAN 'S watch . Quite a valuable piece of ground . Now is heard the smothered voice of a cuckoo . ALICE Jumping . What 's that ? ELOISE The cuckoo . I suppose it 's lonesome . ALICE Outraged . Cuckoo ! Pointing . In that grave ? The cuckoo we gave you ? ELOISE nods . You buried our wedding present ? ELOISE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , I must say , the people who try to lead the right kind of lives always do the wrong thing . Stiffy . I am not accustomed to having my wedding presents put in graves . Will you please dig it up , Eddy ? It will do very well on the mantel in our library . And my back nearly broken digging for your cook ! She holds her back . While EDDY is digging up the cuckoo , ANNIE and IAN appear and march across from gate to house , ANNIE triumphantly bearing her alarm clock , IAN  --  a captive at her chariot wheels  --  following with suit -- case , shawl strap and long strings of bag around his wrist . A moment later IAN comes out of the house , looks at each dug -- up thing , stands by the grave of the sun -- dial . Enter MRS . STUBBS. p. 34 MRS . STUBBS Oh , Mr. Joyce , I 've come to see your sun -- clock again . Mr. Stubbs says he 'll not be run from Philadelphia . He says if you have got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gone . Oh , do you take it in at night ? IAN The sun -- dial lies buried there . MRS . STUBBS You 've buried the sun -- clock ? And dug up all the wrong clocks ? With a withering glance at ELOISE . That 's how a smart man 's appreciated ! What did you bury it for , Mr. Joyce ? EDDY gives the cuckoo clock to ALICE . IAN It can not live in this world where no one wants truth or feeling about truth . This is a world for clocks . MRS . STUBBS Well , I want truth ! And so does Johnnie Stubbs ! If you 'll excuse my saying so , Mr. Joyce , after you 've made a thing that 's right you ought n't to bury it , even if there is nobody to want it . And now that I want it --  MRS . STUBBS takes the spade and begins to dig up the sun -- dial . IAN can not resist this and helps her . He lifts the sun -- dial , she brushes it off and he fits it to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Joyce , and as good as if it had never seen the grave . She looks at the setting sun . And there 's time for it to make its shadow before this sun has gone . p. 35 IAN The simple mind has beauty . ELOISE Coming to him . I want to be simpler . MRS . STUBBS Now what time would you say it was , Mr. Joyce ? IAN I would say it was twenty minutes of seven , MRS . Stubbs . MRS . STUBBS Looking at EDDY and ALICE and the cuckoo clock . And they would say it was twenty minutes past six ! Well , I say : let them that want sun time have sun time and them that want tick time have tick time . ANNIE appears at the door . ANNIE In a flat voice.
