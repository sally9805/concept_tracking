txt Roosevelt Week brings an opportunity that comes but seldom in the life of any nation . A great historic figure is passing from the world of contemporary fact , the world of the morning paper , and into the world of memory and of history . Such a little time ago men loved and praised a fellow-citizen , or disagreed with hint : it was always as man to ma.a . The intensely personal feeling shut off the larger vision . Even when some ranked him next to WASHINGTON and Lixcow. , the judgment which purported to be historic was mainly partisan . Now we know , or are beginning to know , the great patriot and leader of men in his true and permanent proportions . We use the flag as symbol of the nation 's tribute to all our heroic dead : but we are using it today with a difference . Others have been shrouded in it and laid away amid the hush of awe . For ROOSEVELT we gave it to relays of swift-footed. clean-limbed youngsters . who carried it across the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city of his nativity . Of what other American has youth and swift strength and the mounting joy of life been so fit an expression ? At the stations where the flag lay overnight it was guarded by boys who were often chosen because they wore not born of our people but had made themselves Americans . Among our great men no one has expressed so vigorously our hospitality to all who love freedom and the solemn obligations of those who accept it . At each station a new star was sewed upon the flag by a group of girls and young women . In one of our schools , of the five who sewed each an angle of the star four were descended front veterans of the Revolution , the civil war , the Spanish war , and the Great War . and the fifth was daughter of a naturalized Hungarian . That would have meant much to Itooseveur. for he was the first great American to express for us the transcendent dignity of all womanhood . Others of our leaders have been reverenced devoutly , mourned In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man lives in the spirit of manly youth and vigor , of feminine beauty and steadfastness . In the final stage of the flag . which will bring it to the grave at Sagamore , it will soar aloft in the sky . In that . too . there is a memorable symbol . In his lifetime fortune 's buffets and rewards came to hint in inverse order . There were decades when , in his public appearances , the heavens never once failed to smile on his robust and joyous face . Ho had only to will a thing and it happened . Then came a time when it seemed that nothing he touched could prosper . The greatest crisis which the world has ever endured came in his prime . and he had no active part Ir . it , though , the moral effect of his influence on the Issue may some day be reckoned as his greatest accomplishment . To realize what that meant one would have to be as ambitious as he was ? as eager for the larger life . as full of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet of an Intended assassin in his flesh , he had expressed the thought that now sustained him . A man 's happiness is only " to spend and to be spent . " To its last pulse his great strength was spent for his country . That is the thought which men will remember , which will carry his fame forward through the ages .
