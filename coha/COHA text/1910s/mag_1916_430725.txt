 | ONE by one the three ships in their battle gray edged away from the navy yard docks and swung into the river . Important little tugs sputtered and kicked and hauled and shoved , and asserted their undying conviction that any battleship trying to sail without their aid would be a double copper-riveted imbecile . The big ships , gravely tolerant of their fuming officiousness , straightened out and headed down stream . From the curving span of the Brooklyn Bridge a dozen photographers and movie men focussed and snapped and ground away . The Naval Training Cruise , newest manifestation of the popular thirst for preparedness , was on . On the decks of the battleship " New Jersey " a couple of hundred experimental young Americans ? and a few further removed from the adventurous years ? stood about and slyly admired their glistening white new outfits and wondered what was fo happen to them for the next few weeks . Up on the bridge the Executive Officer navigated the ship and did a little wondering along the same lines himself . For the Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must keep the ship running smoothly , and everything functioning properly , and everybody doing his job . He must plan and dovetail and adjust and take up slack and coordinate ? subject always to the purposes , the inspirations , the hobbies , the whims and the digestions of the Captain at his elbow , and the Admiral off there within signaling distance , and the beautiful , detached , Olympian Department at the other end of the wireless . So the Executive brooded on his responsibility and the volunteers speculated in their irresponsibility . The three ships plowed down thru the Narrows and along the Long Island coast and came to anchor among other volunteer bespattered ships in a secluded bay where they might consider together and find out what to do about it all . Now the nine ships in that little fleet were laboring under grievous handicaps , and it was n't their fault at all at all . They were ships of half a generation ago or less , and in the navy ten years spell obsolescence and a dozen verge on senility and decay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reserve , " where they would be economical and not clutter things up . They had , when this blessed fleet set sail , a third of a crew apiece ' or thereabouts ? and every officer from the Executive to the bo's'n 's mate on the fo'castle and the water tender in the fire room knows just what particular kind of purgatory that means . Their officers were a " scratch " team ; half of them came overside at the last minute with their trunks and bags and parcels , gathered together by an optimistic and resourceful Department from here and there and the other side of beyond . Not a few of them had the milk of their alma mater the Academy still wet upon their lips . And every executive , whether it is four million dollars ' worth of concentrated hardware or of corporate commercialism that he manages , knows what that means . A ship 's officers need to be welded together and seasoned by acquaintance and practise and mutual experience before they develop the indispensable team work and esprit de corps . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant ( in a marine manner of speaking ) mass of two hundred and fifty landsmen per ship ? largely drawn from the unique  | genus " college boy " ? and the task for the responsible heads of those ships looms portentous . The navy has a felicitous phrase , the " happy ship . " It connotes team work , esprit de corps , mutual understanding and respect , cheerful willingness , abounding energy , effectiveness , and punch ? in officers and crew . Its antithesis is " madhouse . " I count it little less than a miracle that the good ship " New Jersey " ? I would speak but of what I saw " close up , " in the movie phrase ? was for those four weeks under those staggering handicaps a " happy ship . " There were rumors abroad in the fleet that the flagship ? but the flagship has added to the complications of its existence an admiral and his staff , and besides it is forbidden by the law to judge . But it must be a fearsome thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem was a hard one , for that it was an all new one , and the straw for that particular brickmaking sparse . But the navy has a way of going and doing the job and complaining afterward , if it pleases , about the materials and the conditions thrust upon it . Afterward , mind you , when the job is done , and , by the same token , well done . So they turned to and taught us what the navy is , and how the sailorman lives , and what he needs to know and do and be and feel if the navy is to be ceaselessly ready and surpassingly good . Now the first thing is order and the second thing is cleanliness . For a battleship is a barracks , and a power house , and a fort , and an eating house , and a magazine , and a workshop , and a storehouse , and an armory ? and a ship . If everything is not in its place twenty-four hours a day and clean , it would straightway become pandemonium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a square inch that has not its appointed function ; if a thing is out of place , it is in something else 's place ? and every housekeeper knows what that means . A bluejacket lives in three dimensions : his hammock , his clothes bag , his ditty box . His canvas hammock reposes by day , a long narrow sausage neatly bound round with precisely seven turns of his hammock lashing , in the hammock locker . By night it swings five feet above the deck , just un der the deck beams above , and rubbing elbows with its neighbor . To get into it is a feat of the acrobat , to lash it for stowing is a lesson in neatness and skill , to sleep in it , after the first night , solid comfort and refreshment , to leave it at five o'clock for another day of routine and labor a trial to the flesh . The clothes bag , cylindrical , three feet by one and a half , of heavy canvas , hangs on a rack near your hammock billet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ditty box . This little chest , say ten by ten by eighteen in inches , rests above your clothes bag , and holds stationery , tobacco , Bluejacket 's Manual , clothes stops , soap , ki-yi ( otherwise hand scrubbing brush ) , shoe shining outfit , and personal miscellany . Beyond these three dimensions your personal life ends . In every other particular , you have all things in common . So there must be order in your personal existence , or the resulting chaos will bring discomfort , unhappiness and reprimand . Not bad training that for a college boy who just naturally lives all over the shop , or even for a man who is used to a wife who picks up after him and caters to his masculine carelessness . Then cleanliness . Working clothes , except in the engine and fire rooms , are white clothes , and white they must be kept . So Jack has half a bucket of fresh water twice a day to clean himself and his clothes ; and the first dog watch every afternoon finds him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and underclothes and all with his little ki-yi and plentiful suds . Drastic methods they use in the navy , and topsy-turvy . For you rinse your clothes in salt water ? fresh is too precious when it has all to be made by evaporation out of the sea . But the ki-yi , plus elbow grease , does get things clean , and the eagle eye of the inspecting officer at quarters in the morning puts a premium on liberality with the elbow grease . The ship must be kept clean , too ; so at five-thirty we turn to and scrub decks with abundant salt water and sand , applied with the deck ki-yi and the indispensable , muscle . Others of us inside the superstructure sweep and swab the deck , polish bright work ? brass with metal polish and steel thresholds , ladders and hatch-combings with emery cloth ? and wipe off paint work . Five times a day those decks are swept , and twice they are swabbed with a mop  - -  think of it , ye housekeepers ! For cleanliness is next to seamanship . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with living , in new surroundings and under highly restricted conditions . There are more important things we must have an inkling of ; for a ship must be driven by engines , and navigated over the seas , and be able to fight , and win . Bluejackets , too , in these days of the passing of the marine , must be like ' Is Majesty 's Jollies , " soldier and sailor too . " So we put on leggings and cartridge belts and drill on the fo'castle among the bitts . and the big black anchor chains and the ventilators , or on the quarter deck , which is not so cluttered up and more genteel like ? for the quarter deck is " officers ' country , " just as the fo'castle is the men 's " hangout . " One day , when the fleet is all foregathered in Hampton Roads , we all go ashore from our nine ships , and within the walls of Fortress Monroe we march and countermarch and evolute . The Admiral reviews us , and our officers confide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it rains without reserve , and we get a little bit of a feeling that we 're not a hopeless mob but the makings of a battalion . Or we pile into pulling boats ? not rowboats , thank you ? and perform endless maneuvers at the dictation of an officer in a motor launch who seems more concerned with exhausting all the flag signals in the " Deck and Boat Book " than with the limitation of our physical endurance . A boat which is scheduled on the Abandon Ship Bill to carry seventy men is a bit of a craft ; and a sixteen-foot ash oar is quite a piece of timber . Even if you do  | have another man halving the wielding of it , at the end of two hours of pulling round and round in the offing you know you have been doing something . Then day after day comes General Quarters , the thrilling bugle call that sends every man scurrying " on the double " to his battle station . If you are lucky your station is in a turret where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inchers with dummy shells ? that weigh just as many hundred pounds as if they were real ? and bags of beans that simulate the powder bags of the real day . But the luck of tte draw can not be with everyone , so squads of twenty or so go tumbling down ladders and hustling thru corridors into the bowels of the ship where the magazines and shell rooms hide under the arch of the armored protective deck . There we " break out " the dummy shells from the shell room and send them shooting up by compressed air to the turret . We pass out the bean bags thru the round hole in the magazine door ? the magazine powdermen , for their sins , are locked into the magazine to consider on their pleasant surroundings and to speculate a little on what would happen if an enemy were really bowling twelve-inch shells at the outside of their particular rat trap . The powder goes up by hand , from stage to stage thru the vertical tunnel which contains the shell-hoisting machinery . Shells and powder-beans sent up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun crew up above is wearing itself out trying to beat the navy loading record , and coming near enough to it to make them all a little overbearing the rest of the day . Then we stand watches , now . in the cavernous fire rooms or alongside the glittering , slithering engines ' way below the water line , now on the high and lofty bridge under the contemplative stars . The engine rooms are fascinating if you like machinery ? or have imagination ; but the bridge is fascinating anyway ? unless you are hopelessly prosaic . Two hours long are the watches for us volunteers ; and from two to four in the morning is quite a stretch in the hot fire room or up where the wind whistles and the fog lies chill . One night come the culminating hours of the war game , in which the twelve ships of our fleet ? three others carrying the Annapolis cadets have joined us now ? represent Blue Fleet , the defenders of our coast against attack . Somewhere off there Red Fleet ? the real battleships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Atlantic Squadron ? is circling round trying to effect a landing for a mythical ( constructive , I believe , is the word ) fleet of transports bearing an army of invasion . Our torpedo boats and scouts are scooting around , too , somewhere over the world 's edge , looking for Red Fleet . Meanwhile we meander along in stately column , waiting for the information that will tell us where the enemy will try to break thru , and where we must strike our protecting blow . Night comes down , and we steam along " ships dark . " Every unnecessary light is out , and some necessary ones , we are inclined to believe , as we wander thru the gloomy ' tweendecks and " break out " our hammocks in sepulchral twilight . From ten to twelve I stand a watch on the bridge that night . It is ticklish business , this steaming in column on a none too clear night with " ships dark . " The next ahead , usually a giddy amusement park of lights , shows two pin points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By those inconsiderable beacons we must navigate . Five hundred yards is the appointed interval , a distance we can cover , at the day 's standard speed , in two minutes ; and the next ahead , very much occupied with " keeping station " her five hundred yards behind the flagship , changes speed with irritating persistency . The " next ahead " is always a frolicsome individual , who keeps you guessing out of ? the officer of the watch is convinced of it ? pure malevolence . Now a battleship is a ponderous object that stores up a disconcerting amount of momentum and lets it go reluctantly . Two battleships two minutes apart are between them ? even if they 're a dozen years old ? worth a million or so . So and therefore and accordingly , the officer of the watch on such a cheerful occasion as this here crucial night of the great war game has a nervous time of it ? and the executive officer prowling about the bridge and the captain standing detached and impartial in a corner do not help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventive processes of the admiral which send the column chasing its tail in successive ciro4es like a kittenish sea serpent . But the gods are good to us , and we make much better weather of it than the next astern , who comes stealing up on our starboard quarter to give us the time o ' night and to earn our heartfelt contempt . We are keeping station behind the most vagarious ship in the navy , and why ca n't she , with us , steadiest and most reliable of them all , as " next ahead ? " So the end of the watch comes at last ; and the hammock underneath the open hatch is just as welcome as tho there were no next ahead to perplex , no next astern to annoy , no flagship to distract , no enemy to look out for . Morning comes ; and general quarters drags us from breakfast to our cavernous battle stations ; and rumors of the enemy slip down the hatchway ; and long , long after we go on deck to find Red Fleet in ofensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sunk , the umpire ship has condescended to reveal . So Red Fleet goes off about its business , and we steam on to Hampton Roads . The fo'castle explains profanely and at length just where our admiral had made his blunder . The volunteers wonder what the game was all about , and even the officers confess that they do n't know and wo n't find out until the War College has chewed it over and digested it and written a volume or two to prove what everybody ? in the fo'castle ? knew before and could have told ' em if they 'd only asked him . Thus went the cruise , and so it ended . A pleasant time was had by all . We know a lot better than we did what the navy is , how it does its job , and some of the things it needs to prepare it to do that job as it must be done . It was worth the doing , and is worth the doing again . May the department learn as much from this cruise as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its blindnesses ? trying as they were to all concerned ? could not spoil the cruise . May they profit by them next time . Then we 'll all go again .
