txt By his speech in the Chamber yesterday Premier Clemenceau not only secured the largest majority received since he took office , but immensely strengthened , strong as It was before , the position of his Ministry in the country . The " tiger " was at his best , and his personal triumph was enormous . At one and the same time he crushed the Socialist-pacifist opposition , proclaimed the intention of the present Government not to interfere with reasonable liberty of the press , and again proclaimed to the world that France was beyond doubt united in the resolve to continue the war to the bitter end .. The debate arose on an interpellation designed to fix the responsibility of M. Painleva , the former Premier , for the extraordinary delay in handing to the court-martial in the Bolo case certain vital documents . The debate would have been confined to this question had not the Socialist leader , Renaudel , unlucky moment given M. Clemenceau an opening by challenging him to accept responsibility for recent severe attacks which have been made on the Socialist Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounded to the tribune with all the vigor of a man thirty years younger . " You pose as great advocates of liberty , " he said , addressing the Socialists , " but during the last three years you have acquired too easily the habit of being protected by the censor , while your adversaries ? " The House was quick to seize the atlusion to the state of affairs which existed during Malvy 's long tenure as Cailiaux 's nominee in the Ministry of the Interior , when the Socialist and Radical Socialist journals enjoyed unusual liberty of discussion while Clemenceau 's own bitingly critical articles calling on the Government to end Boloism were suppressed with astonishing frequency . The conclusion of the Premier 's sentence was drowned in a burst of applause from all but the Left of the Chamber . " If you want a Government that will stop such campaigns , choose one that 's not mine , " was his uncompromising retort . Then the veteran statesman went on to lay down afresh his policy for France in regard to the war . The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cry of : " We are betrayed , " and at that time the guillotine was working on the Place de la Concorde . France was not using the guillotine , but was making war , and at the same time safeguarding liberty , and the Republic and his Government intended to continue this policy . Alluding to the Socialist charge that he was a bourgeois and an enemy of the working classes , M. Clemenceau observed that the hands of Renaudel and Albert Thomas were no more horny than his own , as they also were members of tile middle class , although they posed as leaders of the working class and excommunicated him as a bourgeois . " The truth is , " he said , ? turning to the Socialists , " you , find nothing to bite when you attack this Government and you can only snap your jaws in anger . " Then addressing the country- at large , he went on : " There is only one thing to do , and that is to get on with the war and nothing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I shall continue the war to the last quarter of an hour , for the last quarter of an hour will be ours . " Frantic applause from all otlr parties in the House emphasized this statement , and it continued until the Socialists were driven to proclaim that they , too , were as little anxious as the rest of the country for peace at any price . " Then , " flasher : Clemenceau , " why are you always discussing whether or not you wilt vote further credits for the war ? Let those who intend to vote against further wan creaits vote against me . " The Premier left . the tribune amid thunderous applause , and on this direct and unmistakable challenge a resolution of confidence in the Government was voted by 400 against 75 , the minority being composed almost entirety of the Socialist extreme Left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that Prance is firmly resolved on pushing the war to a , victorious finish
