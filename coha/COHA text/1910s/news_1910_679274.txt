txt It was only a few days ago that Representative Eugene N. Foss , the Democratic Governor-elect of Massachusetts , celebrated his first anniversary as a Democrat . Yet the words that came most readily to his lips to-day were the Democratic battle cries , such as " tariff revision . " . " I am a manufacturer , and I was virtually driven into public life by my business experiences , " explained Mr. Foss to the correspondent of THE NEw Yong Trams . " I fought for nine long years within the ranks of the Republican Party , to which I pledged my faith for the ' reforms in our fiscal policy , for which I am now doing battle from beyond the breastworks . It is going to be a fight to the finish , too . " Mr. Foss said this with a snap of his jaws to emphasize that he was in dead earnest It was not in the sedate surroundings of a law office , from which so many men of political prominence have emerged into public life , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is Treasurer and manager that the correspondent found him . The Governor-elect is a big man of strong build and ruddy complexion . He has some very definite ideas regarding what sort of an administration Massachusetts requires at this juncture . ' Past Legislatures have passed much of their time legislating along strongly humanitarian but in many instances wholly ineffective lines . Mr. Foss intends to give his State a business administration , once he exchanges his seat in the House of Representatives for the Governor 's chair . He win bend his best endeavors toward the " industrial and commercial uplift " of the State . State to Pay for Campaigns . He is going to recommend in his message one reform , to be sure , which does not come within that field and which will prove a distinct novelty This has to do ' With the election system . " I want to drive money out of politics , " he said . " I believe the State should assume all the expenses of election , Including those new legitimately incurred by oaddidates. - and the latter should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only way in which the poor man can meet the rich man on equal ground as a candidate for public office . " Discussing the campaign which resulted in his election and the defeat of all the other candidates on the Democratic State ticket , he said it was probably more strenuous even than the carapaign in New York . " Our campaign here wastought on National issues for the city , " said Mr. Foss , " though the Republicans attempted to inject some trumped-up State issues in order to divert the attention of the voters from the vital question involved . The issues in the State campaign were identical with those on which I fought for election to Congress from the Fourteenth District last Spring  --  the high cost of living in its relation to the tariff and to reciprocity . That is what the people in this State were interested in hearing discussed , and that is what made them vote as they did when they went to the polls . Need of Reciprocity . ? " The people of New England are very much interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand that the duty he taken off completely from all raw materials  --  and with raw materials I include coal . iron , lumber , wood ... pulp , and every product that is a factor in industry . We are going to take the advanced ground here that all such duties should he taken off even if Canada fails to reduce its duties . This as an earnest of our good faith . Canada has a triple tariff arrangement under which she automatically must meet our reductions . I am in favor of reducing the tariff on manufactured articles to the same level as Canada . Our schedules are twice as - high as hers , and under this system the manufacturers of Massachusetts are suffering from the lack of cheap- raw materials which Canada could supply in abundance . " " - How would New York State and the commercial interests of New York City come out under the reciprocity system ? " he was asked . " New York would benefit with the rest of the country ; your State would get its share of what would be a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States took the initiative and Canada should fail to respond at once . would not the home markets suffer without any compensation in the way of markets for American goods in Canada ? " " You do not believe for a minute . " exclaimed Mr. Foss. " that the producing capacity of 7.000.000 people . the population of Canada . people of our own race . with the same blood coursing through their veins and with much the same standard of living at that . could he a menace if pitted against the producing capacity of a Nation of uo.ono are ? Why , ore State in our ' Union  --  Pennsylvania .. for instance  --  nroduces as much in a year as all of Canada . " Mr. ' Foss said that after the election of Premier Laurier on the reciprocity issue and the cold reception he got from the " standnat . crowd " in Washington when he came to the lehltinnal capital in the interest of reciprocity . Canada . - through a concerted effort , had found marl , ets andsucceeder ) in fostering by artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hut which worked tremendous damage to the United States in the markets abroad . Protection Game O ? reenlcred . " I am a protectionist " he went are " but I am a reasonable protectionist , and I do not - believe in a policy which will drive Sano.nottoeo across the Canadian border to foster industries which now compete with us in the foreign markets and will end by competing with us in our own markets at home . " " But wo n't the protective tariff be a guarantee for American supremacy in Amerienn markets ? " asked the correspondent ? Tf we are going to protect our markets . " Air . Foss replied . " we must al'ways hear in mind that there are two kinds of rhafirets to protect  --  one the domestic . the other the foreign . One is as important as the other , and . if anything , the foreign markets are the more , valuable . Our industries here have assumed such Dronortiors that in all staple articles we can supply the domestic-market by keening our factories going eight months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with our as-nosh-it:weep and the many mouths they have to feed in the remaining four mocths if through a short-sighted standpat policy we are driven out of the ; foreign markets as the result of retaliation rather than the natural competition that we are abundantly able to meet ? " We have overplayed the protectionist game ? we have played it to the limit , arid we have got all we ever are going to get out of it . Now we must change our fiscal policy for our own . protection . We are to-day where England was seventy-five years ago , when her corn laws were repealed . I do know that-we have got to have reciprocity right away , and I firmly believe that we will end by becoming the greatest free-trade Nation on the face of the earth . " " Would not the higher standards of living in this country militate against such a policy ? " " I do not think so , " was the reply . " The price of all food products must come down first  --  all the products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this done , I believe we will have all the nations in the world at our mercy when we choose to go after them in the fields of trade and industry . We are the greatest producers , we have the greatest natural resources , the most highly developed . Inventive skill , and the most resourceful and skillful mechanics in the world . " Free Trade for AU America . Mr. Foss said the beginning should be made by establishing a system of absolutely free trade on the American continent as the only means by which this country could get her carrying trade back . 1 " Why , the protected interests of Massachusetts at this very moment are crying out for protection against the protective system which has fostered them , " exI claimed the Governor-elect . " We are responsible for every high tariff in the world ; we blazed the way , and now we are taking our medicine , and we will keep on taking it until we have settled the i tariff question right . Industry in this country has fallen off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AldrichPayne Tariff bill . Why ? Because every one engaged in industry knows that the question involved has not been settled right and must be reopened . Consequently , everybody is buying from hand to mouth . Consequently , also , the business men of the country have lost their confidence in the Republican Party . One very serious trouble is that where we could have settled this thing right without any disturbance of business a few years ago , when the country was at the height of prosperity , if the standpat crowd had hot been in the way , we may not be axle , to bring about the change without a jar in our present condition . " " What do you believe has brought about the reduction in foodstuffs reported during the last few days ? " was asked . " To my mind it is due to a gradual falling off in the demand for such products at the present high prices , " he replied . " The men who have control of the food market simply are acting on the well-known business principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchaser 's resources will permit him to Pay . " " Do you look for a Democratic victory in 1912 ' 1 " " I can see nothing else . " said Mr. Foss . " What is left of the Republican Party will line up under the leadership of some radical , and the drift of the conservatives toward the Democratic Party will continue . It is a growing movement , as we demonstrated in this State . In my own Congressional district I received 1,500 more votes as a , candidate for Governor than I did as a candidate for Congress a few months ago . I do not believe the factions in the Republican Party can ever get together . A readjustment of party lines is in progress right now , and in this process I believe that we will not only hold the Republican votes that came to us in ' the last election , but will win over more . " Democrats Have Opportunity . " Do you believe that - the Democratic Party will rise to the situation ? " " Now , that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is no doubt that the party stands face to face with the greatest opportunity in all its history . In order to make good , however , we must go in noii only for the wiping out of evils fostered under Republican rule , but for a sharply defined and safely progressive constructive policy . It is not enough to merely tear down the tariff wall ; we must put something in its place . " " And what would you suggest as ' a substitute ? " " As a manufacturer , I would advocate as a first step In the programme the establishment of reciprocal relations with rnreign countries as a middle ground between ultra protectionism and absolute free trade . What I mean is that we should apply in our fiscal policy a principle which recognizes that in certain lines other nations may be able to supply something better and cheaper than we can ever hope to  --  the principle that we should not foster at great expense industries foretell to our climate and our conditions . " He specified the hemp industry , the sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as among ' he activities which this country might well turn its back en . " Take hemp , for instance , " he said . " It grows with a tremendous strain on the soil , and when it is harvested not a particle of it goes back to the soil to enrich it . Besides , it requires manual farming . That may be well enough abroad , but we are not gauged that way . The farming natural to this country is farming with machinery and on a large scale . We could -9 ? ell afford to import these products from abroad . Broadly speaking , we should seek to bring about in our trade relations with foreign countries the same comity that now exists between the different States in the Union . " Not to Wait on Tariff Board . 1 " Do you believe President Taft will urge upon the present Congress any changes in the tariff as a result of investigation made by the Tariff Commission ? " " Oh , he may do something , " said the Governor-elect , " but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in no mood to wait for its reports . The first thing for us to do is to kick out all the graft of the present schedules and get back to old-fashioned honesty . Then iwe can create a new commission with real powers and settle down to a scientific readjustment of the tariff . " The inevitable recurrence to reciprocity ? which is the Governor-elect 's hobby  --  occurred when THE Trams correspondent i asked what he intended to do with referI ence to the question of conservation of the natural resources of the State . This will be one of the leading topics of discussion at the conference of Governors , which is to be held in Frankfort , Ky. , next month . Governor-elect Foss and all the other newly elected Governors have I been invited to attend . ? i " I have very strong views on the subof conservation , " said the Governor- ! ject elect . " We have made a very late begin ! ning here . Just now we are seeking to ! - acquire " for the State for reforestration : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White Mountains which has already been devastated by the lumber and pulp interests . I will do all I can to aid those efforts . " ! " But here again . " he added , in an after I , thought . " the subject of reciprocity ' forces itself upon us . If we had reciprocity ' with Canada we , ' would teas on " wood . frOra ikortiSsith%i 1-iorrler gay. , " emi . roregtA. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - , ? The , !

Shelving of Lodge Comes Firsts The Governor-elect was asked what Wag the most important question before the people of the State . " The shelving of United States Senator Lodge , " he replied , sharply . " To leave him in his present position would be to nullify what progress toward better government we have made . " The commercial and industrial uplift of Massachusetts will be one of my chief concerns . This city is the metropolitan centre not only of New Engiand , but of Canada as , well . It is the nearest port south of the Dominion that dues not freeze up during the 1s , inter months , and it is 20o miles nearer Europe than any Canadian port .

I shall strive to have measures enacted mak.ng for the upbuilding of : every harbor through construction of great docks , either under State auspices FOSS AGAINST DELAY ? , or under municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harbor them . " Mr. Foss also will recommend to the Legislature appropriations for the building of canals to distribute raw materials at lower cost than can be done by using the railroads to the various industrial , centres of the Bay State . One part of his plan , in this direction contemplates the deepening of the Merrimac : aver to render that waterway navigable as far as Lowell and Lawrence , both busy manufacturing centres . Mr. Foss will go to Washington for the short session of Congress , and will resign his seat in the Houe of Representatives in time to assume his Gubernatorial duties on the 1st of January .
