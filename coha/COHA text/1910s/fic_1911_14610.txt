THE summer moonlight flowing through a large French balcony window at the right discloses the dim outlines of a curious , clover-shaped studio . A door , which one learns opens upon a stairway is faintly seen at the back . The light from a lamp upon a mantelpiece near a bedroom door , at the left , suggests more clearly the interesting collection of prints and curios placed along the wall . Some bookcases are noticed amid the strange mlange of tasteful if somewhat eccentric furniture . At a table near the window , ARLISS is seated writing persistently . His cigar has gone out , and as he pauses to relight it , one observes that he is tall , almost emaciated , and past the meridian of life . His dark , deep-set , inquiring eyes seem the only thing alive about his sallow , ascetic face . His thin , sensitive lips are bloodless through continual compression , and his high distinguished forehead is lined by a heavy shock of black hair . When he speaks it is obvious he phrases self-consciously . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are long and nervous , really conscious of the things they touch . He continues under apparent inspiration for some time ; the clock striking four finally interrupts him . He looks up , realizing it is late . He glances out of the window as though awaiting somebody , looks up at a stone gargoyle projecting outside , half grunts to himself , then searches among his papers and finds a telegram which he rereads for reassurance . The faint ring of a bell is heard . He starts up toward the door at the back , but hesitates and goes to the window instead . CRAIG ARLISS ( Calling out ) Vaughan ! Vaughan ! At last ! Wait ; I 'll throw the key . An old habit , eh ? ( He takes a key off the table and throws it from the window . ) There , right before you . You have n't forgotten the trick of that door ? ( He takes the lamp from the table and goes up to the door at the back , opening it , and stepping outside on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Close it . Be careful of that turn . Seventh step . I 'm always stumbling over it myself . ( A slight pause . ARLISS comes into the room as VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE enters . ARLISS lifts the lamp high , and the two men face each other in its light . Another pause . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE , still in his early thirties , of handsome if somewhat underlined features , gives indication , through a certain marked unkemptness , of the same native refinement of birth and sensibilities . ARLISS calmly offers his hand . VAUGHAN does not take it. ) p. 3 VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE We are alone ? CRAIG ARLISS Quite . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Still at the door ) The servants ? CRAIG ARLISS Are evils I am compelled to tolerate only in the daytime . ( VAUGHAN sighs in relief , and enters the room . ARLISS closes the door and comes down slowly to the telegram . ) You said it was something " important . " VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE I came straight from the train . CRAIG ARLISS Oh , do n't apologize ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Referring to manuscript . ) Poor creatures ! They 're having a hard time Oh , pardon , and your luggage ? VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE I 've brought none . I 'm not going to stay . CRAIG ARLISS ( Enigmatically ) Then you have n't reached the bottom yet . ( Pause . ) I never persuade . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE I hardly think you will be able to , this time . CRAIG ARLISS Your room has always been waiting for you these  --  let me see  --  it 's two years , is n't it ? p. 4 VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE In time , yes . CRAIG ARLISS Whenever you are ready you can take up your old life . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE My old life , ha ! ha ! I 'd have to be the same person I was , would n't I ? CRAIG ARLISS I accept the correction . Your new life dating from to-day . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Sarcastically ) Have you advice to give me about that , too ? CRAIG ARLISS Not precisely ; but I might hazard a guess , though , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Surprised ) That is still open to me ? Even after these last two years ? CRAIG ARLISS ( Lighting a cigar ) Certainly . Old Gambrill understands , too . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Understands ? CRAIG ARLISS Yes . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Grimly ) I wonder . ( He walks up and down . ) CRAIG ARLISS Maturity is only mental vanity , eh ? But this is a good chance for you , Vaughan . I 'm not much on business affairs , yet I think your father would have approved . It 's  --  I have it here ; I only remember moods , never facts . ( He takes up a memorandum . ) Twenty-five hundred at the start  --  six months ' travel  --  ' rikshas , mules , and so forth  --  hard work , but full of color , I should think  --  stimulating , shoulder-rubbing  --  p. 5 VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Crossing close to him ) Do you know where I 've come from ? CRAIG ARLISS Yes . From the Devil . You went to shake his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , and regretfully sent you back to earth . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Bitingly ) Something made me come to you . CRAIG ARLISS ( Covertly watching the younger man , measuring him , and purposely drawing him out ) I have been expecting you for many weeks . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE I said nothing about coming in my letters . You received them all ? CRAIG ARLISS Every one of them . It was good of you to number them as I suggested . In spite of your bad handwriting , I followed you in great detail day by day . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Why did n't you answer them ? CRAIG ARLISS I sent my card and a check . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Do you know why I took your money ? CRAIG ARLISS The answer is obvious . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE I took it because I despised you . p. 6 CRAIG ARLISS That 's splendid psychology . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Oh , you can sneer at me now . But how could you  --  how could you keep sending it to me ? How could you let me go on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing interested me . I was always glad to hear . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Glad ? CRAIG ARLISS Yes . Even after your letters came , so eagerly awaited , I sharpened my pleasure by placing them on the bookcase  --  there . All day they would cry out to me , but never till night did I release their tumbling words . Then , under the black mantle , I lived with you gloriously through it all . For to me your letters meant experience  --  sensation . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE So that was why you did it ? CRAIG ARLISS Alone in my chair I felt the quick rush of your life . My lips bled with your wine , my ears burned with your music , and the rouge of your women rubbed my cheeks . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Bitterly ) And I paid . I lived it . I suffered  --  while you sat comfortably alone in your chair . Ha ! ha ! CRAIG ARLISS ( Half to himself ) That was the only way I could do it . p. 7 VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE So I earned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was burning the wick that you might see . I was material  --  copy . Oh , I might have guessed , for I heard you say once : " Creation sprang from suffering . " CRAIG ARLISS And you very rightly deduce it is generally somebody else who pays . We artists who justify ourselves forget that . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE I 've paid long enough . I did n't come to take up my life nor Gambrill 's offer , but for a settlement with you  --  an accounting . CRAIG ARLISS The money was not enough ? VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE No . You must give me back something you have taken from me . CRAIG ARLISS What ? VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Earnestly ) My ideals . CRAIG ARLISS ( Startled ) Ideals ? Brave images in the sand until a wave has kissed them . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE My self-respect . CRAIG ARLISS The vainest of all vanities . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE My purity , my sense of honor , my dreams . You must give them back to me . I want my faith in things again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  empty . I have nothing left . p. 8 CRAIG ARLISS But disgust . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Yes , disgust . CRAIG ARLISS ( Emphatically ) And something else . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE What else ? Only pain  --  pain in my heart for every living thing that breathes . CRAIG ARLISS That 's it . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Yes ; down in the depths I 've wept for all the sins of the world , for I 've been part of them all . I 've felt the thrill of the thief and the hate of the beggar , for I , too , in my bitterness , have felt the impelling impulse , and when the impulse was born my judgment died . God ! Do n't you see I 've lost my sense of right and wrong ? I 'm stripped  --  stripped ! ( He sinks bitterly , burying his head in his arms . ) CRAIG ARLISS Are n't your phrases a bit overseasoned ? That 's my literary prerogative , which they tell me , I always use . Come now , are n't you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You shall take me seriously ; you shall see I 'm in earnest . I 'm not a youth any longer , but a man with life washed out of him . You are responsible  --  do you hear ?  --  for what I am . I was beginning to find myself , to argue myself out of it  --  beginning to kill my grief . The right word from you would have saved me  --  but you made me go out into the world , knowing the kind of life I would lead , encouraging me in it . And now I 've come back for an accounting . ( He comes closer with great earnestness . ) Give me back what I 've lost . Can you ? Give it back , all of it , for I 'm dead without it , and it is you alone who have killed me ; and you must answer  --  first . ( He slowly draws a pistol from his pocket. ) p. 9 CRAIG ARLISS ( Enthusiastically ) I have saved you  --  I have . Now you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you see , Vaughan , what I 've kept for you , what I 've given you , too ; do n't you see it ? VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( After a pause ) I suppose you think I will halt because I do not understand . CRAIG ARLISS ( With great earnestness ) If I do not make you understand , you must do to me as you intended to . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Must ? CRAIG ARLISS Yes ; for if I had destroyed all in you I should demand it . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Hesitating , then putting the pistol upon the table ) Well ? CRAIG ARLISS ( Vigorously ) Where is your strength , your conviction ? I sha n't respect your intention if you are so easily turned from it . ( VAUGHAN reaches for the pistol . ARLISS covers it . ) It 's not death I 'm afraid of , but life . It would solve my problem and not help yours . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Pointing sarcastically to the manuscript ) You talk like one of your characters . p. 10 CRAIG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different attitudes toward life . ( VAUGHAN drops the pistol on the table . There is a pause while ARLISS fingers it . ) This has flashed like the proverbial symbol between us . Give it to me of your own free will , and I shall know that you take up Gambrill 's offer and start with your head high and your manhood sure . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Savagely ) There is no use . I tell you I have no will left , only impulse . CRAIG ARLISS ( Quickly ) Then I 'll meet your spasmodic melodrama halfway . I 'll gamble with you for that pistol and all it means . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Gamble ? Ha ! ha ! How ? By " matching " miseries like pennies ? CRAIG ARLISS That just describes it . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Is this some scene from your new novel ? CRAIG ARLISS It 's a bit too real and too unnatural . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE A few moments can not alter my intention . ( He sits down . ) CRAIG ARLISS ( With force ) You must resent every word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yourself . Then only will you be convinced that what I did for you was right . p. 11 VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Then you do acknowledge it was deliberate ? That with a purpose you sent me out to be what I was , to become what I am ? CRAIG ARLISS Yes , deliberate . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Why ? CRAIG ARLISS There was a chance that way . Otherwise , you might have become  --  VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Sarcastically )  --  a famous novelist , a great success ; " one of the mountain peaks , " they call you . CRAIG ARLISS The mountain peaks are lonely . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE As if loneliness were hard ! CRAIG ARLISS My sort of loneliness is . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Who 's melodramatic now ? CRAIG ARLISS Hear me out . Will you change places with me ? I would take your life gladly , stripped and naked as you think it is , if you could take up mine , full as it seems to you . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE I suppose I ought to ask you to  --  CRAIG ARLISS  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it may seem , I was young once . p. 12 VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Bitterly ) Like me ; I know that beginning . Go on CRAIG ARLISS And I soon made the astonishing discovery that the easiest way to avoid the petty worries of life was to deny their reality . Instead of absorbing them , I squeezed them out of my daily living . I  --  I  --  VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE But what has this to  --  CRAIG ARLISS Wait . I did n't realize the tyranny of this comfortable habit until I faced the first conscious climax of my life . ( Stops in recollection : VAUGHAN becomes interested . ) Why drape the fact and bury it beneath pretty flowers ? My heart was pounded by the tiny fists of a woman . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( With impulsive sympathy ) You , too ? I never knew . CRAIG ARLISS How beautifully your pity leaped toward me in spite of yourself ! I like that . You are real . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE I know what it is . Was it the same sort of thing as mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart was broken too ? CRAIG ARLISS ( With deep conviction ) No ; if it only had been ! p. 13 VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Incredulously ) If it only had been ? CRAIG ARLISS Yes . But I would n't let it  --  I would n't . To kill the pain which was ready to flow into every fiber of my being , I shot my mind through it . It became something I had imagined , something I had read or written ; for I simply and deliberately and cruelly denied its reality . It was born dead . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE But that was strength . CRAIG ARLISS That was cowardice . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Cowardice ? How do you know ? CRAIG ARLISS By the punishment which lurked in the reaction . I found I had no longer the power to keep real any feeling I wanted to feel . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Puzzled ) But you did not cease to feel ? CRAIG ARLISS No , only I felt differently . I felt through my mind . In other words , I felt self-consciously . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , my emotional life became something apart from me , something I watched and guided  --  something which always knew I watched and guided . I never forgot how I should feel , only it was emotion parented by my mind and my sense of the situation  --  never directly , by the stimulus itself . I still had red blood that would leap to red lips , but there was thought in my kiss . I still had eyes that would weep , but no tear fell from its own weight of sadness . p. 14 VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Thoughtfully ) That recalls  --  CRAIG ARLISS I could not accept from the unsuspecting world either praise or blame for my actions , because I questioned the motives which prompted them . What days and nights they were as I sat alone beginning to doubt my own sincerity ! There is no misery you have tasted greater than that . Was I sincere ? I wormed my life with that question . I could n't dodge that . And to myself I was soon forced to acknowledge I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Incredulously ) But could n't you do anything ? CRAIG ARLISS I fought against it . How I tried to be as real to myself as I seemed to others ! But in every action , every word , every look which sprang so self-consciously from me , I saw ( Pointing quickly to the shadow on the floor cast by the gargoyle outside ) I saw a gargoyle leer its relentless question : " Are you sincere ? " Then I resolved to crush its thick lips , to escape forever from my own mind , for once to abandon myself to a life of the senses  --  a life without thought  --  to feel without question gloriously and nakedly , to become an elemental being who could react properly , without indirection , from every stimulus  --  who could touch and be burned  --  who could be cut and bleed  --  who could suffer pain  --  p. 15 VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Eagerly ) Then , what did you do ? CRAIG ARLISS I threw myself into a woman 's life . I stifled each cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went on and on with words , gestures , tears , and sighs , furrowing over the same roads and highways seeking this new heart . But when her love paused and her calm eyes claimed mine in return , I found all I really had to give her was the same conscious lack of sincerity . I had not changed . It had been too late . I had become an emotional hypocrite with nothing real about the things I knew I said so prettily . And when I looked at her  --  horror-stricken , I saw I had burned her fires to ashes . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE You ruined her life ? CRAIG ARLISS Absolutely . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE How terrible ! CRAIG ARLISS How damnable ! ( During the long pause which follows , the dawn gently tints the room . The clock strikes the hour of five . ) After that nothing remained for me but to become impersonal  --  to soil no other life with my thin fingers  --  to give nothing  --  to seek nothing  --  to get nothing  --  to be emotionally alone , detached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant by loneliness . p. 16 CRAIG ARLISS Yes . One reality was left : my imagination , my characters , my creations . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE And other people 's letters . CRAIG ARLISS Yes . Your life in them was real to me because it was not mine . ( Softly ) So you see , when it comes to " matching miseries , " as you call it , I  --  VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Almost tenderly ) I see you are not so happy as I thought . CRAIG ARLISS ( Looking at him cautiously and feeling his way ) But you understand why ? VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Yes . CRAIG ARLISS Only the more intuitive than you would have grasped this without living it . You understand by an instinct ; because it is an emotional echo . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Half mysteriously ) Where before have I  --  CRAIG ARLISS Back before the dawn of your new life  --  you yourself felt it . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Recalling ) That 's so  --  that 's so . That 's what kept me spellbound listening ; it seemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  p. 17 CRAIG ARLISS Before I sent you out in the world . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Excitedly ) No , no ; you 're baffling me with your subtleties . You 're trying to confuse me ; to make me forget why I 've come . But I have n't forgotten . ( Pointing towards the pistol . ) You have n't convinced me I should alter my intention  --  for what has all this to do with me ? I 'm not that way now . Thank God , I 'm not like you . But answer me  --  why did you send me out ? CRAIG ARLISS ( Clearly and emphatically ) To save you from becoming what I am . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Almost dazed with the idea ) Would I have become  --  ? CRAIG ARLISS Yes . I am the logical end of what in you was only a tendency . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE But are you sure ? CRAIG ARLISS ( Indignantly ) Only my sureness excuses my conduct . I had one chance to save myself  --  when my grief first struck me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then only , in that molding moment . You were like me in all things . I saw you were killing your grief as I did , letting your awakening literary sense master and direct your emotions  --  dodging the pain of it all . I could n't let you come to my end  --  to my civilized soul misery . So I took the risk to make you what you are now , and I sent you out to find yourself , as you have , in the mud and in the elemental . p. 18 VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE But you 've failed  --  I 'm ruined , anyway . CRAIG ARLISS No , no . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Yes , yes . You 've saved me from one thing to toss me to another . You have no right to play with a human life . I ca n't forgive you . I must still claim my accounting . You 've shown me your emptiness , but look at mine . You 've shown me what you 've saved me from , but what have you given me instead ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not . Everything except my fame , which I have bought by losing all you have . ( He speaks with exaltation . ) This dawn is yours , but not mine ; you have drowned your grief in its colors . The paths of day and night are yours , but not mine , for over them you have dragged your pain . You 've soaked the world with your tears ; the world has become yours . But nothing is mine . You are the humanity about you ; you own its blood , its sweat , and its heartbeat . I own nothing . You 've bought them for all time by feeling them properly , by feeling them sincerely . For that I 'd give all my fame  --  just to be able to feel without self-consciousness  --  to feel as you , only because I felt . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Spiritually moved ) Yes , yes ; what you say must be true . I felt it out there , but it lay in my heart seeking a voice . Your words have let something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given me  --  the world ! p. 19 CRAIG ARLISS I staked all that I might make you see . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE I do now . ( Enthusiastically ) But in speaking like this , you 've given the lie unto yourself . You 've given me a release ; it is my turn to give you yours . CRAIG ARLISS You ca n't  --  you ca n't . Nobody can free me from myself . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE I can . You 've been living with a false idea of yourself . You 're not what you think you are . You say you do n't feel ! Why , you , too , are thrilling still with the words you 've given me . They are you , you , you ! CRAIG ARLISS ( With grief ) No , I was only feeling in your place . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE But you say you do n't suffer . You are suffering now ! CRAIG ARLISS ( Sinking into a chair ) I suffer only because I do not suffer properly . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE ( Looking at him awed ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All " actors " pay it , once they honestly understand themselves . And we all act so . VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE Actors ! If you have n't changed from what you were , you must be acting now . ( ARLISS starts . ) Have you assumed these attitudes to save yourself from my intention ? ( Aggressively ) Have you spoken because you felt it , or because you knew it was the thing to say ? p. 20 CRAIG ARLISS ( With deep pain ) But you are convinced that what I did for you  --  VAUGHAN BLAKESLEE No ! I ca n't be unless I know you are sincere . ( ARLISS winces . VAUGHAN leans towards him across the table . ) Tell me , have you been sincere with me ? Are you sincere now ? CRAIG ARLISS ( Almost pitifully ) Wo n't you show me that you believe I am ? Wo n't you please let me feel I am sincere  --  just for once ? ( He looks at VAUGHAN , who , after a pause , with a look of pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly , sunk deep in his chair. )
