SCENE  --  Mammy Saunders ' bedroom in a house just off of Carmine Street , New York City . The left of the room , forward , is taken up by a heavy , old-fashioned wooden bedstead with a feather mattress . A gaudy red-and-yellow quilt covers the other bedclothes . In back of the bed , a chest of drawers placed against the left wall . On top of the chest , a small lamp . A rocking-chair stands beside the head of the bed on the right . In the rear wall , toward the right , a low window with ragged white curtains . In the right corner , a washstand with bowl and pitcher . Bottles of medicine , a spoon , a glass , etc. , are also on the stand . Farther forward , a door opening on the hall and stairway . It is soon after nightfall of a day in early winter . The room is in shadowy half darkness , the only light being a pale glow that seeps through the window from the arc lamp on the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be dimly discerned . The vague outlines of Mammy Saunders ' figure lying in the bed can be seen , and her black face stands out in sharp contrast from the pillows that support her head . MAMMY SAUNDERS  --  ( weakly ) Ceely Ann ! ( with faint querulousness ) Light de lamp , will you ? Hits mighty dark in yere. ( after a slight pause ) Ai n't you dar , Ceely Ann ? ( Receiving no reply she sighs deeply and her limbs move uneasily under the bedclothes . The door is opened and shut and the stooping form of another colored woman appears in the semi-darkness . She goes to the foot of the bed sobbing softly , and stands there evidently making an effort to control her emotion. ) p. 3 MAMMY SAUNDERS Dat you , Ceely Ann ? CEELY ( huskily ) Hit ai n't no yuther , Mammy . MAMMY SAUNDERS Light de lamp , den . I ca n't see no whars . CEELY Des one second till I finds a match . ( She wipes her eyes with her handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around on the top of it  --  pretending to grumble ) Hit beat all how dem pesky little sticks done hide umse'fs . Shoo ! Yere dey is . ( She fumbles with the lamp . ) MAMMY SAUNDERS ( suspiciously ) You ai n't been cryin ' , is you ? CEELY ( with feigned astonishment ) Cryin ' ? I clar ' ter goodness you does git the mos ' fool notions lyin ' dar . MAMMY SAUNDERS ( in a tone of relief ) I mos ' thought I yeard you . CEELY ( lighting the lamp ) ' Deed you ai n't . ( The two women are revealed by the light . Mammy Saunders is an old , white-haired negress about ninety with a weazened face furrowed by wrinkles and withered by old age and sickness . Ceely is a stout woman of fifty or so with grey hair and a round fat face . She wears a loose-fitting gingham dress and a shawl thrown over her head. ) p. 4 CEELY ( with attempted cheeriness ) Bless yo ' soul , I ai n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix you so you 'll rest mo ' easy . ( She lifts the old woman gently and fixes the pillows . ) Dere . Now ai n't you feelin ' better ? MAMMY SAUNDERS ( dully ) My strenk don ' all went . I ca n't lift a hand . CEELY ( hurriedly ) Dat 'll all come back ter you de doctor tole me des now when I goes down to de door with him . ( glibly ) He say you is de mos ' strongest ' oman fo ' yo ' years ever he sees in de worl ' ; and he tell me you gwine ter be up and walkin ' agin fo ' de week 's out . ( As she finds the old woman 's eyes fixed on her she turns away confusedly and abruptly changes the subject . ) Hit ai n't too wo 'm in dis room , dat 's a fac ' . MAMMY SAUNDERS ( shaking her head  --  in a half whisper ) No , Ceely Ann . Hit ai n't no use'n you tellin ' me nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ En I knows hit 's on'y wid de blessin ' er God I kin las ' de night out . CEELY ( distractedly ) Ai n't no sich a thing ! Hush yo ' noise Mammy ! MAMMY SAUNDERS ( as if she had n't heard  --  in a crooning sing-song ) I'se gwine soon fum dis wicked yearth  --  and may de Lawd have mercy on dis po ' ole sinner. ( after a pause  --  anxiously ) All I'se prayin ' fer is dat God don ' take me befo ' I sees Dreamy agin . Whar 's Dreamy , Ceely Ann ? Why ai n't he come yere ? Ai n't you done sent him word I'se sick like I tole you ? p. 5 CEELY I tole dem boys ter tell him speshul , and dey swar dey would soon 's dey find him . I s'pose dey ai n't kotch him yit . Don ' you pester yo'se'f worryin ' . Dreamy ' ull come fo ' ve'y long .

You git a wink er sleep en I wake you when he comes , you heah me ? MAMMY SAUNDERS ( faintly ) I does feel mighty drowsy . ( She closes her eyes . Ceely goes over to the window and pulling the curtains aside stands looking down into the street as if she were watching for someone coming . A moment later there is a noise of footfalls from the stairs in the hall , followed by a sharp rap on the door . ) CEELY ( turning quickly from the window ) Ssshh ! Ssshh ! ( She hurries to the door , glancing anxiously toward Mammy . The old woman appears to have fallen asleep . Ceely cautiously opens the door a bare inch or so and peeks out . When she sees who it is she immediately tries to slam it shut again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Irene pushes her way defiantly into the room . She is a young , good-looking negress , highly rouged and powdered , dressed in gaudy , cheap finery. ) p. 6 IRENE ( in a harsh voice  --  evidently worked up to a great state of nervous excitement ) No you do n't , Ceely Ann ! I said I was comin ' here and it 'll take mo 'n you to stop me ! CEELY ( almost speechless with horrified indignation  --  breathing heavily ) Yo ' bad ' oman ! Git back ter yo ' bad-house whar yo ' b'longs ! IRENE ( raising her clenched hand  --  furiously ) Stop dat talkin ' to me , nigger , or I 'll split yo ' fool head ! ( As Ceely shrinks away Irene lowers her hand and glances quickly around the room . ) Whar 's Dreamy ? CEELY ( scornfully ) Yo ' axe me dat ! Whar 's Dreamy ? Axe yo'se'f . Yo 's de one ought ter know whar he is . IRENE Den he ai n't come here ? CEELY I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . IRENE ( pleadingly ) Tell me , Ceely Ann , ai n't he been here ? He 'd be sure to come here ' count of Mammy dyin ' , dey said . CEELY ( pointing to Mammy  --  apprehensively ) Ssshh ! ( then lowering her voice to a whisper  --  suspiciously ) Dey said ? Who said ? p. 7 IRENE ( equally suspicious ) None o ' your business who said . ( then pleading again ) Ceely Ann , I jest got ter see him dis minute , dis secon ' ! He 's in bad , Dreamy is , and I knows somep'n I gotter tell him , somep'n I jest heard  --  CEELY ( uncomprehendingly ) In bad ? What you jest heah ? IRENE I ai n't tellin ' no one but him .

( proudly ) You ai n't got de right not ter trust me , Ceely , where de Dreamy 's mixed in it . I 'd go ter hell for Dreamy ! CEELY ( indignantly ) Hush yo ' wicked cussin ' ! ( then anxiously ) Is Dreamy in trouble ? IRENE ( with a scornful laugh ) Trouble ? Good Lawd , it 's worser'n dat ! ( then in surprise ) Ai n't you heerd what de Dreamy done last night , Ceely ? p. 8 CEELY ( apprehensively ) What de Dreamy do ? Tell me , gal . Somep'n bad ? IRENE ( with the same scornful laugh ) Bad ? Worser'n bad , what he done ! CEELY ( lamenting querulously ) Oh good Lawd , I knowed it !

Dat ai n't your business . CEELY Oh , I knowed Dreamy 'd be gittin ' in trouble fo ' long ! De lowflung young trash ! An ' here 's his ole Mammy don ' know no dif'frunt but he 's de mos ' innercent young lamb in de worl ' . ( in a strained whisper ) What he do ? Is he been stealin ' somep'n ? IRENE ( angrily ) You go ter hell , Ceely Ann ! You ai n't no fren ' of de Dreamy 's , you talk dat way , and I ai n't got no time ter waste argyin ' wid your fool notions . ( She goes to the door . ) Dreamy 'll go ter his death sho 's yo ' born , if I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 CEELY ( terrified ) Oh Lawd ! IRENE ( anxiously ) He 'll sho'ly try ter come here and see his ole Mammy befo ' she dies , do n't you think , Ceely ? CEELY Fo ' Gawd I hopes so ! She 's been a-prayin ' all de day  --  IRENE ( opening the door ) You hopes so , you fool nigger ! I tells you it 's good-bye to de Dreamy , he come here ! I knows ! I gotter find an ' stop him . If he come here , Ceely , you tell him git out quick and hide , he do n't wanter git pinched . You hear ? You tell him dat , Ceely , for Gawd 's sake ! I'se got ter go  --  find him  --  high an ' low  --  ( She goes out leaving Ceely staring at her in speechless indignation . ) CEELY ( drawing a deep breath ) Yo ' street gal ! I don ' b'lieve one word you says  --  stuffin ' me wid yo ' bad lies so 's you kin keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakes and groans faintly . Ceely hurries over to her bedside . ) Is de pain hurtin ' agin , Mammy ? MAMMY SAUNDERS ( vaguely ) Dat you , Dreamy ? CEELY No , Mammy , dis is Ceely . Dreamy 's comin ' soon . Is you restin ' easy ? p. 10 MAMMY SAUNDERS ( as if she had n't heard ) Dat you , Dreamy ? CEELY ( sitting down in the rocker by the bed and taking one of the old woman 's hands in her 's ) No . Dreamy 's comin ' . MAMMY SAUNDERS ( after a pause  --  suddenly ) Does you ' member yo ' dead Mammy , chile ? CEELY ( mystified ) My dead Mammy ? MAMMY SAUNDERS Didn ' I heah yo ' talkin ' jest now , Dreamy ? CEELY ( very worried ) I clar ter goodness , she don ' know me ary bit . Dis is Ceely Ann talkin ' ter yo ' , Mammy . MAMMY SAUNDERS Who was yo ' talkin ' wid , Dreamy ? CEELY ( shaking her head  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befo ' de en ' . ( in a louder tone ) Hit was me talkin ' wid a pusson fum ovah de way . She say tell you Dreamy comin ' heah ter see yo ' right away . You heah dat , Mammy ? ( The old woman sighs but does not answer . There is a pause . ) MAMMY SAUNDERS ( suddenly ) Does yo ' ' member yo ' dead Mammy , chile ? ( then with a burst of religious exaltation ) De Lawd have mercy ! p. 11 CEELY ( like an echo ) Bless de Lawd ! ( then in a frightened half-whisper to herself ) Po ' thing ! Her min 's done leavin ' her jest like de doctor said . ( She looks down at the old woman helplessly . The door on the right is opened stealthily and the Dreamy Kid slinks in on tiptoe . ) CEELY ( hearing a board creak , turns quickly toward the door and gives a frightened start ) Dreamy ! DREAMY ( puts his fingers to his lips  --  commandingly ) Ssshh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the door about an inch open , peers out into the hallway in an attitude of tense waiting , one hand evidently clutching some weapon in the side pocket of his coat . After a moment he is satisfied of not being followed , and , after closing the door carefully and locking it , he stands up and walks to the center of the room casting a look of awed curiosity at the figure in the bed . He is a well-built , good looking young negro , light in color . His eyes are shifty and hard , their expression one of tough , scornful defiance . His mouth is cruel and perpetually drawn back at the corner into a snarl . He is dressed in well-fitting clothes of a flashy pattern . A light cap is pulled down on the side of his head. ) p. 12 CEELY ( coming from the bed to meet him ) Bless de Lawd , here you is at las ' ! DREAMY ( with a warning gesture ) Nix on de loud talk ! Talk low , ca n't yuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then continues with a sneer ) Yuh re a fine nut , Ceely Ann ! What for you sendin ' out all ober de town for me like you was crazy ! D'yuh want ter git me in de cooler ? Don ' you know dey 're after me for what I done last night ? CEELY ( fearfully ) I heerd somep'n  --  but  --  what you done , Dreamy ? DREAMY ( with an attempt at a careless bravado ) I croaked a guy , dat 's what ! A white man . CEELY ( in a frightened whisper ) What you mean  --  croaked ? DREAMY ( boastfully ) I shot him dead , dat 's what ! ( as Ceely shrinks away from him in horror  --  resentfully ) Aw say , don ' gim me none o'dem looks o'yourn . ' T'war n't my doin ' nohow . He was de one lookin ' for trouble . I was n't seekin ' for no mess wid him dat I would help . But he tole folks he was gwine ter git me for a fac ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git him ter pertect my own life . ( with cruel satisfaction ) And I got him right , you b'lieve me ! p. 13 CEELY ( putting her hands over her face with a low moan of terror ) May de good Lawd pardon yo ' wickedness ! Oh Lawd ! What yo ' po ole Mammy gwine say if she hear tell  --  an ' she never knowin ' how bad you 's got . DREAMY ( fiercely ) Hell ! You ai n't tole her , is you ? CEELY Think I want ter kill her on the instant ? An ' I didn ' know myse'f  --  what you done  --  till you tells me. ( frightenedly ) Oh , Dreamy , what you gwine do now ? How you gwine git away ? ( almost wailing ) Good Lawd , de perlice gon ' kotch you suah ! DREAMY ( savagely ) Shut yo ' loud mouth , damn yo ' ! ( He stands tensely listening for some sound from the hall . After a moment he points to the bed . ) Is Mammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seems like she is . ( She comes back to him . ) Dat 's de way wid her  --  sleep fo ' a few minutes , den she wake , den sleep agin . DREAMY ( scornfully ) Aw , dere ai n't nothin ' wrong wid her ' ceptin ' she 's ole . What yuh wanter send de word tellin ' me she 's croakin ' , and git me comin ' here at de risk o ' my life , and den find her sleepin ' . ( clenching his fist threateningly ) I gotter mind ter smash yo ' face for playin ' de damn fool and makin ' me de goat . ( He turns toward the door . ) Ai n't no us'en me stayin ' here when dey 'll likely come lookin ' for me . I 'm gwine out where I got ta chance ter make my git-away . De boys is all fixin ' it up for me. ( his hand on the doorknob ) When Mammy wakes , you tell her I could n't wait , you hear ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  pleadingly ) Don ' yo ' go now , Dreamy  --  not jest yit . Fo ' de good Lawd 's sake , don ' yo ' go befo ' you speaks wid her ! If yo ' knew how she 's been a-callin ' an ' a-prayin ' for yo ' all de day  --  DREAMY ( scornfully but a bit uncertainly ) Aw , she don ' need none o ' me . What good kin I do watchin ' her do a kip ? It 'd be dif'frunt if she was croakin ' on de level . CEELY ( in an anguished whisper ) She 's gwine wake up in a secon ' an ' den she call : " Dreamy . Whar 's Dreamy ? "  --  an ' what I gwine tell her den ? An ' yo ' Mammy is dyin ' , Dreamy , sho 's fate !

Yo ' jest gotter stay wid her in her las ' secon 's on dis yearth when she 's callin ' ter yo ' . ( with conviction as he hesitates ) Listen heah , yo ' Dreamy ! Yo ' don ' never git no bit er luck in dis worril ary agin , yo ' leaves her now . De perlice gon ' kotch yo ' suah . DREAMY ( with superstitious fear ) Ssshh ! Can dat bull , Ceely ! ( then boastfully ) I was n't pinin ' to beat it up here , git me ? De boys was all persuadin ' me not ter take de chance . It 's takin ' my life in my hands , dat 's what . But when I heerd it was ole Mammy croakin ' and axin ' ter see me , I says ter myse'f : " Dreamy , you gotter make good wid ole Mammy no matter what come  --  or you don ' never git a bit of luck in yo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , was n't I ? Nary body in dis worril kin say de Dreamy ai n't game ter de core , n'matter what . ( With sudden decision walks to the foot of the bed and stands looking down at Mammy . A note of fear creeps into his voice . ) Gawd , she 's quiet ' nuff . Maybe she done passed away in her sleep like de ole ones does . You go see , Ceely ; an ' if she 's on'y sleepin ' , you wake her up . I wanter speak wid her quick  --  an ' den I 'll make a break outa here . You make it fast , Ceely Ann , I tells yo ' . p. 15 CEELY ( bends down beside the bed ) Mammy ! Mammy ! Here 's de Dreamy . MAMMY SAUNDERS ( opens her eyes  --  drowsily and vaguely , in a weak voice ) Dreamy ? DREAMY ( shuffling his feet and moving around the bed ) Here I is , Mammy . MAMMY SAUNDERS ( fastening her eyes on him with fascinated joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I ai n't dreamin ' nor seein ' ha'nts , is I ? DREAMY ( coming forward and taking her hand ) ' Deed I ai n't no ghost . Here I is , sho ' ' nuff . MAMMY SAUNDERS ( clutching his hand tight and pulling it down on her breast  --  in an ecstasy of happiness ) Didn ' I know you 'd come ! Didn ' I say : " Dreamy ai n't gwine let his ole Mammy die all lone by he'se'f an ' him not dere wid her . " I know o 'd come . ( She starts to laugh joyously , but coughs and sinks back weakly . ) DREAMY ( shudders in spite of himself as he realizes for the first time how far gone the old woman is  --  forcing a tone of joking reassurance ) What 's dat foolishness I hears you talkin ' , Mammy ? Wha ' d'yuh mean pullin ' dat bull ' bout croakin ' on me ? Shoo ! Tryin ' ter kid me , ai n't yo ' ? Shoo ! You live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don ' . p. 16 MAMMY SAUNDERS ( sadly and very weakly ) I knows ! I knows ! Hit ai n't long now . ( bursting into a sudden weak hysteria . ) Yo ' stay heah , Dreamy ! Yo ' stay heah by me , yo ' stay heah  --  till de good Lawd take me home . Yo ' promise me dat ! Yo ' do dat fo ' po ' ole Mammy , wo n't yo ' ? DREAMY ( uneasily ) ' Deed I will , Mammy , ' deed I will . MAMMY SAUNDERS ( closing her eyes with a sigh of relief  --  calmly ) Bless de Lawd for dat . Den I ai n't skeered no mo ' . ( She settles herself comfortably in the bed as if preparing for sleep . ) CEELY ( in a low voice ) I gotter go home fo ' a minute , Dreamy . I ai n't been dere all de day and Lawd knows what happen . I 'll be back yere befo ' ve'y long . DREAMY ( his eyes fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanter.

( She goes out quietly . Dreamy goes quickly to the window and cautiously searches the street below with his eyes. ) p. 17 MAMMY SAUNDERS ( uneasily ) Dreamy . ( He hurries back and takes her hand again . ) I got de mos ' ' culiar feelin ' in my head . Seems like de years done all roll away an ' I 'm back down home in de ole place whar yo ' was bo'n. ( after a short pause ) Does yo ' ' member yo ' own mammy , chile ? DREAMY No . MAMMY SAUNDERS Yo ' was too young , I s'pec ' . Yo ' was on'y a baby w'en she tuck ' n ' die . My Sal was a mighty fine ' oman , if I does say hit my se'f . DREAMY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Better you 'd close yo ' eyes an ' rest . MAMMY SAUNDERS ( with a trembling smile  --  weakly ) Shoo ! W'at is I done come ter wid my own gran ' chile bossin ' me ' bout . I wants ter talk . You knows you ai n't give me much chance ter talk wid yo ' dese las ' years . DREAMY ( sullenly ) I ai n't had de time , Mammy ; but you knows I was always game ter give you anything I got . ( a note of appeal in his voice ) You knows dat , don ' you , Mammy ? MAMMY SAUNDERS Sho'ly I does . Yo ' been a good boy , Dreamy ; an ' if dere 's one thing more'n nother makes me feel like I mighter done good in de sight er de Lawd , hits dat I raised yo ' fum a baby . p. 18 DREAMY ( clearing his throat gruffly ) Don ' you talk so much , Mammy .

MAMMY SAUNDERS ( after a slight pause , faintly ) Dere 's a singin ' in my ears all de time . ( seized by a sudden religious ecstasy ) Maybe hits de singin ' hymns o ' de blessed angels I done heah fum above . ( wildly ) Bless Gawd ! Bless Gawd ! Pity dis po ' ole sinner ! DREAMY ( with an uneasy glance at the door ) Ssshh , Mammy ! Don ' shout so loud . MAMMY SAUNDERS De pictures keep a whizzin ' fo ' my eyes like de thread in a sewing machine . Seems s'if all my life done fly back ter me all ter once . ( with a flickering smile  --  weakly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dey alls call yo '  --  de Dreamy ?

( A noise of footsteps comes from the hall stairway . Dreamy springs to his feet . ) Leggo my hand , Mammy  --  jest for a secon ' . I come right back to you . ( He pulls his hand from the old woman 's grip . She falls back on the pillows moaning . Dreamy pulls a large automatic revolver from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does so there is a sharp rap . He stands listening at the crack for a mommet , then noiselessly turns the key , unlocking the door . Then he crouches low down by the wall so that the door , when opened , will hide him from the sight of anyone entering . There is another and louder rap on the door . ) MAMMY SAUNDERS ( groaning ) W'at 's dat , Dreamy ? Whar is yo ' ? p. 20 DREAMY Ssshh ! ( Then muffling his voice he calls ) Come in . ( He raises the revolver in his hand . The door is pushed open and Irene enters , her eyes peering wildly about the room . Her bosom is heaving as if she had been running and she is trembling all over with terrified excitement . ) IRENE ( not seeing him calls out questioningly ) Dreamy ? DREAMY ( lowering his revolver and rising to his feet roughly ) Close dat door ! IRENE ( whirling about with a startled cry ) Dreamy !
