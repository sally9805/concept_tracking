India , " by Mrs. George Churchill , " Scandinavian Immigrants in New York , 1630-1674 , " is the title of a thick volume by John 0 . Evjen , professor of church history-in Augsburg Seminary , Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holter Publishing Co. , Minneapolis . Professor Evjen has devoted a great deal of careful research to his subject , which he presents in the form of biographical sketches of the persons of Scandinavian origin who came to New York between the dates mentioned . One hundred and eighty-seven persons are included in the list . Professor Evjen has added some appendices dealing with Scandinavians in Mexico and South America , and in Canada in the seventeenth century , in New York in the eighteenth century , and with German emigrants in New York before 1674 . For the special student , or those interested in genealogy , the volume will be of interest and value . " A History of the Family as a Social and Educational Institution , " by Willystine Goodsell ( Macmillan ; $2 ) , ought to form an important number in a textbook series in education . Westermarck 's " History of Human Marriage , " Starcke 's " Primitive Family , " Howard 's " History of Matrimonial Institutions , " and other more pretentious , theoretic , or special works in this field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet there is as great a need that the young shall be instructed in the history of the family as in that of any other major institution of society . is the sort of vital history that History has never attended to ; when historians complain of the inroads of the science of society upon the domain of history , they might well be taxed with having left large portions of that area in waste  --  and title to the waste has always been vested in the agency that has redeemed it . This is a remarkably informing and clarifying book ; it is also well and simply written and can be understood by any student of college grade . It is correct in its essentials far beyond the degree attained by most such treatises upon social subjects . But we wonder whether it is destined , in the present age , to a wide use . No topic connected with sex can be adequately treated without some plain wards upon matters that are commonly tabooed , especially in books for the young . What is allowed freely in the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description , even though there are historic facts in the latter case as against veiled reference and suggestion in the former . Our author is as discreet and has as delicate a sense of propriety as could be desired , for instance , he slips by the practice of bundling with such reticence that the uninstructed reader could have no idea of what is meant by the term  --  a situation recognized by a reference to Howard and to Stiles for " an account of the character and extent of the practice . " But no one can write a history of marriage or the family , in which he must treat of the customs of other times and places , as , e. g. , the Middle Ages in Europe , without in some measure infringing the tacit agreement current in this age and country not to handle these matters freely " This unwillingness , " writes Goodsell , " to discuss such questions has been united with a feeling of hostility toward social critics who proposed measures of reform at all radical in character . Thus Mrs. Parsons 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago with a storm of adverse criticism and rebuke because it rather audaciously suggested that in view of the widespread existence of prostitution , and in view of the danger of long-deferred marriages , society might find it wise to attempt the experiment of early trial marriages . " There is a good deal of sense in the views of such critics ; and their opposition is still more reasonable when it comes to filling the undiscriminating heads of young people with ideas of this sort . But our author does not sin much , if at all , in such directions ; and our doubts as to the adaptability of his volume for use as a textbook are not based upon his indiscretion , but upon the more general question as to whether topics involving sex can be acceptably treated , except in the most summary and partial fashion , in a textbook . For the graduate student , however , this volume will be most useful as a book of reference . It is remarkably full and complete for its size , witnessing as it does to wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall another book of its compass that is nearly so satisfactory . It is descriptive rather than analytical , and treats the subject historically rather than from the standpoint of social evolution . But it is good to have all tlus matter inside the covers of a single book of convenient size and moderate price . Occasionally , it might be added , there is inaccuracy of form ; on page 46 we have noticed several cases of wrong initials , pointing , etc. , as , for example , " Giddings , Franklin T. " , " McGee , W. J. , " and " Giraud-Teulou . " For consolation the reviewer of ever multiplying war books may reflect on the magnitude of the task which awaits the future earnest student of sources for the history of the war . That task will not be lightened by the fact that so many of the volumes of notes and impressions of various aspects of the struggle contain much that is of interest and value . Of the volumes before us one which aims to be rather more than such a collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Seven Divisions " ( Dutton ; $1 ' 50 net ) , " being a detailed account of the fighting from Mons to Ypres . " It is a plain account , based partly on personal observation ( the author is a captain in the Eleventh Hussars ) , partly on second-hand information , evidently conscientiously acquired and used , of the retreat of the British expeditionary forces from Mons to the Marne , the dramatic resumption of the offensive there , the advance to the Aisne , the westward extension of the Allied left wing and the German right , and finally of the tremendous first battle of Ypres , when the attenuated British line , holding firm against overwhelming odds , defeated the alternative plans of the German General Staff , the occupation of the Channel ports . The general story is well told and is supplemented by accounts of actions of individual units and of individuals themselves . The same general ground is covered in Frederic Coleman 's " From Mons to Ypres with General French " ( Dodd , Mead ; $1.50 net ) . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally , except for such account of general operations as is necessary to give an intelligent perspective , with incidents that came under the observation of the author , an American who at the beginning of the war joined the Royal Automobile Corps . The opportunities for observation of one whose principal duty it was to dash from one part of the front to another carrying staff officers in a high-powered automobile were naturally exceptional , and Mr. Coleman has made of them a singularly vivid and interesting narrative . It is interesting as a comment on one of the unexplained incidents of the war to record the high admiration expressed by both these authors for Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien , particularly for his feat in extricating the Second Army Corps from apparently inevitable annihilation at Le Cateau . Both authors agree , however , that had not the German pursuit on the two days , August 29 and 30 , been inexplicably slackened the escape of Smith-Dorrien. ' s army would have been exceedingly doubtful . Translated from the French , we have " The Epic of Dixmude , " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by Andre Warnod ( Lippincott ; $1 net each ) . The former is the story , well worth the telling , of the heroic defence by the French Fusiliers Marins , which helped to save - for King Albert that stretch of Flanders where he still rules . The latter is an . account , which does not differ greatly in general impression from others of a similar character , of several months ' imprisonment in one of the German concentration camps . The impressions of a British subaltern who signs himself ' , Platoon Commander " in the fighting from the Aisne to La Bass &; are recorded In " With My Regiment " ( Lippincott ; $1 net ) . It is an unpretentious , brightly written little volume , made up of papers that have appeared in various English periodicals . From a different point of vie ' ? we have , in " Under Three Flags " ( Macmillan ; $1 ) , impressions gained in Red Cross service in Belgium , France , and Servia by St. Clair Livingston and Ingeborg Steen-Hensen . The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffuseness in subject matter and lack of organization . Lieut. - Col . J. H. Patterson has a theme of exceptional interest in " With the Zionists in Gallipoli " ( Doran ; $2 net ) . The Zionists were a mule transport corps recruited from Russian Jews who fled before the Turks into Egypt from their settlements in Palestine . This corps was organized and commanded by Col. Patterson , and with him it rendered valudble and distinguished service in the ill-fated Gallipoli expedition . His story of its exploits is well told and makes capital reading . Whether or not Col. Patterson would have been professionally more discreet to have confined his account to the business in hand , the adventures of his own corps , it is not for us to say . Unquestionably , his volume gains in interest from the general commentary he has to make on the conduct and organization of the Gallipoli expedition as a whole . That it was ill conceived he does not agree ; that it was almost inconceivably ill-managed he is convinced . The splitting up of the army of invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anzac , where the Australian and New Zealand divisions alone missed capturing the heights of Sari Bair by so narrow a margin as to show conclusively that a strong force could have occupied this key to the Narrows , cutting off from its supplies the whole Turkish army of the peninsula , and gaining at one blow a victory that would have had a decisive influence on the entire course of the war . Quite unconscious of events to come , " The Gate of Asia " ( Putnam ; $2.50 ) gives an intimate insight into the races and political conditions that obtained in those regions which now mark the eastern confines of the present war . William Warfield , impelled by a geologic hobby to travel the historic sites of Babylonia and Persia. , managed to invest his observations with a strategic as well as a human interest , and his leisurely record contains pages that will bear fruitful reading after the war . Nowhere else , perhaps , will problems of geographic and political interest take precedence over these of Mesopotamia and Persia , of the southern hinterlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influence takes place . Mr. Warfield sojourned at Bagdad , whose importance has revived , and there may yet exist reasons why the ancient city of the Caliphs will be resuscitated , and the Moslem world pay homage to the Caliph , or to some Caliph of equal importance , if the dissolution of Turkey in Europe is assured at the close of the war . Besides finding the ubiquitous Teutonic influence at work along the much-discussed Bagdad railway route , Mr. Warfield , in his pre-hostile impressions , found murmurs of protest at the supineness of the British in their wide concessions of spheres on the Persian Gulf . Of the unpopularity of Turkish rule there are abundant anecdotes gleaned among Arabs and Kurds Quite the most interesting pages are those depicting the Kurdish tribes , whose exploitation for the fiendish massacres of the Armenians has given them and their late master , Abdul Hamid , a well-deserved stigma in modern history . But Mr. Warfleld has a good word- to say for the Kurds , whose native honesty- and rugged simplicity in their own country caught his admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is poetic justice in his enthusiasm for the stalwart , rugged type of the native Armenian of the mountain villages , who has so often dared to hold up an avenging Turkish army corps , as compared with our experience with the undersized and sharp-witted types of this race more familiar in the Levant and in America . Whatever hard things Mr. Warfield is justified in recording of Russia , the fact remains that depleted Armenia has the - single hope and ambition of being rehabilitated under her mgis . It is a pleasure to read Mr. Warfield 's anecdotes of our sturdy American missionaries in these oppressed sections of the Ottoman Empire ; in more than one instance has the church militant become the church triumphant . Full of delightful memories of the Victorians , of Paris under the last Emperor , of Spain in revolution , of Russia , and of London and provincial Manchester , Richard Whiting 's " My Harvest " ( Dodd , Mead ; $2.50 net ) will impress the reader as a commendable example of autobiography . The author of " No. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of the robustious optimism concerning progress in civic and human relations that made him distinct from the sentimental school of " uplift " we have still with us While he is to the fore with the newest movement for betterment in life and letters , his sturdy Victonanism is proof against the gibes of modern prophets like Mr. Shaw , against the Superman in letters and life . " The strong man rules  --  himself , and serves the others . While the effigy holds its place as a god in Germany , Germany must be on its way to the abyss . She was once re-made by a literature of the right sort ; she is going to be unmade by a literature of the wrong . " And one is fain to quote further : " This good breeding of the pen is a great point with the French . Literature is the medium in which they render their idea of the gentleman . They have absolutely no mercy for the bull in the china shop on the search for emphasis . " As a correspondent on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history in the making , and gives interesting pictures of particular phases of this period of Victorian Olympians on which it is still our fashion to lavish an unintelligent scorn . Here we End a defence of Tennyson : the best Judges of a man , Mr. Whiting asserts , are his contemporaries . " They alone know what new thing he brought into the world . . . . The critic of a new time , who inherits the concept only as a platitude at the best , is in no position to feel the rapture of the sense of service . " The author also knew the human side of his heroes . There are some delightful anecdotes of the Browning family in Paris , before the poet came into his great vogue . " The greatest visionary in the finer sense of the word , and withal the greatest diner out , " is the verdict on Browning from a Victorian who , as man of the world , himself kept a fine integrity of art and conscience . Mr. Whiting admits the Mid-Victorian " dowdiness " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellington touch on the iron string of duty , the sense of the novel as the epic of life . " Quite the best chapter is that on Prussianized History , but the memories of great ladies and their salons in Paris , of the social and literary life of the period in their capital cities , the simple story of the author 's own part in the passing show , are also written with a - rich mellowness of reflection that incites to a second perusal . We know of no wiser book of recent years on the subject of preaching and the preacher than George Wharton Pepper 's " A Voice from the Crowd " ( Yale University Press ; $1.50 net ) . The volume contains the forty-first series of the Lyman Beecher lectures , but the first of the series to be given by a layman . The notable fact is that this layman distinguishes himself by laying the emphasis on the spiritual and religious aspect of the preacher 's task , rather than on the social aspects which the clergy themselves are so fond of magnifying these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conviction than in these lectures , but they are also sprinkled with shrewd observations on sinful human nature . Altogether the book can be highly recommended to clergymen who make sermons and to laymen who hear , or ought to hear , them .
