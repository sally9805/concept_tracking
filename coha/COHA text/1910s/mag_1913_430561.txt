 | What lover of Addison can ever forget Will Wimble ? " He is extremely well versed in all the little handicrafts of an idle man : he makes a May-fly to a miracle ; and furnishes the whole country with angle-rods . " Why ? Forsooth because " bred to no business , and born to no estate . " Later on the delightful essayist " could not but consider , with a great deal of concern , how so good an heart , and such busy hands , were wholly employed in trifles ; that so much humanity should be so little beneficial to others , and so much industry so little advantageous to himself . " I wonder . I wonder . Is the only thing worth while the practical thing ? Is the only life worth while the life practical ? If Addison had lived in our day would he have pointed his finger at Will Wimble ? In this age of ever-busy-ness , of fret , fume and flurry , do we not need Will Wimbles , silent preachers , professional idlers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too much commercialism is just as bad as too little . I take off my hat to Will Wimble . Just now to " make a Mayfly to a miracle , " and " furnish the whole country with angle-rods , " seems a religious duty . If I were not so busy I would be a Will Wimble . On the desk before me lies the unfinished manuscript for which I know an impatient editor waits , but my pen refuses to move ; for , across the manuscript , forth and back , up and down , passes an endless procession of birds ? meadowlarks , robins , bluebirds , sparrows ? my willing ears filled with their music . To push the pen would be to kill the birds , and I had rather that the grim editor kill me . I am possesst of the spirit of that idler Will Wimble . I am going fishing . Why a man should be ashamed of fishing is more than I can understand , but most of us are , nevertheless . A certain minister friend of mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wasted " ( that is his word ) an hour fish- ing , yet he spends half a day each week at a ladies ' society , the only man present . Let us say that he has been preaching for forty-five years and each one of those years he has spent fifty-two half days , or twenty-six full days , which in forty-five years amounts to ? but shucks , what is the use ? It is all a matter of viewpoint anyway . Of course , I do not care what he thinks of me , but just the same I have evolved an outfit so inconspicuous that with it , as dear old father Izaak would say , " Ye may walk and there is no man shall wist whereabout ye go . " In a moment I will tell you all about it .. Now I do not possess a garden , but my neighbor does ; as I view matters , about the most valuable thing he grows is earthworms , so in the early spring when I go fishing , I am under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? which I think he counts upon , for he never has it plowed until the last possible moment . When I dig worms I do it surreptitiously , not that I am ashamed of it , dear no , but because of my ministerial friend and an angular spinster over the way , neither of whom have any sympathy with Will Wimble . The Good Book says , " Judge not , " and if I can obviate their judging me perhaps in the make-up of all things it will be counted to me for righteousness . I , and you , all of us , are going to need judgment tempered with mercy , fishermen or not . Of course , much is written about true sportsmen not using worms , but I dare assert that sportsmanship is a finer thing than bait or tackle , and I am credited in some quarters with knowing considerable about tackle , and possest of not a little skill in the making and casting of the fuzzy wuzzy lures . Sportsmanship as I define it is the spirit of fair-play finding expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who plays fair , yields to his opponent equal chances with himself ; harbors no resentment if the game goes against him , does not brag when he wins . Yes , I fish with worms early in the season , and sometimes with grasshoppers later , yet I hold that I am a sportsman . Not because of my tackle ? I use the lightest and best I can afford ? but because I " play fair . " Any true disciple of Izaak Walton loves tackle and loves to talk tackle , is always investing in " rods , and reels , and traces , " to borrow from Kipling . Now I possess rods and rods , reels and reels , naturally , because of my position as " angling editor " of an outdoor magazine , some of which cost a mint of money , but I desire to tell you of a little pocket rod , each joint only twelve inches long , which when assembled becomes a rod six and three-fourths feet long , weighing in the neighborhood of five ounces . The advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a well made little tool and costs but four dollars . Oh yes , there are better rods , but not for less money . In combination with this little rod only the very lightest reel should be used , and a line that will preserve the unities , say size G , enameled , of course . A few small snelled hooks , size 2 , and a bait-box ? any tin can will do providing it will hold worms . Not much of an outfit ? but it will serve . Of course , there are conven- iences such as folding landing nets and creels , but they can be dispensed with , as one can get along without drab clothing , hip-boots and a guide . Oh , yes , I like to go trout-fishing with a Saratoga trunk packed full of paraphernalia , articles to satisfy every whim and wish of man and fish ; but for true sport and recreation forever commend me to the little coatpocket outfit , with which , again to quote Father Izaak , " Ye may walk and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can face the peering spinster over the way with a face as long as her own , even while your happy heart is pounding away against the little rod in your inside coat pocket . To set out on a fishing excursion looking as tho you were going to your mother-in-law 's funeral may be incongruous , but it is sometimes necessary . " What is the attractiveness of spring fishing ? " Well , it is not the tackle , tho as I said before we like to talk tackle , neither is it the trout , tho there is pleasure in catching them and we enjoy eating them when fried to a delectable brown ; but it is the outdoors , the ministry and soothe of Nature , that makes fishing worth while . To be in the open when the birds are fair crazed with joy , the retiring arbutus and delicate hepaticas creeping up to the very water 's edge , everywhere adding a dash of color to the greening grass , and the baby leaves , half formed and ethereal , poke inquisitive noses from every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only see it but feel it to the uttermost part of the body , that is spring trout-fishing . Undoubtedly there is pleasure in making a good catch , in filling a basket chock full of sparkling , irradiant bodies , yet it is the indefinable , intangible something which one takes away with him from a trout stream that makes angling a unique sport . I know of no place where one can so easily believe in miracles as upon the banks of a purling trout-stream in May . Bless you , a single blue violet is itself a greater miracle than any of those supernatural events recorded in the Bible . The wonder was not that a bush burned without being consumed , but that Moses could see it , for every living branch everywhere is aflame with God these days . The ancient seer prayed that the eyes of his frightened servant might be opened so that he could see the spirit forces , the soldiery of God marshalling to the defense of the beleaguered ones . We , too , need to pray that our eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not the real things of earth that are of the most value , but the unreal . To see such things requires much prayer and striving . All of which a trout fisherman knows . As the rustic swain waits until the shades of night have fallen before paying a visit to the lady of his heart lest the curious might discover him , so the true angler is chary about divulging the whereabouts of his stream , indeed he does not care to be seen going to a tryst with his intangible love . To such an one the little outfit mentioned in a previous paragraph will be a veritable boon . After all , it is the little , unpremeditated , unplanned for trip that proves the most satisfactory and enjoyable . When the weather is right and the spirit moves , " stand not upon the order of thy going , but go at once . " He who spends weeks in getting ready to go fishing or to be happy will find his outing juiceless and his happiness vanished . Happiness is a by-product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. The pot of gold is not at the end of the rainbow , but in the falling rain-drops . Whitman was right , " I ask not good fortune , I am good fortune . " Heaven is not for the dead but the living ; in other words , he who does not find heaven here will not find it hereafter . Did I hear someone say , " You make fishing a religion ? " Sure , all life is religion . You can not tell where the one leaves off and the other begins . I have a " good time " on the streams and in life itself when I am my own " good time , " not otherwise . After all , Will Wimble was not the shiftless fellow Addison painted him to be ; there was a method in his madness . True , he might have engaged in business some of the time , but if in so doing he had lost the power of " making a Mayfly to a miracle , " in other words , lost the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wide fields , he was wise in remaining a mere rodmaker to the country side . These days when the days grow long and the invitations of the birds grow more and more insistent , we are wise to slam the desk shut , and with
