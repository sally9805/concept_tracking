txt // extremes of aestheticism be tolerated ; and yet are the extremes of aesthetic sensualism , with the interests of the soul 's inner life in the foreground , any worse than the extremes of scientific materialism , where the affairs of the self are thrust into the background ? One method exaggerates the importance of the individual , the other so minimizes it as to render it null . While the individualist is likely to hesitate when it comes to assenting to the ideals of Decadence , he should be able to see that in this exaggerated aesthetic the chief aim has been to grant the soul the right of self-existence and selfexpression . The " I think " in which the individualist is privileged to rejoice is hardly to be found in any other form of human culture ; the artist serves us where the scientist refuses aid . In the same manner , aestheticism has made it possible to give expression to the inner states of consciousness , where scientism can only wish the individual to keep the silence . The aim of scientism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and how valiantly did Darwin make war upon the spiritual life of his age ; the aim of aestheticism is to raise humanity to an independent position , so that the exaggerations of Decadence are well meant and well timed . In the eyes of science , all that man can do is to carry out the purpose of nature , whence civilization and culture are supposed to assume a naturalistic character of which the Spencerian State may serve as the convenient type . Put the expression of the inner life , as this comes through the improvisations of the free individual , is not to be relegated to an inferior order of existence . What can the culture of naturalism do for the ideals and strivings of the aesthetic individual , what promises of self-expressionism can it hold out ? As ordinarily understood with scientism , " nature " can not provide a place for the adequate objectification of the self-existent ego ; at the same time , // the aesthetic ego can not longer remain in its morbid subjectivity , whence arises the need of a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual finds itself . Meanwhile , the value of free aestheticism must not be overlooked , since in the exaggerated conscious state of the decadent the freedom from both nature and society manifests itself . Were there no aestheticism , it would be possible for the naturalistic thinker to insist upon that rigid parallelism which , while it may make smooth the path of mere speculation , forbids the existence and expression of the inner state as such . If this inner soul-state could be expressed as a superior mental condition whose spiritual character could not be questioned , the principles of individualism would be more consistent and more acceptable ; but , wanting this superiority , the soul-state asserts its independence when it shows itself to be different from the usual mental condition which is so easily explained after the manner of psycho-physics . The self must be free ; if this freedom can not come to it in the form of the idealistic , it must enter in the form of the morbid and unusual . In the attempt to keep the inner life free from exterior intrusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the means of arriving at his goal . II . THE STRUGGLE FOR THE WORTH OF LIFE If the natural order , so fixed and forbidding in its rigorous physicality , makes no room for the free , interior joy of life , it will be found to be no less inimical to affirmation of worth on the part of the individual . Man can not find joy within himself when his life is interpreted by science ; man can not secure worth from the world which is now in possession of science . In imme122 THE GROUND AND GOAL OF HUMAN LIFE diate response to its hasty metaphysics of the natural order , scientism has elaborated a world of forms and a world of functions ; but in neither the statics nor the dynamics of the natural does the individual find the opportunity to get values out of the world . Scientism differs from humanism in that scientism regards all work as the exercise of functions , while humanistic individualism lays its emphasis upon the principle of creativeness , whereby the individual is able to perfect a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning , which is ever tainted by the thought that all such action is a merely automatic response to exterior excitement , the ideal of creating involves a certain amount of preliminary deliberation , in the light of which the ego considers whether this or that shall be done ; indeed , egoism goes so far as to question whether action has the power to create the values which the human self feels called upon to seek . In every case where the worth of life is considered , the individualist demands that action shall spring from the " I will , " in which alone may value be found . In this manner , the struggle for value consists in asserting the rights of an independent initiative , in default of which the evaluating ego is ready to repudiate the natural order , and set up the independent standard of immoralism. 1 . SELVII00D IN WORTH The essential principle in all human values is found in the ego 's desire to go forth from the very depths of its interior self to the most essential and remote phases of reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to the more superficial aspects of the world , as these are recognized in the satisfaction of immediate wants . Now , such mere functioning is not evaluating , whence egoism turns away from naturalism // in order that the true self within may seek its proper possession in the world without . The cultivation of the things peculiar to immediate welfare , so dear to the utilitarian of all special schools , is in no sense the deliberate cultivation of values ; for these true worths are concerned with that which has its source within the depths of man 's nature while their goal lies over the horizon of immediacy . This distinction between the immediate and the remote , both within and without the self , is one which scientism can not possibly make , since scientism has before it as its data and factors nothing but immediate impulses within and perceptible objects without . In such a double immediateness the worth of life can not be found . The value-problem arises when the individual in the consciousness of his inner life attempts to secure from the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to supply . There was indeed a time in the history of humanity , although then the value-ideal was not recognized , when the human will drew from the depths of the world-order the kalokagathia so dear to the soul of classicism ; but the advent of scientism had the effect of denying to the human will the superior benefits once enjoyed . In this manner , there has arisen a veritable struggle for life-values , a conflict in the course of which one is led to raise the question whether values do exist , and whether man has the right to secure them . The life of naturalism may permit of functional activity without further allowing work , just as it may promise utility where it does not grant worth , but the work of worth is that which for individualism is the one thing needful . The naturalistic conception of man , which regards the human being as one thing among others , and which looks upon the individual as a " specimen of the species , " can not construe the active life of man as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is regarded in the functional manner , the idea of work fails to evince that which is most characteristic of man , the internal and intellectual . According to naturism , intelligence is no more than an instrument finely adapted to handle the things and arrive at the ends which are peculiar to the exterior , perceptible life of the human species . It is admissible that man 's active life may have begun in no other realm than that of immediate activity , just as it may further be pointed out that a certain nucleus of human activity is still to be found in that which is at once practical and perceptible ; but to elaborate a philosophy of life out of these naturistic data is to overlook the most significant elements in man as worker and valuer . It is still possible to assume that the will may so internalize its activities as to proceed from the depths of the soul to the remoter borders of the world , and in the possibility of proceeding from the internal to the remote the worth of human life consists . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality reveal the fact that the human will is capable of this double movement of intension and extension . Common , functional activity with its hedonic and utilitarian consequences , fails to bring into play that which is at once characteristic of both man within and the world without . Indeed , naturalism can not evoke the characteristic in the individual , even where it may claim to express that which is psychologically essential ; naturalism thus fails to find a basis for morality . Where work is viewed in the light of its character , it is symbolized by the arrow which shoots beyond the bow rather than by the hammer which does not leave the hand . In its fullest meaning , action is doubly idealized , in that it springs from the idea within , while it is aimed at the idea without ; the ego which makes such action manifest is conscious of who he is and of what he is doing . // In the so-called ethics of naturalism , as this may be found in the one-time ethics of Spencer , there is no trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In true art and true morality , the supreme factor is the " I will " of indi vidualism . By its very nature , the human will has the power to establish values in the world . In many instances of action , the individual may be impelled by the incentive which promises some immediate benefit in the world of sense , just as it may be aroused by desires which speak for the immediate needs of conscious life within . But the essence of volition is found in an idea in the delib erate pursuit of which the stolid activity of the will stands out in strong outline against the warmer impul sion of desire . To will is to will ; that is , to will is to strive after that which , in the individual 's judgment , has worth for man . As scientism has no real morality , so it has no essential values ; these are found in an order of life where the self as centre draws its own circle of limitation . The possibilities of the will are determined by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is judged to have , worth . An individualist may thus will an object of sensuous enjoyment after the manner of Sudermann , or he may will the naught in a manner peculiar to Stirner ; in the case of either ex treme , it is the individualized will in search of values which determines the volition . Scientism can not under-stand that man is anxious to realize worth in the world ; therefore scientism persists in seeking to settle accounts with the individual by proffering spurious satisfactions , like pleasures and utilities . It is commonly assumed that the negations of sci entism have had to do with ideas alone , as though the agnostic veto applied to the individual 's purely specu lative attempt to lay hold upon life . But scientism has // assumed the same forbidding attitude to the deeds of the will in the latter 's attempt to lay hold of values in the world . Indeed , the circle of scientism has been drawn about both free ideas and free volitions . The history of individualism shows how man has willed the Beyond even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think the Beyond . In its more definite form the Will-to-the-Beyond has assumed the form of self-will , or the will-to-selfhood , so well known with Stirner , Wagner , and Nietzsche . Where Romanticism simply postulated the Beyond as an indefinite object of poetical sentiment , the individualism of the mid-nineteenth cen-tury made the Beyond a definite object of volition . Wagner 's Siegfried , who was delightfully innocent of modern scientism , showed his ability to create values out of his own will ? Denn selbst muss der freie sich Schaff en.23 In the same manner , Ibsen 's " right man " of the " third empire " was to come into being as " the one who wills himself , " just as Nietzsche 's Zarathustra was the one who could say , " I will . " What scientific conception of the world were capable of such intensity of individuation as to make possible or even permit such a self-valuation ? In defiance of scientism , with its half-hearted conception of action , individualism has proceeded to create values in the world in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will the immediate and useful is by no means the same as to will the values which belong to the inner nature of the free ego . Agnostic scientism prefers that man should neither know God nor will the self ; if individualism has not been alive to the exigencies of the divine prob-lem , it has not failed to solve the human one . The struggle for the worth of life has had the effect of developing an individualistic psychology wherein the ideal of worth has been relegated to the human will . // Values are volitional values produced by the strength of the self-propelled will . In the single attribute of strength has the individualist sought to find the essence of the will ; where the conflict over the Joy of Life was decided by the refinements of emotion , the conflict over values has centered in the idea of the ego 's ability to reinforce its own motives . When , in the struggle for the worth of life , the individualist seeks to express selfhood through strength , one is not to assume that this new doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However paradoxical it may appear , the stronger the individualist is within , the less inclined for destructive action does he appear to be . In his opposition to established law , Schlegel was purely aesthetical ; the same may be said of the more danger ous Baudelaire . In the same spirit of passive resist ance , did Stirner express himself : " Now , as my object is not the overthrow of an established order but my elevation above it , my purpose and deed are not a political or social but an egoistic purpose and deed . " 24 There can be no doubt that there was perfect serenity in the midst of Emerson 's intense non-conformity , while one can believe that even Nietzsche was free from any desire to revolutionize the world . Aye , in the most intense individualism and evaluation of Christ himself , there was no thought of outward insurrection . Strength , then , is internal strength , an arming and fortifying one 's self within ; such strength proceeds from the idea of self-value , while it contents itself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all one 's volitions , as egoism has been doing , is to assert that the value of life is to be found in the individual . Nevertheless , in seeking the value of life within the self , the individ ualist does not exalt a petty , punctual egoism of self-love ; for it has been the self as the seat of spiritual life // with its aesthetical , moral , and religious values rather than the private personality of an ego with its pleasures , which individualism has seen fit to uphold . When , as in the happy instance of antique culture , the outer world was not allowed to threaten the sanctity of the inner life , there was humanism without egoism , intellectualism without egoistic opposition ; but , where modern life uses scientism to persecute the individual , a more militant humanism becomes necessary . In a world of culture where all tendencies worked outwardly for the exaltation of the physical , egoism becomes a necessary movement for the preservation of the human soul . When the view of nature becomes less scientific and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the field ; but until scientism yields , it will be necessary for individualism to take upon itself the task of asserting the worth of human life as such . We must abide by Protagoras until Socrates is come . While individualism has often been one with egoism , it has never lost sight of perfect humanism . But how is such humanism to be advanced ? According to the common assumption , we may argue that , the more egoism there is , the less humanism ; the more sociality , the more humanism . This , which is really the fallacy of composition , makes necessary the distinction between the intensive qualities of a concept and its purely quantitative extension . According to the principles of social thinking , " humanity " is a class-term the validity of which depends upon the assembling of individuals under one general head ; according to individualism , " humanity " is an essence which can be discovered only by analyzing the individual in all the character of his inner existence . Modern democracy gave excessive width to the concept ; modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this diffusion . As a philosophy of rights , which originally had co other aim than the eleTHE // mental welfare of the human species , such a humanism was just ; but when this exteriorizing humanism is immediately turned into a philosophy of life , the quantitative , extensive principle does not obtain . Man as man may have within him an essential humanity which all morality must recognize ; but , when this humanity is organized in the form of institution , and we are asked to believe that the old content may be found in the new form , the immoralistic idealist can only become skeptical . With the individualist , humanity is an idea which signifies something more than a generalization elaborated to include all anthropoids under one head ; humanity is essential and characteristic . In particular , the humanism of that individualism for which immoralism stands includes the superioristic in'mankind ; whence it is not the man eating and working , but the man thinking and creating which is set up as the standard . Social thought starts and terminates with the man as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever coming about by means of human perfection . To enclose the given man in a circle of social conceptualism is not to arrive at humanity ; this superior notion is elaborated only as humanity is considered as the subject of inward culture . Thus it is the cultural , rather than the natural in humanity , which has guided the immoralist in his assertion of the individual 's supremacy , as also in his opposition to the fixed order in which only man external is made the subject of observation . As individualism regards culture as the Good , sociality can hardly do otherwise than view it as the had , inasmuch as culture takes man 's attention away from the immediate world with its practical problems , while it works also for the elevation of the superior above the inferior . In contrast with the individualistic view which con13o THE GROUND AND GOAL , OF HUMAN LIFE siders the self as something connected quite loosely with the social order , contemporary moralism offers the conception of the self as a " cell in the social organism . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competing conceptions is likely to appear the more moral ? If it seem immoralistic to consider the self in that independence which its unique nature demands , what ethical degradation is involved in the current social conception according to which the spiritual is absorbed in the social ! When the question is placed upon the basis of value , what is there in the objectified social order which can compensate for the loss of personal worth which the social system demands ? The social puts men together , but that is not to say that they belong together ; furthermore , the social system puts men together , not for the sake of evoking in the individual that which is characteristic of his nature , but in order that more and more socialized work may be done . In thus assembling men industrially , sociality sacrifices a permanent value to a passing utility ; the individual is not suffered to live within or to work from within , so that his humanity is lost to him . The genuine Inner of human life thus perishes with exteriorizing progress . Immoralistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social moralism which springs from the naturalistic order ; that complaint involves the Outer , the world in which the individual is supposed to live and work . With the assertion of the individual in all the privacy of his interior existence , it would seem as though the work of the immoralist were done ; but immoralism has ever found it possible to provide the humanized self with an objective in the form of Humanity . When the essential meaning of humanity is considered , it is possible , aye necessary , to affirm that it is the individualistic rather than the social which has had the fate to organize the // idea of humanity . This individualistic conception of humanity depends upon sympathism . Upon the naturalistic basis of social ethics , the attempt to produce humanistic sentiment has resulted in nothing more convincing than " altruism . " This modern thought , this sentiment , with which ancient humanism found it possible to dispense , has assumed the twin form of benevolence and conscience . From Cumberland to Smith , from Smith to the school of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period sought to justify it as an ideal ; the later one has attempted to realize it as a principle of experience . Arguing that there is a natural principle of benevolence or sociality , which holds men together as a social unit , the school of social morality then attempted to transfigure this social sentiment as the ethical ideal of conscience . In response to such moralization , immoralism urged that , since the bond which was assumed to assemble men on the planet was based upon the inferior principle of naturalism in the form of the herding instinct , the so-called moral sentiment could not be regarded as sufficiently sanctioned . It was in the repudiation of social conscience , the conscience of the species , that immoralism came into being and acquired its unhappy renown . Stendhal and Emerson anticipated it ; Dostoievsky and Nietzsche made of it an ethical system of hardness , if not of cruelty . The appeal to gregariousness was lost on such individualists ; the conscience of the race failed to soften their victorious egoism . In connection with the history of immoralistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cited with the aim of showing that in some instances the intrepid individualist found it expedient to abandon the severities of his doctrine and repose at last in the softer conceptions of sympathy and compunction . This may indeed be granted ; but the retreat of the Russian novel132 THE GROUND AND GOAL , OF HUMAN LIFE ist and German musician was marked by an advance inward toward a complete compassionism rather than outward in the direction of altruism . In the case of Dostoievsky , there is no suggestion of the greatest happiness of the greatest number as the sanction of morality ; rather was it a sense of universal misery which led him to abandon his immoralistic egoism and seek refuge in the idea of divine compassion . The same may be urged in the case of Wagner , where the strident will-to-selfhood yielded to a soteriological sense of sympathy whose spiritual character was such as to involve intellectual illumination instead of human good feeling . It is thus a spiritual humanism which lies behind the principles of immoralistic self-assertiveness . Indeed , in this sympathism , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a point where both phases of humanism , the cultural and the compassionate , meet ; this is in the notion of insight . Aiming at insight , Hellenic humanism seeks the development of that which is superior and permanent in humanity ; guided by such insight , Hindoo humanism proceeds to elaborate its system of sympathism . The dialectical character of such immoralistic humanism appears at once ; no longer is it the naturalistic sense of a common animality , but the spiritual consciousness of essential unity which brings the sons of men together . When , therefore , the social moralist says , " man , " he means something of a biological and anthropological nature ; when the individualist pronounces the term , it signifies a spiritual communism whose roots descend into the essential nature of humanity whose place is the spiritual order . Furthermore , the immoralistic character of humanism is such as to involve profound pessimistic considerations , since it is the realization of the seriousness of man 's condition in the universe which acts as the bond to draw men together . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the contrasted ideals of egoistic strength and human sympathy meet in one common sense of interior life . If , as Anatole France has said , " only egoists really love women , " it may be asserted that only individualists really love humanity . If egoism and altruism represent contradictory values , individualism and sympathism are suggestive of two sides of one and the same human affair . The individualist who , not contented with the self-life parcelled out to him by a differentiating natural order , takes selfhood into his own hands and thus wills his inner being , is in a position to appreciate the essential meaning of humanity ; and this appreciation becomes the means of enlightening him as to meaning of another 's life . To abandon egoism for the purpose of securing an altruistic standpoint is to extinguish the torch which is to light up the world of humanity as a whole . Naturalism , which knows nothing of humanity save that superficial aspect of it which appears in egoism and altruism , is thus in no position to indicate to mankind the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INDIVIDUALISTIC INITIATIVE In the capacity of valuer , the ego endeavors to exercise that free initiative by means of which he shall put his will into the world ; for this individualistic initiative , systematic metaphysics , whether rationalistic or positivistic , must make way . Where the individual in his quest of the real joy of life had demanded the privilege of receiving from the world the impressions which should become veritable soul-states , the elaboration of life-values finds the same individual asserting his right to react upon the world in a manner peculiar to his own will . Under what circumstances does the human ego really act , and what is the character of that // which we call a " deed " ? In taking up the activistic phase of human life , individualism does not fall into the error of assuming that a theory is a necessary preliminary to life itself , even where individualism exercises the faint hope that a critical conception of life may have the effect of making life appear more genuine in its sense of joy , of worth , of truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of man , although wanting in sincerity and strength , will ever possess something like soul-states , free initiatives , and ideals . But genuine and consistent action , like sincere feeling and thought , must find a sufficient ground , or an approximation to it . What , then , is really meant when one says , " I will " ? The individualistic " I will " takes up the question in the spirit of pessimism in obedience to which individualism is led to question the value of action as such . Non-individualistic systems , the whole legion of which seem equally possessed of the energistic spirit , always take action for granted ; the inner life of feelings may be impossible and thought-ideals unattainable , but action can never be tainted by the skepticism which invades the passive precincts of man 's nature . If life be a dream , then one may still have Calderon 's belief that such a dream permits moral action ; if knowledge be of no avail , one may still follow Voltaire and cultivate the garden ; if agnosticism shuts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his will and with Comte take up his social duties undismayed . Those whose strict scientific conceptions tend to sever them from the far off sources of spiritual life are ever the ones who recommend a course of activity in life , when it is quite thinkable that such activity depends upon the acceptance of those remote ideals which the skeptical critics reject . As a result , systems of action and philosophies of work have ever placed the affair of action upon naught . For this reason , the individualistic " I will " // can find no support in the scientific view of things in the light of which man 's life is limited by the natural istic horizon ; if thinking can proceed upon this basis , which is quite doubtful , it seems impossible for action to be carried on in the scientific spirit of immediacy . The problem of action is made more perverse , more paradoxical , when it is observed that those who raise the human will above the restricted realm of scientific thinking are not the ones who commend activity for man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the free initiative , still recommend work ; those who have come into possession of the limitless will , discoun tenance activity . Where Geulincx delivers the will from the meshes of the corporeal world and identifies it with the will of God , he refuses to conclude that man can therefore do everything , and asserts the proud negation , nihil volo . With the strong Satanism of Milton and Blake , belief in the supremacy of the will leads to nothing more than ideas and words . In the instances of Emerson and Stendhal , one observes how these strong immoralists were ever disinclined to make malicious use of the over-free will which they had discovered . The same practical passivism erected upon an energistic basis is none the less apparent in Stirner and Nietzsche , whose extravagant anarchism and atheism , instead of leading their authors to take up arms against earth and heaven , merely left them in a Dionysian condition wherein activity was purely internal and personal . In the case of Schopenhauer , the paradox is most strident , for where , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do all , the moral conclusion which follows is to the effect that the will should do nothing : where , by its very nature , the will is not only free but almighty , " the practical exercise of the indi viduated will can only lead to remorse , " while the just // conclusion has to do with renunciation and the denial of the will-to-live.27 In its special form , the dialectic of Schopenhauer is quite different from if not opposed to that of Geulincx ; but , since both these activists rele gate causality to the Supreme Being , whether God or the Will-to-Live , and since both alike suffer the indi vidual to participate in this omnipotent will , both Geu lincx and Schopenhauer may be said to proceed from the same metaphysical notion of all-willing to the same moral conclusion of no-willing . If , therefore , in the career of voluntarism , they who have no metaphysical right to believe in action still recommend work , while they who know the secret of all-willing refuse to allow action , the problem of per sonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexing ; indeed , the problem of action seems even more confusing than the question of thought . In the instances of Geulincx and Schopenhauer , where the dialectical profundity lies , the secret of the paradox seems to lurk in the special question of individualism ; thus it is the " I act " which appears so appalling to them . With Geulincx , self-inspection leads to self despection , 28 just as ' in the case of Schopenhauer it is the idea that the whole will-to-live is concealed with the individual 's brain , = ? which forces the thinker to repudi ate that personal omnipotence which seems to him so terrible . Scientific thinkers , whose skepticism screens from their eyes the august and fearful meaning of the human will , are very ready to recommend action because they have no means of knowing what the word " action " means . With the scientific thinker of modern times , the appeal to action as a way of solving the problem of life has never been more than a makeshift , a subterfuge , a sop to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendTHE // ency to shrink from action the moment that action becomes possible has been the most pronounced , most perplexing tendency . For this reason , he who desires to know the meaning of the " I will , " is bound to be disappointed when he searches the record of the voluntaristic philosophers , so that it seems almost impossible for the individualist of the present day to gather the rich harvest of activism , blighted as this was in the day of its fruitage . As soon as Taoism had delivered man from the world , it imposed upon him the ideal of " doing-nothing " ; Yoga , with its philosophy of work , was equally serious in its injunction to worklessness ; Aristotelian morality , which started out boldly with the notion of energy as the most satisfactory thing in the life of man , came to the conclusion that after all it is the " energy of contemplation " which marks the summit of man 's life in its ascent to godhead ; Kantian morality , with its much-heralded freedom of the will , allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered it to the mercies of the categorical imperative ; Fichte 's ego posits itself only to become passive in the absolutistic turn which this voluntarist gave to the human self . Hence , Geulincx and Schopenhauer seem to be no exception to the rule that , the more the self makes of itself , the less it becomes ; the more the will is freed , the less liberty does it enjoy . Indeed , under the auspices of naturalism and determinism , where the world of sense is given over to the sons of men , there is more appreciable freedom of living than in idealistic and libertarian systems which grant all freedom in theory only to yield none in practice . Voluntarism , as this appears more vividly and concretely in Milton and Blake , in Stendhal and Stirner , in Wagner and Nietzsche , is a disappointment , an InVain , as Nietzsche called it . In the failure to assert through action that will which 13S THE GROUND AND GOAL , OF HUMAN LIFE the voluntarist has affirmed in thought , the apostle of will has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long assumed the supremacy of humanity and reason . Because of its naive assumptions , voluntarism has thus been led to treat the will as Abraham his only-begotten ; can the individualistic angel stay the sword ? At the moment when the will was idealized it was destined to become an object of sacrifice , an act in which appears the exquisite paradox of all voluntaristic systems . The thought that seems to have been uppermost in the mind of the voluntarist was to the effect that , although self-initiative was the dearest of voluntaristic ideals , the deliberate sacrifice of this principle might be even dearer , while life itself might proceed will-less , as Israel might somehow come into existence apart from Isaac . If much learning can make one mad , much reasoning make one irrational , much willing may perhaps make one will-less ; from the extremes of assertion and denial , the will of individualism has been called upon to suffer . Much as individualism believes in the will , individualism does not delude itself into thinking that the effect of willing is so likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express ; to individualism , although the fate of the will in the world is a subject of limitless importance , the actual will of the individual is far from being the omnipotent will-to-live of Schopenhauer , nor does individualism find it possible to exercise the belief that the individual has such a wealth of willing at his command that he may either assert or deny the initiative within him . To have that initiative and to rejoice in its thrills are indeed the privileges which individualism sees fit to express , but the power to take one 's life up or lay one 's life down is a power to which individualism does not lay confident claim . Such idealistic supremacy is something which the individual of the day can not assume . // Since individualism must admit that scientism has the upper hand , while the egoistic initiative has been forced into a position painfully secondary , individualism is not ready to indulge in the noble excesses of a renunciatory philosophy . Indeed , the individualist feels that , so slender is his hold on what he calls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble act of self-negation , even if he thought this might be wise and just . To assert or to deny the will ethically is to have complete possession of the will metaphysically , so that the average person does neither the one nor the other ; the average person , whom individualism would convert to the doctrine of being one 's self , lets the will merely slip through his hands , neither holding on nor letting go . Of the two tendencies , the realizing by means of self-assertion and the renouncing through self-negation , the self-assertorial seems the better one for the individualist , inasmuch as the forces of his world are all making for the materialized mass rather than for the punctuated form of individualized existence . Where the rationalistic presumption of man 's supremacy may tend to produce self-negation , the realistic situation as appreciated by the egoist of the day warns the individual that he must assert himself . Hence the terrors of self-willing , as these showed themselves to Oriental and Pagan thinkers , to Geulincx and Schopenhauer , have little or no meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will out beyond the proper limits of his essential being . Scientism will take care of the negative side of man 's volitions , so that individualism would better exercise concern for his individual welfare as the one who wills himself . But it was not merely a superior conception of the world as a world of reason which persuaded the individualist to restrain his efforts of self-assertion ; in company with this superior idea of the outer world 14o THE GROUND AND GOAL , OF HUMAN LIFE there went an inferior conception of the will which was to exert itself . From this twofold eighteenth-century prejudice , the superiority of reason and the inferiority of the self , one strives in vain to be free . Yet individualism realizes that , if the bright dream of reasonableness has not faded , the supremacy of pure thought has become obscured so that one may not count too much upon the possession of that which Cartesians and Kantians so confidently affirmed . But , where intellectualism has been waning , individualism has been waxing ; whence , if the understanding is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood tide . The ego of egoism , far removed from the alleged ego of rationalism , is now something more than a bit of rationality or sensuality ; the ego of current individualism has become the supporter of the whole inner life with its ideals of beauty , worth , and truth . For this reason , individualism advances its first principle with the feeling that self-assertion means the assertion of those ideal interests for which the self stands , ideals of joy , value , and truth . Hence , the belief in the individualistic initiative really amounts to a belief in the affirmation of those things which are dear to the ego , soul-states , initiatives , and ideals . What once belonged to the objective world of reason has now become the possession of the subjective world of selfhood ; and , with this new content , the ego 's attempt at self-assertion can never again be confused with abstract self-cogitating or concrete self-loving . With the new estimates which individualism has placed upon action , the situation is just the opposite of that which once obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inferiority of will in mind , the Enlightenment said , Man is capable but not worthy of willing , the age of culture declares , Man is certainly worthy of willing , but it is a question whether he is capable of it . The will of Emerson and Ibsen , THE STRUGGLE FOR SELFHOOD ' 4 ' of Wagner and Nietzsche , should have self-expression in the world ; but is the world so constituted that such self-expression is possible ? Is the metaphysics of volition on a par with the ethics of willing , so that selfexpression shall find its place in the world of work ? Suppose , then , one abandon the almost meaningless conception of action which obtained in the rationalisticosensuous Enlightenment , and centre his attention upon the more sincere and characteristic notion of work as this has appeared in the age of culture ; will it not appear as though the world should make room for such work ; will it not appear further that the world , as organized by scientism , has made room for nothing more than the functional conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown itself to be worthy , may we not assume that there is an appropriate realm in which this worth may display itself ? That such a realm of true volition is not to be found in the physical view of the world must appear to any one who will take the time to compare the ideals of individualism with the principles of scientific thinking . Because of the world 's singular unfitness for the human ego , the human ego working for the first time in a selfconscious , self-willed manner , has made a world of its own , the world of immoralism of such unhappy repute . Before one can appreciate the gravity with which the individualist laid the foundations of his own world , the ideals which impelled him to abandon the world of scientism must be duly considered . The simple fact that some kind of action does express itself in some kind of a world-order is not the same as the serious ideal which assures one that genuine action should express itself in an appropriate cosmos . In the ancient world of things , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffice to contain the Christian who had dreamed of things better and more spiritual ; of such spiritual142 THE GROUND AND GOAL , OF HUMAN LIFE izing ego the world was unworthy . Now , because again the human self is surrounded by the physical order , it does not follow that he can find his home there . The primitive Christian promptly repudiated the cosmos which he found enveloping him , and for a while he went on his way worldless , cheered by the thought that inwardly he was possessed of something more worthy than the world-order had to offer him ; but the time came when he too elaborated his own world-order , the world of spirit peculiar to Scholastic times . Will the new individual be so brave as to reject the cosmos of things physical which surrounds him ; will he at last be able to find his own world ? That which the individual in the age of culture asks of the surrounding order is a true place , a place for his mind as well as a mere location for his body . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his aestheticism has led him to withdraw from the physical order so that he may have soul-states of his own in all their decadent aestheticism ; perhaps , this same fate will be found to overtake him when , in the pursuit of a world which shall possess the freedom of individual initiative , he shall deem it fit to retire once more to the inward self where , in immoralistic manner , he shall use his initiative as a mere will-to-selfhood . The physical order does not permit action as such ; on that point the individual can no longer remain in doubt . That which the physical order of ambitious scientism does allow and advise is something automatic rather than free , functional rather than creative . Under the auspices of scientism , which finds no place for the human initiative , the fact remains that creative work goes on in the realm of art , of moral ideals , of religious beliefs ; but , while these are actually in the world of scientism , they are not of the world . Between the free ' creations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the // physical order , the worst of contradictions prevail . The recent history of culture has witnessed the rise and development of artistic , ethical , and religious ideas at once independent , self-contained , and intelligible ; yet there is nothing in the actual history of thought , as this is represented by authoritarian scientism , to justify the elaboration of these ideals . Undoubtedly , there are also a scientific art , a scientific ethics , and a scientific religion , however contradictory is the relation of the adjective to the substantive ; but who can doubt which of the two , the cultural or the scientific , is the true form of spiritual life ? Even if one show such bad judgment as to prefer the scientific product to the cultural one , he can not deny that the cultural one is none the less a fact with which he must settle ; and this settlement with the freer creations of the human will can hardly be made after the genial manner of a scientism which attempts to call all non-scientific forms of culture " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , rather than the type itself , which persists in calling attention to itself as culture indeed ; excluded from the orthodox realm of science , this spontaneous culture still exists and continues to expand its borders , to intensify its ideals . The automatic and functional form of action , adopted by scientism for the sake of pursuing its evolutionary analogies of organic existence in general , does not for a moment explain the data presented by complete experience . Experience does indeed present many examples of automatic activities peculiar to general bodily movement , breathing , and special muscular movements of the hands . But these simple and obvious forms of activity are far removed from the free creations of the will in the form of action as action . Spencer 's definition of conduct as " the aggregate of interdependent acts performed by an organism " is an example of the // candor which can pervade a scientism which has abandoned the idea that there is something extraordinary about the human species . It is true that scientism , with its social affiliations does attempt to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the realm of things humanistic have usually if not wholly confined themselves to anthropological data peculiar to primitive man . Granted that scientism explains the life and activity of primitive man , which itself is an open question , it is still more evident that such scientism has done no more by way of explaining the man of perfected culture than to call him degenerate . Where the Enlightenment studied nature apart from history , and the man of perfected culture and civilization was not disturbed , the affairs of the human self were not unsatisfactory ; but where , with the coming of the nineteenth century , both nature and human history were made the twin objects of investigation , the naturalistic soon overcame the humanistic , which latter appears in no other light than that of anthropology . In the case of man as man , the scientific conception of conduct fails to suffice ; not because man 's conduct is of a marvellous character , but because it is marked by the initiative , the improvising , the creating , out of which the cultural products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creations as functional processes , to regard artistic creations and moral performances as a part of the " aggregate of the interdependent acts of an organism , " is to reduce scientism to an absurdity . The attempt to socialize science or to make sociality scientific has been the undoing of scientism ; so that who can deny that Comte and Spencer have made scientism appear silly ? Evidence to this effect should be found in the swarm of sociologists who have attempted the disastrous combination of the physical and humanistic . That individualism should thus have become antiTHE // scientific and even anti-natural , as with the Decadents and Symbolists , should occasion no great alarm and sill less surprise . Is the ego to remain silent when the prevailing type of intellectual life is such as to negate that which he feels to be most characteristic of his being ? Individualism , which at times has rashly insisted upon the monstrous , the vicious , and the unnatural , is interested in nothing so much as that which may be called strictly human ; and if an individualist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is something in him different from the purely anthropological , does overdo the affair with Baudelairean or Nietzschean exaggeration , all that one need gather from such a performance is the secure thought that the individualistic initiative is practically boundless and incalculable . Persuaded that human life has a value of its own , the individualist has insisted upon the inviolability of his own impulses ; his volitional excesses in the direction of diabolism may be taken as exceptional means of proving the point in question . 3 . THE DEMANDS OF ' IMMORAI , ISM In the struggle for the worth of life , the essential conflict appears when the contrast between the functional and initiatory is made . The individualist can find no value in any course of conduct which does not spring from a strong , self-impelled " I will , " so that he is forced to turn aside from the genial paths of scientism and make his way alone . Where the desire for the inward joy of life , which could not be found in the drab hedonic pleasure-pain , made inevitable the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life will be found to lead to a vigorous immoralism . The naturalistic conception of man could afford the ego nothing higher than an automatic response to the objective demands of the scientific arrangement of society , // whence the individualist took the matter in his own hands and thus sought to lay down the principles of life in a hypernomian immoralism . Such " immoralism " often appears to amount to no more than mere transgression , in thought if not in deed ; but the essential principles of the immoralist are ever found in strength and inwardness , which strong assertion from within contrasts most strikingly with weak submission to that which is without . Where opposition enters into the ethical calculations of the immoralist , the non-conformity and disobedience involved are secondary to the principle of self-assertion ; immoralism has no desire to recognize the alleged authority of those standards which are set up by scientific thinking , even when this recognition appears in the form of resistance . The supreme moment of individualism lies in the autonomous " I will . " In contrasting the ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem as though scientism , with its usual attitude of opposition to all idealism , would negate both the metaphysical and the moral ideals of orthodox thought ; but this is not the case . Scientism , which was ready to remove ideals , has never found it expedient to efface the moral sanctions which followed from those spiritual ideals ; scientism did make rigorous use of its agnostic theory for the purpose of removing the spiritual world from the natural order , but scientism did not care to do away with the influence which came from that spiritual world . The scientists have removed the Good One , but the good remains . In the Enlightenment , nothing seemed more important than the removal of the orthodox Deity ; yet , where rationalism opposed theism , it was unwilling to set aside the ethics which had followed from theistic belief . At the climax of the rationalistic period , Kant was found dismissing the Deity but holding fast , and that with extraordinary vigor , to // the Deity 's law of duty . If , therefore , the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the rationalistic scientists , the ethical concep-tions of religion were either left untouched or actually furthered . The intellectualistic courage of the modern has thus been accompanied by immoralistic cowardice . In the later period of modern thought , at once nat-uralistic and cultural , scientism has been even more determined in saying " no " to the idealizing intellect while saying " yes " to the moralizing will . Scientism is thus innocent of immoralism . Why scientism should have performed a half-work only , is another question ; yet there should be no doubt that scientism was content to destroy certain accepted forms of thinking , while it remained more than loyal to equally traditional forms of action . In the case of such authoritarian thinkers as Comte and Darwin , Haeckel and Spencer , the attitude of ferocity toward ideas spiritual is accompanied by an attitude of extreme mildness toward spiritual motives , such as obedience , sympathy , and good-behavior . For this reason , one can discover little difference in moral value between Christian ethics and the ethical ideals of scientism . What one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made short work of the soul and the Deity , was the origination and elaboration of a morale of appropriate blindness and cruelty , so that those who look for great things from scientism have a right to claim that scientism is , when ethically considered , a great disappointment , if not a great deception . Comte fails to carry out in ethics the bold worldliness of his positivist physics ; Darwin 's bloody struggle for exist-ence finds no place in his domestic ethics of " socia-bility " ; Haeckel 's animalism ends before he draws his ethical conclusions ; Spencer 's Unknowable allows him to perfect an ethics of which the physically knowable was quite innocent . This saintliness of scientism should // be noted down as one of the surprises , one of the dis-appointments of the nineteenth century . Alas ! the docility of the brave , the weakness of the strong . Did they imagine , Kant the finisher of the eighteenth century , Spencer that of the nineteenth , that they had done enough ? Did they fear to destroy both God and godliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egoism , while less pretentious and less inclined to promise , has done the work that all-vaunted scientism failed and feared to take up , the work of setting aside the moral law . Scientism , with its eighteenth-century abstractness and nineteenth-cen-tury concreteness , has always sighed for order , which was for it the first law of earth as once it had been the first law of heaven ; scientism thus postulated a morality of reason , a morality of knowableness . In the latter period of scientism , this desire for order appears in the strange reverence for the " species , " the only shred of rationality left in the de-idealized. world of things . To the claims of the species , all must submit , hence the sociability of Darwinism , the sociality of Spencer 's ethics . The human species thus became society , when it became easy to conclude that the moral is the social , the immoral the anti-social . Individualism has never felt excessive regard for any impersonal order , and it is still less likely to feel this awe when the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a specimen . Whence this dread of the human self , this fear of the self when it indulges in an aesthetic withdrawal from the world to the inwardness of its soul-states , this hatred of the ego which proceeds from within outward toward its own " immoralistic " goal ? Scientism must explain its own timidity ; meanwhile , scientism must ad-mit that , where it failed to indulge in an ethical assert-iveness peculiar to its own principles , art went forward and postulated its own morale , where scientism abode // by spiritual ideals of life . In the name of Romanticism , both Schleiermacher and Schlegel sought to set aside the moralic restrictions of an ethics based upon the exteriority of scientific thinking . Was Schleiermacher an immoralist when he emancipated religion by saying , " Piety can never be an instinct craving for a mess of metaphysical and moral crumbs " ; 3 ? was he likewise an irrationalist ? Schleiermacher was rather the individualist who sought in religion the free expression of the inner life apart from the restraints of morality . Schlegel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Schlegel , all genuine morality was to be found in spontaneity : Alle Originalitdt ist moralisch ; 31 such morality must initiate its expression in opposition : Die erste Regung der Sittlichkeit ist Opposizion gegen die Gesetzlichkeit.32 This attitude of opposition to the moral law as an established thing casts the romanticist back upon the self , the assertion of which leads to the individualistic doctrine of Ironie , the Ironie for which Schlegel was famous , die Ironic der Ironie.33 But this romantic despair of the self was far from being one with the scientific fear of the ego ; with Romanticism , the self was all , even when the self was nothing . It would indeed sound strange were one to affirm that science lacked the strength which culture enjoyed and expressed ; yet some such affirmation must be made . Perhaps the cultural affirmation of the will 's inherent worth was made possible by the scientific perception that the human ego owes naught to the artificially organized world of institutions ; yet the attitude of the artist of the nineteenth century was more naturalistic than scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evasion was destined to become the fundamental principle and leading motive of an art which // should seek to set aside the , limitations of exterior law . Did Stendhal and Emerson , did Dostoievsky and Nietzsche , make use of the physics of scientism to de stroy the ethics of scientism , and was such scientism the " fear and evasion of pessimism " ? Scientism has no culture for the upbuilding of the human soul ; hence scientism can not further the soul in the latter 's attempt at self-realization . It was art then which was to come to the relief of the self-asserting ego ; and , where the scientific treatise could not avail , the romantic novel was made the medium of emancipation . Scientism has done nothing for the human atom ; that atom has had to work out its own salvation by means of art . It was art which in its unique freedom taught the human self to make use of culture as a means of self-emancipation , and this culture was , alas ! connected with crime . In the self-valuing individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the foci of that immoralism which individualists made use of in seeking the worth of life . So intimate is the connection between the cul tural and the criminal that Nietzsche 's dual derivation of the principles in question can not fail to provide sug gestions . According to the reasoning of this immoral ist , both Semite and Aryan had the fate to establish the bond between self-development within and sin without . In the story of Eve , the serpent conveys the idea that the fruit of the precious tree , instead of affording mere passing pleasure , had the effect of awakening the mind to the knowledge of ethical distinctions which the Deity had reserved for Himself . Enlightenment and disobedi ence , culture and crime thus went hand in hand . In the Aryan mind , with the masculine myth of Prometheus , the secret of heaven was to be learned by sinful dis obedience only ; so that the sin of the Aryan man was one with the transgression of the Semitic woman . ' It // was in the aesthetic recognition of the blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of exceptional ethical enlightenment , that Nietzsche was led to seek in the Wagnerian opera the restoration of the " barbaric and titanic " as these had been felt by the ancients before the will was silenced by formal intellectualism . Where , in matters of superior ethics , science has been silent , art has been correspondingly eloquent . Scientism has recognized the need of the individualistic " I will , " and , where the demands of the human self have been observed , they have promptly been filled by the old hedonism in a more scientific form ; " scientific hedonism " of Spencerian fame has been at once the worst and the best that scientism has had to offer . Then , in another vein , scientism showed its ability to imitate when Darwin took the eighteenth-century conscience of Butler and submitted it to scientific interpretation . For some reason which aesthetics must supply , the artistic consciousness of the nineteenth century could find no joie de vivre in the biological sense of beneficial pleasure , could feel no detent in the new biological conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immoralism has placed its affair upon the ideal of strength , the inward strength of a self asserting " I will . " Aesthetic Milton was aware of the possibilities of strength when he made his Satan say , " To be weak is to be miserable " ; and Blake supplied the positive counterpart of such Satanism by adding , " Energy is eternal delight . " When contemporary scientific ethics comes forward with its social , cudchewing animal , it is probably unaware of the fact that the beast of prey has not been wholly exterminated . The scientific lion is thus found eating straw like the ox . Strength was thus the categorical imperative of immoralistic individualism in its development from Milton to Neitzsche . In postulating such a principle as im152 THE GROUND AND GOAL , OF HUMAN LIFT perative for the self-asserting ego , immoralism never expressed itself in such a manner as to justify the identification of itself with mere immorality . What the immoralist does , is not to transgress the law but to repudiate the law , to rise above the common ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " becomes equivalent to the social , the " bad " to the antisocial , the task of ethical elevation is not supposed to appear difficult ; and , if the egoist is ever guilty of wrong , his is the sin of intellect rather than of will . Scientism has been all but able to cast the social net about those whose idealistic morality abounded in the sense of submission and tenderness ; but the scientific net has been spread in vain in the sight of the artistic bird . Artistic morality with its prejudice for genuine values has not been inclined to exchange the self for the species , worth for utility , humanity for society ; so that artistic morality is found just outside the gray scientific wall . The method of immoralism may have been severe , but it would seem as though no sincere believer in the true worth of life could regret the romantic revolt of the human , ego . Perhaps something more than mere " strength " will be found necessary for investing morality with a content , but the emancipation of morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to be hard , impassible , and destructive were moralic methods due to the exigencies of the case . Romanticism had not been guilty of mere aestheticism with its ironical delight in mere soul-states and its harmless maxim of art for art 's sake . In the midst of these aestheticisms , the sterner stuff of self-assertiveness had made its fibre felt . The English poetry of Milton and Blake had prepared the way ; but , without reference to more classical immoralism , the romantic school proceeded to assert the " I will . " Schlegel may have // seemed more eccentric than unethical , his Lucinde more startling than convincing . The realistic school was less declamatory ; and , with its preference for action , it gave the new ego a will , and made him a self-propelled creature in the real world . At the same time , the living , active immoralist of realism was lacking in clearness , so that his motives were to be more inferred than observed . From Schlegel to Stendhal-Beyle , the aesthetic connection as seen by criticism must appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What Schlegel 's character had felt , that Stendhal 's hero did . Beylism is a philosophy of immoralism , is marked by the absence of all expected ideals ; even if the reader of beylisme can not find in the premises the subject and predicate which leap forth stark and strong in the conclusion , he has a right to believe that they are there . The title , Red and Black , symbolic of army and church , is suggestive of the ethical vigor and sternness of the immoralistic author . Owing to Beyle 's habit of following a sort of Cartesian spiritual automatism , the aesthetic method assumes a pragmatic character , while the romantic is silenced by the realistic . As Maurice Hewlett said of Stendhal , in his preface to the translation of La Chartreuse de Parma , he was " a man of fire cloaked in ice . " In other words , the individualism of Beyle , wanting in the enthusiasm of the Romantic school and not yet ripe for the cruelties of the Decadence , represents the individual as one who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them because they make no appeal to his individuating consciousness . The egoistic asbestos with which Stendhal thus protects the individualism of his characters was destined , however , to assume a different form and function in later individualism ; Baudelaire reassumes it in his ideal of impassibilite , whereby the ego is led to look with apathy upon the feelings and // needs of others ; Nietzsche popularizes it in his maxim , " Be hard ! " The sclerotic character of selfhood , as it was indi-cated by Beyle , was apparently the place where indi-vidualistic immoralism had its beginning . And yet , had it not been for the development of the Decadence , it might safely be assumed that the indifference to the moral ideal , as this is shown in the delineation of the Duchess Gina 's personality in La Chartreuse , would have meant no more than Prevost 's Manon Lescaut , who has yet to be connected with the immoralistic move-ment . Manon failed to find a place among the indi-vidualists for the reason that she had none of the intro-spective equipment of Lucinde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous in the Duchess Gina . Manon sinned , but did not find her self-hood in sin . Hence , while we may restrace the history of immoralistic individualism back to Beyle , we are not justified in pursuing a regressus which should leave us in the middle of the eighteenth century . The immoralism of Stendhal consists , not so much in a direct opposition to the moral ideal , as in a cool analysis of motives as these spring from the will as such ; with his admiration for Napoleon , a character which was destined to inspire the immoralism of Dos-toievsky 's Raskolnikow , Stendhal pursues the psychology of volition as if ethical norms had no existence . His philosophic aim was expressed in his own words , when he said , " I seek to recount with truth and clearness that which passes within my own heart . " as With this ideal for himself as writer , Stendhal creates characters which are capable of the most intimate powers of intro-spection so far as their volitional states are concerned . This voluntaristic introspectiveness which , in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character // to consult with his own motives , involves constant use of such expressions as , " He said to himself , " " she mused , " " they said to themselves . " They are not con-fined to the hero , as the criticism of Bourget would suggest , but all the characters , from the prince to the servant , indulge the introspection of the will ; if it does not amount to obsession , as Bourget asserts , 38 it finds the author so engrossed with his desire to discover motives that he must make use of the it se dit some two hundred times . To act naturally and with strength , and to reflect clearly upon that which passes in the mind , seem to have taken the place of morality with Stendhal 's Beylism . His own character that of warrior and lover , the poles of his philosophy are found to con sist in the sense of power and pleasure ; all that can restrain him is the inner lack of ability to arrive at his desired end , and this restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immoralism of Stendhal had nothing obtrusive about it ; a generation later , Dostoiev sky placed the self-asserting ego in a more polemical position , whence Nietzsche was able to develop his idea of the self as the strong one . The Beylism of Stendhal , by no means as exaggerated as the Satanism of Baudelaire , has much of modern immoralism to its credit . To observe the peculiar char acter of Stendhal 's ethics , one can do no better than contrast his methods with those of his contemporary Balzac , who enjoyed far more popularity in his day , and who is more likely to be esteemed a classic , even where Stendhal was far more subtle and significant . With Balzac , who took the world for granted without pausing to inquire concerning the final sources of human perversity , sin is a fact which we must accept and in the delineation of which the realistic writer may exer cise his powers of description to the full . But Balzac // does not look upon the human self as setting the law aside in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil act . His Valerie Marneffe , who enjoys the distinction of being among the most complete of female offenders , never thought to negate the law which she so relentlessly violated ; hence she is a sinner without being an immoralist . In the case of Vautrin , in Old Goriot , there is indeed some such suggestion of the immoralism known to the romantic Schlegel and the realistic Stendhal , for this would-be superman saw the possible distinction between moralistic submission and im.moralistic nihilism . Said he to young Rastignac , " there are but two alternatives ? stupid obedience or revolt . " In addition to this Stendhalian distinction , Balzac 's bad man gives the following advice : " Do you know how a man makes his way here ? By brilliant genius or by skilful corruption . You must either cut your way through the masses of men like a cannon ball , or steal among them like a plague . " Yet , in this ideal of selfhood in success , it is plain that Balzac , whose eighteenth-century ethics did not permit him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not in sympathy with the principle which the hero expresses ; Balzac merely portrays that which his conservative philosophy can not justify . Now Stendhal makes it plain that he sides with his sinners , who both transgress with their wills and negate with their intellects the law that seeks to thwart their impulses and ideas . For this reason , we may gather from Stendhal the immoralistic data and relations which , when developed by Balzac , are but materials which serve for the elaboration of a comedic ' hurnaine . The first clear expression of immoralism as a form of individualism appears in Emerson , who , in advance of French Decadents and Russian Nihilists , placed the affair of the self upon the naught . In some phases of // his doctrine , Emerson is content to set the self in oppo sition to the State , as when he says , " Every actual State is corrupt ; good men will not obey the laws too well " ; 37 and he further speaks of society as " this foul compromise , this vituperated Sodom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individualistic doc-trine does not prevent him from repudiating the moral law as well as the State . In this antinomianism , or " hypernomianism , " as he calls it , he insists that , " Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to this or that ; the only right is that which is after my con-stitution , the only wrong what is against it . " 39 When Emerson has observed that the darlings of nature are the great , the strong , the beautiful , he is ready for a more thoroughly immoralistic expression of his doc-trine . Thus he says , " It is an esoteric doctrine of soci-ety that a little wickedness is good to make muscle " ; 40 as the social , so the individualistic , " There is no man who is not at some time indebted to his vices , as no plant that is not fed on manures. " 41 The whole tenor of Emersonian egoism is that of selfhood in strength , the strength which makes the self impassible and hard ; while Emerson does not imitate either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to look upon him-self as one who , under certain circumstances , might be called " The Devil 's child . " 43 Science is incapable of the individualistic hardness found in Stendhal and Emerson ; at heart , science with all its attempts at intellectual severity is soft and obedi-ent . With its scientific " sociability , " Darwinism is a fine exemplification of the manner in which intellectual rigor may melt before the alleged claims of social mor-ality ; yet , did not Darwin perhaps long for somewhat of that saving hardness with which the egoist had learned 15S THE GROUND AND GOAL OF HUMAN LIFE to deliver his soul ? In spite of his sickness and science , Darwin was not unaware of the possible place which the human self might occupy and enjoy could that human ego feel himself free from the principle of Natural Selection which was so domineering in the world of organisms in general . In a letter to Asa Gray , written September 17th , 1861 , Darwin said , " If man were made of brass or iron , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived , I should perhaps be convinced ( of design ) . " The fact that man by means of a superior morale might make himself of brass or iron , seems never to have occurred to this naturalist with his tendresse , but the aesthetic individ ualism of the mid-nineteenth century perfected this metallic morality for which Darwin 's soul longed . One must thus turn from Darwin to Dostoievsky for the severe philosophy of life which is to save the soul of the individual . In placing the iron individual in the actual world of men and women , Dostoievsky has the honor , if not also the responsibility , of making individualism some-thing more than an idea ; Stendhal and Emerson merely conjectured where Dostoievsky actualized . Before Dos toievsky took up his pen of iron , Turgenieff had pre-pared the way for egoism by creating a nihilistic atmosphere . As an individualistic doctrine , nihilism consisted in repudiating all authority , while the practice of the doctrine led to a forceful rejection of all estab lished institutions ; " we , " said Turgenieff 's Bazaroff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most use ful . At the present time , the most useful thing of all is rejection ? we reject . " 43 Indulging in such senti ments , Bazaroff , the most perfect of Turgenieffian ego ists , came to be known to his youthful disciples as a " bird of prey , " although there was nothing in the // actual conduct of the invalid , for such he was , as to justify such a departure from the realm of tame birds . Dostoievsky differs from Turgenieff and contrasts with Darwin in that he calls upon his hero to come out of the scientific order which has so benignly created man , and assume an attitude of opposition toward it . At the same time , the metallic morality of Dostoievsky 's Raskolnikow , far from being a mere impulse , was based upon a conception of life somewhat different in ethical significance from the Darwinian biology . Psychologi cally viewed , Raskolnikow was so impulsive as to be unable to connect his inner motive with the outer social act ; but for this weakness his morale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behind the actual Raskolnikow that the latter can convey the volitions of the former in a manner purely spasmodic . " His chin quivered " ; " he set his teeth " ; " he shud dered " ; " he fidgetted " : such were the indications of the volitional states which the hero was to transmute into vigorous action . " Attribute some part of this quasi-voluntarism to the abnormality of the man , and the rest of it may be understood as temporary weakness due to the fact that the act to be performed demands too much contrast between ideals of individual worth and the norms of the social order . Mere naturalism or brute force will not carry him through to the end of the terrible deed he is planning , since the " terrible " struggle for existence is far from justifying egoistic self-assertion ; in the philosophy of Dostoievsky , the struggle for selfhood results in the elaboration of the maxim , " A cultured man has the right to commit crime " ; in all this , nothing is said about the scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toievsky attempts a bit of anthropology quite alien to anything in Darwinism . Upon the basis of this im160 THE GROUND AND GOAL OF HUMAN LIFE moralistic biology , Raskolnikow is allowed to commit his " crime , " although the nihilism of Dostoievsky 's art is such as to lead to the conclusion , " There is no crime . " So important is the rationale of the culture-criminal ; that its ipsissintia verba deserve exact repetition and careful consideration : Men are divided into ordinary and extraordinary men . The former must live in a state of obedience , and have no right to break the law , inasmuch as they are nothing more than ordinary men ; the latter have a right to commit every kind of crime , and to break every law , from the fact that they are extraor dinary men . . All legislators and rulers of men , commenc ing with the earliest down to Lycurgus , Solon , Mahomet , Napo leon , etc. , have one and all been criminals , for , while giving new laws , they have naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by society and transmitted by its progenitors . These men most certainly never hesitated to shed blood , as soon as they saw the advantage of doing so . It may even be remarked that nearly all these benefactors of humanity have been terribly bloodthirsty . . . . Nature divides men into two categories : the first an inferior one , comprising ordinary men , the kind whose material function it is to reproduce specimens like themselves ; the other , a superior one , comprising men who have the gift or power to make a new word , thought , or deed , felt . . To the first belong in a gen eral way , conservatives , men of order , who live in a state of obedience and love it . . The next class , however , consists exclusively of men who break the law , or strive , according to their capacity or power , to do so . . . . The first group is always predominant in the present ; the second , however , is master of the future . One class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other arouses humanity and makes it act . Both have absolutely the same right to exist , yea , even to the day of the New Jerusalem.45 While , in all this , the general idea of criminal resist ance and repudiation of the established order stands in the foreground , the morale of Dostoievsky , doing away with crime and upholding culture as it does , tempers itself to the extent of limiting such cultured criminality to the superior man , while even he , instead of pursuing his own interests alone , is supposed to usher in a better day . As reformer , Dostoievsky offers severe contrast // to most other egoists , Stendhal , Emerson , Baudelaire , Stirner , Nietzsche ; yet it must not be overlooked that , with Raskolnikow , the " Day of the New Jerusalem " was never anything more than a sentiment , for it was the present which claimed him as its own . Moreover , Dostoievsky 's immoralist was unable to abide by the metallic rigor of his original resolution ; so that finally one sees him confessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can affirm the act of his will , he is but flesh and blood after all.46 The career of subsequent immoralism is significant of the same opposition to that same social order to whose relief chivalrous scientism has so lately come and that in true Quixotic fashion . Ibsen was not quite himself when , in 1863 , he wrote The Pretenders , in which Skule has his " great king's-thought " to carry through . Where the Pretender fails to seize his throne , others are more intrepid , if not more successful . These true Ibsenesque egos win the victory over the private intellect where perhaps they are unable to overcome the public will . According to Nora Helmer of Doll 's House , a woman 's first duty is toward herself as a human being , while she should seek to discover which is right , society or the self . According to Helen Alving , who fought her Ghosts , all morality is so machine-sewn that the whole affair unravels with the untying of a single knot , while law and order are responsible for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who criti cized the Master Builder , has no patience with " sickly conscience , " and prefers the " ideals of a ruffian " ; herself a " light-haired little devil , " she is almost , but not altogether , ready to seize the tower of selfhood . As there is in Ibsen no place for scientific morality in which the ego is but a specimen of the species , so later immoralism has the same lesson for the searcher after // ideals . According to Schiller , man is only completely man when he plays ; according to Sudermann , one is only one 's self when one sins . Such was the case with Paul Meyerhoeffer in Danie Care , with Regina in Cat 's Bridge , with Magda in Die Heimat . " We must sin if we wish to grow " ; so concludes Magda , whose musical culture , like that of Evelyn Inness , came only through sexual crime . With all self-asserting egos , it is the belief in life 's worth which leads to the immoralistic program ; it is culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimed in to make the solution of the music still more difficult . " One can fancy an intense personality created out of sin , " says he.4i Later , Wilde preferred to consider culture alone rather than crime alone as the true means of self-realization ; thus he says , " Crime , which under certain circumstances may seem to have created individualism , must take cog nizance of other people , and interfere with them . " 4. s Culture is thus more individualistic than crime ; hence it is better for individuating purposes . To state the cause of immoralism is not to explain it , to explain is not to justify . Yet , in stating the fact that a century of immoralism insisted upon the worth of the self even when that simple assertion was to involve non-scientific culture and anti-scientific crime , is to explain that these methods were deemed necessary for a self surrounded by the narrow synthesis in which the individual was but a specimen of the species ; the justification must be more general . If it be assumed that the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas drawn as conclusions from the study of nature , it does not follow that contem porary scientific conclusions are the most suitable ones . The ego may indeed be destined to repose in solitari ness ; but , if we assume that the human self must have // some kind of world , it is to be hoped that a more liberal study of the natural order will effect a higher synthesis in the light of which the self may find its home in the natural order . Where scientism is not sufficient unto the needs of the self , it may still be shown that the self may find its place in that which is greater than scientism : namely , Nature . III . THE STRUGGLE FOR THE TRUTH OF LIFE In considering the final form of the struggle for selfhood , it might seem as though the principle of truth left room for none of the dispute attendant upon the more plastic notions of joy and worth . Where we may have such joys as we will and elaborate such values as we chose , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a certain rigidity about it . Toward truth , our attitude should be one of obeisance ; for , where we may perhaps assume mastery over joys and values , it is truth which rules us . Were we speaking of absolute truth , this would indeed be the case , just as the presence of absolute joy or absolute worth might be regarded as something commanding perfect submission on our part ; but , since our concern is with truth as applied to life , we feel that we have here somewhat the same freedom enjoyed by individualistic aesthetics and ethics . By means of certain adjectival truths , we speak of scientific truth and religious truth , so that we are justified in making use of the expression , " individualistic truth , " or the truth of the self . It is with the adjectival qualification that we have to do , so that one can not say that , inasmuch as scientific truth has been established in this or that manner , we can not hope to establish an individualistic truth in opposition to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as friendly to one form of culture as to another ; whence there is no reason to feel that the goddess of truth , // having expressed a preference for scientism , will spurn the advances of individualism . Thus , the position of individualism in this third question is not unlike its position in connection with the other two ; where individualism sought for the joy of life in soul-states , for the worth of life in independent initiatives , it may proceed to search for the truth of life in the self-assertion of the human ego . I. TII TRUTH OF ' SI , rHOOD As is the case with almost ill the phases of individualism , one must look back with pathos to the Enlightenment , when , with the self in its possession , the age was unaware of wealth , and promptly squandered it upon the world and the social order . The individualism of the day , far from rejoicing in the self-knowledge of Descartes , can not claim to have even a Socratic hold upon the self . But , if the self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been forced to abandon its claim that the self will be found true , nor must one draw the lamentable corollary that , since the world is known , therefore one must accept the world as the truth . Descartes was sure of the self but was doubtful about the physical order ; Stirner is sure of the objective order , but can not be so easily convinced of the self . Yet Stirner is the better individualist of the two ; in comparison with him , Descartes is almost nothing . In its most essential form , self-truth consists in the right to affirm the self as such ; where the joy of life permits the individualistic " I think , " and the worth of life the " I will , " the truth of life allows the individualistic " I am . " This principle of individualism is not one with the primitive cogito , ergo sum of Descartes ; indeed , the truth of individualism is better expressed by the judgment in its converted form : I am ; therefore I. // think . The self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is its self . ( 1 ) The Passion for Predication In the consideration of truth , one is disposed to feel that the question at hand is exceptional , so that the determination of joy by the senses and value by the will does not justify the free deduction of truth by the ego as such . This feeling of reverence toward the true , this shudder in its presence , is wholesome indeed and not illogical ; but it is beset by a peculiar danger for the individualist . While the individualist is spending his precious time adoring truth in the abstract , some less devout person takes possesson of the sources of knowledge whence the ego is forced to draw water , not from the springs , but from the wells of truth as these have been dug by certain investigators . In looking at truth in its superb limitlessness , the individual fails to observe that some special form of human culture has been erecting a truth-wall well inside the horizon of knowledge . In this manner , the vast life-truth has been enclosed within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern Reason or modern Science . The result has been to endow , if not to fetter , truth by the application of limiting adjectives , so that truth has at times been , not truth eo ipso , but classic truth which to Aristotle seemed final , scholastic truth which brought the mind of Aquinas to the omega of truth 's alphabet , rationalistic truth which had the last word for Voltaire , scientific truth with which Comte and Spencer sought to end all speculation in the world . All except the last of these adjectives has worn off in the wear and tear of life , so that one can not help believing that the fate of the adjective " scientific " will be parallel to that of the other qualifying predicates . In the midst of these fluctuating truths , one factor seemed constant ; it was // the " I think " of individualism . From the adjectival point of view , Aristotle differed from Voltaire , Aquinas from Spencer ; yet , in all four types of thinking , the presence of the thinking self was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it struggles against the truth of life as this is formulated in a special manner , and the special truth-mode which individualism opposes to-day is the scientific one . Ancient truth had its opponents as one sees in the history of the Stoics ; Mediaeval truth was fought by nominalism ; the truth of the Enlightenment was negated by Hume ; and may not the truth Hof scientism be opposed by individualism ? It has ever been the exterior generalization which has come in for its share of the conflict ; and , in the resistance to the scientific synthesis , this conflict is now going on in the field of individualism . Far from being truth as such , classic and scholastic , rationalistic and scientific truth has been a mixture of principles , opinions , and terms . Terms , or words , which would seem to be the least formidable , are often the greatest foes of progress toward a higher synthesis ; next come opinions , which are furthered by authority ; last of all , principles , which , while the most difficult to withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is most anxious to offset the influence of words and opinions whose domination is little suspected until one conjures with a term like " theology , " " reason , " " science . " How can these august expressions signify anything but august truth itself ? If the ultimate can not be found without upon the horizon , may it be found within in the " I am " of the thinker ? The actual pursuit of truth has always been conducted under the auspices of a peculiarly human passion , the passion for predication . Given a subject , like some physical fact or psychic phenomenon , and the human mind will not rest until it has set up some sort of conTHE // nection between these and some other fact or phenomenon . This is very largely as it should be , and one can hardly provide for the progress of knowledge apart from the persistent predication of the restless , imaginative intellect . Physical phenomena shall be connected with psychical ones : such was the dictum of the primitive mind . Psychical phenomena shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the dictum of the contemporary mind . Where both popular and sober thinking has always exercised with freedom the right of predication , definite periods have exhibited their favorite types of predication . The classic mind sought to explain all details of physical and social existence by direct reference to the type ; hence the Ideas of Plato and the syllogisms of Aristotle . The scholastic mind , not oblivious of ancient logic , sought in the doctrines of the Church the predicates of physical reality , even when physical reality might well have disdained such an august explanation . The Enlightenment thrust upon all things the single predicate of reason ; it might be nature with its seismic disturbances so irrational , it might be man 's religion with its interesting fantasies , yet all must be rational before it could be true . Our own age is no less free from this mania for the predicate ; only now we seem to prefer the observed rather than the idealized , the believed , or the rationalized . Every judgment of truth , therefore , must have a scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Predication , we may say , is just and necessary , but special predication may lead to error . Suppose that nature and humanity refuse to come into the cage of the ideal , the credible , the rational , the scientific ; what can be done with the creature in whose sight the net is spread in vain ? ' When relentless predication applies itself to the human ego , the result is unsatisfactory for both the logical and the personal factors involved in the transaction . The // ancients predicated in such a manner as to leave out of consideration the human self . Socrates was intolerant toward the egoism of Protagoras , so that Greek thought established an ideal system from which there was no escape except by means of the nihilistic apathy of the Stoic who , unwilling to abide by the generalization , simply withdrew to the shadows of such inner selfhood as he could find . Scholastic vigor of predication soon reduced the world of things and persons to order , but the individual was called upon to renounce all that was most peculiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was the Enlightenment more human ; did it allot to each individual ' his own world ? The Enlightenment effaced egoism as effectually as the classic and scholastic systems had done . Our contemporary science has been no more liberal ; its concepts have been as drastic as ancient ideals , as grim as mediaeval walls . Truth has been allowed all things except the self , and it is the self which is conspicuous for its enjoyment and appreciation of the true . Molecules , atoms , and cells do not suffer when they are not recognized ; individuals languish when they are not allowed the sunlight of truth . Can it be wondered at , then , that the ego has sought self-deliverance by means of nominalism , irrationalism , irreligion ; and can it be doubted that these forms of negation had at heart the interests of a superior form of affirmation ? The conceptualizing method of authoritarian thinking has its advantages in that it makes it possible for the thinker to view the whole world without the arduous , dangerous journey from place to place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and longitude . But the method of conceptual reasoning is in itself suspicious , because such reasoning is forced to omit details , and these details , when peculiar to man , may be of special , immutable interest . ConTHE // ceptualism is forced to emphasize the abstract , the general ; when that which is true for all is true for none . Nor is anything gained when induction takes the place of deduction . It is true that induction seems to make overtures to the individual ; but this is all in the seeming , since the manifest aim of induction is to arrange the individual things in line where deductive reasoning placed them within a circle . Enclosed or aligned , the fate of the human self is the same ; selfhood is lost by one method as readily as by the other . Where other concepts , wrought out by either deduction or induction , may not complain , the elaboration of the concept " Man " has the misfortune to omit the most human of characteristics , selfhood . Furthermore , all attempts at conceptualizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does the thinker know that the facta bruta will submit to his amiable generalization ? Is an intellectual rule within , a real law without ? At the beginning of thought in the western world , even when it was then that thought was most optimistic , the presence of possible pessimism was never lost to view or left out of the calculation . The brighter the light of the intellect , the deeper the shadow of irrationality . Through strength and skill , the Greeks wrought an idealism by rescuing reason from the domination of unreason . It was , as Neitzsche 's The Birth of Tragedy pointed out , the living conflict between the chaotic and contradictory of the Dionysian and the form-loving Appollonian . Greek poetry and Greek philosophy joined arms in subduing the barbaric in Greek life . Where classicism had its Dionysius , scholasticism had its Devil , with his power to pervert the mind . If , therefore , these ages insisted upon the " truth " as they saw it , the reason for such insistence may be found in the feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // unreason should not be surrendered , should not perhaps be questioned . Alas ! for modern scientism , which is so strangely wanting in helpful diabolism , so wanting in the " friendly foe " of stubborn unreason . Yet , is the spirit of unreason any less real to-day than it was in the days of Plato and Aquinas ? Science now dreams its dream of pure truth , but its optimism may be its undoing . If Dionysius and the Devil are gone , unreason still remains , and it has been the duty of individualism to play its disconcerting part in the program ; for its has been individualism which has resisted the scientific generalization , individualism in the form of a Satanism peculiar to Milton and 1Blake , Emerson and Stirner , the Decadents and Symbolists . Will individualistic pessimism succeed in awakening science from its dogmatic slumber ? ( 2 ) Humanistic Criteria of Truth The individualistic claim that the relation of the self to truth is exceptional is based quite largely upon the thought that the criteria of truth are largely of an individualistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which man judges truth ; moreover , the question of truth may involve certain grand criteria which have no special concern with the " I am " of individualism . Thus , when knowledge avows that truth means the correspondence of thought with thing , or the coherence of thought with thought , the ego can hardly be regarded as anything more than the point where correspondence and coherence bring their two factors together . Yet , the thought that it is the ego which has the capacity to unite thought and thing , thought and thought , should encourage the individualist to insist upon the importance of the individual in the whole truth-problem . Over and above these major standards of truth , there are certain criteria which have ever // served to corroborate the truth or falsity of this or that idea . These criteria are of a personal character ; they have to do with the humanistic fact that truth , instead of being merely " true , " is possessed of concomitant characteristics which involve the individual 's sense of joy , of worth , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a formal affair whose validity depends altogether upon demonstration ; truth is possessed of a reality whereby the individual as individual is able to gather , not only verity , but joy , worth , and adoration . Could truth be truth and yet leave the mind unsatisfied in its desires ? Can truth end in a quod erat demonstrandum and not communicate something calculated to please the senses , add worth to the will , or command the devotion of the mind ? Real , living truth has ever been supposed to supply just such humanistic demands . Far from appearing stark and cold , truth comes warm and clothed ; its most apparent characteristic is the eudaemonistic one in virtue of which truth affords the heart joy . The arguments which are forthcoming to establish the intimate relationship between truth and joy may be found , first of all , in the inversion of an ethical judgment to the effect that the highest joy is found in the possession of truth . In the assertion of this sense of satisfaction which comes from beholding the true , Aristotle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy have gone to declare that the perception of truth saves the soul , gives consolation to the mind , or satisfies the desires of the human heart . Man can not be happy without the consciousness of truth , so that it becomes possible to say , happiness is truth . Now , to convert this proposition mutatis mutandis is to assert that where there is genuine joy there is also truth , for truth can not conduct us to happiness unless happiness be allowed to reciprocate and lead us back to truth . In joy , therefore , appears one of the criteria of the true . // To construct what might thus be called a eudaemonistic epistemology upon the basis of this thought is far from the intent of individualism , especially as individualism realizes how prone to illusion is the yearning heart of mankind . Nevertheless , individualism , in its desire to find the truth of life as well as the truth of things , is not ready to consent to a formalistic system which constructs truth out of purely impersonal elements when truth itself seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a criterion of truth rather than truth itself which individualism seeks in the sense of joy , whence individualism asserts that truth is known to the mind , not simply because troth seems clear , but because it has the capacity to yield a sense of joy . Where that joy of intellect is felt , the truth of mind is all but proved . Not only the Upanishads , to which reference was made in speaking of The Inward Enjoyment of Life , have seen fit to refer to the convincing connection between enjoying and knowing , but the Gospels and Epistles as well have looked upon truth as a palimpsest on which , as upon parchment , the original message of truth was written over an additional communication relative to the humanistic sense in which that truth made its appeal . The truth of the Gospel was very largely made up of its ability to communicate joy ; thus did the Gospel become a veritable evangelium . St. John speaks more dialectically when he declares , We know because . we love ; it was thus the agape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . Where humanistic pragmatism has sought to adopt such a eudaemonistic epistemology , it has prejudiced its cause by failing to observe that happiness is only a criterion of truth , while this happiness instead of being the fantastic feeling of that which " makes a difference to some one , " is looked upon critically and disinterestedly as the normal appetite of the human soul at large . An // unrestricted eudaemonism in knowledge can never free itself from the danger of illusion . Critical individualism is none the less convinced that where truth imparts joy , truth is none the less an affair of value . Those who , like Ritschl , have laid so much emphasis upon the value-judgment , have been guilty of regarding the sense of worth as though it were something extraordinary ; moreover , these apostles of the Werturtheil have never been able to overcome the Kantian prejudice to the effect that the moral principle of value comes at the death of the mental principle of knowledge as thought . Individualism has shown a disposition to look upon worth as the natural accompaniment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not because the idea lacked truth that it was endowed with worth ; it is endowed with worth because it has truth . When viewed as a criterion of truth , value has the effect of showing how ideas , instead of reposing in the calm intellect , take up their work in the active world of will , where they " work " because they are true , not that they are true because they work . False ideas often work and that in a manner quite perennial , as is the case with the divine right of kings , the infallibility of popes , and the natural right of mankind . Pragmatism , which has grown like Jonah 's gourd , has not taken care to watch the worm destined to destroy that which has grown up so wantonly . The danger incident upon connecting truth with the idea of worth appears in the tendency toward negation , the negation of ideals when these do not seem to serve the valuational interests of the human will . The spirit of negation , der Geist der stets verneint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , individualism has worked consciously toward the negation of the alleged ideals of rationalism , as one can see from a reading of individualists from Blake to Neitzsche . In // its work of negation , individualism differs from pragmatism which merely falls short of the idea which individualism surmounts : instead of lagging behind , individualism forges ahead undismayed by the prospect of destroying that which is dear to itself . The motive for such destruction appears in the idea that the old generalization will not suffice for the truth of life ; and , without any prospect of supplying a higher synthesis , the individual shows himself ready to resort to irrationalism , provided that that seems better fitted to conserve the ideal of life 's worth . The connection between knowledge and value is akin to the bond between virtue and value ; where a contrite ethics refuses to lower virtue to the realm of mere utility , it is none the less persuaded that the essence of morality can not be conserved in an analytical judgment which insists that virtue is virtue ; such a constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the same manner , individualism insists that truth is not merely truth but worth also , so that the validity of ideas , established in their own intellectualistic way , may be corroborated by showing that these ideas have a value . Truth , which is joyful and valuable , is none the less worshipful ; individualism , with its unhappy tendency toward the irrationalistic negation of knowledge , never loses sight of the fact that by its very nature truth is divine . Thus , instead of exhausting itself in satisfying the logical function of judgment in the human understanding , truth is possessed of such wealth and versatility as to be able to satisfy the sense of enjoyment and the feeling of disinterested appreciation , while it further extends its sway by commanding the full assent of the worshipful heart as a whole . In the career of individualism , where many a fine paradox and ardent contradiction has had its place , truth has never been lowered to a level below that occupied by the ego itself . Usually // exalted above the ego as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth has never been regarded as a mere means , an instrument . In worshipfulness , then , appears the third criterion of truthfulness ; let the supreme idea be the world or Godhead , reason or humanity , the exponent of the idea has ever been its devotee . Just how scientism is to supply the mind with these criteria is another thing , for scientism makes no room for aesthetic joyfulness or moral worth ; still less does scientism provide the mind with an idea capable of commanding the adoration of the soul . Scientism is thus wanting in all forms of and all tendencies toward a culture under the auspices of which the complete human intellect may realize itself as that which is akin to the truth which it adores . Individualism from Protagoras to Ibsen has never failed to seek that truth which should have the power to contain man , the ability to content his spirit . Where individualism has assumed a militant form , its polemic has been directed against the merely theoretical representation of the truth rather than against truth itself . At heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth-culture peculiar to the Grecian and Germanic mind ; the dilettante spirit , which fails to establish the bond between thought and life , has been foreign to individualism , which has sought to establish truth , not merely for the sake of things and ideas , but for its own sake , since it is by means of truth that the human ego is able to affirm itself as real in the world . 2 . Tni ArFIRMATION or TIM S 1 , V It is by means of truth that the individual is able to affirm his own inner being ; the supreme text upon which all fundamental egoism is based is found in the words , " I am the truth " ; in a manner most strident , Stirner , who suffered from the slavery of Hegelianism , pro176 THE GROUND AND GOAL , OF HUMAN LIFE ceeded to say , " I raise myself above truths and their power ; as I am supersensual , so I am supertrue. " 43 The spirit of individualism reposes somewhere between the divine utterance and the diabolical assertion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when truth is allowed to invest the things of the world and the members of society in general , as is the happy fate of things and persons under the auspices of scientism , without at the same time and in a more intimate manner investing the human ego as a self-conscious and self-willed " I am . " Is the self sub-true ; is it to occupy a logical position where truth arches far above its head without allowing the ego to participate in its essence ? Stirner goes too far where scientism does not go far enough ; the balance is found in a conception of selfhood which unifies the self and the true . In the synthesis of the self and the true , the very essence of all spiritual religion may be found . It is peculiar to the genius of religion to arouse the soul to a sense of individual exist ence and to inspire it with the desire to affirm its intrin sic character in the world . Where scientism surveys man under the form of nature , religion regards him as a detached creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large as he does , man enjoys an implicit freedom , while he further shows himself to be in a way superfluous . Nature does not need him as it needs the beast , and if he is to live his life as human , it must be in an exceptional manner . Of all earth 's creatures , man is the only one able to say , " I am . " In order to gather the individualistic fruits of religion , one must observe that , contrary to the traditional idea , religion has its source in the attempt on the part of the soul to affirm itself in opposition to the world . The theological idea of religion is formal , secondary ; when it insists that religion has to do with the speculative // affirmation of Godhead , it fails to advise us why man undertakes such an extraordinary program . The humanistic view of religion is inaugurated by the activistic tendency to quit the world and go forth in search of something more complete and satisfying . Where the theological conception proceeds to mark God plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all this , it may seem that the individualistic attitude is too nihilistic to be true and valuable , but the fact remains that human faith has asserted itself by means of negation , but not in such a manner as to render impossible the postulating of a theistic ideal . World-negation , then , seems to afford us the most original principle of religion , while it is further possible to assert that , with this nihilistic motive at work , religion has sometimes found it unnecessary to advance to the theistic postulate . In Taoism , the world is set at nought in both thought and deed , but the divine is neglected ; in Buddhism , the negation of the world is more intense , the neglect of Deity more pronounced . Here it must be observed that , with the failure to evince the idea of Godhead , these religions are equally lax in asserting the existence of selfhood , content as they are to rid the mind of the idea of the world . Only the preliminary step is taken ; the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of this lapse on the part of such religions as Taoism and Buddhism , it can not be denied that a worldreligion , instead of theologizing , takes up its work in a humanistic fashion , even when the negation of the world , instead of serving simply as a means of asserting the self , brings the religious operation to a conclusion . Man feels that the world is against him , so that only by a vigorous withdrawal from its solid walls may he be himself indeed . Humanity in its internal character is the postulate which , at the beginning , religion has at // heart . When the independent existence and characteristic life of the self are established , it becomes possible for the religionist to add the postulates of worldhood and Godhead , but the prior claim is advanced by the self for the self . Religion , like art and morality , is based upon the inner independence of the human self ; its lesson is the " I am . " In our own age , when the religionist , unaware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has given pathetic demonstration of the vanity with which any form of inner life may seek to advance its intrinsic claims by an appeal to exteriority , contemporary religion js now busy exhausting itself in the smug endeavor to be " scientific " and " social , " as if , by aping the age , it could come to its own so far afield from its proper place in the world . As a result , irreligion , with its antipathy to science and society , is giving a more consistent , though less happy , demonstration of the self and its independence . Religion sprang from the human self and has ever had the affairs of self in its keeping . When intellectual activities were in their incipiency , as in the days of Vedanta and Christianity , it was not difficult for the religionist to isolate the soul and place it in its proper position , but with the development of scientific philosophy , the task of selfassertion is far more difficult . But does it follow that the religious principle of the " I exist " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and that to such a degree that man feels divorced from existence ; no longer can he find his place or determine his fate . Worse still , man is so situated that , insecure as he is in the world without , he is no longer sure of his position within himself . The mystical Vedantist rejoiced in selfhood to such a degree that he felt justified in identifying the world with the self ; the modern religionist on the contrary is in such straits that he can hardly identify // the inner life with the self . No longer is it that which goes on without , no longer does he feel that he is that which goes on within . For this reason , the problem of religion , when this is adequately conceived , consists in re-establishing the relation between the inner life which has been so vigorously introspected by psychology , with the ego as the sovereign of consciousness . In this endeavor , no help may be expected from scientific psychology , which is pledged to the nervous system rather than to the ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ego with its various forms of culture .
