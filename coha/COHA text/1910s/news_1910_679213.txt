txt Tits belief , somewhat Widely prevalent , it appears , that enrollment under 0 . party emblem to secure the privilege of ssarticipation in primaries deprives the voter of his liberty of political action , is erroneous . If that were true , the provision of the law relating to enrollment would be invalid , as no law earl take away from the voter his liberty to vote for the party of his choice ; nor can any law authorize him to enter Into e , contract or to make a promise Impairing his political independence . Section 3 of the Primary Election law providing for the enrollment of voters on the days of registration reads as follows : I , ? ........... who have placed a mark underneath the party emblem hereunder of my choice , do solemnly declare that I have this day registered , and that my residence address is as stated by me at the time I so registered ; that I am in general sympathy with the principles of the party which I have designated by my mark hereunder ; that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election . State or National , the nominees ; of such party for State or National offices ; and that I have not enrolled with or participated in any primary election or convention of any ether party since the first day of last year . The word party as used herein means a political organization which , at the last preceding election of a Governor , polled at least ten thousand votes for Governor . The moral obligation of the voter is here plain . A Republican , though intending to vote the Democratic ticket this year . but intending , also , to vote the Republican ticket next year , would be guilty of a wrongful and immoral act if he should this year enroll himself as a Democrat . But , although being fully- determined to vote for the Democratic ticket this year . yet nevertheless believing in the principles of the Republican Party and having a general intention to act with that party next year and in future , he would be fully justified in enrolling himself as a Republican and in taking part In the primaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should enroll this year under the emblem of his party , expressing a general intention to act with that party next year , would be open to no reproach on moral or other grounds if , finding himself unable to support any or all Democratic candidates next year , he should cast his ballot for the candidates of the Republlcan Party . It is the " general sympathy " with the principles of the party under whose emblem ha enrolls his " Intention to support generally at the next general election " the nominees of that party , that the law requires . That intention is one which the voter himself is supposed to have formed and hold at the time of enrollment . The Taw does not require that he should form and hold it subject to no change Theintention which the voter expresses by enrollment must , however , be one which he has formed in good faith , sines if it were merely professed for the purpose of invading the primaries of the party with whose principles he is hot in general sympathy , the purpose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
