txt The question was broached to TEE TRIBUNE some time ago of the relative fascination of the American and French girls . It was asked if the less independent but more strictly feminine French type might not have such an influence on our men who have come to France that when they returned home our girls would have to look to their laurels . The French girl 's training is to look ' up to and coddle the men in the fatally . She is more of a listener than a talker ; she is pleased with small atten-1 tions , and never fails to show appreciation of them . ? It was inquired in THE TRIBUNE story if the contact of our , men with these customs might not make them less willing to fetch and carry and obey the beck and call of our self-reliant American type of girl . There was only one way to settle the question , and that was to ask the men themselves . The army edition last week stated the case to its readers and invited them to give opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very thoughtful ' and showed that the men have not answered offhand , but have seriously considered before answering . Several such are from privates . One of the surprises was the number who favored the French girl . Among the first batch the French probably had the majority , but then the American girl 's defenders came to the front . Be it understood that this is a discussion of types and not individuals , and there need be no heartburnings . A private in the medical corps , who says he read the  --  questions in the company of his fiancee , dares to write : " I 've had some opportunity to observe the French girls and wish to assure you and the folks at home that they have my entire approval . " Why He Favors French . One of the most complete answers is from a sergeant who emphatically declared he considered the French girl more thoughtful , agreeable , and less exacting than the American . and just to show that he is not prejudiced he wound up by saying he was going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world unless she has changed her mind . Giving/ the reasons he favors the French girl , he said : " The French girl expects nothing and is not disappointed if she receives no more than that . The American girl expects everything and always is cer- , taro , in one way or another , to make known her feeling if she does not receive it . If you want a surprise ask a French girl to allow you to carry her umbrella or parcel and , if she is not used to Americans , she will be just as surprised as you . It can not be denied that the French girl has won her way Into the heart of the Americans . " French Girls Good Listeners . Another soldier who is going home to an American girl begs that his name be not used when he says : " The charm of the French home life Is a revelation . The French girls stand the beauty test every time . Their keen humor does n't take the form of the verbal sparring and the cheap banter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , what is more , they can listen . " Woe to the American girl who fails to listen long and patiently when the A. E. F. goes home . The French girls are ideal companions , friendly , natural , unaffected , and self-possessed in a quiet way , never seeking the center of the stage , and never con. spicuous . " He 's Been Away Long . A sergeant who has lived in France for twelve years lauds the American girls . " There is nothing doglike about the devotion of the American girl . " he says , " but she is true blue and a real comrade through life , depending upon her worth , not her sex , to hold her beloved beside her and keep the respect of all men . " Joe Lucas , 4250 Campbell avenue , Chicago , is for the American girl first , last , and all the time , iand wants everybody back home to know it . One whole aero squadron votes the French girl adorable . So it goes and the discussion is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
