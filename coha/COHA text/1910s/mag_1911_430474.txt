IT is not possible in the time at our disposal to enter upon a description of the explorations and investigations which were made of various routes proposed for a canal joining the two oceans , nor can an account be taken of the considerations which resulted in the United States finally adopting the Panama route . Suffice it to say that under the Spooner Act , approved June 28 , 1902 , the President of the United States secured the necessary concession from the Republic of Panama , purchased the rights and property of the New French Canal Company , and undertook the construction of the canal on May 4 , 1904 . The Isthmus of Panama runs nearly east and west , and the canal traverses it from Colon on the north to Panama on the south , in a general direction from northwest to southeast , the Pacific terminus being 22 miles east of the Atlantic entrance . TORRENTIAL , FLOODS OF THE CHAGRES RIVER The greatest difficulty of the Panama route is the control or disposition of the Chagres River and its tributaries . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basin of 1,320 square miles , about half of which is above the mouth of the Obispo River . Its course is generally parallel to the Caribbean coast line so far as the mouth of the Obispo , where it turns almost at right angles to the westward , pursuing this general course to Tabernilla , whence it traverses a tortuous channel in a general northwesterly direction and enters the Caribbean Sea to the west of Limon Bay . The general elevation of the valley is but little above sea-level to Bohio , where the low-water surface of the Chagres is one foot above mean tide . At the mouth of the Obispo , 13 miles from Bohio , the low-water surface is 48 feet above , and at Alhajuela , II miles farther , it is 95 feet above the same datum . Above Bohio the Chagres Valley is undulating , the hills becoming higher and steeper as the river is ascended , causing very rapid run-off of the rains , amounting to too inches and over in eight or nine months , the average duration of the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hour ; the greatest recorded change in the river at Gamboa is a rise of 25.6 feet in 24 hours . Its discharge at the beginning of the rise was 8,200 cubic feet per second , increasing to 90,000 cubic feet per second at the peak of the flood . The excessive rainfall and precipitous character of the hills enclosing the valley make it a torrential stream . The bars formed during floods differ materially , and are of sand , gravel , pebbles , and rounded stones three inches to six inches in diameter . The sand and clay deposits are useful in giving suitable material for the impervious portion of the dams , while the gravel beds furnish ballast for the railroad and for other purposes . The Chagres River has 26 tributaries between Bas Obispo and Gatun , the largest of which are the Gatun and Trinidad rivers , the former entering from the east with a drainage basin of about 16o square miles , and the latter from the west , draining an area of about 390 square miles . Each rises in the same character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drainage areas , they are of the same torrential character and must be reckoned with in the general question of the control of the Chagres and its tributaries . Various methods for the disposition or control of the Chagres have received consideration . The first French corn- pany , in its attempt to cut a sea-level canal , found it necessary to provide diversion channels to care for the water of the rivers . The New Panama Canal Company adopted the plan of a dam across the river valley at Bohio , creating a lake above this point and discharging the flood waters to the level below by means of a spillway in the adjacent hills . The canal which the President was authorized to construct by the provisions of the Spooner Act was the lock type recommended by the first Isthmian Canal Commission in its report submitted November 16 , 190T . This plan also provided a lake for controlling the Chagres by a dam at Bohio , following along the plans of the New Panama Canal Company , thereby utilizing to the fullest extent the work already accomplished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sea-level canal was agitated ; this is undoubtedly the ideal canal . It took such a hold on the public mind that , in consideration of the international importance of the work , the President convened a Board of Consulting Engineers to consider and report upon the type of canal which should be adopted . This Board consisted of 13 members ? five representatives of European countries and eight Americans and assembled in Washington in June , 1905 . The minority of this Board ? five in number ? reported in favor of the lock type for the reasons that such a canal would provide greater safety for ships and less danger of interruption to traffic by reason of its wider , straighter , and deeper channels , as well as quicker passage for large ships ; the other considerations were that such a canal could be built in less time and for less money . In forwarding the report of this Board to Congress , on February 19 , 1906 , the President stated : " The law now on our statute books seems to contemplate a lock canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is advisable . " On June 29 , 1906 , the Congress authorized the construction of the lock type of canal , in accordance with the general plans of the minority of the Board , and  | the work has since been carried on along these lines . This conclusion was not generally accepted as satisfactory ; the plan was again vigorously attacked after the settlement and slip in a part of one of the toes of the Gatun Dam in the latter part of 1908 , and the " Battle of the Levels " continued well into 1909 , notwithstanding the fact that the then President-elect , with a party of eminent engineers , after a personal inspection of the work advocated no change . WISDOM OF CHOICE OF LOCK CANAL NOW GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED Since then , as the work has advanced , the wisdom of the choice is clearly shown and there is no doubt as to the ultimate success of the project . Developments within the last year in the form of slides have brought more prominently to the front the excellence of the judgment which accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the majority , and show more clearly the greater difficulties that would be encountered in an attempt to construct a sea-level canal . An English scientist , who has kept in close touch with the work since the Americans took charge , and who at first was skeptical as to the Gatun Dam , said , after a recent visit , that he was converted to the present plan because it is not a dam at all that is building , but a veritable hill . He also thought that the expressed opinion of the Board of Consulting Engineers with reference to the Gatun Dam , namely , " that no such vast and doubtful experiment should be indulged in , " was now applicable to Culebra Cut . There are probably some who still believe a wrong choice was made , but a visit to the Isthmus is a sure cure for such cases , provided always that they are open to conviction . In the present plan the control of the Chagres is also effected by a lake , but greater in extent , because the dam is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first proposed by Godin de  | Lepinay , a French engineer , who , in an exhaustive paper on the subject , prepared for the Congress of Engineers in Paris in 1879 , advocated the construction of a lock canal with a dam at Gatun in lieu of a sea-level canal . The reasons which he advanced at that time were to the effect that such a canal could be built for less money , in less time , and with less sacrifice of life . THE PRINCIPAL , FEATURES OF THE CANAL The canal which is now building consists of a sea-level entrance channel from the sea through Limon Bay to Gatun , about seven miles long , 50o feet bottom width , and 41 feet deep at mean tide . At Gatun the 85-foot lake level is obtained by a dam across the valley . The lake is confined on the Pacific side by a dam between the hills at Pedro Miguel , 32 miles away . The lake thus formed will have an area of 164 square miles and a channel depth of not less than 45 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea to the lake level , and vice versa , by three locks in flight . On the Pacific side there will be one lift of 30 feet at Pedro Miguel to a small lake held at 55 feet above sea level by dams at Miraflores , where two lifts overcome the difference of level to the sea . The channel between the locks on the Pacific side will be 500 feet w : e at the bottom and 45 feet deep , and oe:cw the Miraflores locks the sealevel section , about eight miles in length , will be 500 feet wide at the bottom and 45 feet deep at mean tide . Through the lake the bottom widths are not less than i , 000 feet for about 16 miles , Boo feet for about four miles , 500 feet for about three miles , and through the continental divide , from Bas Obispo to Pedro Miguel , a distance of about nine miles , the bottom width is 300 feet . The total length of the canal from deep water in the Caribbean , 41-foot depth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45-foot depth at mean tide , is practically 5o miles . 15 miles of which are at sea level . The variation in tide on the Atlantic side is 2.5 feet as a maximum , and on the Pacific it is 21.1 feet as a maximum . Provisions are made to amply protect the entrances of the canal . During the winter months occasional storms occur on the Atlantic side , of such violence that vessels can not lie with safety in Colon Harbor , and during the progress of such storms entrance and egress from the canal would be unse fe . To overcome this condition , a breakwater will extend out about two miles from Toro Point in a northeasterly direction , which will not only protect the entrance , but will provide a safe harbor . Whether protection on the east side will be ultimately necessary is still an open question . The Pacific entrance requires no protection from storms , but the set of the silt-bearing current from the east is at right angles to the channel and the silting made constant dredging necessary . To prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Balboa to Naos Island , a distance of about four miles : the benefits derived from it are already very marked . The projected lakes will submerge the tracks of the Panama Railroad for the greater part of its length , and as this road is necessary for construction purposes , and ultimately for the operation and maintenance of the canal , it is being reconstructed throughout , with the exception of a few miles at either end . It was originally intended to pass the new railroad through Culebra Cut on a berm , to feet above the water surface , to be left for this purpose during the excavation of the channel through the cut , but the slides and the absolute necessity for keeping open railroad communication between the two ends of the line necessitated a change in the location , and a new line to the east of the cut has been selected . In order to hold its concession the French company continued work on the canal up to the time that the United States assumed control , and after the transfer of rights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the United States with the various tools and appliances then in use . MAKING THE ISTHMUS HEALTHY The first two and a half years of American control were given to preparation . All energies were devoted during that time to rid the isthmus of disease by sanitation , to recruiting and organizing a working force , and providing for it suitable houses , hotels , messes , kitchens , and an adequate food supply ; to assembling the plant to do the work ; to increasing the capacity of the existing railway system , and to establishing a system of civil government for the Canal Zone , which is a strip of land to miles wide ( five miles on either side of the center of the canal ) , extending across the Isthmus . The work of sanitation included clearing lands , draining and filling pools and swamps for the extermination of the mosquito , the establishment of hospitals for the care of the sick and injured , and the quarantine . In addition , to secure and maintain better health conditions , municipal improvements were undertaken in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the line of canal , such as the construction of reservoirs , with mains and adjuncts , for furnishing wholesome and sufficient water , sewerage , pavements , and a system of roads . Buildings to the number of 2,009 were constructed , including office buildings , hospitals , hotels , messes , kitchens , shops , storehouses , and living quarters . In addition to this , 1,536 buildings out of a total of 2,200 buildings turned over by the French were remodeled and repaired for use . Recruiting agencies were established in the United States , Europe , and the West Indies . AN IMMENSE DEPARTMENT STORE The Commissary Department of the Panama Railroad Company was enlarged until it is now a great department store supplying to the employees whatever may be necessary for their comfort and convenience . Manufacturing , cold storage , and laundry plants were established and turn out each day about 90 tons of ice , 14,000 loaves of bread , 2,400 rolls , 250 gallons of ice-cream , I , 000 pounds of roasted coffee , and 7,500 pieces of laundry . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and such fruits as can be obtained , are sent out on the night freight to distant points , and every morning a supply train of about 16 cars , of which number six to eight are refrigerator cars , leaves Cristobal at 4.30 to distribute food-stuffs and laundry to the local commissaries along the line , where the employees make their purchases and where the hotels , messes , and kitchens secure their supplies for the day . The construction plant , consisting of steam shovels , locomotives , cars , unloaders , spreaders , track-shifter 's , pile-drivers , cranes , dredges , steamboats , tugs , and barges , was purchased for the most part " knocked clown , " and shops for their erection and repair were constructed and enlarged . Some of the machinery was built from parts manufactured in the shops . The distance from the home market , with attendant vexatious delays in securing parts and material and the necessity for keeping the construction plant in the most efficient condition for economical operation , made it imperative that the shops be equipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railroad , over a large part of which the spoil from Culebra Cut must be handled , was increased by double tracking it throughout , except from Cristobal to Gatun and from Culebra to Paraiso . Yards were enlarged and connections made to areas available for dumping grounds . Laws were framed , and civil government was established with its necessary adjuncts of courts , police force , fire companies , customs and revenue service , post-offices , public works , and treasury . A purchasing department was organized in the United States for the obtainment of supplies of all kinds and descriptions . Upon arrival on the Isthmus ,  | the supplies are shipped to the various subdivisions of the canal-work for which they were purchased , or they are placed in storehouses along the line for issue when required . It was only after these various yet necessary adjuncts had been provided and the forces for their operation were organized that the principal work in hand ? the building of the canal ? could be pushed forward with any hope of success , and too much praise can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a working condition . The Department of Construction and Engineering is divided into three construction divisions . The Atlantic Division embraces the engineering construction from deep water in the Caribbean Sea to include the Gatun locks and dam ; the Central Division extends from Gatun to Pedro Miguel , and the Pacific Division from Pedro Miguel to deep water in the Pacific Ocean . KEEPING THE FLOODS OUT OF CULEBRA CUT As already noted , the Americans continued the work in progress by the French in the cut through the continental divide , commonly known as the Culebra Cut , utilizing the French machinery until it could be replaced by more modern appliances . This is the most formidable part of the enterprise on account of the magnitude of the cutting , and also because of the difficulties attending it , due to the excessive rainfall and to the varying character of the materials encountered . The efficient and economical working of the plant requires that provisions be made for the disposition of the large quantities of water that result from the rains . Whatever water is not carried off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the excavated area or by seepage into it . Proper drainage of the cut is therefore an ever-existing problem , and two distinct phases are presented , viz : T. To keep out the water of the surrounding country . 2 . To rid the excavated area of the water that collects in it . A system of diversion channels accomplishes the first , and gravity drains and pumps solve the second . The canal line follows the Obispo River , which drains the area from the divide to the Chagres River . It has four principal tributaries , two from the east , the Masambi and the Sardinilla , and two from the west , the Mandinga and the Comacho . These are cared for by two diversion channels . On the east side of the cut the Obispo diversion has been constructed almost parallel to the canal and carried through a depression in the hills so as to discharge into the Chagres about one mile above the point at which the canal line crosses the river . To the west of the cut the Comacho diversion carries the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel of the Obispo River . Through a hill between Haut Obispo and Bas Obispo , which sharply deflects the river , the French had built a tunnel for diverting the flood waters , and this forms a part of the new diversion . The canal follows the Rio Grande on the southern slope of the divide , and its waters are cared for by a diversion channel constructed by the French . They also constructed a dam across the valley , impounding the waters , and the resulting reservoir supplies the settlements from Culebra to and including Panama . During the wet season the diversion channel carries the overflow from the reservoir . HOW THE SHOVELS WORK The French so planned the excavation that after the removal of the peak of the divide and lesser summits they could work a number of excavators simultaneously at several points , so that a succession of benches resulted , lying one above the other , each with the natural surface as the point of beginning . By working in the direction of the length of the cut , the face of the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the excavator must be hauled back , and secures a satisfactory drainage arrangement , since the cutting is carried up grade on either side of the summit . The Americans have followed this  | same method , the only difference being in the character of machinery used . The width of the channel adopted by the French was 74 feet ; the present plan is for a channel 300 feet at the bottom , so that the first work undertaken by the Americans was directed to securing the necessary widths for the upper reaches before attempting any increase in depth . Whatever water entered from rains and seepage was drained from the summit of the cutting by gravity to the Rio Grande on the south and to the Chagres River on the north . As shovels in excess of those required for widening became available , they were put to work to secure increased depth , care being taken to maintain , as far as possible , free , easy , and rapid drainage . Shovels are started at either end and carried towards each other , cutting out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower grade make the " pilot cuts , " which constitute the new drains and to which water is led by laterals from various parts of the excavated area adjacent . The average grade or slope is about 36 feet per mile . The loading tracks for these shovels are on the level above . When the " pilot cut " has progressed sufficiently far , its cut or trench becomes the loading track for a second shovel , which is started to widen out the cut already made by the pioneer , and so the work moves forward , the shovels approaching the summit from either direction in echelon . In 1904 the summit of the excavation was at Gold Hill and at reference 193 - above sea level . The summit at present is between Empire and Culebra and is at reference 106 above sea level . The drainage to the south is still by gravity , through the old bed of the Rio Grande to the west of the Pedro Miguel locks . It is expected that before the next wet season the center culvert of the locks will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . The reference of the lowwater surface of the Chagres is 43 at the point of its intersection with the . center line of the canal . The bottom of the completed canal is at reference 40 . A dike separates the cut from the Chagres , but this is overtopped during the high floods . To get rid of the accumulated flood water , 24-inch pipes are laid through the dike , each with a suitable valve , and so arranged that all water above the pipes is carried into the Chagres by gravity after the subsidence of any flood . Recourse must be had to pumping whatever water remains from the floods below this level , and such as may be collected by drainage from the south ; for this purpose a sump has been dug to elevation 32 and primps installed . It is not possible to estimate the quantity of water that will have to be handled , but three pumps are in place , each capable of discharging 12,000 gallons of water per minute . VERY TROUBLESOME SLIDES The greatest difficulty encountered in the excavation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses of material to slide or move into the excavated area , closing off the drainage , upsetting steam shovels , and tearing up the tracks . The term " slide " is applied to the movement of the overlying clay upon smooth , sloping surfaces of rock or other material harder than the clay . " Breaks " occur at points where the underlying rock is of poor quality , intersected by vertical seams or seams sloping toward the canal , and which is unable to bear up the superimposed mass . Generally , the upper surface of the broken portion of the bank remains approximately horizontal , settling nearly vertically . The weight of the broken portion forces up and displaces laterally the material lying directly below it in the bottom or on the berms of the canal . As the material thus forced up is taken away the upper part gradually settles and moves toward the axis of the canal until the entire broken portion is removed . The greatest slide is at Cucaracha , and gave trouble when the French first began cutting , in 1884 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a length of 800 feet , measured along the line of excavation , the slide has extended to include the entire basin south of Gold Hill or for a length of about 3,000 feet . The original slide covered an area of about six acres , but the latest surveys show that is has extended to cover 47 acres . NO DANGER FROM SLIDES AFTER CANAL , IS COMPLETED There are all told nine " slides " and " breaks " to be reckoned with , and there is nothing to do but to remove all the material embraced within their limits . As the cut is deepened these may be aggravated or others may develop . There is no method known to stop or to prevent them . Usually the first indication received , if there be a forewarning , is the lifting or moving of a shovel and tracks . The cut has therefore developed into the uncertain and experimental feature of the work and its completion will mark the date of finishing the canal . No apprehension is felt because of the slides after the completion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases , and the banks slide or break because of the condition of unstable equilibrium that results from the cutting ; when grade is reached equilibrium will be established , and the back pressure of the water will result in greater stability . Whatever slides occur subsequently will be relatively small , and the material can be easily handled by steam shovels on the berms that will be left and by dredges that will be available . Some idea of the magnitude of the slides can be obtained from the fact that during the fiscal year 1909 , of 14,325,876 cubic yards removed , 884,530 cubic yards , or 6 per cent , were from slides . For the fiscal year 1910 , of 14,921,750 cubic yards that were removed , 2,649 , - 000 , or 18 per cent , were from slides or breaks that had previously existed or that had developed during the year . THE MATERIAL , IS ALL ROCK Except for the slides , which are of earth , the material to be removed is rock , and requires blasting to enable the shovels to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by churn or well drills , though tripod drills replace them where the others can not be used to advantage . The drills are operated by compressed air , supplied by three compressor plants , which are connected together by a 10-inch pipe line about five miles long , with 6-inch and 4-inch leads running into the cut . The drills operate in batteries of from 4 to 12 ; the holes , from 15 to 27 feet in depth , are spaced from 6 to 16 feet apart . The explosive used is dynamite , 45 per cent to 6o per cent nitro-glycerine . Excessive moisture and water in the holes prevent the use of blasting powder . When the holes in any section are ready for blasting , they are " sprung " ? that is , four to six sticks of dynamite are lowered to the bottom and exploded ? thereby forming a chamber for the reception of the charge . The charges vary from 25 to 200 pounds , depending upon the local conditions ; the tamping follows , and the explosion is effected by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EARTH AND ROCK FROM THE CULEBRA CUT ARE USED FOR THE BREAKWATERS AND EMBANKMENTS Through the blasted area the steam shovel cuts its way , averaging 34 feet wide at the bottom and 50 feet at the top for the " pilot cuts , " which are 8 to 12 feet deep . The widening cuts are about 26 feet wide and from 15 to 24 feet deep . The best results are secured with the 95-ton shovels , though the 45-ton and 7o-ton shovels are also used . The 95-ton shovels have dippers of four and five yard capacities , the former removing rocks containing as much as six cubic yards . When the rocks are too large to be lifted by the shovel , they are " dobie " blasted , and thus broken to sizes convenient for the dipper . This is done by placing three or more sticks of dynamite on the rock , covering them with mud and igniting by means of a slow match . The shovels load the material on dirt trains , consisting of 20 flat cars and  | from 25 to 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds in the vicinity of the cut were utilized to their fullest capacity by the French and during the earlier periods of American control , so that longer hauls are necessary . The new line of the Panama Railroad , being above the lake level , requires many heavy embankments , which offer suitable places for depositing material . The breakwater from Balboa to aos Island offers a dump , though requiring an average haul of ii miles . As difficulty is experienced in extending this breakwater , additional dump tracks are provided at Balboa , so as not to delay the trains , and land at the inner end of the breakwater is being reclaimed ; already 2J3 acres have been filled in . The interior swamps in the vicinity of Ancon are also to be filled . From 16 to 22 trains of material are sent daily to Gatun , an average haul of 25 miles , and used in building up the toes of the dam or for large rock to place in the concrete . The remainder of the excavated material is wasted on extensive dumps at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is abandoned for the present . The Lidgerwood flats are dumped at . Miraflores , Balboa , and on the relocated line of the Panama Railroad , where special equipment is kept to handle them , consisting of plows , unloaders , spreaders , and track-shifters . The plow is attached to one end of the train , and the unloader , consisting of a steam-driven drum on which is wound the cable , at the other end . To stretch the cable , the train passes between two uprights to which the cable is attached temporarily , and by moving the train the cable is drawn from the drum to the plow to which the end of the cable is attached . Winding the cable on the drum draws the plow the length of the train , removing the load . After the material is plowed off , the spreader performs its functions , and , when no longer capable of throwing the material beyond the edge of the dump , the track is shifted by a device patented by W. G. Bierd , formerly general manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track with the ties so as to clear the ground , and by another motion pulls it sidewise . The usual throw is two and a half to three feet , though , if the rails will permit , the track can be thrown as much as nine feet in one throw ( see page 179 ) . The steel dump-cars require no special or extra appliance for their operation , and can be dumped as easily on curved as on straight track . They also dump to either side . Work has been in progress on the Culebra Cut since 188o , and during the French control 18,646,000 cubic yards were removed . Between Gatun and Bas Obispo , the northern end of Culebra Cut , the French excavation which is useful to the present project amounted to 2,201,000 cubic yards , or a total in the Central Division of over 20,000,000 cubic yards . The total estimated amount of material to be excavated from May 4 , 1904 , in this division was 97,125,018 cubic yards , of which , up to January 1 , 1911 , 67,792,8J5 cubic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is expected that all the excavation in the lake section will be finished by July 1 , 1911 . Some idea of the magnitude of the operations may be formed from the fact that this division has within its jurisdiction over 200 miles of 5-foot-gauge track laid , about 55 miles of which are within the side slopes of the Culebra Cut alone . THE GREAT DAM AT GATUN IS A VERITABLE HILL An earth dam across the Chagres at Gatun impounds the water of the river and creates the lake which constitutes the summit level . The darn is 7,500 feet long over all , measured along the top , and , according to the latest profile , it is 2,100 feet wide at the base , 398 feet through at the water surface , reference 85 , and 100 feet wide at the top , which is 115 feet above sea-level . It crosses two valleys separated by a hill rising to elevation 110 , in which the regulating works are being constructed . Of the total length of the dam , only 500 feet  | will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder to less . The dimensions of the darn have been criticised as excessive and unwarranted , but its designers considered it desirable , in view of the amount of material available , that ample provisions be made against every force which may affect its safety , and that a barrier be made so that the layman without engineering knowledge would recognize its stability . Now that the dam is assuming appreciable proportions , this latter object is more than realized . The darn in plan is a broken line to conform to the configurations of the natural surface , thereby materially reducing the fill . It extends from the hill in which the locks are to be constructed to Spillway Hill , thence along the spur or hog-back of the hill on the west side of the valley ( see map , page 201 ) . The adoption of the earth darn brought on such criticism that an exhaustive examination of the foundations was made in order to determine more carefully the character and extent of the various underlying materials ; to ascertain whether there was any possible connection between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposits in the gorges across which the dam will be built ; for testing the ability of the material to support the proposed structures , and for learning whether suitable material for the dam could be obtained in the immediate vicinity . As the result of the investigations , it  | may be briefly stated that the underlying material is impervious to water ; that it possesses ample strength to uphold the structure that will be placed upon it , and , the subsoil being impervious , that there is no connection between the swamps above and the sea below . Because of the sluggish current of the river in the vicinity of Gatun and above , the deposits consist of the finer sands and silts interspersed with beds of clay . By constructing experimental dams of this material and subjecting them to the full head of water , it was conclusively demonstrated that this material is suitable for the interior or the impervious core . The dam is constructed by forming two dumps on the outer lines of the structure and depositing waste material , mostly rock , obtained from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area between the piles thus formed is filled with the material pumped in by hydraulic dredges , the natural surface of the ground having been previously cleared of vegetation and a suitable bonding trench excavated . THE SPILLWAY Fluctuations in the lake due to floods are to be controlled by regulating works constructed in Spillway Hill . Objections were made to constructing such works in the line of the dam , but because of the natural configuration of the ground , irrespective of the location of the spillway , provision had to be made for tying the dam to the sides of the hill ; moreover , the extent and elevation of the hill , as well as the material composing it , make it a suitable and desirable place for the waste weirs . The channel has been cut , the floor-and side walls of concrete completed , and the Chagres River now discharges through it . As the reference of the floor is at Io feet above sea-level , the lake is already formed at least to this height . The spillway dam will be of concrete with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built on top of the crest , 53.5 feet centers , grooved for Stoney gates , which will close the openings and complete this portion of the dam . The trace of the dam will be the arc of a circle 740 feet long , with 14 openings , which , when the gates are raised to the full height , will permit a discharge of 140,000 cubic feet per second . The water discharged over the . dam will pass through a diversion channel into the old bed of the Chagres . ( See map , page 201 . ) The dam is to contain 21,145,931 cubic yards of material . On January 1 , 1911 , there had been placed 12,001,592 cubic yards , making 56.72 per cent of the dam complete . The spillway will contain an estimated quantity of 225,485 cubic yards of concrete , of which 113,269 cubic yards , or 50.23 per cent , were completed on January 1 . THE LOOKS CAN BE PILLED OR EMPTIED IN 8 MINUTES The locks are in pairs , so that if any lock is out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when all the locks are in use , the passage of shipping will be expedited by using one set of locks for the ascent and the other for descent . The locks are Ito feet wide and have usable lengths of 1,000 feet . The system of filling adopted consists of a culvert in each side wall feeding laterals perpendicular to the axis of the lock , from which are openings upward into the lock chamber . This system distributes the water as evenly as possible over the entire horizontal area of the lock , and reduces the disturbance in the chamber when the latter is being filled or emptied . ( See diagram , page 202 , and illustrations , pages 206-207 . ) The middle or separating wall contains a single culvert of the same area as the culverts in the side walls , which feeds in both directions through laterals controlled by valves designed to operate against a head from either direction . This arrangement permits communication between the chambers of twin locks , so that water may be passed from one lock to the other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main culverts are controlled by Stoney valves , and the lat- erals leading from the center wall by cylindrical valves . Assuming a difference of head of 30 feet , it is estimated that the entire lock can be filled or emptied , using one culvert in 15 minutes and 42 seconds , and in 7 minutes and 51 seconds when both culverts are used . The lock gates are of the mitering type , double leaf , straight gates , varying in height from 45 feet 7 inches to 79 feet ; the length of each leaf is about 65 feet . A contract has been entered into for furnishing the steel for the gates and for their erection in place by June 1 , 1913 . To meet this condition , it is necessary that the concrete work shall be completed in time to enable the contractors to begin the erection of the various sets of gates on the dates specified in their contract , and the work is being prosecuted with this end in view . To accomplish the result , the concrete for the Gatun locks must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the locks on the Pacific side by October of the same year . SAFETY DEVICES It has been accepted as a fundamental feature of the design that at each flight of locks there must always be two barriers separating the high level from the level next below . To carry this out , two sets of mitering gates are placed at the  | upper and two at the lower end of each of the uppermost locks in each flight . In addition a chain device is used to guard the barrier gates against accident , and so controlled as to be capable of checking a ship of 10,000 tons moving at the rate of about five miles an hour . More than 95 per cent of the vessels navigating the high seas are less than boo feet in length , and this has been taken as the determining factor for the location of intermediate gates , which are introduced in the design to save both time and water . For the protection of the intermediate gates against vessels using a smaller length of chamber a chain barrier is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which vessels will tie before entering the locks . Designs for electric towing machines are being prepared , which will be used for towing vessels into and controlling their passage through the locks by means of lines or cables attached to what may be considered the four corners of the ship . Even with all of these precautions accidents may happen , and emergency dams are provided at the head of each flight of locks , consisting of swing bridges , which can be thrown across the locks in case of an accident which makes a connection between the top level and the level below ; wicket girders are let down from these swing bridges , supported by a sill at the bottom and the horizontal truss work of the bridge at the top . These wicket girders act as runways for gates , which are lowered and gradually stop the flow . GATUN LAKE WILL STORE WATER FOR THE DRY SEASON It will not be out of place at this point to give consideration in a general way to the question of adequacy of the water supply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject have been collected for many years and studied with care . During eight or nine months of the year there is more than a sufficient supply for all purposes , but during the other four or three months there is practically none , and it becomes necessary to store a sufficient quantity during the rainy season to supply the needs during the dry season . The enormous reservoir of Gatun Lake is available for this purpose . The bottom of the canal in the summit level is at reference 40 , and it is evident that navigation , with the extreme depths provided of 40 feet in sea water , can be carried on until the surface of the lake falls to reference 81 . As the water surface in the lake is to be allowed to rise to reference 87 , there is stored available for the dry season a little more than five feet . Making due allowances for power consumption , evaporation , about which data are available , seepage and leakage at the gates during a dry season of minimum flow , assumed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 41 passages of the canal per day is possible , using the full length of lock . In the average dry season 58 complete transits of the canal are possible , or a greater number than the 24 hours of the day would permit , allowing vessels to follow each other at intervals of one hour . With the design for the locks as adopted a certain amount of water can be saved at each lockage whenever a vessel does not draw the full permissible depth of 40 feet by cross-filling or emptying through the middle wall . As a consequence it can be stated that there will be sufficient water for as many lockages as the time in the day will permit . INGENIOUS METHODS FOR HANDLING THE ROCK AND CEMENT At Gatun three locks in flight overcome the difference in level between the lake and sea , and are being constructed in a cutting made through a hill . The excavation , consisting of upwards of 5,000,000 cubic yards , mostly rock , is practically completed . The locks are of concrete , and contain about 2,046,100 cubic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 49 per cent completed .  | The broken stone for the concrete is quarried and transported from Porto Bello , about 20 miles east of Colon , and the sand is procured from Nombre de Dios , about 20 miles farther to the east . Both are transported direct to Gatun in barges through the French Canal , which was dredged of rock ledges and accumulated deposits for the purpose . Since the canal line was cut through to the French Canal this new channel is also used . The cement is purchased under contract at clocks in Jersey City and shipped to Cristobal , thence by barges to Gatun or cars to Pedro Miguel and Miraflores . The material taken to Gatun in barges is landed at unloading docks , conveniently located on the old east diversion , to which a channel from the French Canal was excavated by dredges . The east clock is inclosed , forming the cement storehouse . Its floor dimensions are 1E6 feet by 490 feet . The roof projects 35 feet beyond the face of the dock , affording some protection against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each of which a two-ton traveling crane , worked by electric motors , operate entirely across the building . In the rear of the building 30 cement hoppers are placed in the floors and covered with steel screens . The cement is delivered through these hoppers into cars running on a track below the floor . The cement for this work is in barrels , which are first put into the storehouse and subsequently moved to the hoppers . Grab buckets , operated by cableways , remove the sand and stone from the barges , moored against the west dock , and deliver the materials in stock piles . The towers of the cableways are of steel , 85 feet high and 800 feet apart . They are mounted on cars , which enable movement at right angles to the line of the cable ; one single and two duplex cableways are provided . ( See illustration , page 196 . ) Each of the latter have complete independent cableway systems . The cableways are equipped with five 70 cubic feet self-digging grab buckets , each having an independent run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not the capacity to unload the material required with sufficient rapidity , and have been augmented by three derricks operating on a dock north of the cement shed , transferring sand and stone to bins . THE AERIAL CABLEWAYS Two tunnels run north and south through the stock piles , with hoppers in the top through which stone and sand are fed to cars . The cars used for transferring the material are of steel with hinged side doors , and bottoms inclined outward at an angle of 52 degrees from the horizontal . A steel partition divides each car into compartments , one for rock and cement and one for sand . The car starts at the cement shed , where it receives two barrels of cement , thence runs through one of the tunnels , receiving a full charge of stone and sand in the proper compartment , and proceeds to deliver this load in the mixer hopper . The concrete mixers are of the cubical type , each having a capacity of 64 cubic feet . There are eight of them , all mounted in one building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that four clump in one direction and the other four directly opposite , thus permitting the use of two tracks under the mixers . There is , however , but one track above . A four-track electric railway , thirdrail system , operates the length of the locks and carries the concrete from the mixers to the cableways over the locks , by which it is placed . The equipment for this road consists of 12 electric fourwheel mine-locomotive-type engines and 24 flat cars fitted with automatic couplers , each designed to carry a two-yard concrete bucket . Two charges of concrete are taken by each train and carried to the cableways . Four duplex cableways span the locks with steel towers 85 feet high and 800 feet apart , similar in design to the unloading cableways . The forms used in concrete laying are  | of steel and , for the straight portion of the walls , so designed as to permit construction of monoliths 36 feet in length extending from the floor to the top of the walls . The forms for the main and the lateral culverts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE OCEAN The channel from the locks to deep water in Limon Bay , approximately seven miles in length , is being excavated in part by steam shovels and the remainder by dredges . South of the French Canal the Mindi Hills cross the line of our canal between Gatun and Limon Bay , rising to the elevations 50 and 6o . As the bulk of the excavation is rock , steam shovels were put to work to secure the requisite width and depth . It was thought that when sea-level was reached the shovels would have to be replaced by dredges , as the Mindi River is within a few hundred yards of the area , and the French Canal borders it . As the work progressed , however , notwithstanding the seamy nature of the rock , it was found that a relatively narrow levee would keep out water from the French Canal , and the seepage was so small as to be easily handled by pumps . One shovel-cut to grade was made , when the high water in December , 1909 , flooded the pit and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed by a suction dredge . The water is being pumped from the pit so as to permit completion of the work by steam shovels . Over the area to be dredged , a seagoing suction dredge removes the softer material , while ladder and dipper dredges handle the rock and stiff clays . The underlying rock is drilled and blasted prior to dredging . A total of over 35 , - 000,000 cubic yards was the estimated amount to be excavated , of which 60.3 per cent is completed . THE LOCKS AT PEDRO MIGUEL In the Pacific Division the work consists of the construction of duplicate locks at Pedro Miguel overcoming a 30-foot difference of level , with the neces- sary dams ; two locks in flight , also in duplicate , at Miraflores , connected with the adjacent hills by one earth and one concrete dam ; excavating the channels between the locks to the required depths , and the excavation of the channel to proper width and depth to deep water in the Pacific . The Pedro Miguel locks connect the summit or 85-foot level with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 770,000 cubic yards , is completed , and of the 837,400 cubic yards of concrete required for their construction , 57 per cent is completed . The west dam connects the head of the locks with the hills to the northwest and performs the same function at the south end of the lake that the Gatun dam does at the north . It is to be of earth , about 1,400 feet long , 40 feet wide at the top , which will be at reference 107 above mean tide , and have side slopes of 8:I . It will be subjected to a maximum head of 40 feet , though the average head is from 25 to 30 feet . In its construction two rock piles are formed : between these two masses of material ( from which an existing stratum of gravel was removed ) , selected material will be placed properly puddled and rolled . This central portion will have a thickness of 140 feet at the bottom . Concrete core walls will connect the dam with the hill and lock . The dam , which contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent completed . The natural surface of the ground from the east wall to an adjacent hill is above the upper level , but it is to some extent pervious to water . To cut off any possible flow , the lock wall is returned toward the hill , with which it will be connected by a concrete core wall . THE LOCKS AT MIRAFLORES The Miraflores locks are two in flight , overcoming the difference in level between Miraflores Lake , whose surface is at reference 55 , and the sea-level section . As the fluctuations in tide are about 20 feet and mean tide is the datum , it will  | be noted that the maximum lift for these locks is about 65 feet . The excavation for the upper set of locks is complete and for the lower set it is about 70 per cent complete . It was not intended to lay any concrete until the plant at Pedro Miguel had finished the locks at that locality , but , as the work has advanced so much more rapidly than anticipated , and as the contractors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than expected , it became necessary to install auxiliary mixers and begin this part of the work earlier . There will be  | a total of 1,312,200 cubic yards of concrete to lay for these locks , of which 7 per cent is already done . The Cocoli River , a tributary of the Rio Grande , crosses the site of the Miraflores locks from the west , and is such a formidable stream in times of heavy freshets that the protection of the locks against its floods during construction and after completion is necessary . A diversion channel through the hills to the west with a dam across the river valley would accomplish the desired end ; but , as a dam at the head of and to the west of the locks is also necessary to impound the water for the pool above , the solution finally adopted was the construction of a dam extending from the head of the locks to Cocoli Hill , with a direction nearly parallel to the axis of the locks ; by this arrangement the Cocoli River will discharge into the upper pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , top width 40 feet at reference 70 , and the side slopes approximately 12:1 . The average head to which the dam will be subjected is 30 feet , the maximum 40 feet . It is being constructed like the Gatun darn , and is 43 per cent complete . The east dam will be of concrete , approximately 500 feet long , provided with regulating works similar to and of the same dimensions as those at Gatun , the crest in this instance being at elevation 39 , with seven openings , permitting a discharge of 7,500 cubic feet per second . For a distance of one and one-half miles south from the Miraflores locks rock is found in the channel , to be excavated at an average elevation of minus 30 . The estimated quantity to be removed is 1,503,260 cubic yards , which is covered by 8,158,133 cubic yards of alluvial material , averaging 38 feet in depth . It was not practicable to remove the earth and rock by dredging and subaqueous methods , as the requisite plant could not have been assembled to complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ,  | therefore , selected as being the cheapest and most expeditious method of handling the loam , especially because by this means 450 acres of swamp land adjacent to the canal could be reclaimed . Four hydraulic pumps force water through pipes , fitted with hydraulic giants or monitors , with a pressure of 130 pounds per square inch at the nozzles ; these jets wash the loam to sumps , from which 18-inch centrifugal dredging pumps , mounted on reinforced concrete barges , pump the material to such places as may be desired . Below the area to be excavated in this manner , the channel is secured by ordinary dredging operations . Rock encountered is blasted , the drilling being done by churn drills through the natural surface to the proper depth or , where submerged , by use of a drill scow . A Lobnitz rock breaker is also in use for preparing the rock for the dredges . The total amount of material to be excavated aggregates 35,000,000 cubic yards , of which 73.55 per cent is completed . REBUILDING THE RAILROAD The relocated Panama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with canal construction work . From Colon to Mindi and from Corozal to Panama , the old line , relieved of some of its curvature , will be used , but the remainder must be rebuilt . From Mindi to Gatun , two miles , and from Paraiso to Corozal , four miles , the new line is completed and is being operated . Just south of Miraflores the new road passes through a tunnel 800 feet long .  | The section from Frijoles to Gamboa , 9 miles , is complete to grade and has been turned over to the Central Division for use in wasting material . This includes a steel bridge across the Chagres nearly one-quarter of a mile long . From Gatun to Frijoles a temporary line was completed up to grade 6o in April , 1910 , and maintained ready for operation at any time during the past wet season that the old line was flooded out . About 3,000,000 cubic yards are still required to complete the embankments of this section to elevation 95 , and every effort is being made to finish the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by January 1 , 1912 . On this date it is expected that work in the Gatun spillway will have progressed sufficiently to begin raising the lake to elevation 55 . Construction of the line from Gamboa to Paraiso , east of the cut , was started in January and will be pushed with a view to completion by January 1 , 1912 , if possible . As the greater part of the road passes through the lake , reinforced concrete culverts are provided to equalize the water on both sides of the em . bankments.  | THE CANAL WILL Bit COMPLETED ON TIME Generally speaking , employees are selected on account of their special fitness for the work in hand , and are then unhampered in their methods of securing definite results , thus bringing out to its fullest extent individual effort and brain power . As a consequence each man has a personal interest in the work and seems imbued with the idea that the success of the enterprise depends on him . The spirit of enthusiasm and of loyalty  | among the canal workers strikes forcibly every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canal will be built . The time required for completing the lock type of canal was estimated by the Board of 1905 , which made its report in January , 1906 , at 9 years , in accordance with which the work should be completed by January 1 , 1915 , and this is still retained as the date for the official opening . The expectation that the locks will be completed by June 1 , 1913 , is dependent on the gate contract and has already been noted , which leaves Culebra Cut as the doubtful factor . THE SLIDES IN CULEBRA CUT ARE THE ONE DOUBTFUL , FACTOR Assuming that all the material will slide into the cut that was estimated in June last , so that all of it will have to be removed , it is estimated that this part of the cut will be finished by September ' , 1913 . It is well within possibility ? indeed , it is probable ? that other slides or breaks will develop , and it may be more economical to admit the water , thus getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dredges , which will then be available and which can be passed through the locks when completed . This will be done if need be , but in any event there is nothing that can be foreseen at present which will postpone the date fixed for the official opening , with ample time to spare for tuning up the operating machinery and to organize and train a force for the operation and maintenance of the canal by January 1 , 1915 . With concrete work in the locks coming to a close in the early part of 1912 , steps must be taken to disband the present organization . The time has arrived for outlining an organization for the operation and maintenance of the canal . The tuning up of the machinery and the training of an organization will require the actual use of the canal . It is stated on reliable authority that at least 1 &; months will be required for shipping to adjust itself to the new conditions that will exist when the canal is ready for use . Such readjustment , however , will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are to be charged and the basis for such tolls . THE CANAL , IS WORTH THE $375,000,000 INVESTED Much has been said and predicted as to the commercial value of the canal to the United States . In this connection it must be remembered that the commercial shipping of this country never required the canal . The trip of the Oregon in 1898 settled the question of the advisability of constructing an Isthmian Canal , and had the canal been built at that time , thereby saving that trip , around the Horn , there is no question that it would have been agreed generally that the canal , even at an expenditure of $375,000,000 , was worth while . In whatever light the Panama Canal isviewed , it will have paid for itself if in time of war or threatened war a concentration of the fleet is effected without that long , tedious , uncertain route followed by the Oregon .  | It will practically double the efficiency of the fleet , and , notwithstanding the fact that we are a peaceful nation , our outlying possessions make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so recognized . From this point of view the debt should b ? charged to the account which necessitated its construction , and whatever revenues are derived from other sources are so much to the good . The traffic that will utilize the canal depends upon the tolls that will be charged , and the President has asked the Congress for legislation which will enable the establishment of rates . There is another policy which if adopted will have a material bearing on the revenues of the enterprise . Through the Panama Railroad a large expenditure of money has been made for providing the present working forces with supplies of all kinds . Though the railroad has been reimbursed for this plant through fixed charges on sales , it should not be abandoned but utilized for furnishing shipping with its needed sup- plies . Suitable coaling plants should be erected for the sale of coal to vessels touching at or passing through the canal . In addition , since oil is now used on a number of ships plying in the Pacific , such fuel should also be on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops now located at Gorgona must be moved before the completion of the canal , and they should be established in connection with a dry dock that will be needed for commercial purposes , and utilized as a revenue producer for the canal . This policy also needs congressional action . With properly regulated tolls , and with facilities for fully equipping , supplying , and repairing ships , the Panama route would offer many advantages and bring to it a sufficiently remunerative return to pay not only the operating expenses , but to gradually absorb the debt which the United States has incurred by its construction .  |
