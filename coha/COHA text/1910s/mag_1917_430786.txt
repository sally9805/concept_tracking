 | IT appears to have grown customary to take the yearly number of lynchings as barometric readings of race relations in the South . A rise from sixty to seventy in these wild outbursts of violence is taken to show increasing cloudiness ; a fall to fifty would show " clearing , with light variable winds . " But in spite of its general use this pseudo statistical device is of very uncertain value . For it is doubtful whether the actual number of lynchings has ever been ascertained , and whatever the number , not all the victims have been negroes . Furthermore , when it is known or suspected that race antagonism exists , it is so easy to attribute mob violence to that alone that other promotive conditions have been ignored . Yet it seems to be these other conditions in a very great number of cases , and not race prejudice , that explain the frequency of lynching in the South . A brutal crime growing out of malice , envy , lust , or degeneracy has much the same effect on the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it in common with cattle to be wildly stirred at sight of blood and conflagration , a sort of shuddering horror begets a hysteric wish to trample and gore . This trait of human nature is elemental and universal . It is also destructive and terrifying , and in their sober hours men know the need of guarding against it . Therefore , organized in society they create agencies not only to prevent crimes by individuals but also to control themselves when moved to mob and riot . In populous , well organized regions there are usually men enough and wealth enough to provide for keeping the peace under nearly all conditions . Primitive frontier settlements , on the other hand , and widely  | scattered rural communities find organization and maintenance always difficult and sometimes impossible . Between these extremes are many grades of civic development , and in each grade the attempt is made with the means available to adjust the protective agencies as closely as possible to normal local conditions . But in all grades they sometimes prove too weak for sudden and great emergencies . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for physical protection and control have the appearance of an outworn survival . The average county , the unit of local government , extends for many miles in all directions , and communication within its borders is frequently hampered by swamps , deep rivers or mountain barriers . The sheriff is sometimes a day 's journey distant from a spot where his presence is suddenly required . Even the magisterial districts , into which the county is divided , usually cover many miles of territory . Thus in a typical county embracing some five hundred square miles the sheriff , some three or four magistrates and as many constables constitute the whole establishment for enforcing order and keeping the peace . Of these the sheriff alone is supposed to give more than a small fraction of his time to official duties . His alone is a salaried position ; the others receive small fees for their occasional services , and the emoluments of office are regarded merely as extra earnings , they do not suffice for a livelihood . The dignity once attached to the position of justice of the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries no appreciable prestige ; and in an office lacking both honor and income it is seldom that men of force and training can be induced to serve . It is obvious that such an establishment exists only to " vindicate the majesty of the law " after it has been insulted . Its purpose is to arrest offenders and bring them to punishment when the offense is an accomplished fact . It is practically helpless to prevent felonious acts , to guard and protect the peaceful , to police the roads , to keep under surveillance turbulent or suspicious characters . Its function is to punish and not to prevent crime . In the discharge even of this function it moves slowly with cumbrous and creaking machinery , affording to the criminal abundant warning of its intentions and opportunity for escape . It is a deterrent only to those evildoers with whom the fear of a more or less remote punishment outweighs the temptation to  | break the law . As a means of controlling tumultuous outbreaks and group movements it is utterly futile . The question naturally arises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so weak an establishment for protection and control ? The answer is that for centuries it proved sufficient for their needs . Far back , indeed , into Saxon England its main features may be traced , and the early colonists received it as an ancient and cherished inheritance . Tradition , use , sentiment , and inertia all have helped to preserve it , but in England itself and in most parts of this country it has been strengthened and modified so as to adjust it to altered needs . It is because the needs of the rural South until recently have not so greatly changed that it is still retained there in almost primitive simplicity . More than anywhere else in America , the Southern white people are homogeneous . This means not only a common race , but also , in the great essentials , common beliefs , common convictions of right and wrong , a general agreement on the standards of conduct and behavior proper to each state of life to which it pleases God to call one , a general acceptance of the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general conformity to established usages . With such a people public opinion has an overwhelming strength ? vox popvli vox Dei ? and it is to this rather than to physical agencies that society has looked for both protection and control . It affords protection , because the individual before defying it must break the strongest influence that has surrounded him from birth , and outraging it is analogous to blaspheming God . It affords control , because it stands for law and order ; it is conservative , very definite and very steady . It is the Atlas that supports the sky and protects humanity from falling heavens . Jefferson 's observation of it in his day explains his theory of government , a theory based on trust in the people rather than in any artificial agency for physical control . That theory still persists , although with waning strength , among the homogeneous white people of the South , and public opinion is still the giant trusted to support the social firmament . In those regions developed under Anglo-Saxon institutions where public opinion has become uncertain or divided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting singly or together may account for the change . The  | immigration of large numbers with new customs and opinions , an economic growth that splits the population into classes with different interests and motives , intellectual movements that annihilate old ideals and beliefs while new ones are still vague or find limited acceptance ? these are among the things that in the more populous and progressive sections of Anglo-Saxondom have made necessary the creation of physical agencies . Until recently the rural South has been slightly affected by them , and the survival of old conditions accounts for the retention of old institutions ; the continuance of homogeneity , economic simplicity and intellectual conservatism saved the controlling strength of an undivided public opinion . Without discussing here the relation of law and opinion it may be admitted that submission to public opinion is very much like obedience to law . To say then that an orderly public opinion has in the main effectively controlled the people of the South is to say that they are essentially law abiding and peaceful . Probably such a statement will be received with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly it contrasts with the popular conception of the typical " Southerner . " It is true that within the boundaries of what is called the South there are regions , restricted but notorious , where lawlessness has prevailed ; where if there was a public opinion it did not stand for peace and order ; where Highland clanishness , Corsican vindictiveness , distorted notions of personal liberty combined to nullify moral as well as physical agencies of control . In a sense these regions are the last " frontier " of this country . They were occupied some four or five generations ago by men whose only title to the land was known as " rifle " right . In subsequent years isolation has arrested their development , conditions have continued primitive , and " rifle right " to many things besides the land still holds its sway . These well marked and isolated regions were never typical of the South , but their geographical location has caused much misapprehension . It appears then that the conservative character of the Southern people and the peaceful course of ordinary life among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies to control themselves . Until social and economic conditions were radically changed their trust in themselves was not unjustified . There is no reason to be- lieve that they are more excitable and vengeful than other people , or that brutal crime is more heinous in their eyes than in the eyes of others . It is indeed possible that the horror it causes among them is more general . For in rural regions and small cities and towns people are apt to know each other more intimately than elsewhere . In the South this intimacy is promoted by the homogeneity of the population . There are relatively few strangers and transient sojourners ; immigration has been small ; and all the residents of a community are apt to be well acquainted . What happens to one is therefore a matter of close concern to all . Men may be mightily unmoved by a wrong done to a stranger and yet be deeply stirred by the same thing in the case of a friend or acquaintance . Through their very cordiality and hospitable habits and the neighborly life they lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid sensitiveness to the horror of crime among them . This explains the seeming paradox that lynching occurs as frequently in a peaceful community as elsewhere ; indeed , the more peaceful the people and the more orderly the life , the greater will be the horror and excitement . But the South is not unique in this regard . Its distinctive weakness lies in its failure to adapt its institutions to social changes that in this generation have grown constantly more apparent . It should be emphasized that such fury is no respecter of race or color . It is true that more negroes than white men are lynched in the South , so many more indeed as to explain the belief that race prejudice is the cause of the evil . But in truth the disparity grows out of the fact that the kind of crimes that provoke lynching are more often committed by negroes than by white men . This may be said without disparagement of the negroes as a race , with no reflection upon their docility , their amiable good nature , their efforts to attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past and their prospect for the future . For it is not because they are negroes that more of the brutal criminals are black than white ; it is because in the South more black men are exposed to the conditions and forces that make men criminal . In every society crimes of lust , degeneracy or hatred predominate in the poorest class of the population . Ignorance and squalor and vice and crime and poverty and disease of body and soul are commonly found together . Certainly not all poor men are criminals , nor are  | all criminals poor . None the less , the close connection between crime and ignorance and want is too well known to need discussion . Furthermore , it is with members of this class that the controlling influence of public opinion is weakest . When the ties of home and property are lacking , when there is no established position of respectability to be maintained , when one 's usual associates and acquaintances are already the lowest in the social scale , what is to be lost by offending public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already at the bottom , and the fear of physical punishment is the only deterrent to wrongdoing . Now , the poor we have always with us . There is no known society without its squalid and ignorant class . But in most regions this class is not distinguished by race and cjlor from the class above it , whereas in the South the class of the very poor is still composed for the most part of negroes . That it contains no small number of depraved whites may be freely admitted . Also it should be emphasized that it does not contain more than a small part of the colored race , a race that as a whole has made in fifty years a progress in civilization that has never before been achieved in the same time by any people in history . But it was inevitable that in this swift progress many weak and unfortunate members must be left behind . In the advance from the verge of barbarism to an appreciation of law and order and decency the-re were obstacles that many members of the race could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went backward ; and it is they who mainly compose the worst class of the Southern population . It is in this fact that we find the true explanation of the greater number of negroes that are lynched . It is , then , not against the race but against the criminal that the fury of the mob is directed . But before this fury any negro is in one respect at a disadvantage . Suspicion falls upon him more readily than upon a white man , because the negro belongs to the race with the larger proportion of ignorance and delinquency . Even a half frenzied mob requires strong evidence before it imputes to a white man the guilt of a heinous crime , because such crimes are more likely to be committed by the depraved members of the poorer race . For this reason it very seldom happens that an innocent white man is lynched , while it is a lamentable truth  | that innocent negroes are sometimes done to death with every accompaniment of gruesome torture . But while the mob is quicker to impute crime to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual and not the race that moves it to violence . This is no mere distinction without a difference : it is an expression of the fact that crime and not color is the incentive to lynchings . It would be false to say that race prejudice does not exist in the South . It would be equally false to say that it does not exist wherever two races with strongly marked differences inhabit the same territory . At the same time lynching in the South is not always one of its manifestations . But even when race prejudice has not caused lynching , it seems certain that lynching has greatly increased race prejudice . For it is not unnatural that the greater frequency of negro lynchings should be attributed to race hatred by those that do not understand its cause , and among these are the greater part of the negroes themselves . A continuation of the practice , therefore , will inevitably widen the gulf between white and black and inflame the resentment of the negroes by increasing their feeling of injustice and discrimination . Indeed , already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has weakened their respect for the white man 's law to see the white man himself set it at defiance . It gives them a grievance under which they withdraw further from the white man 's influence , attach less value to his good opinion , are less willing to cooperate with him for the maintenance of law and decency and the promotion of the general public welfare . At the same time it has tended to demoralize the white race and to affect its attitude towards the negroes . Whenever men with a standard of respectability to maintain transgress the bounds of decency , they seek palliation and excuse . When a man who is usually temperate becomes drunk and disorderly , he tries to shift the blame to his associates or the conditions that led to his lapse . In the same way lynching mobs try to justify their deeds by fixing the blame on their victims . To do this they point to the prevalence of crime among the negroes , their bestial propensities , their lack of moral sense , their inaccessibility to the motives that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary procedure of the courts is too slow and orderly and decent to act as a deterrent to such a race , and that the only effec- five preventive of crime among them is a vengeance so swift and ghastly as to fill the soul with dread . This sort of reasoning , adopted by the perpetrators of a lynching to soothe their own sense of shame after defying the law , ends by convincing them and their friends that the negro race is in truth too vile to be treated as other human beings . Thus an act that was really caused by the crime of an individual results in widening the breach between the races ; it makes easier its own repetition ; and sometimes even prepares the way for genuine race riots . The futility of the reasoning is obvious to those who know how mob violence is precipitated . It is not the thoughtful action of men who aim to protect society ; it is an uncontrolled outburst of passion . Yet as a matter of historical interest it may be noted that it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lynch law " owes its name . Charles Lynch , whose name has been thus unjustly defamed , was an honorable Quaker gentleman , a justice of the peace in Bedford County , Virginia , and a gallant officer in the Revolutionary militia . In 1780 , when his State was threatened with invasion by Cornwallis , Lynch discovered a Tory conspiracy to seize certain stores that had been collected in his county for the American army under General Greene . As justice of the peace he had the conspirators arrested and confined till the danger was ended by the reverse to Cornwallis at Guilford Court House . When the war was over the men arrested threatened to sue him for damages , on the ground that he had overstepped his powers as a mere county official . But Lynch , who was then a member of the State Legislature , succeeded in getting through it an act to the effect that : Whereas divers evil disposed persons in the year 1780 formed a conspiracy and did actually attempt to levy war against the commonwealth , and it is represented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other faithful citizens , aided by detachments of volunteers from different parts of the State , did by timely and effectual measures suppress such conspiracy , and whereas the measures taken for that purpose may not be strictly warranted by law , although justifiable from the imminence of the danger , Be it therefore enacted , that the said Charles Lynch and all other persons whatsoever concerned in suppressing the said conspiracy or in advising , issuing , or exacting any orders or measures taken for that purpose , stand indemnified and exonerated from all pains ,  | penalties , prosecutions , actions , suits and damages on account thereof . . . The principle expressed in the preamble of this act , that measures not strictly warranted by law may be justifiable from the imminence of the danger , was the distinctive feature of " Lynch 's Law . " It is by appealing to it that modern " lynchers " seek to mitigate their shame in the eyes of mankind . The fallacy in their appeal is too obvious for comment . It is impossible to say with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the passing years . There seems to be a very general belief that conditions are improving , but safe grounds for the belief are not easy to find . Conditions differ very widely in different parts of the South . Statistics derived from different sources also differ , and none of them is altogether trustworthy . The best appear to be merely a list of the cases found by individual observers in the newspapers ; others are the result of estimate or pure guessing . In an open letter to college men the University Commission on Southern Race Questions reports a " decrease in the average annual number of lynchings from 171 for the decade 1.886-1895 to 70 for the decade 1906-1915 . " But no explanation is given as to how these very definite figures were ascertained , and it is hardly too much to say that , for the first decade at least , any approach they make to accuracy is purely accidental . For several years the head of the department of records and research at Tuskegee has compiled such facts about lynchings as he could gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 69 for 1915 , and 54 for 1916 . Much confusion arises from the difficulty of determining just what constitutes a lynching . Many a desperate or panic-stricken fugitive has been shot to death by volunteer search parties before he is actually captured . Especially is this apt to occur with a white desperado , who usually offers more resistance than a negro , and it accounts in part for the race discrepancy in the number of lynchings . Occasionally such parties are called out by the sheriff , usually they are purely volunteer ; sometimes they are disguised as white caps or night riders or maskers ; more often they make no concealment of person or purpose . If they capture the fugitive and then kill him , the deed is commonly known as a lynching ; if for safety or convenience , they kill him before he is captured ,  | it is not called a lynching . But whatever their procedure , their acts are in principle much the same as those of the typical lynchers . Perhaps an explanation of the belief in improved conditions is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of the economic and social changes that are taking place among them . The swift growth of urban districts with a greatly strengthened police system , whose influence reaches out into the adjacent country , the diversification of industry that brings a demand for more effective regulation , an altered social structure due to economic causes and composed of distinct classes with differing economic interests , the example of other regions which have already made the transition that is now under way in the South , the influence . of schools and colleges and individual leaders of thought ? these and other things have drawn attention to the need of measures for dealing with a wide group of interrelated problems . Many of these measures aim at the removal of conditions that promote crime . Reform schools , State institutions for the defective and delinquent , public hospitals and asylums for both races , well equipped boards of health , efficient organization of poor relief , enlightened methods of prison reform ? in the adoption of these things and in the aid that is given to them the negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other measures aim more directly at control . There is a marked tendency to increase the powers of the State governments . They share at least equally with the localities in the support and control of public education . Local option seems to be nearly everywhere giving way to Statewide prohibition . In most States the assessment and collection of taxes is under the strict supervision of the State . State regulation of banks , public utilities and other corporations has been extended to include many kinds of unincorporated business and individual activities . All signs indicate that the Southern people are becoming decidedly " governmentish " ? to use a word of William Penn . They are trusting less to self-control and public opinion and relying more on government control and statute law . There are many who believe that the change will not be for the better . Be that as it may , it is as yet too recent and incomplete to forecast its effect on race conditions .                   @ @
