It is , therefore , with great regret that I am asking you for space to call attention to a very peculiar condition of patriotism in the East . I spent my Summers on the Atlantic Massachusetts coast in a place which shall be nameless , visited various relatives in different parts of New England , and found ' everywhere a complete disregard of the sugar regulations and of a good many other Food Administration rules which have been rigorously observed in the West here for a goob deal more than a year . I regret this more because the East has been so proud of Its patriotism and because I have listened to a great many supercilious remarks about the lack of patriotism in the Middle West , especially in St. Louis , where I live . It seems to . me a great pity that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Vehemence should have eaten ? during the Sumner several times more sugar than the Government allowed them . The Food Administration officers insist that they are literally helpless in the face of public opinion . It seems to me high time that something was done in other parts of the country , of . which I hope New York is one , to put some pressure on public opinion in New England . ROLAND G. USHER .
