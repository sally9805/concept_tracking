txt Vice President Thomas R. Marshall was interviewed over the long distance telephone by THE Nmw YORK TimEg last night at the-CopleyPlaza Hotel in Boston with regard to George W. Wickersham 's opinion , expressed in a speech in New York , that , should President Wilson by going to Europe to attend the Peace Conference put himself In a position where he could not exercise any of his duties , his powers and duties under the Constitution would devolve , unon the Vice President . , The Vice President emphasized the fact that the propositions presented by the former Attorney Genera : were quite new to him and that he was replying to them informally and without mature consideration . Nevertheless , lie was quite frank as to his attitude toward the contemplated departure of President Wilson and as to his own course during the President 's absence . Mr. Marshall stated categorically his attitude toward the three methods advanced by Mr. Wickersham under one of which , in the latter 's opinion , Mr. Marshall might have to aseume the duties of Chief Executive of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the suggestion that 1 might voluntarily assume the Presidency and raise a legal question as to my right of tenure by some such act as the signing of a legislative bill : 1 can state now definitely and positively that I shall not of my own volition ' assume President ? Vilson 's office or the duties thereof if the President departs from the ' United States to attend the Peace Conference . " Two  --  As for the ' suggestion that a joint resolution of Congress might be adopted to ' set the Vice . President in motion ' : This proposal is entirely new to me , and I am unable to commit myself as to what ? I would do if the Congress should adopt jointly such a resolution . " Three  --  In answer to the suggestion that a court having jurisdiction might mandamus me to assume the duties of the President:0 I unquestionably would assume the Presidency of the United States and exercise the duties of that office if a court having jurisdiction directed me to do so . " These three categorical answers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . Marshall , and ve  --  fied /As him as correct . To Tin : TIMES correspondent in Boston he added : " It is the duty of every American citizen to obey the judgments of courts , and I would obey - them , not because I want to , bat , as a late-abating citizen , would feel compelled to do so . " I hope the controrcrsy will be stopped , as I have not the slightest dc , irc nor intention of interfering with the President , unless 1 am forced to . and that te'a't be of infinite regret to me . " Mr. Marshall manifested great reluctance to . discuss the whole subject without having given careful consideration to every possible phase of it . His reluctance sprang from two can : es : First , an ardent desire that neither the President nor the people of the United States should gather the impression that he is in any faint sense , even , opposing the departure of Mr. Wilson , and , second , a ' full appreciation of the delicateness of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with President V.'neon have been extremely warm and friendly and cordial , " said Mr. Mar , ihall , " and they are so today . For that reason I can not emphasize too strongly that . I do not wish to say anything I hat might . com.ey the impression that I thialt he should not go .3 the Peace Conference if be sees fit to go . Furthermore , 1 do not want to say one word I hat ! nigh ! give the imprcssioir that I was participating in any discus:sem of constitutionality , or precedent , or propriety , which is designed to make him hesitate or to induce him to +abandon his journey . " I have assumed from the first that there was no barrier to Mr. Wilson s leaving the country to attend the I'cace Conference if he decided that it was his duty to go abroad for tnat purpose . The only discussion as to the constitutionality of such an act that . I have heard was a brief one to which I listened recently , and which concerned itself solely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any question as to what would happen at home if he did go . " I emphasize that because I am particularly anxious that the public should understand that I have taken no position In opposition to the Preeitient 's going , and I most certainly want him to know beyond a doubt that , so far as I have formed any opinion , that opinion has been that he certainly could go if he wanted to . " ( " You also convey the idea , " Mr. Marshall was told , " that you have not given any consideration to the question of your own line of action in case the Presieent leaves the count ! ye " " That is correct , " he replied , " at least in the negative sense , that I have assumed that his going did not cyncern me officially . It had not occurred to me that any responsibility might develop in his absence which I might have to assume , nor was I aware that any question would arise as to any effect upon me officially of his departure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marehail over the telephone Article 2 , Section 1 of the Constitution of the . United Staten , which provides : In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignaeron , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office , the same snail devoi  --  e on the Vice President , and the congress may by alw provide for the ease of removal , death , res.enation or Inability , both of toe Presiuent and Vice President , declaring what ofLeer shall *en act as Presment , and such ot fa:or shad act ** y , until the eleability be remover ' , or a President ahait be elected . " Of course , I ant aware of that constitutional provision , " Mr. Marshall replied , " but I repeat 1 have not considered it in connection with Mr. N , v'ilson s forthcoming- trip . 1 never dreamed of ads trouble arising . 1 can say to you that not voluntarily shall I assume Inc office of Presidenk of the United States . I should become President dururg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur through some judtial or legislative process . The idea of its occurring through legisiadve process is new to ine , so I can not attempt to say now what I would do if the two houses of Congress in joint resolution should call upon me to act . That is a responsioility teat would have to he met when it arose and if it arose . The possibility of judicial action is a different one . If that should he taken a court possessed of jurisdiction should order me to assume the Preen cy , I certainly v. ould obey that court , and I would ' assume and discharge the duties of the Presidency . " I have made no investigation of this subject . I saw no reason to . The ' President decided it was right and proper for him to go to the Peace Conference , and I supported his decision heartily and cordially . Most certainly I do not want his job while he Is away . That does not mean that I am dodging responsibility . I am not . If the question should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsilnity was placed upon me . I ant most reluctant to become involved in any academic discussion of the constitutional or other questions involved , because I am fearful that my participation in , such a ' discussion might give the President the impression that I am in some way opposing his going . I am not . Furthermore , 41S . I said , I have not stunted - these questions for the reason that 1 did not anticipate anything arising which would force them upon me . " Asked if it were true that under his present plans he himself would be absent from ivashington most of the time during Mr. Wilson 's own absence , Mr. Marshall said : " 1 can not answer that definitely now , because I have just heard from Washington regarding a matter that is not yet settled , and if that matter is not settled before the 14018ident goes , 1 shall have to cancel my trip and stay in Washington . " " Is that a personal matter or a Government matter ? " Mr. Marshall was asked . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which Mr. Marshall referred is a speaking tour under the auspices of the League to Enforce Peace , of which former President William H. Taft is President . This tour , which is to take him across the continent , Mr. Marshall said , was planned before there was anything definite about President Wilson going to Europe , thus disposing of ' Washington gossip to the effect that the journey had been devised purposely to keep the Vice President away from the capital during Mr. Wilson s own absence . If the Government matter to which he referred is dIsporied of in time , Mr. Marshall probably will be away about six weeks -- -the , same length of absence that Mr. Wilson is understood to contemplate . The Vice President is scheduled to speak in Chicago on Dec. 4 , and from there his proposed itinerary would carry him to Des Moines , Omaha , Reno , Salt Lake , and San Francisco , after which he and Mrs. Marshall plan to spend some time with Mrs. Marshall 's parents at .
