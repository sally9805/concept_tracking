NERO did not fiddle when Rome was burning . He had no fiddle ? nobody had in his day , nineteen centuries ago . The violin , as played in our homes and concert halls , is little more than three centuries old . Today it is , next to the piano , the most generally played of instruments and perhaps the most beloved of all , because of the human quality of its tone and expression . The popularity of the violin is indicated by some- surprising figures gathered in England a few years ago . It was found that even in that supposedly " unmusical country " there were orchestras in five thousand schools , and these orchestras included 200,000 violin-playing children . This means what has been truly called " a movement of gigantic proportions and incalculable possibilities , " especially since conditions are similar in other countries , including the United States . In view of this great and growing popularity of the violin , it would be interesting to know something definite about its origin . Many scholars of many lands have spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , but the early genealogy of the violin still remains obscure . Crude , primitive instruments played with a clumsy bow may have existed in India , Egypt , or China , thousands of years ago ; but whether the first bowed instruments used in med√¶val Europe originated in those countries , or in Europe itself ; is not known . A REASON FOR EVERY DETAIL The modern violin , when we come to think of it , with its deeply curved waist lines , its corner blocks , its two f-shaped holes , its movable bridge holding up the strings , and its finger-board , is certainly an odd-looking  | little wooden box ; yet every one of the details in ' its make-up has its acoustic reason for being just as it is . Deviations from them result , as a thousand experiments have shown , in loss of volume or beauty of tone . Three kinds of wood are used in making the best violins ? maple , pine and ebony . The instrument consists of no fewer than seventy different parts , fifty-seven of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible in all of these seventy parts , one can see at a glance what abundant opportunities were offered the master builders to improve on their predecessors by careful choice of material , details of shaping , size , varnish , and so on . AMATI , GUARNERI , AND STRADIVARI The builders who made the best use of these possibilities of improvement were mostly Italians , the most famous of them being members of theAmati ( ah-mah ' - tee ) , Guarneri ( gwarnay ' - ree ) , and Stradivari ( strah-de-vah ' - ree ) families , several of them in each case . The earliest of the wonderful old Italian violins , those made by the Amatis , have not stood the wear and tear of time so well as the others . Their tone is very sweet and mellow , but lacks sonority and carrying power in a large hall . The greatest member of the Amati family , Nicolo , lived from 1596 to 1684 . The evolution of the violin has been called the " survival of the loudest . " The church was the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big tone . It was the problem of the successors of Amati ? of the members of the Guarneri and Stradivari families and other famous makers ? to augment the tone of the violin while still further improving its mellow beauty . And so admirably did they succeed that the models left by these old Italians have never been improved upon or equalled . Though one of the latest of all instruments to come into use , the violin , thanks to these experts , was thus the first to reach absolute perfection ? three centuries ago . All other instruments are still being improved . Of the five famous members of the Guarneri family , Joseph del Gesu ( 1683-1745 ) was the greatest ; his instruments ( Fritz Kreisler uses one at his recitals ) are as much valued as those of Antonio Stradivari , the prince of  | violin builders . This Guarneri had a keen instinct for choosing sonorous wood ; he found one piece of pine which " he regarded as a mine of wealth , " as Hart relates . From it he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stradivari ( 1644-1736 ) the violin reached its perfection . After years of experiment , he evolved the pattern which was to be the model for all time ? a pattern which promoted the vibration of the strings in every part of the violin , resulting in a tone of unprecedented sonority , mellowness , brilliancy , and carrying power . THE CREMONA SECRET Was it a mere coincidence that the Amati , Guarneri , and Stradivari families all lived in one place ? Cremona in Northern Italy ? For generations the notion prevailed ? and it is not yet extinct ? that the beautiful tone of Cremona violins was due largely to the particular kind of varnish used and the way it was applied . All efforts , however , to discover , with the aid of chemical analysis and otherwise , the secret of this varnish failed ; nor need anybody worry at'this failure , for it is now held that , as Thomas Porter puts it , " no varnish could make an inferior instrument sound well , while a superior one would still be good , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from damp and injury , and it adds to the beauty and individuality of the appearance of the instruments of different makers . But the beauty of tone is due to details of construction and to the wood . The Cremona makers had access to a supply of particularly fine balsam pine for their sounding-boards and for the sound-post under the bridge , which the French call " the soul " of the violin . This partly explains " the secret . " But the main reason why the violins of Stradivari are the best is that , better even than his great predecessors , he knew how each slight change of angle , size , degree of curvature , or thickness of the wood , affected the sound ; and he personally attended to every detail . THE BOW AND EXPRESSION A violinist may have a genuine " Strad " and yet be unable to play with subtle artistic expression unless he has also a good bow . Like the violin itself the bow has gone through a process of gradual evolution . The crude , mediaeval predecessors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crwth ( crowd ) , and the viol , were played with short , clumsy , inelastic bows , and as long as such instruments were used chiefly for accompaniments , this made no great difference ; but when , in the eighteenth century , Corelli , Tartini , and other masters of the violin began to write for it as a solo instrument , the demand arose for more elastic and responsive bows . Tartini ( whose piece " The Devil 's Trill , " which he heard Satan play for him in a dream , is still often performed in our concert halls ) , was so impressed with the importance of the bow that he wrote a treatise on the art of using it , on which expression in violin-playing depends . It remained , however , for a Frenchman named Tourte to do for the bow what Stradivari had done for the violin itself . His bows , which became the models for all time , are made of the most elastic of woods , the Brazilian Pernambuco ; the stick bends inwards , and every detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most subtle shades of tone-color and expression , as well as execute feats of skill previously not dreamt of ? even by Tartini . PAGANINI AND TECHNICAL SKILL Without these improvements in the bow , it would have been impossible for Nicolo Paganini ( pah-gah-nee ' - nee ) ( 1784-1840 ) to create such a frenzy of excitement all over Europe by his brilliant feats of execution . He represents the climax of virtuosity ( technical brilliancy ) in violin-playing . He created unheard-of difficulties , and then amazed his audience by the ease with which he overcame them . His astonishing performances on a single string gave rise to the legend that he had been in prison several years with only the G string left on his instrument to practise on . Some of the tricks with which he astonished not only the " natives " but rival professionals , he achieved by altering the tuning of his violin . Both fingering and bowing gymnastics were developed by him to heights previously unimagined . Harmonics , for instance ? those high , piping notes that are  | produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down on the keyboard ? were used by him in extending the compass of the violin to dizzy heights and in playing " double stops " ( two notes together ) previously considered impossible . Much wondered at also were his " guitar effects " ; that is , his plucking the strings with the left hand while the right hand continued the bowing . Unusual stretches added to the novelty of his playing , as did his unique effects with the " springing bow " and arpeggios ( are-pedge ' - gee- ohs ) , in which the notes constituting a chord are not played together but in rapid succession , up and down . One might say of Paganini what Matthew Arnold once wrote about Victor Hugo ? that he was " half genius , half charlatan . " While some of his performances had little more value than circus tricks , he was nevertheless a real creator . Not only did he reveal the utmost possibilities of violin-playing , as Liszt ( inspired by his example ) afterward did those of piano-playing , but he was also a composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Twenty-four Caprices , " indeed , received the compliment of being arranged for piano by both Liszt and Schumann . JOACHIM AND THE GERMAN CLASSICAL STYLE Directly opposite in character to Paganini was Joseph Joachim ( Yo-ah ' - keem ) ( 1831-1907 ) , who , though born in Hungary , completely identified himself with the cause of German classical music . To him all display of technic to win applause was abhorrent . His aim was to reproduce the music of the great masters exactly as printed , without reading between the lines or giving any individual interpretations , such as many of the greatest artists indulge in . His method did not lead to particularly satisfactory results with some of the other romantic composers , but Schumann was one of the masters he understood , and he became famous as a player of the works of the three B 's ? Bach , Beethoven , and Brahms . He excelled particularly as an interpreter of the works of Bach , who wrote much for the violin alone ? not only melodies , but harmonies , to play which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded by him , did much to increase the vogue of Beethoven 's quartets , especially those of the last period . He was also a missionary for Brahms , and disliked Wagner 's music . As head of  | the Royal High School of Music in Berlin for a number of years , he exerted a conservative influence on hundreds of pupils from all parts of the world . OLE BULL AND NATIONAL COLOR The great Norwegian violinist , Ole ( o ' - leh ) Bull ( 1810-188o ) , represents the popular and national elements in music . From his childhood he listened to the sounds of nature , and the traditional folk-music of untaught peasants was his inspiration . The result of this devotion was the unique Norwegian melodies with which he delighted the whole world , including that stern critic Joachim , who said of him : " His tone is pleasantly soft and full of feeling , " and " No artist in our time has possessed his poetic power . " In technical skill he was second only to Paganini ; but , unlike that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strength , which enabled him , among other things ( with the aid of a flattened bridge on his violin ) to play a string quartet all alone , drawing his bow over three strings at once , while the fourth was plucked with the left hand . Ole Bull played with composers as widely divergent as Iendelssohn and Liszt , and both admired him immensely . He once went on tour with Patti , but usually traveled alone , and had all the world at his feet . He interested the unmusical as well as the musical . Men and women who never attended other concerts , went to his . In the United States one year he gave two hundred and seventy-four concerts in six months . Among the pieces played were two of his own , inspired by American scenery : " Niagara , " and " Solitude of the Prairies . " YSAYE , REPRESENTING THE FRENCH-BELGIAN SCHOOL No violinist of the present generation has enjoyed greater popularity among the best class of music lovers than Eugene Ysaye ( ee-sai ' - ye . ) He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a boy he was so fortunate as to be able to profit by the lessons of two such masters of the violin as Vieuxtemps ( Vyew ' - tong ) and Wieniawski ( Vee-nee-ovs ' - kee ) . He soon developed a style of his own , and when " Joachim heard him he said : " I never heard the violin played like that before . " For twelve years he held the post of professor of the violin at the Brussels Conservatory , and also acquired fame as an orchestral conductor . His compositions never attracted much attention ; but as a player he was long considered unrivalled , both in Europe and in America , which he visited repeatedly . Like Joachim , he made a specialty of Bach and Beethoven , but his repertory was remarkably varied , and he naturally paid much attention to Belgian and French composers , some of whom , like Cesar Franck and Vincent D'Indy , ( van ' - song- dan- dee ' ) he helped to make popular . He got from his instrument a rich , warm tone , and indulged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory was so remarkable that , like Hans von Billow , ( bee ' - low ) the pianist , he could play a piece in public after merely studying the score with his eyes . In the United States , for years , he held first place in the affection of music lovers , as Ole Bull did before him and Kreisler does now . MAUD POWELL : WOMEN VIOLINISTS Maud Powell , who is America 's leading violinist , and second to no violinist of her sex of any time or country , is the niece of Major J. W. Powell , famous as the pioneer explorer of the Grand Canyon of Arizona . There are in her playing a dash and a daring that remind one of her uncle . It has been said that the highest creative genius combines virile strength with feminine tenderness . The same is true of interpretative ability . It is true of Maud Powell 's playing . So perfect is her technical skill that she has been called " The Lady Paganini " ; but she doubtless values more highly the references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilling tone , " " Magnificent abandon , " " Marvellous sense of rhythm , " " Subtle feminine charm , " " Magnetic personality , " and " Lavish display of temperament . " Probably this temperament is an inheritance  | from a strain of Hungarian blood on the side of her mother , who was an amateur composer . Maud Powell , whose name off the stage is Mrs. Godfrey Turner , was born at Peru , Illinois , and is now in her prime . One of her teachers was Joachim . She has played before emperors and kings , and to countless audiences , the world over . She has daringly visited places which other artists had overlooked , and has been everywhere received with enthusiasm . The explorer 's enthusiasm which she shares with her uncle has led her to introduce to her audiences many novelties , American as well as European , and she was the first to play over here some of the now famous concertos of modern European masters . We now smile at the notion which used to prevail that violin-playing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were much fewer players of the fair sex , both professional and amateur , than there are now . Among the names of historic interest are Teresa and Marie Milanollo , Lady Halle , Camilla Urso . Prominent among violinists of to-day and yesterday are Teresina Tua , Marie Hall , Kathleen Parlow , Eleanora Jackson , Leonora von Stosch . FRITZ KREISLER 'S EMOTIONAL ART The four men in the musical world who draw the largest audiences at present are Caruso , McCormack , Paderewski and Kreisler . Caruso owes his popularity chiefly to the luscious beauty of his voice ; McCormack , to his singing of ballads and airs dear to the greater public , in a sympathetic and ingratiating manner . Paderewski and Kreisler have always played what they themselves liked best , which is the best in music , and this makes their triumph all the greater ; they raised the public to their level , and the glow of genius which warms their playing makes it kindle enthusiasm even in those who do not ordinarily care for music . There are more men at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attended Kreisler 's recitals because they enjoyed the way he warmed their hearts , and made intelligible to them music which previously had been as a sealed book .  | " Say what you please , music is an emotional art , and it never quite takes hold of us unless it is exercised as such , " wrote Germany 's leading musical critic , Dr. Leopold Schmidt , a few years ago , in explaining Kreisler 's supremacy among violinists of our time . One must hear him play one of his own delightful pieces , such as the " Caprice Viennois " ( vyen-nwah ' ) , " Tambourin Chinois " ( tom ' - boo- rong shin ' - wah ) , Liebesleid ( lee ' - bes- lide ) , " Liebesfreud " ( lee ' - bes- froid ) , or one of his arrangements of old Viennese waltzes , or pieces by the Bohemian Dvorak ( vor ' - shock ) ? whose " Humoresque " he has made beloved by millions ? to realize what violin-playing can mean in the way of enchantment , poetry , melodic charm , glowing tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But while he is unique in this field , he is equally great in other departments . Of all violinists of the present or past , he is the most versatile . He plays Bach , Beethoven , and Brahms more entrancingly than Joachim played them , because he brings out more prominently the emotional side of their art , which , in his hands , undergoes " a change into something rich and strange . " For Beethoven 's concerto he has originated two cadenzas ( that is , special music introduced by the performer and played without accompaniment ) , which sum up the essence of Beethoven 's music as a few drops of attar of rose do the fragrance of an acre of flowers . It has been said that there have been only three composers who could write in the best violin style ? Bach , Paganini , and Kreisler . Paganini , as we have seen , exhausted the possibilities of technical display . Bach had a violin style of his own , in which " double stops " * play a big role . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other concertos , and in his own compositions , these harmonies  | resulting from " double stops " ( which made an accompaniment unnecessary ) assume such importance as to open up a new era in violin music . When he plays , it often sounds as if two violinists were performing a duo ? two Kreisiers ! The harmonies also add to the beauty of those delightful arrangements of old Italian and French pieces with which Kreisler has enriched modern programmes ? not only his own but those of the other great players , who have eagerly adopted them . Thanks to these rejuvenated pieces , and those that are entirely Kreisler 's , it may be said that he would be the most commanding figure in the modern violin world even if the Cossacks had killed him or crippled one of his arms . THE BEST MUSIC FOR THE VIOLIN Naturally the music most suitable for the violin is to be found among the compositions of the great violinists , from Tartini to Kreisler . They , better than anyone else , know how to make their instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the violin among the works of great composers who did not play it . The two most famous and popular of all concertos were composed by Mendelssohn and Beethoven , who were not violinists , but who were wise enough to consult great players while writing their masterworks . Brahms did the same thing , securing the aid of Joachim when composing his difficult concerto ( kon-chair ' - toe ) . Even thus , a critical joker remarked that it was written " against the violin " rather than for it ; but the players have learned to master it . Other concertos by famous composers which are often played in public are those by SaintSaens ( sant-sang ' ) , Tschaikowsky ( chy-kov ' - skee ) , Max Bruch , ( broock ) Goldmark and Dvoiak . From the purely musical point of view these concertos by great composers , and those referred to in the preceding paragraph , are better than those written by great players like Paganini , Spohr , Wieniawski , Vieuxtemps , whose main object in writing these pieces was to give the player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazzling manner .  | Concertos are usually in three movements , and with orchestra accompaniment , although they are often played at recitals with the piano . Their number is not as large as it might be , and any composer , American or foreign , who can produce a new first-class concerto may count on a sensational success . Good sonatas for violin and piano are most abundant . Among these those of Beethoven , especially the " Kreutzer " ( kroyt ' - ser ) ( about which Tolstoy wrote a love story ) , and the three masterworks of Grieg are particularly enjoyable . Delightful short pieces have been written by many of the great violinists and composers , beginning with Corelli and Tartini . Lists of them may be obtained from any of the music publishers or sellers . Probably the most comprehensive of these lists is that included in G. Schirmer 's " Violin Teacher 's Guide , " in which they are classified as well as graded according to difficulty . Besides the multitude of pieces written specially for the violin , there are many arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some other instrument . Some musical critics think it " high-toned " to sneer at these arrangements , but when they are well made they are as good as the original violin pieces . Kreisler , Elman , Spalding , Maud Powell , and other great players often enchant their high-class audiences with transcriptions of classical or romantic piano pieces by Schubert , Chopin , and other masters ; nor are there any good reasons why good operatic and popular airs should be excluded from domestic or public programs .  |
