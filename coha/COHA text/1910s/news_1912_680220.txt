txt The Supreme Court announced no important decisions Monday . Chief Justice White announced the adoption of new rules of equity to govern practice before the Supreme Court to co into effect February 1 . The new equity rules of the Court are designed to expedite litigation by cutting down the size of records limiting modes of taking testimony and abrogating old forms of pleading and substituting therefor new forms in vogue in the " code ' states and in the Chancery courts of England . This is the first time in about fifty years that equity rules have been revised . One of the most important features of the new equity rules relates to issue of preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders . The rules as modified provide that no restraining order shall issue without notice unless it shall be shown that irreparable loss would otherwise result to the applicant . Hearings when there is no notice of the issue of a temporary restraining order shall take precedence of all other matters and all hearings in such cases are to be as expeditious as possible . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House and Senate .
