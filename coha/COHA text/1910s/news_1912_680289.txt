txt The . big motor stage that travels back and forth between this place and Roosevelt , seven miles distant , was headed this way with thirteen passengers shortly after 4:30 o'clock this afternoon and was approaching the dangerous Jersey Central crossing at Holton Street , near Sewaren , two mile and a half from here . That crossing , with six deaths marked against it in the last ten years , has no.gates to guard it , but a bell rings whenever a train is approaching . As the ' bus neared the tracks this bell was signaling the approach of the Atlantic City Express ; then shooting over the roadbed at a , rate of more than sixty miles an hour . The driver of the ' bus was sheltered from the wind and the sound of the bell within the glass vestibule of the stage . Moreover his own machine was trundling noisily , and with these two factors operating , the bell rang unheard . Stage and flier reached the crossing at the same moment . The train struck the rear part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sixty feet . The passengers were tossed with it , and the express train passed on its way .

The wounded were removed at once to the Perth Amboy Hospital . When the men who were carrying out the injured came to the Thornton children they hesitated . " Why , those two children are dead , " they said , thinking that in these two cases , at least , the need for ambulances was over . A woman stretched on the floor of the baggage car turned her head and looked at the children as the men spoke . Then she groaned and fainted . She died on the way to the hospital . It was supposed at first that she was the mother of the children , but this identification was soon discarded and until a late hour last night she remained nameless .
