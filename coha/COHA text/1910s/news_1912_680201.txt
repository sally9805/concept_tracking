txt Opposition on Account Of Danger to Buildings Apparently Overcome . The two schools of opinion on the practicability of the William Street Subway aired their views yesterday at a meeting called by William J. Schieffelin at the Drug and Chemical Club , 100 William Street . Mr. Schieffelin and the majority of those present were in favor of using William Street as a rapid transit route . and they were supported by the expert opinion of T. Le Roy Harkness , one of the counsel of the Public Service Commission , and Alfred Craven , chief engineer of the commission . The property owners further down the street , who organized against the proposed subway last July , sent Carl A. Mead , their counsel , and Daniel Moran , their engineer , to explain why ' they considered the route impracticable . The result was an interesting discussion , and the formation of the Abutting Property Owners ' Association in favor of the Park Place and William street subway route , the Executive Committee of seven of which will consider what steps to take to insure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bassett opened the meeting with an address , in which he answered the objections raised to the subway on the ground that it would undermine the foundations of the adjoining buildings . The structure , he pointed out , would be double-decked , and the contractors would be under bond to underpin all buildings along the route . Special stress was laid on the fact that this underpinning would precede the actual subway digging , so that the buildings would be safeguarded at the very beginning of the work . Mr. Bassett also pointed out that many encroachments had been made by property lowners on the public streets , and that I these may be removed by order of the ' city at any time without notice . He asked whether it would not be better for the property owners to agree to the under , pinning of their buildings now rather than have them at - some future time removed . iThe practicability of the subway construction , he contended , was shown by the addition or an extension to the Corn Ex ' change Bank Building without danger to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Schieffelin , " shall the hypothetical fears of a few rich men hold up the whole Subway system ? " The William . Street route is not only an important link in the proposed new Interborough system , but also was adopted by the Public Service Commission as a cornpropise to its original plans , which were not acceptable to the B. R. T. At that time it was regarded as a solution of a problem which threatened to ruin all sub ' way negotiations . Mr. Harkness was then called upon to explain the safeguards which the construction contracts afford to property holders , and he declared that those persons who quoted the construction conditions of Forty-secon1 Street when the present Subway was ouilt , as an argument against the present project , were completely behind the- times , as they showed they had not inquired into the present modes of construction , Asked about the requirements of the New York Fire Insurance Exchange , Mr. Harkness reminded the meeting that the vaults were built under the street on a lrevocable permit only , and called attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last twelve years . " Now the exchange has suddenly Jumped in with its requirements , " he said . " It is a case of working a willing horse ' to death , but we have the question under consideration and hope it will soon be settled . We have already called the mat ' ter- to the attention of the Attorney ! General , and this may lead to legislation to re gulate fire insurance rates . " Charles A. Schieren spoke briefly in favor of the William Street route , and I then Mr. Mead explained the objections , of the property owners whom he reprosenteel . They considered , he said , that tile subway under William Street from 33celciroan Street to Old Slip was an engiI peering impossibility , exrept at a prohibitive expense . It would involve an ex , cavation in fine sand and quicksand be , low the water level , and would inevitably I undermine the foundation of a great many buildings . In a great majority of cases , he contended , it would be impractei cable to protect the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practically prohibitive . Mr. Mead also pointed out that In 1506 commission appointed by the Appellate Division load reported against a William Street subway and that the city had not appealed from their report . Mr. Harkness retorted that this commission had been mainly maved by the argument that at that time no such subway was necessary , and Mr. Schieffelin wanted to know if sufficient account had been taken or the progress of engineering skill . Sir . Moran . ' speaking as an expert , then asked how Mr. Bassett would underpin the Fallon-Loeb Building , which is resting cn a " floating foundation . " and whether he would carry the supports down to the bedrock . No such problem as the William Street line , he declared , has ever been tackled in the history of subway construction . Mr. Bassett retorted that Mr. Moran 's argument would make it appear it would be impossible to excavate for buildings adjoining the Kuhn-Loeb Building without causing the Kuhn-Loeb Building to fall . Digging a subway was not different from digging to bedrock next door . Alfred Craven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plans for the subway , showing that it would be a narrow structure . " That is Lot a governing consideration , however , " he said . " We are proposing a perfectly possible engineering feat , and I 'm quite sure Mr. Moran would undertake to underpin all the buildings we shall have . to . " Mr. Moran laughed , and the vote on the formation of the new Abutting Property Owners ' Association was taken , 13 ' voting for it and I. against it . ' NEW CATHEDRAL CHAPEL .
