The scene is a sort of informal reception room at the KENTS ' . Its furnishings are few but fine , intimating quiet extravagance . The general tone is soft green with a subtle suggestion that the room has been lived in a long while . There are folding-doors in back , which , when open , disclose the dining-room beyond . A small door in the left , at back , opens out on the hall , which apparently leads to the library beyond . The general entrance for callers , opening on this same hall , is down stage . Directly opposite this , on the right , is a deep bay-window daintily curtained . A grand piano , with its key-board towards the window , rests in the alcove thus made . At the foot of the piano stands a lovely Japanese screen , which , with several tall artificial palms , half shuts off part of the room , in an intimate cozy-corner effect . A desk-telephone upon a small table between the doors , a deep couch near the center , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an early spring afternoon pours in the window and dining-room in back . When the curtain slowly rises the folding doors are open disclosing KENT , GILMORE , and two other men  --  BIDDLE and TAINTER  --  at the luncheon table . They are obviously absorbed in a conference , though they are not heard . A maid waits upon them . There is a pause . WOODS , a quiet-mannered butler , about sixty , enters from back . He carries a vase filled with large American Beauties which he brings down into the room and places upon the piano . He then goes back and pulls the folding-doors together , thus cutting the men from view . He goes out the main door . There is another pause . TOM PORTER comes in , followed by WOODS . PORTER is a genial , lovable man , verging on fifty , with hair noticeably turning gray . He is observing , acute , and keenly sympathetic . In spite of a persistent cheerfulness he suggests deep wells of feeling . He is obviously very much at home . TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? p. 3 WOODS Almost any time now , Mr. Porter . Mrs. Kent 's lunching out . TOM PORTER ( Looking at clock ) Um . Two-thirty . I 'll wait a few moments , Woods . WOODS ( Taking his hat and coat ) Very good , sir . I 'm sorry I ca n't tell Mr. Kent that you 're here . TOM PORTER ( Surprised ) He 's at home ? WOODS Yes , sir . Mr. Kent telephoned unexpectedly after Mrs. Kent had gone . Three gentlemen are lunching with Mr. Kent , sir . ( Indicating dining-room in back ) He left word I was n't to interrupt him under any circumstances . TOM PORTER Do n't bother him , of course . ( He lights a cigarette ) Political pot boiling , I suppose ? WOODS Yes , sir .  --  Would you like to wait upstairs ? TOM PORTER No . I 'll smoke a cigarette here and look over the paper . ( The telephone rings and WOODS answers it . ) WOODS Hello . No , Miss Deering . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in yet . Yes , Miss Deering . I 'll tell her . p. 4 TOM PORTER Hold the wire . WOODS Just a moment ; Mr. Porter 's here . ( WOODS goes out with PORTER 'S hat and overcoat . ) TOM PORTER ( At the ' phone ) Hello , Julia . I just dropped in to see Dora . Yes ; she 's coming right back . What 's that ? Got to see her alone ? Ah , you ca n't scare me off like that . Yes . Come over . I 'll tell Dora . Yes ; I 'll wait . ( More tenderly ) Julia , I 'll always wait . What 's that ? No , Central , I 'm sorry that was n't meant for you . ( DORA KENT enters . PORTER hangs up the receiver and they greet each other affectionately as old friends . DORA KENT , in spite of her girlish figure , is nearing thirty . Her obvious refinement gently colors a latent sense of power . Her manner , though never negative , is quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smart suit and hat . ) DORA KENT ( Good-naturedly ) Tom : I caught you . TOM PORTER Dora , dear . DORA KENT You ca n't leave Julia a single moment , eh ? Oh , do n't deny it ; I heard you . TOM PORTER Julia was ' phoning you and like the popular song : I happened to be there. p. 5 DORA KENT ( As he helps her remove her coat ) Does she want me to ring her ? TOM PORTER No : she 's coming right around . DORA KENT Good . I have n't seen her for ages . I suppose she 's absorbed in her new novel . TOM PORTER She 's absorbed in something , I know . She says she has something to tell you  --  alone . DORA KENT Tom ; are congratulations in order at last ? TOM PORTER ( Embarrassed ) Her and me ? Not yet . DORA KENT Nonsense . I never thought a banker who 'd beaten Wall Street would fall before a woman 's hesitation . TOM PORTER ( With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system : Julia 's only got temperament . DORA KENT ( Playfully ) Tom , exactly what is temperament ? TOM PORTER I never was much on genealogy ; but I should say temperament was certainly descended from St. Vitus . DORA KENT ( Laughing ) Tom , a lovely woman like Julia ought n't to be at large . p. 6 TOM PORTER That 's why I 'm trying to persuade her to marry me . But she 's awfully stubborn . DORA KENT Do n't hurry her . She 'll find herself . We all do in time . ( He looks at her enigmatically , as she buries her face in the flowers , deeply inhaling their fragrance ) Are n't they lovely ? Treated myself . TOM PORTER How you love flowers . DORA KENT Yes ; like Lady Teazle : when they 're expensive . ( She lifts the vase , and as she turns to put it in the dining-room , she notices the folding-doors are closed . ) TOM PORTER Woods said Wallace had some men unexpectedly to lunch . DORA KENT Did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , remember , this is the political season . DORA KENT ( As she presses the push-button on wall ) Yes : the annual show of spring candidates , eh ? Goodness , I do hope the politicians have n't been bothering Wallace again . I can see it 's getting on his nerves : so I get it . ( Smiling ) Take my advice , Tom : never be the wife of a District Attorney , if you can help it . TOM PORTER ( Laughing ) All right , Dora ; nor the wife of the next Governor , either , eh ? ( He pats her arm playfully. ) p. 7 DORA KENT ( Casually , as WOODS enters ) Woods , did Mr. Kent leave any word for me ? WOODS No , Mrs. Kent . I do n't think he expected you back so early . DORA KENT Do you happen to know who are lunching with Mr. Kent ? WOODS I believe it 's Mr. Biddle , Mr. Tainter , and  --  ( Trying to recall ) Mr. Gil  --  TOM PORTER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the name . TOM PORTER ( Turning away and concealing his surprise ) Mr. George Gilmore , um  --  DORA KENT That 's all , Woods . When they get to the cigars tell Mr. Kent I 'm home . TOM PORTER Better also tell Mr. Kent I 'm here , too . WOODS Very good , sir . ( DORA is arranging the flowers , transferring some to other vases . As WOODS goes out , she notices that PORTER is standing lost in thought . ) DORA KENT What 's the matter , Tom ? p. 8 TOM PORTER That 's Tainter from up state , is n't it ? DORA KENT I suppose so ; but I do n't recall Wallace ever met him before . TOM PORTER Biddle and George Gilmore , Wall Street . ( Dubiously ) I do n't like it , Dora . These fellows want something . DORA KENT Certainly they do : they 're in politics . But all they 'll get from Wallace is some of Letty 's real home cooking . TOM PORTER Well , I 'd be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so openly ; particularly now that Wallace is being mentioned for Governor . DORA KENT ( Confidently ) Oh , he 'll know how to handle them . And his record for his entire career will make them understand the sort of man he is . TOM PORTER Of course , of course . ( He watches her a moment ) What a part of his career you 've been . DORA KENT We have no children , Tom ; so all I 've had to give has gone into that . TOM PORTER You 've made it together . DORA KENT Yes : together . And I 've been more a part of it than even he realizes , have n't I ? p. 9 TOM PORTER ( Understanding ) Much more . ( He goes to her ) And Fred Safford ? DORA KENT ( With a slight start , as her mood suddenly changes ) Fred Safford ? ( She pauses as he looks at her in question ) Why should you speak of him ? TOM PORTER We seldom have since you sent him away . DORA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen nor heard from Fred since . TOM PORTER And you 've never told Wallace any of the particulars ? DORA KENT What good would it have done to have told him anything ? That 's all over , Tom . ( The doors in back open and WALLACE KENT enters , closing them after him . For a short interval the three men  --  GILMORE , TAINTER , and BIDDLE  --  are again seen at the table , discussing together.WALLACE KENT is reserved , forty , with a fine face and pleasant personality . He suggests hidden force and passion , coupled with considerable sensitiveness and intuition . He is a man not easily read . ) WALLACE KENT Dora , back so early ? DORA KENT ( As they kiss ) Oh , it was a dreadful bore . p. 10 WALLACE KENT Hello , Tom : what 's this ? A self-appointed investigating committee ? DORA KENT ( Laughing ) Goodness , no ; but perhaps you could tell us the secret . I asked Woods who were with you . Is it about the governorship nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a nomination this year means election sure . WALLACE KENT So they say . DORA KENT ( Good-naturedly ) Wallace ; Tom does n't like your company . TOM PORTER ( Protesting ) Now , Dora ; you 're telling tales out of school . WALLACE KENT ( Casually ) We 're only talking over the coming State convention . DORA KENT And you 're getting all shades of opinion , eh ? WALLACE KENT You see the political training she has had , Tom ? DORA KENT Tom thinks you ought to be careful . WALLACE KENT Indeed ? TOM PORTER Well , I do n't know much about politics , but it is n't the oyster plants that shed the pearls . p. 11 DORA KENT I said you 'd know how to handle them . WALLACE KENT ( With a slight touch of asperity ) I 'm not a fool , Tom . TOM PORTER ( Seeing the need of an explanation and going to him with genuine affection ) Wallace , I 'm afraid I 'm in bad . Do n't think it 's an intrusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three and Julia have been pretty close these years and  --  WALLACE KENT ( Seeing him hesitate ) Say it , Tom . TOM PORTER Well , I 'd hate to have you get that nomination unless it came right , and without any strings . DORA KENT ( Half-reproachfully ) Why , Tom . WALLACE KENT Nothing 's to be decided yet ; but the nomination will come right or not at all . TOM PORTER Do n't misunderstand . I know the pressure that 's being brought to bear on you to delay that C. N. Y. Railroad case . DORA KENT Tom , you really must be reprimanded . The idea of even thinking these gentlemen have anything to do with that case . WALLACE KENT Tom means the Railroad crowd would do most anything to get the prosecuting attorney , eh ? p. 12 TOM PORTER And those fellows have a lot of friends . ( Taking his hand ) I just wanted to hear you say it was all right . Forgive me . WALLACE KENT Oh , everybody 's suspicious of public officials nowadays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He smiles as she continues in good spirits ) But we must n't deprive these gentlemen of your moral influence . TOM PORTER No , no ; I 'm sure they need it . DORA KENT Tom will stay here with me , wo n't you ? He 's waiting for Julia . WALLACE KENT You 're always waiting for Julia . TOM PORTER One of the things I do best . DORA KENT ( Over near door ) I think this is Julia now . Stay a second , Wallace , and say hello . ( DORA goes out . ) TOM PORTER Can you hear my heart jumping ? I 'll never need digitalis so long as Julia 's in my life . WALLACE KENT ( Trying to be casual ) May a very unimportant District Attorney ask when it 's coming off ? p. 13 TOM PORTER Sh ! It 's such a secret even Julia does n't know it . WALLACE KENT Perhaps she feels a novelist should n't marry . TOM PORTER She 's not a real novelist ; she has money . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other with intermingled sentences . ) And they both understand what they 're saying . ( They enter . DORA having her arm affectionately about JULIA.JULIA DEERING is a contrast to DORA . She is also about thirty , but with an opulent personality , impulsive and rather emotional in speech and temperament , a bit assertive and seemingly independent . She is attractively gowned though with a faint suggestion of the unconventional.She halts suddenly on seeing KENT , is slightly confused , but quickly recovers and goes to him . ) JULIA DEERING Wallace , this is unexpected . I thought you were downtown . WALLACE KENT Sounds as though you 've been trying to avoid me . DORA KENT Yes : it 's been two weeks since even I have seen you . WALLACE KENT ( Indicating dining-room ) And now I have some hungry men waiting . p. 14 DORA KENT You see he will bring politics into the home . JULIA DEERING I want to see Dora ; so do n't let me keep you . But I must thank you again for letting my big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't told him yet , as I promised . WALLACE KENT ( Enigmatically ) I 'll be glad to give Armor this chance for your sake . TOM PORTER ( To DORA ) Is n't that just like Wallace ? DORA KENT When does it go to trial ? WALLACE KENT It 's on the calendar next week . TOM PORTER They certainly have delayed it . JULIA DEERING I 'm so sorry I sha' n't be here to watch Armor perform . He 's so eager and enthusiastic about everything . DORA KENT Surely you 're not going away ? JULIA DEERING I 'm afraid so . I 'm sailing before then . ( They are all surprised . ) WALLACE KENT You 're going abroad ? DORA KENT Why , Julia  --  no  --  ? JULIA DEERING Yes ; to Corfu . p. 15 DORA KENT Not while the war 's still on ? JULIA DEERING Oh , I guess it wo n't pay attention to me . ( Smiling ) I 'm a pacifist , you know . WALLACE KENT But , Julia , this is all unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance ) I 've been thinking for some time it 's best . ( Throughout the following a subtle tenseness , beneath the surface talk , is obvious . ) DORA KENT Well , I know there 's no use trying to persuade you how foolish it is , when you once get a notion . TOM PORTER You 're going to stay long ? JULIA DEERING ( Vaguely ) Oh , a year or so this trip . DORA KENT But you will be lonely there . JULIA DEERING ( Half light-heartedly ) Oh , no ; I have my work . TOM PORTER ( With a sigh ) The world is full of people who have gone away . JULIA DEERING ( To PORTER ) But do n't take it so terribly . There 's no reason to be glum  --  all of you . Maybe , Tom , you will come and see me when the war 's over . p. 16 TOM PORTER ( Whimsically ) Should n't wonder if I went before . DORA KENT You may have to charter a submarine to get there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank and kept some of it . WALLACE KENT You 're going alone ? JULIA DEERING To finish my novel . My publishers are getting impatient . TOM PORTER ( Mock seriously ) These restless women with missions and no husbands ! JULIA DEERING But you see , Tom , I 'm already wedded to my art . TOM PORTER Ca n't we find a country where bigamy 's permitted ? DORA KENT ( Laughing ) How many husbands do you think a woman needs ? TOM PORTER Lord ! I do n't know . That 's every woman 's eternal mystery . ( They laugh nervously to cover their varying emotions . ) WALLACE KENT But you 're not sailing right away ? JULIA DEERING I 've got to get my passports . DORA KENT Had your photograph taken and all that ? p. 17 JULIA DEERING ( Laughing ) Yes . WALLACE KENT It seems to me you 're taking chances , Julia . DORA KENT Ca n't anything persuade you to stay ? JULIA DEERING ( Significantly ) Oh  --  something may turn up to keep me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WALLACE KENT ( Shaking her hand ) I 'll see you before you sail . If there 's anything I can do , let me know . DORA KENT ( Going back with him ) Have you everything you wish , dear ? ( He nods ) We wo n't disturb you here ? WALLACE KENT Could n't hear a sound back there if I wanted to . Oh , Tom ; after what Julia 's told us , are you sure you do n't need a cocktail ? TOM PORTER No , Wallace . I 'm like the fellow who was asked by a musical hostess if he 'd like a sonata before dinner and he said he 'd had two on the way uptown . ( They laugh as DORA opens the doors in back and stands there a second with KENT . PORTER looks strangely at JULIA who is apparently under some agitation . DORA closes the doors , comes down , then goes to TOM , shakes her head indicating how sorry she is for him . Then she takes up her coat. ) p. 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must take off my hat which wo n't come off by itself . ( Closer , on second thought ) Julia ; what 's the reason you 're going away ? TOM PORTER She 's afraid she 'll spoil me if she stays and marries me . DORA KENT Something may come up to keep you , you said . ( Laughing good-naturedly ) Well , I 'll give you a few seconds , Tom , to find out what it is . ( Hesitating ) Was this what you really came around n't deceive me , you two . I 'm afraid there is a conspiracy between you . ( She goes out , laughing . JULIA sinks into a chair as though she has scarcely been able to control herself . She obviously waits till DORA has gone . ) JULIA DEERING Tom ! ( He comes to her ) Fred Safford has come back . TOM PORTER ( Astonished ) Safford ! JULIA DEERING Yes . He 's in town . TOM PORTER You 've seen him ? p. 19 JULIA DEERING No . He ' phoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to see Dora this afternoon . TOM PORTER ( Hardly able to grasp it ) To see Dora ! JULIA DEERING Yes . He probably thought Wallace was downtown . I tried to get him to see me first ; but he would n't . He seemed desperate , as though he 'd been drinking or something . TOM PORTER ( Realizing ) Good God ! She must n't see him . JULIA DEERING Why not ? TOM PORTER ( Surprised ) You ask me that ? JULIA DEERING He says he has a right to see her . TOM PORTER ( Emphatically ) He no longer has any rights here . JULIA DEERING He thinks he has : he still loves her . TOM PORTER ( Dismissing it ) But all that is over with her . JULIA DEERING Are you sure ? TOM PORTER Certainly . ( Between his teeth ) The dirty pup , to come back . p. 20 JULIA DEERING ( Surprised ) You never said a thing like that about him before . TOM PORTER I 've had my reason for being silent about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his address ? JULIA DEERING He did n't tell me . TOM PORTER That 's like him . But I 'll find him . JULIA DEERING No ; you must n't stop him from seeing her . TOM PORTER ( Astonished ) I must n't ! JULIA DEERING ( Realizing the difficulty of her position ) Would n't it be best if  --  if she found out for sure how she really felt ? TOM PORTER ( Persistently ) But I tell you it 's all over , as far as she is concerned . JULIA DEERING It was mighty important  --  once . TOM PORTER Yes ; of course , it was . When she and Wallace were n't hitting it off . ( Dismissing it ) That was only the usual let down after a few years of married life . JULIA DEERING But you seem to keep forgetting that Fred had come into her life ; that she loved him . p. 21 TOM PORTER No ; I 'm not . And she did what she should have done ; she sent him away ; she thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fred . TOM PORTER Wallace loved her . He still loves her . You know that . ( JULIA turns away ) Why , Julia , you 're her very best friend ; surely , you would n't want anything to come between her and Wallace ? JULIA DEERING ( Quickly ) Then you , too , are not sure of how she may still feel toward Fred ? TOM PORTER I 'm sure she must n't see him . JULIA DEERING You 'll prevent it ? TOM PORTER If I can . JULIA DEERING ( Desperately ) Tom ; yoxu  --  you must n't interfere . TOM PORTER ( Surprised and incredulous ) Julia ! JULIA DEERING I have my reasons . I ca n't explain to you . TOM PORTER ( Hurt ) Ca n't explain to me ! JULIA DEERING Let me see Dora alone and she can decide . p. 22 TOM PORTER Julia , your word has always been law to me . JULIA DEERING Then please do as I ask . Do n't  --  do n't interfere . TOM PORTER ( After a pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . JULIA DEERING Tom  --  TOM PORTER Perhaps you women see best . If she is willing to see him I wo n't interfere . ( With quiet determination ) But if he tries to force himself upon her against her wish , I know a way to silence Fred Safford . ( DORA has come in and heard the last few words . They turn embarrassed as she slowly comes down and speaks very quietly . ) DORA KENT Tom , you 've been speaking again about Fred ? Has anything happened to him ? Is he  --  ? JULIA DEERING He 's come back . DORA KENT Here ? ( JULIA nods ) Tom , is this true ? TOM PORTER Julia has just told me . DORA KENT ( As though not understanding ) But he promised  --  JULIA DEERING ( Abruptly ) He still loves you . p. 23 DORA KENT He still loves me ?  --  Too bad ! Too bad ! I had hoped he would forget . ( She goes to chair and sits down . PORTER lays his hand in appeal on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns abruptly . ) I understand now . He wants to see me . JULIA DEERING Yes , he 's coming here today . TOM PORTER Unless  --  DORA KENT ( Startled ) No , no . He must n't come here . ( Glancing back where KENT is ) I sha' n't see him . JULIA DEERING ( In spite of TOM 'S protest ) Then at my place . TOM PORTER Julia ! JULIA DEERING ( To PORTER ) Please leave me alone with Dora . TOM PORTER ( After looking at JULIA and resigned to the situation ) All right . Remember , I 'm just around the corner , if you need me . I 'll ' phone you later , Julia . Bye-bye , Dora . Let me know what you decide . ( Under his breath as he goes out ) The pup  --  ( DORA has moved her hand across her brow in a bewildered fashion , not noticing his last words . PORTER has gone out . JULIA makes sure the door is closed after him . She stands looking at DORA for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand affectionately on her shoulder. ) p. 24 JULIA DEERING ( Tenderly ) You still love Fred ? DORA KENT ( Indefinitely ) Oh , Julia , do n't ! JULIA DEERING See him . I 'll arrange it : at my place . No one need  --  DORA KENT No ; not if he still loves me . JULIA DEERING ( Moving away slightly ) You are n't afraid , are you ? DORA KENT Why go over it again ? What good will it do ? JULIA DEERING But has n't he meant something to you ? DORA KENT Yes . It would mean something to any woman when a man accepts a decision as bravely as he did . I 've not forgotten . I 've been grateful . But I thought Fred knew it was final . JULIA DEERING But you 'll never be sure of your own feeling till you see him again . DORA KENT ( Slowly as though puzzled ) Why do you wish me to be sure of my own feeling ? JULIA DEERING ( With growing agitation ) I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am  --  I am  --  as far as I can be . JULIA DEERING Then you do fear to see Fred . DORA KENT No ; I do n't fear to see him ; but it must stay as it is between us  --  for his own sake . JULIA DEERING You also forget Fred loves you . DORA KENT I 'm sorry , sorry . JULIA DEERING Is n't love everything ? DORA KENT No ; not everything . JULIA DEERING It should be in marriage . DORA KENT ( Looking at her ) You are reproaching me ! JULIA DEERING I 've said nothing to make you feel that . DORA KENT No , not in words : but I feel your silent reproach , just as I felt it when I sent him away . You 've always thought I should have gone with him . JULIA DEERING Only because I did n't want any one to be cheated . DORA KENT Fred may have been cheated ; but it was the situation not I that made it hard for him . I did what was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DORA KENT ( Confidently ) Oh , yes . He needed me . A scandal would have hurt his work  --  his political career . What he has become through me is sufficient proof I did the right thing . JULIA DEERING ( Turning away ) Success is not always a proof of what is right . DORA KENT It 's my justification for any wrong I may have done Fred . ( Going to her ) But , Julia ; why do you insist on my seeing him again ? ( JULIA is silent ) We 've been so close ever since we were children ; we 've shared all our confidences . But you 've come here now to urge something my whole instinct rebels at . I think I 've the right to ask you for an answer . JULIA DEERING I 've told you . DORA KENT No . You have n't explained your reason for wanting it . JULIA DEERING I ca n't explain . DORA KENT There must be something more than your consideration of me back of this . There 's some reason vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KENT ( Her intuitions now thoroughly alert ) You did n't want any one cheated , you said . You were n't thinking only of Fred . p. 27 JULIA DEERING Dora , I 've put myself in a false position . DORA KENT Has this anything to do with your reason for going away ? ( There is a pause ) Julia  --  has it ? JULIA DEERING Yes . DORA KENT Something might persuade you to stay . It is something to do with me . Have I done you any wrong ? Have I cheated you in any way ? JULIA DEERING ( Seeing she must face it ) I  --  I might at least have had a chance for happiness , if you had  --  DORA KENT ( Quickly ) If I had  --  what ? JULIA DEERING Oh , all that 's worst in me is coming out . Please , please , let 's stop . DORA KENT ( Insistently ) If I had what ? JULIA DEERING ( Almost inaudibly ) If  --  if you had gone with Fred . DORA KENT ( Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JULIA DEERING ( Defensively ) Well , have n't you been living a lie here ? p. 28 DORA KENT No ! JULIA DEERING Yes , you have . You 've loved one man and lived with another . DORA KENT ( Scarcely believing what she has heard ) Julia , Julia , I see it now . I was in the way . I am still in the way . That 's why you wanted me to go with Fred ; why you wish it even now ! JULIA DEERING ( Quickly ) Not go with him now unless you love him ; only give yourself the test . DORA KENT ( Gazing incredulously at her ) Julia ! Do n't turn from me . You mean you love Wallace ? ( JULIA tries to meet her gaze , then she turns and bows her head in silent acknowledgment of the truth . DORA looks at her a long while , then impulsively goes to her , clutching her arm . ) Does Wallace know this ? JULIA DEERING No . He loves you . DORA KENT ( Releasing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JULIA DEERING I 've been unkind to him . I 've even led him to believe it was Tom . ( Earnestly ) You know I 've never been disloyal to you . p. 29 DORA KENT Yes ; I 'm sure of that . ( Still incredulous ) You love him . That explains much I never understood . Poor Julia ! JULIA DEERING You pity me ? DORA KENT No ; I just understand . JULIA DEERING ( Passionately ) But I tell you , Dora , if Wallace had loved me I would n't have been the coward  --  DORA KENT That I was ? ( Eyeing her ) I wonder . I wonder . JULIA DEERING ( Humbled ) Oh , forgive me , dear . I 'm all impulse and selfishness . I 've suffered a lot . It broke my defenses just now unexpectedly seeing Wallace and knowing I was going away . That 's why I 'm going . I ca n't stand it . I  --  forgive me . DORA KENT ( Very tenderly , after a pause ) It 's best you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( As though thoroughly ashamed of herself ) But this wo n't make a mess between you and me ? DORA KENT No . I have n't forgotten all you did for me  --  once . JULIA DEERING I do n't know what got into me . It was just the wild chance that perhaps  --  p. 30 DORA KENT I 'm not angry ; only hurt a little somehow . JULIA DEERING You ought never to speak to me again . DORA KENT ( Tenderly ) Love makes us all do foolish things . There , there , Julia ; let 's say no more about it . JULIA DEERING ( After a pause ) And Fred ? DORA KENT ( Going to button and pushing it ) I sha' n't see him . JULIA DEERING You 're right . It 's better all around . I 'll tell him . DORA KENT ( Calmly ) No ; I 'll write him and you will see that he gets the letter . JULIA DEERING I 'll ask him to go away . DORA KENT Yes ; and tell him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a Mr. Safford should call  --  WOODS I was just going to announce him . JULIA DEERING ( Tense ) But  --  ( FRED SAFFORD enters quickly . They all stand still and silent.SAFFORD is almost the wreck of what was once a strong , handsome man ; his face is worn and dissipated , mouth hard and fingers nervous . He is thirty-eight but looks older . There is a very slight suggestion he has been drinking which tends to let down whatever reserve may have been left . There is only an occasional flash of what must have been an old charm. ) p. 31 WOODS ( After a slight pause ) Anything further , Mrs. Kent ? JULIA DEERING ( Relieving the situation ) Will you see if my car is there . WOODS Certainly . ( They wait till WOODS goes out . ) JULIA DEERING ( Goes to SAFFORD ) Had n't you better come with me ?

( Saying this for SAFFORD to know KENT is in the next room . SAFFORD is surprised at this , but apparently accepts it . ) Be careful , Fred , be careful ! ( DORA has stood as one transfixed . She has not taken her eyes off SAFFORD , who is also staring at her . JULIA goes out closing the door.There is a pause : SAFFORD takes a few steps nearer to her , hesitates , then slowly goes to her , as if to embrace her . She instinctively puts her arms between them , pushes him back , breaking from him and silencing him . He halts , half in query . They play the whole scene with a quiet intensity as though afraid of an impending interruption from KENT. ) p. 32 DORA KENT What do you mean by coming here ? FRED SAFFORD I thought you 'd be alone . DORA KENT But why did you break your promise ? FRED SAFFORD ( Surprised ) You do n't want to see me at all ? DORA KENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to say things . DORA KENT ( More tenderly ) Oh , why did you come back , Fred ? FRED SAFFORD Did n't you ever think I would ? DORA KENT I thought your promise was sufficient . FRED SAFFORD I was a fool to make it . DORA KENT Even when I asked it ? FRED SAFFORD It cheated us out of our happiness . DORA KENT ( Hurt more and more throughout ) Would it have been happiness ? FRED SAFFORD Beginning to doubt ? DORA KENT ( Looking at him ) No , Fred . I 'm sorry ; but seeing you again , I know it could n't have been happiness .  --  How you have changed ! p. 33 FRED SAFFORD ( Tensely ) Not in my love for you . DORA KENT Hush ! FRED SAFFORD Dora ! DORA KENT ( Repressed ) Do n't , my husband ! Oh , let me think  --  please , please . FRED SAFFORD I gave you time to think once , and I lost you . DORA KENT ( On the defensive ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ! FRED SAFFORD ( Forcibly ) Yes ; I did . DORA KENT No , no . I was down , weary , sick . Marriage was n't what I thought and  --  FRED SAFFORD You 're not going to hand out that usual talk ? DORA KENT ( Breaking slightly ) God , Fred ! Do n't you see I did n't want to regret ? It kept me up : the knowledge that I 'd done the wisest thing for us all . FRED SAFFORD ( Emphatically ) What you did to me made me what I am . Look at me . DORA KENT ( Shuddering ) No , no. p. 34 FRED SAFFORD Yes , look at me . ( Slowly ) I 'm a disappointment , a failure , eh ? DORA KENT ( Moving from him ) Yes ; and it hurts . FRED SAFFORD ( With a touch of genuine feeling ) I would have been different if I 'd had you . DORA KENT ( Slowly shrinking from him with growing disillusionment ) Oh , why did n't you forget me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora ; I could n't . DORA KENT I never forgot you , Fred . I thought you were a strong man , strong in your love ; strong enough to make your love , if nothing else , keep you clean . But you 've soiled yourself and me in coming back this way  --  in being what you are . FRED SAFFORD Did you ever once inquire about me ? DORA KENT I trusted you . FRED SAFFORD Then , how do you know what I 've become ? DORA KENT Oh , Fred , it 's in your face . FRED SAFFORD I love you , I tell you . DORA KENT Love ? p. 35 FRED SAFFORD Yes . You 've always been near me . If I 'd owned you just once I might have forgotten . DORA KENT Is that the way men like you forget ? FRED SAFFORD I 've tried to forget you , but I could n't . DORA KENT I gave you credit for everything . FRED SAFFORD Oh , no , you did n't . You really blamed me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , you did . I know women . You 'd have come with me , if I 'd made you . ( She gazes incredulously ) But I could n't stay and force you . You know Porter made me get out . Do n't try to fool me . DORA KENT ( Not understanding ) Tom ? FRED SAFFORD I want you to forgive me for going . But he knew the hole I was in . I did n't intend to keep the money , but I was desperate  --  DORA KENT You stole money ? You left Tom 's bank because  --  ? FRED SAFFORD ( Startled ) Did n't he tell you ? DORA KENT ( Shrinking back ) No ! Never that ! p. 36 FRED SAFFORD ( With a touch of bravado ) Well , it makes no difference . You 'd have to know some day . I was desperate after you threw me over  --  DORA KENT ( Revolted ) After ! And I thought it was your strength that made you go ! FRED SAFFORD I tell you you 've changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man should when he wants a woman . But I 've come back for you now . DORA KENT ( Sarcastically ) How you love me ! FRED SAFFORD ( Pleading quickly ) You 've got to save me , Dora . Every time life shuffled me rotten cards , I knew I 'd have played to win by your side . What was still decent in me reproached me and made me cling to the thought of you . I could n't pull myself up alone . The loss of you kept you alive . My love for you made me go wrong first and you 've got to help me to go back or I 'm finished . DORA KENT ( Incredulously staring at him ) You blame me ! You miserable  --  FRED SAFFORD You 'll blame yourself for what I am when you 've thought it over . ( Reproachfully ) You clung to me when you needed me. p. 37 DORA KENT I was unhappy , I  --  ( Turning firmly as he sneers ) No . I wo n't make excuses . Perhaps I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you found consolation with your husband . DORA KENT ( Her face brightening ) Yes . FRED SAFFORD ( Sneering ) And I suppose you have made yourself part of his career ? DORA KENT Yes , I have  --  as I told you I would . I 've helped to make him  --  FRED SAFFORD What ? A man respected and honest , eh ? DORA KENT Yes ! FRED SAFFORD ( Sneering ) Honest ? DORA KENT What do you mean ? FRED SAFFORD Honest ? DORA KENT ( As he laughs bitterly ) What do you think you 'll gain by insulting him ? FRED SAFFORD ( Abruptly pointing to dining-room door ) Who 's your husband lunching with ? p. 38 DORA KENT ( Involuntarily ) Mr. Tainter  --  Mr. Gilmore and  --  ( Suddenly realizing and becoming confused ) How did you know they were here ? FRED SAFFORD Did n't you hear Julia tell me ? But I did n't know who they were . Thanks for telling me . Gilmore , eh ? George Gilmore ! And Tainter , eh ? I thought so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAFFORD laughs ) What do you mean ? FRED SAFFORD For three weeks since I came back , I 've been nosing around . That 's why I waited before I saw you . I was afraid you 'd pull this good husband stuff . I 've found out what I wanted to know about him . And I 'll tell you how I found out if you want to know . DORA KENT Leave this house ! FRED SAFFORD He 's playing crooked politics . DORA KENT ( Sharply ) No . FRED SAFFORD Watch that C. N. R. Railroad indictment . You 'll find these fellows pressed for trial , like hell you will . DORA KENT ( Defensively ) These men have nothing to do with that case . p. 39 FRED SAFFORD Have n't they ? Well , their friends have and these are the fellows who can give your husband what he wants  --  the nomination ! DORA KENT Leave this house ! FRED SAFFORD ( Pushing her gradually towards the window , step by step ) Dora , Dora ! Do n't treat me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you . Come with me . DORA KENT Go ! Go ! FRED SAFFORD He 's no justification for what you 've done me . DORA KENT Do n't touch me . If you do n't go , I 'll call him and tell him you are a thief ! FRED SAFFORD I do n't give a damn now . I wo n't live without you . DORA KENT You 've stripped everything . Go . Go ! Sh ! ( She has retreated slowly to window by piano . The doors open in back and KENT , followed by GILMORE , TAINTER , and BIDDLE enter . KENT believes they are alone.GILMORE , an impressive , authoritative man about fifty ; BIDDLE , somewhat younger , is suave and polished ; TAINTER , rather rough and important.DORA instinctively covers SAFFORD . They are both hidden by the plants and flowers which screen the piano . SAFFORD grips her arm and listens with a sneer , as she stands dazed. ) p. 40 WALLACE KENT ( Indicating ) We 'll be more comfortable in the library . GEORGE GILMORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a question of a few months , Kent ; the reason for delaying the trial can appear perfectly legitimate , ca n't it , gentlemen ? ( Other two agree ) Besides , your record protects you from criticism and our position guarantees your success . ( He sees KENT 'S uncertainty ) But let 's go over it again . Perhaps we can put our offer in a more attractive way . ( To others ) Fine mild Perfectos these . ( The others , at KENT 'S suggestion , go out towards the library . GILMORE follows . WOODS has appeared at the folding-doors . KENT sees him . ) WALLACE KENT Woods , did you telephone my assistant ? WOODS Mr. Deering will be up later . WALLACE KENT These gentlemen need not see him , understand ? WOODS Yes , sir . WALLACE KENT Serve liqueurs in the library . WOODS Yes , sir . ( KENT goes thoughtfully towards the library . Murmur of men heard greeting him . WOODS closes doors in back and cuts himself from view . DORA and SAFFORD are alone. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! DORA KENT Go ! FRED SAFFORD I 'm a thief , am I ? Well , what 's he ? DORA KENT ( Dazed ) I do n't believe it . FRED SAFFORD He 'll try to fool you . DORA KENT ( Determined ) I 'll find out . FRED SAFFORD ( With hope ) And if  --  ? DORA KENT ( Finally ) Never with you . ( Motions toward main door ) Go ! Go ! You 're dead to me . FRED SAFFORD ( Tensely ) Dead , am I ? Then you 've wrecked me ; you 've killed me for his career and he 's crooked  --  crooked . ( Bitterly ) Do n't forget you 've killed me and he 's going crooked in spite of your sacrifice . Do n't forget that . DORA KENT ( Throughout ) Go ! Go ! Go !  --  It is n't true ! ( She half pushes him in disgust out of the room , closing the door . Then she staggers up to the folding-doors , leans against them , looking towards library where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her face is set in doubt and suspicion. ) @x Same as the first act . Late the next afternoon.The curtain rises on DORA seated at piano playing an aria from Madame Butterfly . She has on an after noon gown . She seems abstracted , pauses , and looks impatiently out of window . She does this a second time and apparently sees KENT . She gives an eager cry , then crosses quickly to door as though to meet him , but changes her mind and comes slowly into room . Though she instinctively resents her own doubt , it is seen that she feels she must question him about SAFFORD 'S accusation . KENT comes in and throws aside hat and coat . There is a note of quiet determination in his manner . He has some unopened letters in his hand which he puts on table . WALLACE KENT Hello , Dora . Feeling better ? DORA KENT Yes . WALLACE KENT I came in too late last night to disturb you and I thought you 'd better sleep this morning . Has Armor come yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see him at your office ? WALLACE KENT I have n't been there today . ( Looks at clock ) Have my brokers ' phoned ? DORA KENT Mr. Cooper did . He said he 'd ring you up later . ( After a pause as though she half hesitates to take up the subject ) But you have n't told me about the luncheon yesterday . p. 43 WALLACE KENT There 's nothing to tell . DORA KENT ( As he is glancing through mail ) You 're still considering being a candidate ? WALLACE KENT For Governor ? ( She assents slowly ) No ; I decided not to run . DORA KENT ( Obviously relieved , though surprised ) Not to run ? WALLACE KENT Why , I thought you 'd be disappointed ? DORA KENT ( With conflicting emotions ) I am disappointed , if you are . We 've both looked forward to it so . But I know there must have been good reasons why you have refused their support . WALLACE KENT They offered it ; but I could n't accept their terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to look at her somewhat puzzled ) Dora , are n't you feeling well ? DORA KENT I had a wretched night : I 'll be better now . WALLACE KENT Here 's some mail for you . DORA KENT ( As she takes up the letters , casually looking through them ) Bridge ? Belgium Relief . Wedding announcements ? p. 44 WALLACE KENT Not Tom Porter 's ? DORA KENT ( Good-naturedly ) No.  --  Wallace , why have n't you been nice to Tom lately ? WALLACE KENT Nonsense . DORA KENT No , you have n't . You 've really been awfully touchy . Here . ( Giving him some letters ) You 'd better take these . WALLACE KENT ( Glancing at envelopes ; tossing them aside unopened ) Bills , I presume . DORA KENT Have n't some of them been kept waiting quite a time ? The florist and  --   --  WALLACE KENT ( Avoiding the subject ) I 'll attend to them later . ( She has kept several letters in her hand and now , on seeing one , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceals it from KENT , who is still glancing through the rest of the mail . ) They 've reserved seats for Tristan . It 's the last performance . DORA KENT Will you be able to go with me ? WALLACE KENT If I 'm busy , get Tom . DORA KENT Wagner always gives him a headache . He prefers Butterfly . p. 45 WALLACE KENT I suppose that mushy music suits his mood . DORA KENT Still , he 'll go , I know , if that important Railroad trial is taking all your attention . ( KENT looks at her quickly . ) ( WOODS enters . ) WOODS Mr. Deering . ( KENT assents and WOODS goes out , taking KENT 'S hat and coat . ) DORA KENT ( Tentatively ) I 'll go upstairs if it 's private . WALLACE KENT No , stay ; of course , stay . ( DORA is pleased that he seems to wish her to remain . As KENT goes momentarily out to meet DEERING , DORA looks triumphantly at SAFFORD 'S letter which she has kept concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't so ! ( She tears the unopened letter up , with a certain finality , as though her doubts were over . DEERING and KENT , who have been heard greeting outside door , enter . ARMOR DEERING , JULIA 'S brother , has not yet reached thirty . He is virile , clean-cut , and ingratiating . He has an air of reliable manliness beneath his apparent earnestness , which , fortunately , is tempered by a sense of humor. ) p. 46 ARMOR DEERING How 'd do , Mrs. Kent . DORA KENT ( Greeting him ) Sorry I missed you yesterday , Armor . WALLACE KENT Cigarette ? Highball ? ARMOR DEERING ( Refusing both ) No . You know I 'm going to be married ; so I 'm reforming my present life . DORA KENT ( Without any hidden intention ) Then , Armor , you and Sally must be more than delighted at this opportunity Mr. Kent has given you . WALLACE KENT What opportunity ? DORA KENT Why , the C. N. Y. case . ARMOR DEERING Sister Julia just told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in court . I thought that was the reason you wished to see me here . DORA KENT Why , of course . You spoke of it yesterday , Wallace , during luncheon . WALLACE KENT Yes , yes ; but  --  ( There is a momentary pause ) Well , Armor , you know I 'd do whatever I could for you and Julia , but  --  ARMOR DEERING ( Sensing the situation ) Do n't let it embarrass you if Mrs. Kent or Julia misunderstood . p. 47 DORA KENT ( Puzzled ) Wallace , I was sure you said  --  WALLACE KENT ( Looking at her keenly ) I think you are mistaken , dear . DORA KENT Perhaps ; yet  --   --  ( She stops a second , puzzled ; then as she turns she looks at the torn pieces of SAFFORD 'S letter still in her hand , her suspicions again aroused . She takes flower vase , goes up into dining-room , throws letter in fireplace , removes the fading flowers from vase , etc. , and is absorbed in thought , yet half unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak in a quick , business-like fashion during this . ) ARMOR DEERING I felt all along it 's your case . It will mean a lot to your political future . WALLACE KENT I was not considering that . ARMOR DEERING I do n't believe you know all I 've unearthed . It will cause a political earthquake ; accounts juggled ; lobby expenses to ward off strike bills ; expenses toward political compaigns  --  all used out of funds , which , by right , belong to the stockholders . WALLACE KENT ( Feeling his way throughout ) Perhaps , after all , you are better acquainted with the case . But are the facts you have unearthed admissible as evidence under the indictment ? p. 48 ARMOR DEERING I 'm not absolutely positive , sir . WALLACE KENT But that 's vital . ARMOR DEERING I know a mere hint of what I 've got will lead the Governor to make an investigation of this whole situation . WALLACE KENT You advise me to make political capital out of this ? ARMOR DEERING ( Smiling ) It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to take your coat off . WALLACE KENT ( Casually ) It 's on the calendar for next Monday , is n't it ? ARMOR DEERING Yes , sir . WALLACE KENT I could hardly go through all the evidence before then , could I ? ARMOR DEERING ( Eagerly ) I 'm well enough prepared to open . WALLACE KENT ( Hesitating ) From what you say this appears such an important case that  --  ARMOR DEERING You feel you 'd better handle it entirely yourself ? WALLACE KENT ( Frankly ) What would you advise in my place ? p. 49 ARMOR DEERING ( Smiling ) You 've had more experience with crooks than I 've had ; but , then , I 'm still young . WALLACE KENT I can probably get to the bottom in a few days . I understand their counsel has asked for a postponement and if we agree  --   --  ARMOR DEERING ( Quickly ) I 'd advise against having this put over . Their counsel has already exhausted every technicality to keep this out of court . The court would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wise . WALLACE KENT Still , I hardly believe it advisable to spoil our case by pushing it prematurely . ARMOR DEERING But there 's no doubt about their guilt . WALLACE KENT Unfortunately moral certainty is not legal proof . If this case should be thrown out on a technicality , it means immunity from future prosecution . ARMOR DEERING ( Emphatically ) Their object is to keep it off the Spring calendar so that , after the Summer recess , the case may be tried before another Judge ; and they would gain the usual benefits of delay . Besides , next Fall , with the muddle of Municipal and State elections , they figure on the people being blinded to the real situation should all the facts be disclosed . And the yellow papers are already beginning to ask questions . So I do n't believe you 'll be able to explain satisfactorily to the voters why you 've put off this case , after I 've forced it to trial , should you , by any chance , expect to rely on their votes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't need the people 's votes ; I wo n't be turned from any course I think is right . If I halt this case one month or two  --  over to the Fall even  --  it will be because I think it wise . ARMOR DEERING I beg your pardon if I seemed outspoken . But I felt sure of my position . WALLACE KENT I 'm not intending to dismiss the case . ARMOR DEERING I ca n't help thinking how embarrassing it might prove for you if you delayed this prosecution too long , and the people should ask why . ( As DORA has come down placing the empty flower vase on the piano , she catches the drift of the last few speeches . She stands listening intently , unobserved by KENT . ) WALLACE KENT Why attempt to explain anything to the people ? ARMOR DEERING ( With feeling ) Mr. Kent ; I 'm deeply grateful for all you 've done for me . I know I 'd never been appointed your assistant if I had n't happened to be Julia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know best about this , sir . You must excuse me if  --   --  WALLACE KENT ( He is obviously moved . His manner is affectionate and it is seen his course has been difficult ) Armor , Armor . Forgive me . I quite appreciate the disappointment this must be to you . p. 51 ARMOR DEERING ( Good-naturedly ) Truck ! I saw a halo sprouting on my head . WALLACE KENT I understand . But you 're exaggerating , you 're over-zealous ; it 's only a temporary delay and it seems most expedient . Come , come . Are n't we both overdoing its importance a little ? ( They laugh ) There 'll be other things that 'll come your way soon . ARMOR DEERING Sure : I 'm going to get married . ( WOODS enters . ) WOODS Mr. Porter . DORA KENT All right , Woods . ( KENT turns and sees DORA standing there . WOODS goes out . ) ARMOR DEERING ( Noting there is some embarrassment as they gaze at each other ) Excuse me for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Tom Porter , I think . I 'll tell her I 'm here . ( DEERING goes out . ) DORA KENT Why ? WALLACE KENT What ? DORA KENT This delay ? WALLACE KENT You heard what I said . p. 52 DORA KENT That 's not the real reason . Something at luncheon yesterday  --   --  WALLACE KENT Bosh , dear ! DORA KENT If not for the Governorship nomination , why ? WALLACE KENT What makes you suspect anything ? DORA KENT My instinct . WALLACE KENT You women have many false instincts . DORA KENT They are as real to us as facts . WALLACE KENT ( Plausibly ) Dear , why have you suddenly grown suspicious ? It 's not like you . DORA KENT No , it 's not ; yet if one suddenly doubts what one has trusted ? WALLACE KENT Do n't you trust me ? DORA KENT ( With impulsive emphasis as though to reassure herself ) Yes , I do  --  I do  --  of course , I do . ( He pats her arm ; then she smiles as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit puzzled . That 's all . ( Enter PORTER . ) TOM PORTER ( Cheerfully , seeing them together ) Ah ! pretty picture ! Not interrupting , am I ? p. 53 DORA KENT ( Lightly ) You 're a habit ; never an interruption . TOM PORTER Glad I 'm something you ca n't lose . DORA KENT But where 's Julia ? I thought Armor said she was with you ? TOM PORTER She 's waiting outside in the car for me . Said she 'd promised to pick Armor up , too . I tried to get her to come in with me ; but I ca n't do anything with her . She 's in one of her moods . It pays to be a writer ; everybody excuses them when they 're flighty . DORA KENT You try to persuade her , Wallace . Perhaps she 'll have some tea . ( Quietly to him as he is near door ) And besides , you 'd better explain to her about Armor . ( KENT goes out . PORTER turns as DORA comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora . DORA KENT How was it Fred was n't arrested ? TOM PORTER ( Surprised ) Arrested ? DORA KENT Yes ; for his theft at the bank . TOM PORTER He told you ? DORA KENT Yes . He thought I knew . I knew . He said you had discovered it . Did any one else know ? p. 54 TOM PORTER Fortunately not . DORA KENT Then the money was restored ? TOM PORTER Yes  --  in full . ( Not quite understanding her mood ) But do n't worry . DORA KENT ( Interrupting ) Did he restore it ? ( PORTER smiles cynically in spite of himself ; she steps nearer to him , grasping the situation ) You  --  you put it back ! TOM PORTER ( Deprecating it ) Now do n't let 's talk of that . DORA KENT What a friend you have been  --  what a friend ! TOM PORTER ( Patting the hand which she has put in his ) I 'd do anything for you and Julia . DORA KENT Then why did n't you tell me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we all need illusions to help us over the hard places . DORA KENT No  --  no , we do n't . They make us sentimentalize things . Here I 've been thinking all this time that Fred was a decent , strong , honest man ; that he did not need me as my husband did . And he was a common crook ; a thief ; a man without principle ; one who betrayed a trust ; took money ! ( Disgusted ) Oh , that I should ever have given him a thought ! It shames me , Tom , that any man who touched my life , who claimed he loved me should not be able to go straight and honest . Oh , the insult he 's given me . And then he blames me  --  me  --  for what he has become ! ( Passionately ) Why did n't you have him arrested ? p. 55 TOM PORTER Because it would have been your husband 's duty to send him to jail . DORA KENT Do you think Wallace would have hesitated in doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . You might have interfered . You might have felt responsible . DORA KENT Responsible ! ( Sarcastically ) That 's what Fred said . ( Bitterly ) That I had wrecked his life for the sake of my husband . Oh , what a cad to say a thing like that . TOM PORTER I did n't want any opportunity to arise where Wallace might forget his oath of office . DORA KENT ( With confidence ) He would n't have forgotten it . He 'd have gone through anything that was his duty then , as he would now . TOM PORTER Yes ; I 'm glad you feel that . DORA KENT And Fred actually said Wallace was crooked . TOM PORTER What ? DORA KENT Yes . That was the last insult . TOM PORTER God ! He was a rotter , was n't he ? DORA KENT Yes . And to think I might have gone with him  --  might have been married by now  --  to a crook . ( Shuddering ) Oh ! ( The ' phone rings. ) p. 56 TOM PORTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KENT Yes . Only make him go away . You can . TOM PORTER I have already . ( She looks up in surprise ) I followed him after he left here . I made him sail at noon . He 's gone to the land of the men who ca n't come back . DORA KENT ( With a sigh of relief ) Thank you , Tom . ( The ' phone rings again ) You answer it . TOM PORTER Always knew you 'd see you had n't made a mistake in staying here . DORA KENT ( Smiling tenderly ) No . I did n't make any mistake . ( DORA goes over to the piano and after a few moments sits before it , completely mistress of herself again . PORTER goes to ' phone . KENT enters quietly and is unobserved at first . ) TOM PORTER Hello ! Yes , this is Mr. Kent 's . Cooper &amp; Collins ? If it 's important I 'll call him . WALLACE KENT ( Slightly embarrassed ) Is it for me ? TOM PORTER ( Looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALLACE KENT Tell them to hold the wire . ( PORTER does so and puts down receiver ) Julia would n't come in . She and Armor are waiting for you , Tom . TOM PORTER ( Realizing KENT wishes to speak privately on ' phone ) To be sure . Bye-bye , Wallace . ( Goes to DORA , who gives him a handshake full of gratitude ) Bye-bye . Going to take dinner with Julia to-night . ( Whimsically ) Intend to try my luck again before she goes . Would n't it be splendid if she  --   --  ? Well , it 's something to love her even if I can't.  --  Bye-bye . ( PORTER goes out . KENT , after glancing at DORA and not desiring to arouse her suspicions , decides to ' phone openly . ) WALLACE KENT Hello , Collins . What do you advise ? Prices have gone down a point ? You do n't need more margin ? Well , do n't buy in till it drops to 40 . ( Significantly ) I think it will . Good-bye . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has now begun to play an improvisation . There is a long pause . After slowly lighting a cigarette KENT crosses to her . It is seen he realizes he must make some explanation . His manner throughout is tender and shows the difficulty of his position . ) I 'm going to Rosemoor for a few days . Will you go with me ? p. 58 DORA KENT And interrupt your work ? No . ( Cheerfully , as she continues to play throughout softly ) A man should have one place where he can get away from wives and ' phones . WALLACE KENT Now , come , confess ; you are disappointed that I 'm not in the running for Governor . DORA KENT I ca n't seem to think of you out of public life . WALLACE KENT Well , you see there are several big guns after the nomination and I thought it might cause a lot of complications if I kept in as a candidate . DORA KENT Yet you knew all this ? WALLACE KENT Yes , dear ; but I 'm getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its deals , its bickerings and fence-fixing . I 've felt the need of something secure  --  some life position away from all the mess of campaigns and elections . ( Eyeing her ) Besides , I know how much happier you 'd feel if things were certain . DORA KENT ( Not quite understanding ) But you never felt this way before . You always loved the fight . ( Smiling ) I 'm afraid you 'll get restless for the smell of battle , as you used to call it . You talk as though you were going to give up your whole life-work . I wo n't let you do that . It 's just a mood , dear . You 've been working too hard . p. 59 WALLACE KENT ( Puffing slowly and measuring his words carefully ) Oh , I 'm not going to put everything away .  --  I 'll tell you a little secret . Only you must promise to keep it all to yourself till it comes out in the papers ? ( She smiles in agreement ) Well  --  you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DORA KENT A Federal Judgeship ? ( She stops playing , rises and in a puzzled manner goes to him , trying throughout to grasp its meaning ) That is n't why you 've agreed to postpone this Railroad case ? WALLACE KENT ( With apparent frankness ) Have n't I explained all that ? DORA KENT You 've explained only that you are not going to be a candidate for Governor . WALLACE KENT I told you they had offered it and that I refused . DORA KENT The Governorship is an elective office ; the people would have some say in that . Tainter and the Machine control enough Federal patronage in this boss-ridden state to offer you the Judgeship . I know that . For reasons of their own it has been offered you , as an alternative ; and you have accepted . You have accepted , have n't you ? WALLACE KENT Well , what if I have ? Do you suppose , Dora , that I 'd have been foolish enough to have told you this at all , if I had meant to deceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicions . You realized that you could n't always keep this from me . Perhaps you thought the best way to blind me was to tell me the truth . WALLACE KENT ( Turning away ) Have we got to go over this again ? DORA KENT I must understand this ; I must think what this means . WALLACE KENT Are n't you women happier when you do n't think ? DORA KENT Please do n't treat me as a child . If all this had n't happened just when it did I 'd have taken your mere word . But I ca n't . I ca n't now . WALLACE KENT Dora ! DORA KENT Wallace ; since luncheon yesterday I have been tortured in spite of myself . You could have seen me there by the window when you four passed through this room . ( He is startled ) I could n't help hearing . Gilmore said it could be made to appear all right . You 've done so to Armor ; but you must tell me the truth . WALLACE KENT It has n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not to go any further . DORA KENT ( Slowly ) So they accomplished their object in coming ? p. 61 WALLACE KENT Since you insist on knowing  --  yes . DORA KENT You 've agreed to delay prosecuting the C. N. Y. case ? WALLACE KENT Do n't forget how financial and political interests are allied . DORA KENT ( Admitting it to herself for the first time ) And in return they will see that you get a Federal Judgeship ! WALLACE KENT Now , do n't blame me . You do n't know what 's back of this . DORA KENT ( With a ray of hope ) I 'm only trying to see if it 's honest , that 's all ? WALLACE KENT There 's nothing illegal  --   --  DORA KENT I 'm not talking of law . I 'm talking of what 's right . You 've agreed to delay the course of justice for your own political advancement . Is n't that what it practically means ? WALLACE KENT I 'm seeing this through my need ; so do n't ask me anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best for you . DORA KENT ( Surprised ) You 've done this for me ? WALLACE KENT I said you were part of my reason for agreeing . ( Testily ) Good Heavens , Dora ; many wives would be proud to be in your position . p. 62 DORA KENT I have been proud of your success up to now . Success ! ( Recalls JULIA 'S words ) But success is not the test . WALLACE KENT It 's the American standard . DORA KENT I could never forget how you had obtained the appointment . ( He moves away as though dismissing it . She hesitates a moment and then goes to him tenderly ) Wallace ; several times things like this have come up in the past and we 've always talked them over together . Remember that Insurance case last Fall ? You said I helped you then . I know men in politics and public office must consider many factors , and they ca n't help thinking , in spite of themselves , of the political . effect . Let 's talk this over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WALLACE KENT But I 've already agreed to this . DORA KENT You have ? ( WALLACE nods ) If you 've done this through some mistaken desire to satisfy me , there 's still time to  --   --  WALLACE KENT I ca n't . ( In spite of himself ) There are other reasons . DORA KENT Reasons that compel you to do it ? WALLACE KENT Does a man do these things of choice ? p. 63 DORA KENT If it 's the easiest way , some do ; but you never took that cut . ( As the suspicion slowly grows ) Do they know something about you ? WALLACE KENT Yes . DORA KENT Something dishonest that you  --  you 've done ? And for their silence  --   --  ? WALLACE KENT No . I 've done nothing dishonest  --  yet . DORA KENT ( She gives a quick gasp of joy which slowly turns into another suspicion ) This telephone just now . Your brokers ! Stocks ! WALLACE KENT ( Quickly ) For God 's sake . Dora do n't dig too deep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has it to do with money ? WALLACE KENT Yes . DORA KENT ( Shrinking away ) You , too ! WALLACE KENT ( Brutally ) Yes : I need money . Now you 've got it . DORA KENT ( Gasping at him absolutely stunned ) You 're taking their money ? p. 64 WALLACE KENT No ; I 'm not as crude as that . I 've sold stocks I have n't got , on margin . Nothing illegal in that . Just the habit of a nation . DORA KENT ( After a pause , as though trying to grasp it ) Go on ! I do n't understand . WALLACE KENT I 'm caught in the market . Gilmore and Biddle and their friends control a pool of the stock ; they will force prices down so I can buy in and get out and make what I need . ( Bitterly ) In return for their consideration . I merely delay the C. N. Y. trial . DORA KENT ( Almost inaudibly as she recalls SAFFORD 'S accusation ) Then he was right ! WALLACE KENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to need money , do you ? DORA KENT ( Vaguely for some moments ) No . You 've always given me everything ; I have a little income of my own , too  --   --  WALLACE KENT Your income pays for your flowers and your music ; but what of your carriages , your amusements ? DORA KENT ( Dumbly ) But your salary ? p. 65 WALLACE KENT Paid for your dresses and pretty things . DORA KENT ( Confused ) But I did n't know ; I did n't know . WALLACE KENT Why should you ? You never could understand money matters . DORA KENT ( Helplessly ) I always thought we had enough . You never said anything about my accounts . I 've let you handle everything . WALLACE KENT ( Half tenderly ) I have n't been particularly anxious for you to know the facts . ( She looks at him ) No matter why . Perhaps because you took such joy in pretty things . DORA KENT ( Quietly ) You feel I 'm partly to blame for your financial condition . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too late ; we 'll change all that . WALLACE KENT ( Shrugging his shoulders ) Change a habit in a moment ? DORA KENT I can try . I 'll do without my pretty things , as you call them . There , there , Wallace . We can live on what we have , ca n't we ? WALLACE KENT And what of the bills ? p. 66 DORA KENT ( Good-naturedly ) They can wait . WALLACE KENT ( Laughs ) I 've paid nothing for months . Many of them have threatened suit . It 's a marvel the yellow newspapers  --   --  DORA KENT Ca n't we save ? WALLACE KENT Who ever lives in this city and saves ? DORA KENT ( Cheerfully ) We will . WALLACE KENT Yes ; after I get on my feet . DORA KENT Through your deal with these men ? WALLACE KENT Yes . Now do you understand ? DORA KENT ( With calm determination ) I 'm willing to bear my part in whatever sacrifices we must make ; but we 'll make them together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't do this . WALLACE KENT Do you know what 'll happen ? Gilmore will ruin me . Ruin ! We 'd have to move from this house ; it 's mortgaged to the limit ; we 'd have to get rid of every piece of furniture to feed our creditors ; we 'd land on the streets . Every dollar I could scrape together I 've put up for margin on stocks these men control . I 've gone deeper and deeper ; every month selling more ; putting up more margin ; thinking prices would drop and I could recover everything . I ca n't get out and they 'll call on me to deliver the stuff I have n't got ; and if I do n't delay this Railroad case , Gilmore will push the prices up , my margins will be wiped out clean , and we 'll be without a cent . p. 67 DORA KENT ( Calmly ) Ruin ? Move from here ? ( Looks about room affectionately ) Well , Wallace , I 'm ready even for that . WALLACE KENT But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty but not  --   --  WALLACE KENT Come , come ; look the facts in the face . DORA KENT You 'll not do this . WALLACE KENT I must . DORA KENT ( With calm strength ) You will do as I say . WALLACE KENT Nothing can make me . DORA KENT I can make you . ( He looks at her in astonishment ) Wallace , I beg of you do n't do this . I beg of you . If you only knew how I 'm clinging to your honesty , what it means to me ! WALLACE KENT There 's no use in further words . ( Emphatically ) It 's done and agreed to . DORA KENT ( Drawing back ) You mean that ? WALLACE KENT Absolutely . DORA KENT What about your oath of office ? p. 68 WALLACE KENT Bah ! Who 'll know ? DORA KENT I 'll know . WALLACE KENT ( Cynically ) Then I think I can trust you to keep the family secret . DORA KENT Do you actually mean you 're deliberately going to ruin your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man whose record is good because he has n't been found out . This is nobody 's concern . DORA KENT Your honesty is my concern ; your work is my concern ; your career is my concern : not just because I 'm your wife ; but because I 've made an equal contribution ; because I have rights here . I tell you , this goes deeper than you know . I 'd rather lose your love  --  yes  --  I 'd rather destroy whatever happiness you have found in me , than let you make this crooked deal . Now you see how dead in earnest I am . WALLACE KENT Well , I 've made my choice . After all , it 's my career . DORA KENT You do n't think I 've been any part of it ? WALLACE KENT Oh , yes ; in a way , but  --   --  DORA KENT ( Murmuring his words , incredulously ) In a way , but  --   --  p. 69 WALLACE KENT Well , I guess I 've got a right to do what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the way I looked at it when I had a choice to make . I thought of you and how my actions might affect your life . You 've got to think of me in what you do with your life ! WALLACE KENT ( Looking at her intently ) What do you mean ? DORA KENT For the last time , will you telephone Gilmore ? WALLACE KENT ( Taking her by the arms imperatively ) What choice did you ever have to make that affected my career ? DORA KENT You 're going through with this deal ? WALLACE KENT Yes ! DORA KENT Then I 'll answer your question .  --  Do you remember Fred Safford ? WALLACE KENT What of him ? DORA KENT During your first campaign for the District Attorneyship , he and I saw a great deal of each other . WALLACE KENT Well ? DORA KENT He wanted me to go away with him . ( KENT gazes at her ) I very nearly went . p. 70 WALLACE KENT ( Hardly believing her words ) You nearly went with him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ? DORA KENT ( In a clear , direct manner ) For the reason I 've just told you . You were making your first real fight . I knew how close it was . All your opponents were trying to get something on you  --  anything that could blur the clean-cut moral issues you were standing for . I felt a scandal could never have been explained before election ; you would have been blamed somehow . I did not want you to know of Fred at the time . It would have distracted you , weakened your strength for the fight . I did not wish to postpone a decision for some future settlement . I feared I could not hide it from you much longer , so I sent him away . I gave him up . I stayed with you . I thought you needed me more ; thought you needed the help I could bring you through standing by your side . That was the choice I made for your career : that 's why I have a right to ask that you keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though at first unable to grasp its relation to the deal with the men . Then he walks back and forth several times in silence as though trying to make up his mind . She stands watching him , firm and determined yet without any defiance . Finally he gives a sharp , ironic laugh , as though some hidden thought were touched . ) Please do n't laugh . p. 71 WALLACE KENT If only you knew how amusing it all is ! DORA KENT Amusing ? WALLACE KENT Yes ; damned amusing . ( He starts for the ' phone . ) DORA KENT Yes , the ending is amusing . ( Starting to explain ) I 've seen Fred again . He came back and  --   --  WALLACE KENT Hello ? Give me Garden 77 . Yes . DORA KENT I want to tell you everything , Wallace . I did n't before , because  --   --  WALLACE KENT ( Ignoring her ) Hello ; connect me with Mr. Gilmore . Yes , Wallace Kent . Thank you . ( She waits in suspense ) Hello , Gilmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have decided I wo n't do it . ( DORA gives a cry of joy ) No ; under no considerations . Personal reasons . Yes . ( Significantly ) I quite appreciate what it means . Good-bye . ( He puts back receiver . ) DORA KENT ( Deeply moved ) Thank you  --  thank you . WALLACE KENT ( Coldly ) What 's Armor 's number ? p. 72 DORA KENT I never can remember figures . ( As he glances through telephone book ) Thank you . It 's all clean and above board now . We 'll get along somehow . It may not be as hard as you suppose . We 'll move to a cheaper place . I 'll never forget this , never , never . WALLACE KENT ( At the ' phone ) Give me Morris 176 . DORA KENT I 'm sure there 'll be something I can do . ( Trying to smile ) I never was very handy with my fingers , but , if necessary , I 'll do anything that will help . WALLACE KENT ( At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just get in ? Well , I 've come to the conclusion you 're right about that C. N. Y. business and I 'll let you take it into court yourself next Monday .  --  I thought you 'd be pleased . Can you open the case without me ? I may have to be out of town for a few days , so I 'll leave everything in your hands . Yes , of course you can tell Julia . Good-bye . Do n't thank me . ( He hangs up receiver . ) DORA KENT ( She goes to put her arms around him with a flood of affection ) What can I say ? WALLACE KENT ( Pushing her gently away ) I intend to send to the Governor to-night my resignation as District Attorney . p. 73 DORA KENT ( Slowly ) Your resignation ? WALLACE KENT Yes . DORA KENT Why ? WALLACE KENT Because I can accept nothing at the price you paid nor keep what I 've gained by it . ( She is completely stunned and he continues with increasing bitterness ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did you think I could not have stood alone ? DORA KENT I only thought you needed me . WALLACE KENT I did not need your pity . DORA KENT You did not know what it was I gave you ; the effect was the same . WALLACE KENT At the time , yes . DORA KENT I gave it all willingly . WALLACE KENT You expect me to take it proudly because you sacrificed yourself and the man you loved for fear I might go to pieces ? You thought I could n't rise above talk ? Proud of that ? It 's an insult . DORA KENT ( Completely halted by his unexpected reaction ) Insult ? WALLACE KENT Yes ; it was an insult : you might have given me the chance to offer you happiness with your poor weak fool . ( She starts to explain ) Do you believe I 'd have dragged you away from him or punished you because I could n't keep your love ? Do you think I could n't have been decent to you both ? p. 74 DORA KENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that would n't have altered the other facts . I did what I thought was honorable by you . WALLACE KENT ( Sneering ) Honorable ? Honorable ? You women are funny ! You 're shocked at me because I accepted Gilmore 's offer ; yet with your feminine logic you can see nothing despicable in living a lie in my house . Honorable ? DORA KENT ( Confused ) No ! No ! I lived no lie . If you 'll let me explain . I suffered for it at first , but  --   --  WALLACE KENT That was sufficient excuse I suppose for the deceit ? Only suffer for an action , you women think , and it becomes beautiful ! Suffer ! You love it ; you take pleasure in it ; your spirit of martyrdom is your greatest luxury . Well , you acted well ; played your part splendidly ; for I never suspected , even when he was around . DORA KENT ( Forcefully ) Then give me credit for that . There would have been no sacrifice had I brought you only tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? You blame me for the lie ; give me credit for my consideration and sincerity . WALLACE KENT Sincerity ? And you lived with me all this time as my wife and I never knew ! p. 75 DORA KENT What else could I do if I stayed with you ? WALLACE KENT Wanton ! DORA KENT ( Flaming up ) Do n't you dare  --   --  WALLACE KENT I understand now . You took my name , my roof , my protection , and gave yourself in return . ( She gives a sharp cry ) Wanton ! You took lips that meant his ; embraces that made other memories live . And his name ! How was it you never gasped his name ? DORA KENT I never stole one hour with him . I played straight that way . WALLACE KENT How do I know , how can I ever know ? DORA KENT I 'm giving you my word ! WALLACE KENT ( With great scorn ) Your word ! When you lived this lie and have given everything the same ! ( She turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I believe anything in the present or past just because you 've given your word ? ( She stands stunned at his words as he begins to laugh ironically throughout . ) DORA KENT If that 's the way you feel , you can believe anything you wish ! p. 76 WALLACE KENT Have n't you gone on cheating him , cheating your-self , and cheating me ? DORA KENT You ? WALLACE KENT Yes , me ! And I thought all the while I was the one you loved . I fooled myself that I was everything to you . And I was n't , was I ? I was n't ? DORA KENT I tell you nothing more till you come to your senses . WALLACE KENT I 'm in my right senses . I see it all . You do n't have to explain . But I do . I want you to know I , also , did everything I could to fool and deceive you . DORA KENT ( Starting up ) To fool me ? WALLACE KENT Yes . I heaped pretty things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ruined myself  --  everything . Now you see . Now you see why this is too monstrously funny . Because I thought you loved me and that kept me silent . DORA KENT Silent ? ( Going to him ) What are you talking about ? WALLACE KENT Do n't you see ? You love somebody else . I am nothing to you now . I can pass out of your life , it 's over . DORA KENT ( Trying to break in ) Answer me . What have you been silent about ? p. 77 WALLACE KENT Now that it 's all over between us , I can tell you . Do n't think I want your pity . I do n't need it now that we know we do not love each other . DORA KENT ( Starting back ) You do n't love me ? WALLACE KENT What difference does my love make to you now ? DORA KENT But  --   --  WALLACE KENT Let 's stop . It 's over . Done with . Thrown in the rubbish heap . DORA KENT Let 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I tell you ; too late for me . DORA KENT ( Trying to grasp the situation ) You do n't love me . WALLACE KENT I never guessed about you . You never guessed about me . What a game we were playing . And you could have seen it happen right here , before your eyes . DORA KENT ( Grasping it ) She lied to me ! You love her ! Julia ! WALLACE KENT Is n't it funny that you should love somebody else and that I should love somebody else and that we should go on living together , lying to each other ? Is n't it too monstrously comical ? p. 78 DORA KENT ( Passionately ) Yes , that you could live with me when your love had ceased ; give everything just the same , because you were a man . You could fool and trick me and yet blame me . That 's why you were so bitter ; I wounded your pride and not your love ! WALLACE KENT I know , I know , you 're right . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to blame , I was to blame , I was cruel  --  all . I lied ; I lied . We both lied . And look what has happened . DORA KENT ( Quickly ) All that 's happened is that I 'm in the way . That can be changed . Go to her . WALLACE KENT ( Halting ) Why to her , pray ? DORA KENT ( Controlling herself ) She loves you . WALLACE KENT Me ? Loves me ? ( Laughing as before ) Loves me ? When I 've never said a word , never dared look her in the eyes because I did n't want to mess things up and make you unhappy ? Loves me ? No , no . DORA KENT ( With cold intensity ) Go to her . She loves you . She told me . WALLACE KENT That 's absurd . Why should she tell you ? It is n't true . No . No . It ca n't be true . p. 79 DORA KENT Go to her . she loves you . WALLACE KENT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies . There 's nothing more to say . ( Goes to the door ) I 'll leave the house to-night and go to Rosemoor ; later you and I can arrange matters quietly . DORA KENT ( With a sharp cry ) And what 's to become of me ? WALLACE KENT ( Bitterly ) Now you can go to the man you love ! ( He goes out . She stands stunned and silent. ) @x The study in JULIA DEERING 'S apartment . The same evening : later . The room , which is shallow and intimate , is soft in tone . The fireplace at the left contains a blazing log which casts its wavering light upon a deep leather couch stretched cata-cornered before it . Several long cathedral candles , in esthetic holders , are also lighted , and one notices a work-table near the center , upon which are a writer 's usual assortment of disordered letters and manuscripts . There are several chairs , of varying designs , about this . Above it hangs a soft shaded light-cluster which , when the curtain lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , otherwise the walls seem to melt away in the shadows . The floor is covered with a thick Oriental rug . The room , somehow , suggests JULIA  --  with its faintly insinuating appeal to sensation . The general entrance is in the right upper corner of the irregularly cut room . This door opens out upon the hallway which leads to the rest of the apartment . A window , now curtained , with some low book-cases on either side , is in the back . The electric switch is by the fireplace . There is no one visible when the curtain rises . Some moments later JULIA opens the door and comes in , followed by PORTER , who is eyeing her furtively . She wears a loose informal gown ; he is in dinner-coat . She goes towards the fire and sits upon the couch . JULIA DEERING The cigarettes are there , Tom . p. 81 TOM PORTER Have one ? JULIA DEERING ( Taking it ) Try one of mine . They 're a new brand , Russian . Safonoff sent them to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 'll stick by my own . JULIA DEERING ( After a pause , as he gazes at her blowing rings ) I love to watch the smoke . TOM PORTER I love to watch you watch it . ( A MAID enters with coffee cups on tray which she places near JULIA . She fills them with steaming coffee ; hands one to JULIA and offers the other to PORTER , who takes it . She then goes to switch on the light . ) JULIA DEERING Do n't turn up the lights yet . ( MAID goes out . ) I 'm so fond of shadows . Are n't you , Tom ? TOM PORTER Depends on whom I happen to be with . JULIA DEERING Oh , I forgot your sugar . TOM PORTER ( Refusing it ) Doctor 's orders ; getting old , Julia . JULIA DEERING You 'll always be the same to me. p. 82 TOM PORTER ( Bantering throughout ) Sounds discouraging already . JULIA DEERING Discouraging ? You did n't intend to ask me to marry you again ? TOM PORTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a better friend . TOM PORTER I like adventure . JULIA DEERING I thought you were seeking peace and quiet . TOM PORTER No ; I 'm seeking a wife . They 're not necessarily synonymous . JULIA DEERING But peace and quiet only can come with love , n'estce pas ? TOM PORTER Nonsense . There 's nothing reasoning or reasonable about love . It drags people together who 'd be much better apart . It frequently pulls one away from two and makes sixes or sevens . It steals like a sneak thief where it should n't go and dodges the vacuums where it would be welcome . Love sometimes raises a family , Julia  --  ( Mock confidentially )  --  but more often it raises the devil . And when our law-makers are trying to pin it down , it only laughs at them . Why do n't these anti-divorcers and preachers and professional moralists stop chiding the poor creatures in love and try to devise some apparatus to steer the pesky thing right ? I 'll patent it and give it to humanity without royalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know just where I can use that idea in my new novel . TOM PORTER I forbid it unless you 'll marry me . JULIA DEERING ( She shakes her head ) Take another cigarette instead . TOM PORTER Hardly a substitute .  --  I 'll stop making love if you wo n't go abroad . You know , I do n't like the idea of getting plastery picture postal cards of Corfu in the moonlight . JULIA DEERING ( Musing ) You want to marry me . I wonder what would happen if I had what I sought most ? TOM PORTER ( Dryly ) You spend too much time anticipating your emotions . When they come , you have already lived through them . The experience itself never can equal such anticipation . JULIA DEERING The penalty of all writers . TOM PORTER Why , you 've got everything now : money , beauty , temperament , reputation ; everything you should have . JULIA DEERING But a husband ? TOM PORTER I offer to supply the deficiency . p. 84 JULIA DEERING I 'd make you miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some sweet young woman with pretty pink ribbons and pussy-cat ways ? TOM PORTER I did . But she refused me ; fortunately . ( Whimsically exaggerating ) Come to think of it , I guess I 've gone through the entire repertoire . Every time an adorable woman broke my heart I read the history of some foreign country to restore me to my proper place in the universe . When we suffer we 're so self-centered . I 've only got Persia left . ( Sighing ) Please save me from Persia . I hate the Shahs with their sneezable names . JULIA DEERING ( Smiling ) You 'd forget me , as you have the others . TOM PORTER This is my finish  --  after Persia . ( With his real feeling escaping for the first time ) Why , dear Julia ; do n't you suppose I know how foolish it is of me asking you ? You were made for the men who could shoot you to the stars and whirl you till you were dizzy in their dust , and all that literary sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . I 'm not much on star dust . Then I 'm not young any more . Oh , I acknowledge it officially . I 'm only one of the wanderers on the streets below with a hand waiting to help a woman just a little now and then . ( Taking her hand ) I know it 's foolish , but I 'd like to see some quiet come into that restless soul of yours ; I 'd like to make you  --  quietly happy . That 's all . p. 85 JULIA DEERING Quietly happy ! ( With deep feeling ) Do n't go out of my life ; I need you just around the corner as you said to Dora ; for I 'm a miserable woman at times , struggling with impulses which drive women like me to  --  . But you steady me . You 're a sort of habit . I need you . I 'd have tried to take much I had no right to if you had n't been here . ( Impetuously as she thinks of WALLACE ) I would now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage that accepts but a greater courage that dares . TOM PORTER ( Not understanding ) Julia ! JULIA DEERING ( Dismissing it ) Ah , je suis gare ! TOM PORTER Do n't know what it is , but you 've got it . JULIA DEERING ( Laughing again as her mood changes ) Forgive me . Do n't say anything more of love ; but be just around the corner . TOM PORTER ( Resigned ) You can do the Rock of Ages act all over me . Grab hold any time ; I 'll let you cling and wo n't call for help . JULIA DEERING Tom , I could kiss you . TOM PORTER But something always happens to prevent . ( MAID knocks and enters . ) Did n't I tell you ? p. 86 MAID I beg pardon . JULIA DEERING What is it ? MAID I forgot to say Mrs. Kent telephoned ten minutes ago that she was on her way over to see you . JULIA DEERING ( Surprised ) Mrs. Kent ? MAID Yes , ma'am . JULIA DEERING Let her come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhat puzzled by this announcement , goes slowly to the lights and switches them on . PORTER gazes at her a few seconds , gives a little sigh as though realizing the uselessness of further words . Then he looks at his watch . ) TOM PORTER Goodness , I must trot along . Promised to drop in on Armor . I 've got a warm place in my heart for that brother of yours . I 'll leave you and Dora here to pow-wow . JULIA DEERING I wonder why Dora 's coming to see me ? TOM PORTER Perhaps Wallace had to go to his office . He 's got that very important case on . JULIA DEERING ( As she abstractedly puts out the candles ) But do n't you remember ? He said he was going off this evening by himself to Rosemoor . p. 87 TOM PORTER Oh , yes ; that 's so . Think I 'll get a bungalow like that when you 've gone . JULIA DEERING Rosemoor ! It 's such a pretty name . TOM PORTER Wallace has a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 'd see that view over the valley and not a soul to share it with him . JULIA DEERING ( Wistfully ) I 've always thought I 'd like to see it before I went away . TOM PORTER But he plays the primitive there and keeps house himself . It takes a touch of poetry these days to get away from people and ' phones .  --  Well , I must be going . Tell Dora I could n't wait . JULIA DEERING Tom , I 've been waiting for you to tell me what happened between Fred and Dora . TOM PORTER Dora can tell that better . Perhaps that 's why she 's coming over . JULIA DEERING Fred 's gone away ? TOM PORTER Yes ; he sailed at noon . JULIA DEERING ( Puzzled ) But how did she make him go ? TOM PORTER ( Smiling ) Some day , I 'll let you know  --  if she does n't . ( DORA enters . She is simply dressed and wears a scarf over her head . She is very calm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and PORTER takes off her cloak , throwing it on chair. ) p. 88 JULIA DEERING Come near the fire , Dora ; the nights are still chilly . ( JULIA crosses to fire with DORA ) I 'll send for some hot coffee . DORA KENT No ; thanks . TOM PORTER Sorry I was just running off . DORA KENT Must you ? JULIA DEERING Tom 's going to see Armor . DORA KENT Then take my taxi , Tom . But send it right back . I 'll only be here a few moments . ( JULIA looks surprised . ) TOM PORTER Thanks . Any messages for Armor ? DORA KENT Tell him I 'm glad he 's going to conduct the C. N. Y. case . TOM PORTER ( Deeply pleased ) I knew Wallace would do what was right by him . DORA KENT Yes ; he does what he sees is right , too . TOM PORTER ( Quietly to DORA as JULIA has crossed to desk for some letters ) Was worried this afternoon . Good-bye , little girl . DORA KENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's gone away . p. 89 DORA KENT I want you to come around in the morning . I need some advice about a trip I 'm going to take . TOM PORTER ( Surprised ) Certainly . JULIA DEERING ( Handing him some letters ) Tom , will you mail these ? Please do n't forget them . One is about my passport . TOM PORTER ( Taking them ) The instrument of my own destruction , eh ? ( Looking at it ) Sort of Greek irony . But do n't worry , I 'll mail it . Bye-bye . Rock of Ages any time you 're willing . See you to-morrow , Dora . Bye-bye . ( He goes out . JULIA follows him off a second . They are heard talking . DORA is left alone . She relaxes a moment as though feeling she has not the strength to go through what she has apparently determined upon . Her eyes fall upon KENT 'S photograph , which is with some others on mantel . She takes it down and smiles at it enigmatically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior as JULIA , obviously sensing a deep reason for DORA 'S coming , closes the door and comes down . There is a pause . ) DORA KENT Wallace has not been here ? JULIA DEERING ( Surprised ) Why , no. p. 90 DORA KENT He wrote some letters but went out before I did . I thought  --   --  JULIA DEERING Wallace went to Rosemoor , did n't he ? DORA KENT Oh , yes ; perhaps . JULIA DEERING How did you think he 'd be here ? DORA KENT Because I told him to go to you . JULIA DEERING You told him to see me ? What about ? DORA KENT Julia , he and I have gone on the rocks at last . JULIA DEERING I do n't understand . DORA KENT It 's very simple . It 's all over between us . JULIA DEERING ( Hardly grasping the significance ) What do you mean ? DORA KENT He does n't love me . JULIA DEERING What are you saying ? DORA KENT He has ceased to love me . JULIA DEERING ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fred ? DORA KENT ( With a bitter laugh ) Going to Fred ? That 's over , too . p. 91 JULIA DEERING ( Eyeing DORA ) But why did you send Wallace here ? DORA KENT Because I am going to leave him . ( JULIA gazes incredulously ) You said you 'd like to have had a chance for happiness . I give you more than a chance . When he and I came to talk it all over ( With difficulty ) I found it  --  it was you he cared for . JULIA DEERING Me ? DORA KENT Yes . JULIA DEERING Wallace cares for me ? DORA KENT Yes ; and he knows you love him . JULIA DEERING You told him that ? DORA KENT ( Firmly ) Yes : you both must not miss your happiness . JULIA DEERING It is n't so ; it ca n't be so . DORA KENT Would I lie to you now after our talk yesterday ? JULIA DEERING Wallace loves me ! He loves me  --  me ! ( JULIA sinks down in the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JULIA slowly recovers ; there is a long silence then she gradually looks at DORA with a new thought . ) And you ? What are you going to do ? p. 92 DORA KENT I told you . I 'm going to leave Wallace . ( Bitterly ) He said I should go to the man I love . JULIA DEERING He knows about Fred ? DORA KENT Yes . But he thinks I love Fred and that I am going to him . Wallace must always believe that . JULIA DEERING But that 's a lie . DORA KENT Is n't it better to lie if it will bring you happiness ? JULIA DEERING You believe the truth might separate him and me ? You think if he should know you do not love Fred  --   --  DORA KENT I do n't wish him to have any thought of me . ( Bitterly ) Even men pity sometimes . JULIA DEERING ( Incredulously ) And you can ask me to keep a secret like that ? DORA KENT Most women keep secrets from the men they love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts . DORA KENT But his happiness lies in your silence about Fred and me . JULIA DEERING ( Pointedly ) And what of my happiness ? You 've put a fear in it . You 've settled your own lives but I 'm the factor you do n't seem to have considered . ( Resolutely ) No ; he must understand about you first , or I 'd always be asking myself afterwards what would Wallace have done if he 'd known the truth ? Would he have left Dora alone ?  --  No , no , I can't. p. 93 DORA KENT ( Coldly ) You must not think of me . JULIA DEERING But I do , Dora . I could never forget you . I 'd always see you alone . DORA KENT I 've always been helpless Dora to you , have n't I ? Just because I was n't practical , as you called it . But I did what I thought was the greatest thing a woman could for her husband ; yet in his wounded pride he thought I should have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his part ; but because I had stood between you and him . ( JULIA surprised ) He did n't realize it himself , perhaps ; but I wo n't be in the way any longer . Never  --  never could I live with him after what he said to me . I 'm leaving him for good . I would even if you were not concerned . That 's why I 've come to ask you to be silent about Fred and me . JULIA DEERING The lie of silence ! DORA KENT Julia . Be fair to him . I gave him his chance by telling him you love him . You must n't rob him of it . You love him , do n't you ? ( JULIA bows her head ) Then make him happy ! JULIA DEERING ( Rising quickly ) How did this all so suddenly come about ? ( Going to her ) Dora , was it because I told you what he meant to me ? p. 94 DORA KENT ( Confused a second at the abruptness ) No . JULIA DEERING Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nothing he said about you . JULIA DEERING It was n't I who came between you ? DORA KENT ( Evasively ) No ; it simply happened . We were talking . How are things ever discovered ? Time found us out . Time 's a rummager , is n't it ? See how it found out you two loved each other . JULIA DEERING ( Half to herself as she sits down still unable to grasp the fact ) That we two love each other ! DORA KENT ( Earnestly ) Before I go ; before you see him ; say you will be silent about Fred . ( JULIA hesitates ) Think , Julia , of Wallace . Do n't you see it 's best he should believe me happy . Make it easier for him and I 'll simply step aside . Come , Julia , say you will . It 's not a falsehood I ask ; it 's only silence . JULIA DEERING Silence can be so cowardly . ( Hesitates ) Yet  --  I  --  I  --   --  DORA KENT But you two love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take its right  --  since I made such a mess of mine . ( JULIA bows her head . DORA looks at her and sees she has practically consented . ) I wish him to be happy more than anything else in the world . p. 95 JULIA DEERING ( Quickly ) Dora ! You love him ! DORA KENT No , no , no ! He killed everything in me . I 'll prove it when the time comes . JULIA DEERING ( Stands confused ) You love him ! DORA KENT No . ( A knock is heard on the door . ) JULIA DEERING What is it ? ( MAID opens the door . ) MAID Mr. Kent is here . ( There is a tense moment . JULIA looks inquiringly at DORA , who quickly decides what to do . ) DORA KENT ( Calmly ) Let him come in , Julia . JULIA DEERING ( Confused ) But  --   --  DORA KENT ( Firmly ) We three must understand one another . JULIA DEERING ( Trying to gain composure ) Ask Mr. Kent to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to fire and puts on another log which blazes cheerfully . They half watch her during the ominous silence . ) Tell Mr. Kent that Mrs. Kent is here with me . I sha' n't need you any more to-night . ( MAID goes out , leaving the door open ) It 's best Wallace knows you are here . p. 96 DORA KENT He will not go away . And he will want you to know I do not love him . ( She stands by fire warming her hands ) The fire is good . JULIA DEERING I 'm burning . ( Turning away ; half to herself ) What shall I do ? ( After a pause ) And this is Dora . DORA KENT ( Simply ) One changes . ( There is a further silence till KENT enters slowly as though the fact that DORA is there has made him hesitate . He closes the door and stands looking at the two women . He can not conceal entirely the bitterness of the previous scene with his wife . ) Again , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is silent ) But there need be no embarrassment on my account . WALLACE KENT I came to say good-bye to Julia . DORA KENT I knew you would come . WALLACE KENT And your reason for being here ? DORA KENT To tell her what she means to you . WALLACE KENT ( Emphatically ) I did not come to talk of that . DORA KENT When I told you she loved you , you said it was n't true . Ask her now . p. 97 WALLACE KENT Believe me , Julia , I did not come to ask any questions ; as you shall see before I go . DORA KENT Ask her . I want everything clearly understood . ( KENT in silence , looks towards JULIA , who sinks into the chair , burying her face in her hands ) You see , Wallace . WALLACE KENT Well , Dora , is that all ? DORA KENT No . I 'm thinking we 'd best talk the matter over quietly . WALLACE KENT Here ? DORA KENT Why not ? It would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There must be no skeins to unravel later among us there ; we must understand one another now . Wo n't you sit down , Wallace ? ( KENT hesitates , but seeing the cold determination in DORA 'S manner , he goes slowly to the other side of the table . After glancing at JULIA , who is in the deep chair gazing tensely before her , he draws back the chair and sits upon it . After this is done , DORA goes to the other chair back of table , between them . The light from the lamp falls upon the three . ) Wallace , Julia knows that you and I have gone on the rocks . WALLACE KENT ( Referring to the political deal ) Is that all you 've told her ? p. 98 DORA KENT Yes . WALLACE KENT ( Significantly ) Nothing else , Julia ? DORA KENT ( Quickly ) You doubt my word ? JULIA DEERING ( Looking up suspiciously ) What else was there I should know ? DORA KENT ( Clearly ) Nothing . WALLACE KENT Then you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes : I came to tell Julia that I was going to the man I love , so that you and she should face the future without thought of me  --  together . WALLACE KENT ( Sarcastically ) I could have told her that , if ever the time should come . DORA KENT It was right I should do that much for her , since I am going to be happy , too . WALLACE KENT Happy ? You 're sure of that , eh ? DORA KENT Would your vanity desire me to suffer in losing you ? You 've shown me once today that pride is as deep and cruel as love . p. 99 WALLACE KENT I was harsh , perhaps ; but  --   --  DORA KENT Do n't have any regret now . I have none , at leaving you . ( He winces ) But I desire Julia to understand how far you and I are apart . WALLACE KENT ( Bitterly ) Is that all you have to say ? DORA KENT ( Concealing from them her suffering ) No . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't really the thought of you and your career that made me stay with you , as I said . I stayed because I had n't the courage to go through all that was necessary . I stayed , like so many other wives , because it was easier . WALLACE KENT ( Disgusted ) That destroys everything between us . DORA KENT I meant it to . ( She rises and turns away . ) WALLACE KENT ( Coldly ) There will be essential affairs to talk over . DORA KENT When you come back from Rosemoor will be time enough . Now I 'm through here . WALLACE KENT ( Coldly ) What do you intend to do ? p. 100 DORA KENT I shall go West to my cousin . I 'll stay the requisite time for the divorce . Perhaps Tom will advise me . We 'll both go through the usual mockery : desertion and all that . Then life will begin again . WALLACE KENT ( Cut , but puzzled by her manner ) After all these years , you can say only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though wondering whether he has feeling for DORA . Over DORA 'S face there is a momentary glance of tenderness which , under JULIA 'S inquiring look , assumes coldness as before . ) DORA KENT Yes , Wallace . I 'm glad it 's over . That 's all there is left . Good-bye . ( She picks up her long scarf , puts it about her . ) WALLACE KENT ( Abruptly ) And Gilmore ? You did n't tell Julia about  --  ? DORA KENT ( Quickly ) No , Wallace . Let that be between us . WALLACE KENT ( Scornfully ) More lies ! JULIA DEERING ( Starting up ) Lies ? WALLACE KENT Yes . Rotten lies . p. 101 DORA KENT ( Nervously ) Wallace ! WALLACE KENT I said I did n't come here to talk of love . I came for only one purpose : to tell Julia about Gilmore and Tainter , and what had happened between us . DORA KENT Why say anything ? JULIA DEERING ( Quickly , rising ) Then there was something that brought about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Julia . JULIA DEERING You told me nothing . DORA KENT But it had n't anything to do with you . WALLACE KENT No . It was something wrong with me . I 've written my resignation , Julia . My career is done , finished , thrown aside . JULIA DEERING ( Quickly ) You feared some scandal would result in coming to me as Dora once feared it in going to  --   --  ? DORA KENT ( Confused at new turn of situation ) No ! No ! Nothing like that . JULIA DEERING It was something to do with me . I came between you . p. 102 WALLACE KENT ( Sarcastically ) I gave it all up for Dora 's justification . JULIA DEERING ( Recalling ) Justification ! WALLACE KENT Tell her , Dora , I faced an alternative ; to stop meant financial ruin . JULIA DEERING And you stopped ? WALLACE KENT Yes ; we are ruined , on the streets without a penny . JULIA DEERING ( Astonished ) Then Dora has nothing ? WALLACE KENT ( Bitterly ) You forget she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal the truth ) But  --   --  DORA KENT ( Stopping her ) Hush ! Your happiness should be your first thought ! JULIA DEERING ( Hesitating ) Oh ! WALLACE KENT You said , Dora , we were to talk it over calmly in order that Julia and I should start straight . I intend to see whether you and I , Julia , can ever start at all . DORA KENT ( Desperately trying to stop him ) Wallace ! p. 103 JULIA DEERING Whether  --   --  ? WALLACE KENT ( Bitterly to DORA ) You came here tonight to arrange matters . Perhaps you did n't trust me . So tell her about Gilmore and all the rest . DORA KENT Wallace , will you be silent about that ? That 's ours  --  ours . I have the right to ask some silence of our life together . WALLACE KENT But first tell her I 'm a crook ; a bribe-taker ; anything you choose to call it . JULIA DEERING Wallace DORA KENT ( Noting JULIA 'S reaction and defending him ) That is n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's intention that makes crime . Tell her , as I was going to , that you discovered I was n't quite the ideal man you thought me . Strip me to her as you stripped me to myself . Tell Julia all , so she may know how the crooked deal came out and with it the lies , the whole rotten lies we were all living . JULIA DEERING ( Confused ) Something crooked ! WALLACE KENT Yes . You 'll have to know , Julia . I 'll spare details now , but the fact is there . I want the decks cleared between you and me , and between me and myself . p. 104 DORA KENT No , no ; Julia , he 's exaggerating . He did n't do anything dishonest . He was merely forced to consider it  --  was tempted . It was my fault ; my extravagances.We needed money  --   --  WALLACE KENT Bah ! I do n't want that defense ! DORA KENT ( Forcibly ) But you did n't do anything wrong , did you ? You did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I did n't . JULIA DEERING ( Who has listened spellbound and is slowly grasping situation ) You stopped him , Dora ? And it all came out ? DORA KENT ( Quickly ) We talked it over as you will all the common problems and difficulties when you are married . This must n't come between you as it did between us . That 's all . WALLACE KENT ( Emphatically and with sincerity ) That 's not all . I was going crooked , slipping into the very class of men it is my business to put behind the bars . I was weak , wabbly , and a coward ; afraid to face myself with the truth till she toppled over our life together to make me see it . That 's what I was . ( DORA watches him with joy at his change ) But I 've got hold of myself in time . I must prove to myself by work and accomplishment that I did not need a woman 's sacrifice . I must clean the rot and rust out of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must build an honest foundation . I must take life by the throat and make it give me what I need . That 's what I came to tell you , Julia ; not to talk of love . p. 105 DORA KENT Do n't be the fool you said I was . Do n't cheat your-self and Julia by waiting . I 'm not in the way now . I 've done , finished . Julia , tell him you want him to stay . JULIA DEERING ( Impulsively ) Not till he also knows all the truth about Fred . Then he may choose . DORA KENT ( Frantically ) Julia ! Julia ! JULIA DEERING Maybe he wo n't want me when he knows . WALLACE KENT ( Not understanding ) Wo n't have you ? DORA KENT Julia , you 'll spoil everything . JULIA DEERING Maybe he wo n't want me when he knows I tried to separate you , and failed  --  failed . Wallace , Dora does n't love Fred . She 's sent him away forever . She 'll never marry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'll be alone , alone  --   --  WALLACE KENT Dora , alone ! JULIA DEERING ( Detecting the note of pity in his voice ) You pity her , too ! WALLACE KENT ( In spite of himself ) Why did n't you tell me that ? p. 106 DORA KENT ( Defiantly ) Why should I tell you ? Why do you give me pity when you refused to accept mine ? Is that your idea of me ? Is that all you think I need ? Ca n't I also stand alone , as you said you could have ? Do you expect me to take your pity proudly and let it cheat love ? Is that the sort of woman you think I am ? It 's you who are now insulting me . JULIA DEERING ( As she sees KENT stands spellbound eyeing DORA ) She loves you , Wallace . She loves you . DORA KENT ( Desperately ) After what he said ? No ! No ! JULIA DEERING Yes , yes ! You want him to be happy above all things . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Let 's have the whole truth . Then he may choose . WALLACE KENT Dora ? JULIA DEERING You love him . I see now you 've always loved him . DORA KENT ( Fiercely ) Well , what if it were true ? What if I were breaking my heart ? What if I do love him ? WALLACE KENT Dora ! DORA KENT ( Bitterly to JULIA ) What has that to do with you ? p. 107 JULIA DEERING ( Shuddering ) I ca n't think of his leaving you alone now . I ca n't . DORA KENT ( Fervently throughout ) Why not ? Why not ? Ca n't you take him on that basis ? JULIA DEERING Oh ! DORA KENT It was easy to believe love was everything until you had to make the choice . You blamed me for sending Fred away , but you hesitate to take your love and you deny Wallace the rights of his love . ( JULIA tries to stop her throughout ) You called me a coward because I was true to what I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage than the mere passion that comes and goes and which we ca n't control . You thought I should have gone to Fred and left my husband , only because you wanted him . I tell you there is nothing in the way now of his leaving me . You can go with him , and if you will not take what life has offered you , I will ask which of us two is the greater coward ! WALLACE KENT Dora , listen ! DORA KENT ( Turning to KENT ) And you pity me now ; you who also blamed me , and burned your words in my soul so I can never forget them . You also thought all the years together were as nothing ; that only passion counted ; not the hours we bad served each other in sickness , not the joys and sorrows we had in common , not all that I shared and sacrificed to make your career possible . They meant nothing , because you could n't understand the difference between a theory of life and what actually was . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you another man had caught for a moment my imagination when we were careless and unwatchful ; and yet because I continued to live with you , and thought you had the greater claim , you called me wanton . p. 108 JULIA DEERING ( Sinking in chair and covering her face ) Oh ! WALLACE KENT Dora , for God 's sake , stop ! DORA KENT Yes , wanton ! Because I took your pretty things , your food and lodging and gave myself in return . Yes , those were your very words . You measured me and what I gave by the standards of street women ; you forgot what I was willing to give to you ; forgot I was faithful , forgot everything .  --  I tried to keep all this back , but now you know all the facts ; everything is unravelled ; there are no secrets . Throw me aside now , Wallace , as Julia thought I should have thrown you aside . Take her , as you said I should have taken my poor weak fool. I 've done everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you said you would have given me . Do n't do as I did : sacrifice and pity ; or Julia will despise you as she always has me in her heart for what I chose . Do everything from now on as you both thought I should have done when I faced the same situation you now face . I 'll never interfere with whatever you choose to take of life together before I am free . Take everything ! ( Slowly ) If you can .  --  If you can ! ( She goes out , closing the doors . Then JULIA and WALLACE turn and gaze at each other in question. ) @x The same as the First Act. A morning ten days later . The room is now dismantled and everything is ready to be moved out . Barrels , boxes , and packing-baskets have taken the place of the furniture . The window-curtains , through which DORA has gazed so often in all the varying moods of her marriage , are down  --  even the brass-poles and brackets have been removed ; nothing veils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows , where once the pictures hung , are seen upon the cold and distant walls . Those who had known the room would sense the subtle atmosphere of protest which inevitably comes with the wrenching of material things from their human relationship . It is only the silver loving-cup , upon the piano , which seems to have escaped the desecrating hand . No longer does one view a home ; it is just a place where people still linger . Yet , somehow , it is a symbol ; a visible statement of what happens in the universal rhythms of life , where only through the breaking-up of the old can one move on to new adjustments . DORA enters , simply dressed . There is quiet sadness in her manner cloaked by an obstinate resolve . She looks about as though recording the new desolation ; but controls herself . Then she goes to the folding-doors , which , as she opens them , expose the other room in the same condition , with some packers , superintended by WOODS , methodically finishing their task . DORA KENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ) Is everything packed ? p. 110 WOODS They begin moving out shortly . DORA KENT I hope they 've been careful . WOODS They know people may use the furniture again in time . DORA KENT ( Evasively ) We 're only going to store it over the summer . Has Mr. Kent ' phoned ? WOODS No , Mrs. Kent . DORA KENT ( Protecting him ) He 's fortunate to miss this . WOODS I 've seen to everything myself . DORA KENT You 've been very good and faithful . You know I 'd have been lost without you . WOODS ( Venturing ) One learns a lot about people in ten years . DORA KENT Ten years ! So it is.  --  I 'm sorry to lose you . WOODS My profession is not a permanent one . DORA KENT I wish we could have made it so . Mr. Porter says he will place you ; so you will lose nothing . WOODS Thank you . ( Significantly ) And your room upstairs ? p. 111 DORA KENT We 'll leave that till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking about ) It is n't easy to move after ten years ; so much rubbish collects in a house ; one never suspects how it gets there . DORA KENT Yes ; lots of rubbish . WOODS It 's only when we tear up we really know what we have and what we have n't . DORA KENT That 's true , Woods . WOODS I beg your pardon  --  ( She turns )  --  but I did not know whether you 'd wish that loving-cup packed . I remembered your wedding anniversary comes next week . ( She looks at it standing forlornly on the piano . He glances at her and she is silent . He bows and goes out . It has seemed as though , for a moment , they had met and subtly understood each other . She moves toward the loving-cup , puts her hand on it half-affectionately and full of implication . Then she shrugs her shoulders , trying to shake off the memories it recalls . PORTER enters . He is very cheerful on the surface but there is an underlying strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad you 've come . I was lonely . p. 112 TOM PORTER Everything ready ? DORA KENT Almost . TOM PORTER That 's good . I 've been busy getting matters in order for you . ( He sits on a box , and takes a lot of papers out of pocket ) I went first to the Trust Company and find you can have your income sent you in monthly installments instead of semi-annually . DORA KENT That 's better . ( Smiling ) Now , I 'll be poor only a few weeks each month . TOM PORTER Then I went to the lawyers ' . DORA KENT You did n't  --   --  ? TOM PORTER Mention any names ? Oh , no . So I suppose they thought I was in love with a married woman . DORA KENT Imagine you . TOM PORTER I was once  --  but only once . It 's a troublesome luxury .  --  I find you 'll need to go West ; rent a house or a flat . Stay six months . Of course , you can travel while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Leaves papers on box ) You can read them later . DORA KENT ( Wistfully ) How do I get there ? p. 113 TOM PORTER Got the time-tables . ( Takes out four colored timetables which he also leaves upon box ) Four routes ; take whichever color looks prettiest . DORA KENT ( Absently ) I 've never been so far alone before . ( Pauses ) What about this house ? TOM PORTER That 's all fixed . Quite unexpectedly got somebody to sub-let it and turn it into a store . DORA KENT ( Half shuddering ) What kind of a store ? TOM PORTER Women 's garments ; you know , with lace on the pretty things that are n't seen . DORA KENT ( With a faint , ironical smile ) Pretty things ? I wish it had been something else .  --  You have looked after everything , Tom . TOM PORTER Had to , since you threatened to do it yourself . ( Absently ) You never will learn . DORA KENT ( Hopelessly ) Wo n't I ? TOM PORTER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But just call on me . DORA KENT How can I always do that ? p. 114 TOM PORTER I have n't anybody now myself and  --   --  DORA KENT ( Affectionately ) You 're a little friend of the whole world . TOM PORTER Truck and nonsense . Dora , this has sort of knocked me out , too . But I like to keep busy . I 'm lonely myself , at times . But one 's never too lonely if he 's working for the happiness of what lies nearest . So I 'm not doing this only for you ; but for her also . She 'd wish it . DORA KENT Julia is a fine woman . TOM PORTER How she and Wallace ! ( With a sigh ) Well , no wonder she would n't marry an old duffer like me . ( She takes his hand affectionately ) So , little girl , we 've got to help each other , you and I. We 're left behind . They 're not going to see sad , weepy faces if they look back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show them we 're game . I 'll have you to look after , if you 'll let me be just around the corner. That 's what Julia said . But she does n't need me and you do a bit , eh ? Guess I need somebody to look after , too . No sad faces , eh ? We 're game , eh ? DORA KENT It hurts , does n't it ? TOM PORTER I 've had pleasanter sensations. p. 115 DORA KENT But you think I 've done right ? TOM PORTER ( Slowly ) Whoever knows what is right ? The answer always lies so many years ahead . DORA KENT That 's so , Tom . Yet there are many people who are always ready to blame and judge others . They forget every one marries to be happy , but no one can ever tell what the future holds . ( Smiles faintly ) I 'm beginning to think husbands and wives should have a lot of sympathy for each other when things go wrong ; but most of them have only bitterness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only could get that patent to steer love right ! Here we all are . We 're pretty decent people  --  at least , we all had good intentions . Yet look how love has tangled us all up , and not one of us really at fault . DORA KENT I thought I was somebody of importance to both Fred and Wallace . I was mistaken . Each would have been what he is without me . Yet I must have hindered Wallace instead of helping him . TOM PORTER Nonsense , Dora . DORA KENT Why , look how dependent I am even on you . It 's easy to say you can live alone and all that . It 's so different when you 're suddenly face to face with your-self . I never realized before how absolutely helpless I was about these practical matters . Wallace always tended to everything . ( Almost shyly ) I 've felt so lost these last days . I miss his being around . I 'd grown so used to turning to him . I have n't shed a tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to be all alone now .  --  What is it , Tom , that makes me feel so all alone ? p. 116 TOM PORTER Let 's call it habit , my dear ; the habit of ten years . DORA KENT I 've been hunting the word ; habit , that 's it . TOM PORTER It 's stronger than love sometimes and gains its purpose just as effectively . ( WOODS enters . ) WOODS Mr. Deering is here . DORA KENT ( Assents and WOODS goes out ) I promised Armor he should have some of the cut glass and  --   --  TOM PORTER Funny where Julia is . Perhaps he knows . DORA KENT ( Betraying nothing ) Perhaps . TOM PORTER Another of her sudden impulses , I suppose : to take a wild motor trip at this time . DORA KENT ( Probing ) You 've not heard from her ? TOM PORTER I 've received a half-dozen postal cards mailed from different parts of the state . DORA KENT ( Puzzled ) Different parts of  --   --  ? TOM PORTER Suppose she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When 's Wallace coming back from Rosemoor ? p. 117 DORA KENT I do n't know . I 've told no one where he is . He has n't ' phoned . ( DORA is apparently puzzled . ARMOR DEERING comes in , very cheerful . They exchange greetings . ) ARMOR DEERING ( Looking about room ) Whew ! DORA KENT I 'll show you what I have . ARMOR DEERING I came ahead ; I 'm on my way down to the steamer . Ca n't I look over the things later ? TOM PORTER Steamer ? DORA KENT It wo n't take a moment . TOM PORTER Which steamer ? ARMOR DEERING Julia 's , of course . ( PORTER and DORA exchange glances ) Yes . Julia blew in on me last night . Threw her arms around me and wept . And then said she was sailing at noon . I thought her trip was all up , motoring more than a week before she started ; so I went around with her . She has n't packed a blessed thing ; said she 'd forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PORTER ( Thoughtfully ) So she is sailing . ARMOR DEERING ( Surprised ) Did n't she tell you ? p. 118 TOM PORTER Got the days mixed . DORA KENT ( Going up ) If you 'll come now . ARMOR DEERING Sure I 'm not stealing from you ? DORA KENT Not at all . ( She is seen in back among things . ) ARMOR DEERING Do n't know how we 're going to live up to our wedding presents on my income . TOM PORTER You 've done those Railroad fellows , eh ? ARMOR DEERING Yes . When they saw the evidence I had , they had to agree to plead guilty in a lower degree . TOM PORTER ( Enthusiastically ) And all on your own hook , too . ARMOR DEERING I ca n't understand Mr. Kent not appearing . TOM PORTER Wished you to get the limelight . ARMOR DEERING ( Modestly ) It is n't good for a young man 's eyes . TOM PORTER Give me your hand . ARMOR DEERING It 's been hammered to pieces nailing their lies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boy . ( Affectionately ) Go straight ! p. 119 ARMOR DEERING I must : to show Mr. Kent how much I appreciate what he 's done for me . When will he be back ? TOM PORTER When this moving is over . ARMOR DEERING ( Looking about ) Say , moving must be  --   --  TOM PORTER It is . DORA KENT ( In back ) Armor ! ARMOR DEERING ( Smiling ) Ought to get married , Mr. Porter , really you ought . ( DEERING goes up with DORA and then they pass out of vision . ) TOM PORTER Ca n't understand why everybody wants to marry the bachelors off . ( Looks about the room ) Too bad ! After ten years . ( KENT enters quietly . He is worn . He looks about and controls himself . PORTER turns ; they see each other ; he pulls the door to and comes down . ) Dora has told me . WALLACE KENT Then there 's nothing to be said . TOM PORTER Between men who love the same woman ? WALLACE KENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the outsider . But the devotion of years may claim the right to ask something of you . p. 120 WALLACE KENT Anything , of course , Tom . TOM PORTER Make and keep Julia happy ; else , do n't do it , do n't ! She is a woman in a thousand . She 'll demand a lot . Be sure you have it to give . WALLACE KENT ( He turns away enigmatically ) And Dora ? TOM PORTER I 'll always look after her . WALLACE KENT ( Moved ) Tom , I have n't been decent to you . TOM PORTER ( Whimsically ) How could you be when you thought Julia loved me ? WALLACE KENT ( Referring to room ) And all this ? TOM PORTER Dora could n't have done this alone . WALLACE KENT It was not your place . TOM PORTER ( With gentle reproach ) That 's what I thought ; but you were at Rosemoor . WALLACE KENT I was trying to solve a problem . TOM PORTER Dora has worked out hers . WALLACE KENT She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't shed a tear  --  that we 've seen . WALLACE KENT ( Noticing time-tables ) She 's going West ? TOM PORTER Immediately . You 'll see that your end is done . Accept service and better be represented by counsel . Saves future complications if there ever should be children . WALLACE KENT Children ! ( As though to himself ) I wonder how it would have been if Dora and I had  --   --  ? ( He puts the thought aside ) She 's going to take that trip alone ? TOM PORTER Got word to-day that some mining interests would need my attention for six or seven months , so I thought  --   --  ( KENT puts his hands impulsively on PORTER 'S shoulders in thanks ) Do n't thank me . I 've got a deal on that will clear up a small fortune . WALLACE KENT Money ! That 's so . They 've finished me , have n't they ? TOM PORTER Done up brown . WALLACE KENT Without a crust , eh ? TOM PORTER Well , quite by accident a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I suspected trouble ; so I got Biddle to let me in at a low price . I believe your brokers managed to save a few thousand for you . They 'll keep silent , too . It will help you turn around . And , Wallace , I believe there 's a chance for a little capital in this copper deal I 'm  --   --  p. 122 WALLACE KENT ( With determination ) No , Tom . I pay off every cent here : her debts and mine with what I can make in practice . Then I begin clean . TOM PORTER So law 's cleaner than copper , eh ? WALLACE KENT The first step is to get this over . It 's almost incredible , after ten years . TOM PORTER ( Quickly ) Do n't look back ; memories are nasty things to bring a second wife . WALLACE KENT What makes you say that ? TOM PORTER I never had one of those luxuries , but I know Julia . WALLACE KENT Strange ; you should say that , too . ( He turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped on the way to see Julia off . ( Closer ) Do it decently . WALLACE KENT ( Evasively ) I want to see Dora . I 'll wait till we are alone . TOM PORTER ( Puzzled ) But what are your plans ? WALLACE KENT I 'll tell you later . TOM PORTER ( Taking his hand ) What 's the trouble ? p. 123 WALLACE KENT I 'm suffering , Tom . ( KENT controls himself and goes off quickly towards the library . ) TOM PORTER Not happy with Julia in reach ! The men are just as hard to understand as the women . ( DEERING re-enters , opening doors and talking cheerfully . WOODS passes in back of them and goes to the main door . DORA also comes down . ) ARMOR DEERING What 's the matter , Mr. Porter ? TOM PORTER Matter ? Nothing . Do n't ask any questions but when you get off by yourself will you swear for me ? ARMOR DEERING Certainly ; I will now . ( WOODS re-enters . ) WOODS Miss Deering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hustle . ( JULIA enters , dressed for traveling . She , too , is halted by the appearance of the room . Her manner throughout is calm and firm in contrast to the previous act . WOODS goes off in back , closing doors . DORA watches JULIA . ) JULIA DEERING You 're going to see me off , Tom ? TOM PORTER One of the specialties I do best . p. 124 JULIA DEERING ( Looking at DORA slowly ) I 've come to see Dora alone . ARMOR DEERING I 'll go look after the trunks . TOM PORTER I 'll go along with you . ARMOR DEERING Do . Blew myself to a cab . See you later , Mrs. Kent . ( He goes off . JULIA detains TOM ; DORA looks out of window . ) JULIA DEERING Tom , I 've written you a long letter . ( Takes it from her pocket-book and gives it to him ) Will you read it to-night ? TOM PORTER ( Moved ) I 've always waited to be alone to read your letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need explain nothing . The world is full of people who are left behind . JULIA DEERING But you see I have n't quite forgotten the Rock of Ages . TOM PORTER May I add some flowers to your luggage ? JULIA DEERING No , no . No flowers now . ( Smiling sadly ) It will never be good-bye between you and me . Just give me a handshake and some strength  --  for a little while . p. 125 TOM PORTER Maybe I need all I have of that . I 'm too old a dog to hope for myself . ( Whimsically ) I  --  I hope you will be very happy . JULIA DEERING Quietly happy , you said . Yes , I shall be that in time , Tom . TOM PORTER I 'll be back , Dora . Rock of Ages ! Hump ! Guess I 'll incorporate myself and sell shares ! ( He goes out quickly , trying to conceal his emotion . The two women face each other . The following played very quietly . ) DORA KENT Julia , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KENT It 's best that Wallace sail later , of course . JULIA DEERING He wo n't follow me . DORA KENT Then you find you do n't love him enough ? JULIA DEERING It is n't that . DORA KENT But , Wallace ? JULIA DEERING I have tried to make him understand . DORA KENT I do n't . Does he ? JULIA DEERING Men see some facts slowly . DORA KENT It 's because of me ? p. 126 JULIA DEERING Yes . DORA KENT ( Firmly ) It is useless . JULIA DEERING That can not alter me . DORA KENT He knows my part in his life is finished . JULIA DEERING Except what has been between you . DORA KENT Ah ! You feel that , too . ( Poignantly ) Is n't it in my power to give him happiness even through stepping aside ? JULIA DEERING Can a mere word cut you out of his life ? DORA KENT You fill his heart . JULIA DEERING Do I ? A heart is such a little thing . It 's I who wish him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DORA KENT Away from you ? JULIA DEERING It could not be together . He may have a chance otherwise . DORA KENT ( Firmly ) He must live alone . JULIA DEERING Better that than what would happen to me . I 've learned much about myself and this problem of marriage in the hour since we three were together . I have gained a clear insight into what I must do . p. 127 DORA KENT Which is ? JULIA DEERING ( Firmly ) To leave him . DORA KENT ( Slowly ) How calmly you say that . JULIA DEERING There has been and will be enough of the other thing . DORA KENT And this is Julia Deering ! JULIA DEERING The real Julia . DORA KENT You 're sacrificing the man you love uselessly . JULIA DEERING No ; if I were to marry him you 'd be in the room watching . You would always be between us . He would never be entirely mine . You belong to one another . DORA KENT By what right  --  now ? JULIA DEERING By the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten long years . JULIA DEERING Listen , Dora . Because he was unattainable he filled my thoughts ; yet when he came to me I saw clearly what all the years of thought unconsciously had done . They had bound you to him in my eyes ; always the thought of him had been also the thought of you , because you two were man and wife and I was the outsider . p. 128 DORA KENT Not that , Julia , if he loved you . JULIA DEERING To think of Julia Deering ever seeing that passion , after all , is only crisis  --  all crisis ; but that the habit of living together becomes a state of mind . DORA KENT ( Half to herself ) Habit ! Tom said  --   --  JULIA DEERING Dora , I 've lived with the thought of Wallace but you have lived with the man . You said it all that day in a few words . You 've shared the daily habit of living ; you 've walked beside him ; he 's held your hand ; you 've eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; sat by each other 's bed in illness and shared the hidden intimacies while I lay in the night alone . And then his work . I could never be part of that . It is n't my sort . This all means something more than what he and I may have felt for each other . DORA KENT But are n't you big enough to forget all this ? JULIA DEERING It is n't my jealousy that makes it impossible between Wallace and me . It 's what you unconsciously made me realize : that there 's a bond between you two ; the bond of most nowaday marriages . It 's not made by passion nor even complete understanding ; but by habit , habit : that mechanical , ordinary , day-to-day , bond of marriage . p. 129 DORA KENT The daily habit of living ! I thought only those who were married knew how strong that is . JULIA DEERING I know it  --  now . DORA KENT So you have come to see that marriage is just walking along the road together  --  if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . DORA KENT But we did not understand each other at all . So it 's impossible between Wallace and me . JULIA DEERING Other women might honestly have solved it differently . I 'm only telling why I 'm going away . DORA KENT Too bad , Julia ; for I am leaving him , too . JULIA DEERING Think it over . DORA KENT I have  --  after what he called me . ( Shuddering ) Oh , it shames me every time I think of it . JULIA DEERING You are obstinate . DORA KENT It 's what some women have in place of strength . ( Half scornfully ) Did he send you to plead with me to live with him again ? JULIA DEERING I do n't believe even he would ask that . p. 130 DORA KENT Then he does understand me  --  a little . JULIA DEERING Good-bye now . I must go while I am still as I am . DORA KENT I called you weak . ( Goes to her ) Julia ! Forgive me . I do n't blame you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . JULIA DEERING ( Drawing back ) No , do n't kiss me , Dora . DORA KENT ( Keenly ) I ask no questions about these ten days . JULIA DEERING You would not believe any answer I gave . DORA KENT No ; for I know , if necessary , a woman would always lie about some matters . ( JULIA turns as WALLACE KENT enters with a letter in hand . He is surprised at seeing JULIA . ) JULIA DEERING No words , Wallace . Good-bye . I 'll never regret unless you fail to take life by the throat . Good-bye , Dora . Remember me a little , Wallace , as one who will be quietly happy. ( JULIA goes out , hastily controlling herself . KENT sits down with head bowed . ) DORA KENT At least your memory will be worthy . I 'm sorry , Wallace . ( She goes and puts her hands sympathetically on his shoulder . Her eye falls on the letter. ) p. 131 WALLACE KENT My letter of resignation . It was not mailed ? DORA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse . Besides it was n't right for you to retire at this time when that Railroad case was  --   --  WALLACE KENT You thought of that ? DORA KENT Your term has only a few months more to run . Finish it ; it will protect you from criticism in the future . WALLACE KENT It was good of you . DORA KENT I felt once this career was partly mine ; I did not like to see you throw it away uselessly because two women touched your life . WALLACE KENT I suppose the strongest men brush women aside . DORA KENT The strongest men should when woman 's emotions interfere . WALLACE KENT This sha' n't hurt me . Work , not sentiment , is the normal man 's life . DORA KENT I 'm so glad you see that . You 'll get hold of yourself now . I 've been the hindrance ; my dependence must have dragged you back . You will soon be free of me . WALLACE KENT ( Looking at her ) But where will you go after  --   --  ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WALLACE KENT You must . DORA KENT I 'm thinking first what 's best for you ; and after what you said that day , I know . WALLACE KENT I was cruel . DORA KENT ( With deep conviction ) No , you were right . It was an insult for me to stay merely because I feared you 'd go to pieces . But I saw it that way at the time . WALLACE KENT Dora , I understand better now . Before you leave I hope you 'll forget what I said . DORA KENT We are both learning to understand each other at the end . It might have been better had there been truth between us . ( WOODS enters . ) WOODS Pardon me , Mr. Kent , but the men  --   --  WALLACE KENT What men ? DORA KENT The movers . Better let them begin in the other room , Woods . ( WOODS goes out ) Tom thought it best to put everything in storage first ; it will save comment . I 've given the china and glasses to Armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go over them . p. 133 WALLACE KENT Now ? DORA KENT They are mostly upstairs . The linen and all that sort I have given to Woods . Your books are packed separately . You 'll direct where to send them . ( Takes loving-cup from piano ) Woods came across this cup your fraternity gave us when we were married . ( Half smiling ) I do n't know who owns it . WALLACE KENT ( Reading inscription ) " To Wallace Kent and Dora Houston , with all best wishes for your happiness . "  --  This will be the first time in ten years we 've not drunk a toast on our anniversary . DORA KENT What foolish sentiments one has at the beginning . WALLACE KENT How can you talk like that ? DORA KENT Because it seems to symbolize the irony of our marriage . WALLACE KENT No ; the habit and community of interests . ( The men are heard passing off back with furniture as KENT stands looking at cup . DORA has crossed and speaks off . ) DORA KENT Be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What difference does it make ? ( She sees him sitting there ) Put it away , Wallace . It 's over . p. 134 WALLACE KENT Dora , for God 's sake , do n't . DORA KENT It 's not easy , Wallace ; but it must be gone through with . WALLACE KENT Must it ? Dora , I could n't get away from the thought of your living alone . DORA KENT You must . WALLACE KENT But it 's not Tom 's place to help you ; it 's mine , if you 'll let me . DORA KENT All you can do is to make it easier for me now . WALLACE KENT Dora , we 've only got each other . We 're both alone . DORA KENT Yes , alone . ( Controlling herself ) But let 's look it in the face . It 's good-bye , Wallace , good-bye . We 're saying good-bye here in this house we 've lived in for ten years . Do n't let 's look back  --   --  WALLACE KENT But all life is looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we gain by living apart ? What victory do we bring ourselves ? DORA KENT We test our strength and  --   --  WALLACE KENT But we are two human beings , Dora . And that means we are both strength and weakness . DORA KENT I 'm thinking of you , Wallace . I can be of no further use to you . p. 135 WALLACE KENT But there is much you can give me . Is n't there something I can give you ? Have n't we learned to understand each other through all this ? Dora , we 've been kind to each other as people go ; we 've got along somehow ; we have more than most people . Is n't there something sweet and noble we can still give each other ? DORA KENT Would you want me to give everything as before ? WALLACE KENT Live in the same house with me  --  if nothing else . DORA KENT No , Wallace . That 's impossible . We are a man and a woman . Do n't let 's fool ourselves as we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have the right to go and if you feel it is for your good , go . I 'll not hinder you . But I wish you 'd stay and go along with me  --  together . DORA KENT To walk along the road together ? WALLACE KENT Yes . That 's what I ask . Wo n't you ? DORA KENT ( Thoughtfully ) And this is marriage ! WALLACE KENT As we have worked it out . DORA KENT I thought it could have been something greater ! WALLACE KENT So did I ; but it lay only in what we were . p. 136 DORA KENT Yes , that 's it ; and what we are . ( With a look of hope ) And what we can still make it . Wallace , I do feel helpless by myself ; I am afraid of the loneliness . My heart goes out to you because of what we 've had . My heart perhaps is waiting for yours  --   --  WALLACE KENT You will stay ? DORA KENT Yes , if  --   --  WALLACE KENT if ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want so to cry . ( She bows her head . He puts his hand upon her , as she sobs quietly . He soothes her tenderly . The bright sunlight floods the dismantled room. )
