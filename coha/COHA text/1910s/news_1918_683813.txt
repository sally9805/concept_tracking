txt Yesterday , after a hearing rich in fine official impartiality and amenity , the Board of Estimate approved unanimously the trenching of the North Meadow in Central Park . If the Liberty Loan Committee will compare yesterday 's proceedings with those of the hearing Tuesday before the board 's Committee on City Plan and Public Improvements , can the Liberty Loan Committee resist the acknowledgment that it has been ? is it impolite to say  --  duped ? Tuesday some of the statesmen who - on Friday breathed fire and slaughter against , the defenders of the park were seemingly averse to the proposed use of it . By clever and evidently planned questioning they sought to favor , elicit , or create the impression that only Central Park would do . " Why not Battery park ? " asked the Controller . " Have you " ever given Van Cortlandt Park a " thought ? " inquired Borough President BRUCKNER . Borough President RIEGELNANN suggested Brooklyn .

Make no mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Estimate . Make no mistake about the ideas held in the Gothic soul of Mayor HYLAN and the large number of persons who agree with him . What to him are " art artists " and their creations in landscape and - waterscape , scenic beauty , rural tranquillity , the planned variety of charm and of rest , the health to the body , the diversion to the mind which a well-ordered park gives ? Fill it with anomalies , monstrosities , gratify in it the schemes of ignorance , vanity , or the desire of gain . Disnark it , destroy its beauty , its art . Ruin it ! Sixty years or more the park has been kept , by continual effort , free from the fate which now threatens it . Tammany has found a good cloak . Under it a multitude of sins against the park will be meditated and committed . Watch for the early revelation of the first of these .
