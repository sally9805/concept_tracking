txt Northwestern university is to have no president In the near future to succeed Dr. A. W. Harris , who resigned last June . James A. Patten and George P. Merrick , members of the board of trustees . announced a different plan isst night . The administration of the university is to be in the hands of a. committee of deans kppointed by the trustees . Dean Thomas F. Hoigate of the college of liberal arts is chairman of this Committee , but he will not be acting president , and no new executive will be selected until after the advisory board plan has been thoroughly tried out . " The experience of largo universities , " said Mr. Patten , " has been that thre is too much jealousy between the departments and schools . One dean does not know what another will ask or get , and the entire school does not pull together smoothly . Our plan for Northwestern is designed to eliminate this . We shall try it for at least a year and more likely two . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
