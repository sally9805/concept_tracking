I HAVE met some interesting types lately . One is Jean B , a sergeant of infantry . Jean has been about the world a good bit , and when the war broke out was just finishing a contract in Spain . He promptly came to France and volunteered , and had only fifteen days of training before being sent to the front for a big attack . Knowing nothing of military matters and having distinguished himself in the first day 's fighting , he was made a corporal at once ; and next day , when the attack began again , he and his squad were the first to jump into a section of German trench . There , abandoned in the hasty retreat , was a brand-new German machine-gun and forty sacks of ammunition . Jean is a canny boy , and before the officers had got to where he was , he had his men hide gun and cartridges in a clump of bushes . The French made a gain of about two miles at this point , and owing to the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the new lines were nearly a mile apart . Under these conditions , both sides were constantly making daylight patrols in the broken country between the trenches ; and as Jean 's captain was a good judge of men , he let him take his squad out daily , to do pretty much as he pleased . Pledging his men to absolute secrecy , Jean had them hide machine-gun and ammunition a little way in front of the new French lines , and then gave them a brief drill , in mounting and dismounting the gun , tripod , and so forth . ( He 118had worked in an ordnance factory , by the way . ) Each man carried either a part of the gun or a few belts of cartridges . One morning , just before dawn , they crawled up close to the Germans and hid themselves in a brushy watercourse ? mitrailleuse set up and ready for action . Presently there were sounds of activity in front , and as day broke , they made out thirty or forty Germans , who , so far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open , working on a new trench . Jean 's men began to get excited and wanted action , but lie calmed them , whispering to be patient . He himself is the most excitable man in the world ? except in emergencies ; a jovial type , with black hair and a pair of merry gray eyes set in a red , weather-beaten face . Hour after hour they bided their time , until the Germans , only 75 yards away , assembled in a group for a rest . Lying on his belly behind the gun , Jean sighted and pulled the lever , spraying lead into the unfortunate Boches until the last belt of 200 cartridges had raced through . Then it was all hands dismount the gun and retreat at top speed . Sneaking home ' by devious ways , they smiled to see shells begin to smash into the position they had so lately left . At supper that evening ( the meal known universally as la coupe ' ) , the colonel came strolling down the trench with Jean 's subaltern . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , ' said the colonel , smiling , so this is the type who was on patrol this morning ? hum . I was in an advanced observation post on the hill above you and saw the whole affair with my glasses . And how many of those poor Germans did you kill ? ' I did not wait to count , my colonel . ' ' I will tell you , then ; six escaped , out of thirty-eight ? most remarkable rifle-fire I remember seeing . It sounded almost like a mitrailleuse at work . How many in your patrol ? Five ? Remarkable ! Remarkable ! Eh bien , good day , sergeant . ' He was a type not too severe , ' remarked the ex-corporal , in telling the tale ; in short , on bon garcon . ' This is the highest compliment a voila can pay his officer ; in fact , I once heard an ancient territorial say it irreverently of Marshal Joffre , whom he had known in younger days , somewhere in the Orient . Jean is at home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Spanish . I usually chat with him in the latter , as in it I get the fine points of his narrative better than in French . His German was the means of getting him into an adventure such as very few men in the war have experienced . I can not , of course , vouch for the truth of what follows , but I have no reason to doubt his word , and know him to be capable of any foolhardy rashness . Such a thing would be impossible at the present time . One dark night , shortly after midnight Jean ? on a solitary patrol ? was lying just outside the wire , about ten metres from the German trench , listening to locate the sentries . There was a faint starlight . Suddenly a whisper came from beyond the wire , a low voice speaking in broken French . ' Why do you lie so quiet , my friend ? I saw you crawl up and have watched you ever since . I do n't want to shoot you ; I am a Bavarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his perfect German . ' So , ' said the sentry , ' you speak our language . Wait a moment , till I warn the rest of my squad , and I will show you the way through the wire ; there are no officers about at this hour . ' Probably not one man in a thousand would have taken such a chance , but he did , and ten minutes later was standing in the trench in a German cloak and fatigue cap ( in case of passing officers ) , chatting amiably with a much interested group of Bavarian soldiers . They gave him beer , showed him their dugouts , and arranged a whistle signal for future visits , before bidding him a regretful good night . ' We are Bavarians , ' they said ; ' we like and admire the French , and fight only because we must . ' With characteristic good sense , Jean went at once to his captain the following morning and told him the whole story . The officer knew and trusted him and said without hesitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ears open . ' So ire made many a midnight crawl through the wires , after whistling the soft signal . He carried with him each time a few litres of wine ( a great luxury to the German soldier ) , and in return they took him on long excursions through their trenches . Once he was in the German third line , more than a mile back . The sector was a very quiet one , though the trenches were close together , and one morning a crude arrow dropped into the French trench , bearing a note to Jean . ' Get into your dugouts at five this afternoon , ' it read ; ' there will be a bombardment , but no attack , we hope . ' Another time , after a French bombardment , a similar note dropped in : ' Don ' t send so many torpedoes ? shells are all right , but your torpedoes have ruined some of our best sleeping-places . Remember we are not Prussians , but Bavarians . ' Jean is just now back from a permission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurer , and has come back sober , serious , and tremendously in love . He told me a little about it , as we sat together in my dugout ( I have a private one now , with a stove , a tiny window sticking up discreetly six inches above ground , and pictures on the walls ) , and the talc is so typical of wartime France that I ca n't resist telling it to you . They had carried on quite a correspondence , as godmother and godson , before the longed-for permission came ; and when A ? , with her parents , of course , met him at the train , she seemed like an old friend . She is charming , as I know from her photograph , and sturdy brown Jean , togged out in his special permissiog uniform , with his neat shoes , bright leather puttees and belt , kepi de fantaisie , and gold sergeant 's wound- and service-stripes , looks every inch a soldier of France . At the end of the second day , he was walking with A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said , ' I can not , as a man of honor , stay here longer . I love you , ? there , I have said it , ? but I am penniless , and after the war shall have only what I can earn . Your father , on the other hand , is the most important merchant in this district ? so you see it would ( even if you were willing ) be quite impossible for me to ask for your hand . I can never thank you enough for your kindness to a poor soldier ; it has given me a glimpse of Paradise . ' That evening , as he sat in his room , trying to make up an excuse to give the old people for leaving , the girl 's mother came in , saying that she understood he was going , and was much hurt to think that her house had not pleased him . Then the old gentleman rushed in , radiant with smiling good humor . But hush , mainan , ' he cried , I know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You love our little A ? , eh , sergeant ? Well , what of it ? And you are poor ? well , what of that ? When we old ones are gone , she will have everything ? she is all we have , since Louis was killed at the Marne . You are a type that I love , my boy ? out there at the front , helping to push the Boche out of France ; do you suppose I would not rather have you for a son-in-law than some sacre espce of a rich embusqui , , riding by in his limousine ? ' Rather superb , I think . So , as an engaged man , he is making a poor attempt to be cautious . Also , he has a frightful case of cafard , that mysterious malady of the trenches , which is nothing but concentrated homesickness and longing for the sight of one 's womenfolk , sweethearts , sisters , mothers . A couple of days ago , he came to me with a brilliant idea . See , Chariot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know Lieutenant P chief of the corps franc ? tell him of me , that I can speak German and can take prisoners , and tell him to ask my captain to detach me for the next ' coup de main . ' To understand this , you must know that a coup de main is a raid , made after a brief artillery preparation , on the enemy trenches , not with the idea of gaining ground , but simply to get a few prisoners for information regarding regiments , and so forth . In the French army such raids are made by special selected companies of each regiment , who have no routine duty and get eight days ' special leave after each raid that results in prisoners . These men are termed corps franc . As you can see , Jean thought this a quick way to get back to his fiancee . While we talked , by a freak of luck , who should knock at my door but Lieutenant P ? , chief of our local corps franc , a very good friend and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quintessence of a French subaltern , ? 26 years old , slight , wiry , and handsome ; an Anglophile in everything relating to sport , as exquisite in dress and person as Beau Brummel , and as recklessly brave as Morgan 's buccaneers . He has risen from the ranks , wears a gold bracelet , and has every decoration that a French soldier or officer can get , including the red ribbon . His Croix de guerre has seven citations , and he has been five times wounded . He took to Jean at once , saying that he needed an interpreter for a raid which was coming in two or three days , and promised to see the captain about it at once . Better come with us , ' he said to rne , whimsically . ' I want to run down to Paris next week , and if the sergeant here and I do n't get a prisoner or two , it will be because there are none left in the first line . Come on ? you ' 11 see some fun ! ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me ? I 'm ruined if I 'm caught in any such escapade , and in any case I get no permission . ' ' Oh , we 'll fix that . Maybe you 'd get a nice little wound like my last one ; and if not , I 'm an expert with grenades ; I think I could toss one so you would just get an ? clat or two in the legs ? good for a week in Paris . ' I thanked him without enthusiasm and declined . The sequel to this came last night as I lay reading in my bunk . The evening had been absolutely quiet , not a rifle-shot along the trenches , until suddenly , about 10.30 , the batteries set up their sullen thumping , mingled with the thud of exploding aerial torpedoes . To my ears , concentrated artillery fire ? not too far off ? has a strangely mournful sound ? heavy , dull , and fit- ful , like a dark thunderstorm in Dante 's hell . The bombardment lasted exactly forty minutes , then absolute silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in raids ) , and once more the sudden stammer of a mitrailleuse . As I lay there , safe in my warm bunk , I thought of gallant little P --  -- - and jolly old lovelorn Jean , perhaps at that moment stealing through torn German wire with a brace of prisoners ahead of them , crouching low each time a star shell sent up its warning trail of sparks , ? or perhaps To-morrow , when I go back to the village for two days ' rest , I shall look for them . April 10 , 1917 . I am writing this in a new post of ours ? a village several kilometres from the lines , where there are still civilians . As the hospital is very noisy at night , and one would have to sleep in a barrack , packed in among the wounded , I have arranged with a motherly old woman ( pa tronne of the local caf ? ) to let me have her spare room . I found an old cow-bell and by an arrangement of strings and hooks have rigged it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . Talk about luxury ! I have a real bed ( about five feet long ) with sheets , pillows , and a feather-bed that reaches from feet to waist . When a night call comes , the bell tinkles , I leap out of bed , pull on breeches and coat and high felt arc-tics , ' and in three minutes am off . As there are no men about , I have been ( in odd moments ) splitting wood and moving the heavy beer and wine casks as required ? work really far too heavy for women . The old lady , in return , often invites me in for a cup of steaming coffee with a dash of schnapps , and to-day she asked me to a family dinner ? a superb civilian meal of ham and boiled potatoes and homemade choucroute . The latter must be tasted to be appreciated . She is quite bitter about a branch of the Y.M.C.A. ? called Foyer du Soldat ? just opened here , which , with its free movies , papers , and so forth , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy license tax , ' she says , ' and they pay nothing ? nothing . ' Useless to try to explain to the good old soul that the innocent must suffer in order that virtue shall triumph ? or in other words , that the f nntassin shall have amusement without beer . I comforted her with the regrettable truth that her boys will all be back when the novelty is worn oil . A great many of the men here are muleteers from the Spanish and Italian borders . Where the country is hilly and trails constitute the shortest route to the trenches , the French use a great many pack-mules to carry up provisions , ammunition , and supplies . A Western packer would be interested in their methods . Each mule has its master , who packs it , washes it , . feeds it , and on the march walks ahead , leading it.by a rope . The pack-saddles and rigging are wonderful they must be when one considers that the mules often carry 300 pounds twenty miles a day , and sore backs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever you meet him ? these are just the same ' ornery ' brutes we have at home . Their effect on the explosive southern French temperament is sometimes ludicrous . I stopped the other day to ask the way of a mule-skinner who was limping dejectedly ahead of his charge ? the rest of the train was far ahead . After putting me on the road , he leaned wearily against a tree and explained that in all the world there was probably not another mule like his . It had kicked him yesterday , it had bitten him severely this morning , and just now , while he adjusted the pack , it had kicked him on the hip , so that in alllikelihood he would limp for life . While he talked , the mule sidled over , with drooping eyelids and sagging ears , and planted one foot firmly on the unfortunate Frenchman 's toes . The whole thing seemed to have been done by accident ? I could almost see the dotted line of innocence running from the mule 's sleepy eye off into space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mule , forced its weight off his foot , and tenderly inspected the injured part . Then , hands on hips , he regarded the mule with a long stare of dramatic contempt . Wouldst thou kill me , sacra espece of a camel ? ' he said at last ; well , death would be better than this . Come , here I am ! ' The day before yesterday , when I was out at one of our posts on the front , an Austrian 88mm. shell fell in a crowd of mules and their drivers . Fortunately no one was hurt ( by one of the freaks of shells ) , but three mules were killed by the splinters . That night , with some misgivings , I tried a steak from the hind-quarter of a five-year-old mule . It was bully . When you come to think of it , a mule is just as good food as a steer . A week ago I was waiting at a front post for some wounded , when a mule train came by , packed with the huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each mule carried four of these truly formidable things . As the last mule passed , he slipped on the muddy slope , his feet flew out , and down he came with a whack , torpedoes and all . You ought to have seen us scatter , ? officers , men , and mule-drivers , ? like fragments of a bursting shell . As the mule showed signs of struggling , we had to rush back and gingerly remove the load before helping him up . These torpedoes play a great part in war nowadays . They are cheap to man- deleted material through the stately old gardens , chatting with the officers while the band played . The general , while the most military man imaginable , has a very attractive brusque affability . We are a good-sized crowd as Americans run , and the French , who average shorter and stockier , never cease to wonder at our height . The old chap grabbed three or four of us by the shoulders and lined us up . Mais vous etes des gaillards , ' he said , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any of you . But wait , we have a giant or two . ' With that he called over a grinning captain and pulled him back to back with our biggest man , whom he topped by a full inch . ' But , my general , ' laughed the officer , it is not good to be so tall ? too much of one sticks out of a trench . ' The owner of the chateau ? a stately woman of fifty , proud of her name , her race , and her country , and an angel from heaven to the sick and poor for miles around ? is an example of the kind of patriotism of which , I fear , we are in need . Her husband is dead ; when the war broke out she had a daughter and two sons ? gallant young officers whose brief lives had been a constant source of satisfaction and pride to their mother . The elder was killed at the Marne , and a while ago , the younger , her special pet , was killed here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom the continuance of an old name was almost a religion , could undergo no harder experience . At the graveside she stood erect and dry-eyed , with a little proud smile on her lips , as her last boy was buried . Why should I weep ? ' she asked some one who would have comforted her ; there is nothing finer my boys could have done if they had lived out their lives . ' Her heart must be very nearly broken in two , but never a sign does she give ; going about among her hospitals and peasant families as cheerful , interested , even gay , as if her only cares were for others . There is true courage for you ! To-day I went to a new post for some sick men , and who should be waiting for me but my friend Jean , of whom I wrote you before ! His company has been transferred to this place . It was great to see his grinning face and to chatter Spanish with him . As the sick men had not finished lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a jolly meal with his pals . I have had to give up wine , as it seems to blacken our teeth horribly . ( all of us have noticed it , and we can trace it to no other source ) , and the Frenchmen ca n't get over the joke of seeing one drink water ? extraordinary stuff to drink ! All right to run under bridges or for washing purposes , but as a beverage ? a quaint American conceit , handed down no doubt from the red aborigines ? les peaux rouges indigenes ? of our continent . Jean admitted that since December , 1914 , he had not tasted water , and no one else could remember the last occasion when he had tried it . As word had just come from the trenches that a wounded man was on the way in , I got my helmet and we strolled clown the boyau to meet the stretcher-bearers . It was , to me , a new section of the front and very interesting . The country is broken and hilly , and the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , which really has been painfully worked out to prevent enfilading fire . There is scarcely any fighting here , as neither side has anything to gain by an advance , which would mean giving up their present artillery positions . In one place the boyau ran down a steep slope , badly exposed , and Jean said , ' Follow me on the run ! ' We sprinted for twenty yards , and next moment , tat-tat-tat-tat came from the Iloches , and little spurts of dust shot up behind us . They can never shoot quickly enough to hurt any one at this point , Jean said , but after all , You ca n't blame a fellow for trying . ' At the next turn we came on a train of the little grenade donkeys ? so small that they make the tiniest Mexican burro seem a huge clumsy brute . They do not show above the shallowest trench , and each one carries two panniers full of grenades . These last arc vicious little things of cast iron , checkered so as to burst into uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemons . They make an astonishingly loud bang when they go off , and if close enough , as in a narrow trench , are pretty bad . At a little distance , of course , they are not very dangerous . In the trench warfare ? raids , infantry attacks , and so forth ? they seem to have supplanted rifles , just as the knife has supplanted the bayonet . May 11 , 1917 . Sunday , another lovely day . It is 7 A.M. , and already the indefinable Sunday atmosphere has come over the camp . The shower-baths are open and strings of men are coming and going with towels on their arms . Under the trees little groups are shaving and cutting one another 's hair , amid much practical joking and raillery . One becomes very fond of the French soldier . Large floods of rhetoric have been poured out in describing him , and yet nearly every day one discovers in him new and interesting traits . Let me try and sketch for you a composite picture of the French infantryman ? the fantassin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , I do not see him as a boy , but as a sturdy middle-aged man ? the father of a family . He is short and solidly built , with thick calves and Imavy shoulders . His round head , on which the hair is short , crisp , and black , is surmounted by a battered blue helmet . He wears a long overcoat , looped up and buttoned at the sides , showing evidence , in several places , of home-made patching . It was once horizon blue , but has now faded to an ideally protective shade of blue-green-gray . About his middle is a worn cartridge-belt , and from either shoulder , their straps crossing on breast and back , hang his musettes ? bags of brown canvas for carrying extra odds and ends , including everything from a bottle of wine to a dictionary . On his back is his square pack , an affair of formidable weight , to which he has lashed his rolled blanket in the form of a horseshoe , points down . Perched on top of this , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which serve for both cooking and eating ; and beside them you perceive with astonishment that he has strapped a large German trench torpedo ? a souvenir for the home folks . From his belt hangs the tin box , painted horizon-blue , which contains his gas-mask , and on the other side his long slender bayonet rattles against his thigh . A large calloused hand , not too clean , holds his shouldered rifle at a most unmilitary angle . The gun has seen hard service , the wood is battered , and in places bright steel shows through the bluing ; but look closely and you will see that it is carefully greased , and in the muzzle a little plug of cloth keeps out dust and moisture . In spite of a load which would make a burro groan , he walks sturdily , whistling a march between puffs of a cigarette . Glance at his face . The eyes are dark gray , deep-set , and twinkling with good humor ; they are the clear decisive eyes of a man who knows what he wants and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth strong and ironically humorous , the unshaven chin i-ositive and shapely . It is the face of a breed that has been settling to type for many centuries , a race old in cultivation and philosophy . What is he in civil life ? That is hard to say . A lawyer , a farmer , a customhouse clerk , a cook ? probably a cook ; most of them seem to be cooks , and mighty good ones . Ours at the mess was assistant chef at the Savoy , in London , and when he has the material ( for example a hind-quarter of mule , a few potatoes , some dandelions , a tin of lobster , and an egg ) he can turn out a dinner hard to equal anywhere ? delicious hors d'oeuvres , superb soup , roast , saute potatoes , salad , and so on . The French soldier 's one great joy and privilege is to grumble . Back in billets where he goes to rest , he spends the whole day at it ? hour after hour , over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything : the food , the uniforms , the trenches , the artillery , the war itself . To hear him , one would suppose that France was on the verge of ruin and disintegration . Let some unwise stranger make the slightest criticism of France and watch the change . The poilu takes the floor with a bound . There is no country like France ? no better citizens or braver soldiers than the French . Dis done , mon vieux , ' he ends triumphantly , where would Europe be now if it were not for us ? ' To be a French general is a terrible responsibility . Their ears must burn continually , for every act is criticized , picked to pieces , and proved a fatal mistake , daily , in a thousand roadside wine-shops . Some celebrity once remarked , that every French soldier was a potential general . He knew them ; he was right . They are no carping destructive critics who tear things down but suggest no method of building up . On the contrary , any chance-met poilu will tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? from a trench-raid to an enveloping movement , which will ? he is sure of it ! ? net fifty thousand prisoners . In last night 's coup de main they caught Only three Germans . ' Do you know why , my friend ? I will tell you . Our artillery cut the wires all right , and tapped on the front trench . Good . After that they raised their guns for the barrage , but pouf ! the Boches had already run back to their dugouts in the second or third lines . Had the gunners made a barrage on the second line from the beginning , the Germans would have been forced to remain in the first line , and instead of three , we would have bagged thirty . Oh , well , we get our extra leave anyhOw , and you should have heard them squeal when we dropped grenades down their stovepipes ! ' The French infantryman would drive a foreign officer mad until he began to understand him and appreciate his splendid hidden qty.lities . The only thing he does without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come to think of it , that is a rather important part of a soldier 's duty . An officer wants a new boyau dug ? you never heard such grumbling and groaning and kicking . Finally , a bit put out , he says , ? All right , do n't dig it , if you are all sick and tired , and think I make you work simply to keep you busy . It was only a whim of mine anyhow ? the Boches put up anew machine-gun last night , which enfilades the old boyau , and when day breaks and you go back to the third lines , they will doubtless put a dozen of us out of our misery . ' As if by magic the new zigzag trench is dug , and the chances are that the officer finds a supply of extra-good firewood in his abri next day . In army like France 's , one finds many odd birds among the simple sol- ( Hers .

Another evening , in a cafe , a roughly dressed soldier stood up to give us a bit of music ? and for an hour the world seemed to stand still while one of the greatest violinists of France ( two years at the front , twice wounded , croix de guerre , with several citations ) made us forget t hat anything existed except a flood of clear throbbing sound . It was a rough , drinking crowd ? a moment before there had been a pandemonium of loud voices and clattering plates ; but for an hour the listeners were still as death ? not a whisper , not even a hand-clap of applause . It was , I think , the finest tribute I ever saw paid a musician . And so it goes : one never knows what variety of man is hidden beneath the uniform of faded horizon-blue . June 17 , 1917 .

I arrived here in the expectation of taking the first boat , crossing the continent , and seeing you .

At home , it seems , men are a drug on the market ? the rub is to train them and fit them in . Here , on the other hand , they fairly welcome healthy young own ? and will train us and put us where we will do the most good , with the least possible delay . Do n't let yourself think that flying over here is unduly hazardous ? a skillful pilot ( as I hope to be ) has as good a chance of living to a ripe old age as his comradesin the infantry .

I stood in line with dozens of other recruits for the Foreign Legion ? all of us naked as so many ' fish , in the dirty corridor , waiting our turns . Each man had a number : mine was seven ? lucky , I think ! Finally the orderly shouted , Numero sept , ' and I separated myself from my jolly polyglot neighbors , marched to the door , did a ' demi-tour h gauche , ' and came to attention before a colonel , two captains , and a sergeant .

' ' Ah , you speak French , ' he rejoined with a smile ; ' good luck , then , my American . '
