txt A SOPHOMORE 'S GRIEVANCE . Hamilton 's " Conservative " Faculty Wo n't Let Him Take Spanish . There is at present somewhat of an uproar among the sophomores at Hamilton College on account of the refusal of the Faculty to grant a petition of its members to have next year 's schedule changed so as to allow them to take two courses , namely , geology and Spanish . which at present conflict . This petition was refused , as usual , on the grounds of conservatism , the Faculty fearing that if they granted one change there would be a dozen more to follow . The necessity for this change lies in the fact that in order to procure the degree of Bachelor of Science here , one must have completed two full courses in science . Those of us who have elected and pursued biology throughout sophomore year , instead of chemistry , must elect either geology , in which our course Is excellent , or physics , in which we have a course practically worthless on account of there being no laboratory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le not only necessary to a modern . complete , and well-rounded education , but is essential to those of us who propose later to teach , travel , or work to positions , very numerous at present . in which a knowledge of Spanish is required . Had the Faculty given us a sufficient and reasonable explanation for their refusal we might have been willing , in some macs at least , to sacrifice either the degree for its useless brother , the Ph . B. , or to give up the Spanish .
