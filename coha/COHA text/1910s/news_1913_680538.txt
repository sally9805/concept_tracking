txt Col. Theodore Roosevelt , appearing for the first time on the stump as an advocate of votes for women , was easily the lion of the hour at the pageant-tableau given last night at the Metropolitan Opera House under the auspices of ten suffrage organizations . Every seat in the opera house was occupied ; every box subscribed fora and hundreds of men and women who felt that they were fortunate to obtain tickets of admission after the S. R. 0 . sign was hung out , crowded the aisles . When the curtain finally - went up twenty-five minutes after the hour set for the prologue to begin , men and women rose to their feet waving American flags and suffrage pennants . Occupying the centre of the stage , on the right of Dr. Anna Shaw , President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association , was the Colonel , smiling and impatient to begin . The pageant was one of the most remarkable affairs given by the suffragists In this city , and Col. Roosevelt was quick to grasp the significance of it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a gathering here in New York was the best proof that " civilization was steady creeping from the West , " assuring votes for women in a short time . The pageanttableau , " A Dream of Freedom , " coming after the addresses was elaborate and imposing . Mrs. Florence Fleming Noyes , as Hope , was the central figure . After the first demonstration Dr. Shaw took charge of the early meeting , overshadowing the Colonel for a time as she told of the advance that the cause of woman snffrage had made in the last few years . She made the statement that Michigan had been stolen from the advocates of equal rights , and the Colonel leaned forward and clapped his hands and shook his head up and down violently In approval . When he was introduced as the biggest addition to the cause of woman suffrage in the past year he rose quickly . bowed to Dre Shaw and advanced to the front of the stage . Never in the many days of his long campaigns was the Colonel in finer fettle . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand In , - the- old en-e thusiastic way : Colonel a Ready Convert . In his address . which occupied nearly an hour , the Colonel went thoroughly into his conversion to the cause . and aimed shafts of sarcasm at those who opposed the movement . A new recruit , he was a master of his topic . and had a ready answer for any objection . The audience was delighted , and frequently broke into applause . Right at the start the Colonel said he wanted to say ditto to all that Mrs. Shaw had said . And then he began to explain why . It is an utter absurdity , it is wicked to condemn a great law-abiding movement because there are a few elsewhere who do foolish and wicked things , " began the Colonel . " As Dr. Shaw said , apply to men the rule that none are worthy of the vote because some of them are riot and there will not be one of us permitted to vote . No reform has been succesful unless it attracted the zealous spirits who dare and suffer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal outruns discretion and even morality , and to hold that against all is more Wicked and foolish than the conduct of those against whom the charge is made . " Col. Roosevelt said that he wanted to make his appeal primarily to men , and that he believed Dr. Shaw was right when she said that women were sure to obtain the ballot . " I do n't think the East is going to always lag behind the West in darkness , " he said . " I think civilization is coming East gradually . I want to speak to the men who have the right to vote and who are recreant in their duty if they do n't see that the women share it with them . I ask every decent , self-respecting citizen who has the right to vote to join the movement to secure for women the ' , Elultrage now denied them . " Then the Colonel said he wanted to make it plain that equality of right did not mean identity of function any more between men and women than it did between man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any line of conduct without leaving some of both sex on either side of it . and that there would be more women on the right side of the line than men . One argument which started a. great outburst of applause he made near the end of his address when he said : A Blow to the Underworld . " In every community where women have received the vote it has meant so much loss of power to the underworld . Just by so much there has been a loss of influence to the powers that prey . The underworld is predominantly a world of men . Vice and crime are conducted by a portion of the population in which there are ten men to one woman . Every disbeliever in decency will oppose this movament And when you see men who make a business of that which is foul and base rallying against a cause you may be convinced that it is pretty good common sense to stand for that cause . " The Colonel said that in his last campaign in Michigan he had seen in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was the first to laugh as he explained that what he had intended to say was that he had seen the signs " outside of the saloons . " Sixty-five years ago , when the suffrage movement started , said Col. Roosevelt . a meeting like that in the opera house would have been impossible . " At that time , " he continued , " you would have found a great number of worthy people , including the very orthodox people . who insisted that the ' foundation of the family would have been ruined if it did n't rest on the masterful headship of the man : But now we have advanced to a far better ideal , the ideal of equal partnership between man and woman . " The advocates of woman suffrage , said the Colonel , were not asking the East to try anything that was new . I never say anything on the stump that I ca n't carry out when off the stump , " exclaimed Mr. Roosevelt , and his audience chuckled delightedly . " Mind you . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ills and ailments , but I give it as my denterate and careful judgment that in every State where suffrage has been tried , there has been , as far as I know , no single instance where it has produced damage . And there has been case after case where it has worked for the universal betterment of social and civic conditions . " There were scores of women , the Colonel added , whose faith and ability rendered them as useful as men for the public service , and every argument advanced against woman suffrage today was advanced against manhood suffrage 100 years ago . The theory of the progressives nowadays , he said , . was to , so conduct . the M government ' that the average man could do his ' duty without neglecting his home . tie added . as the audience applauded : Now , all we propose . to do is to get his partner alongside of him . I do n't say it is n't possible for any number of first-class citizens to be frightened at new ideas . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Queens and the Home . Several questions put to him by Miss Ida Tarbell in a letter , the Colonel answered , adding that he thought she was competent to " vote " if she was competent to tell - him why he should vote . Then he added : " If you ask the finest and most musty old conservative to tell you something dear to his heart , ana knows something about history , lie will tell you that the greatest sovereign of England was Queen Elizabeth , that the second most powerful ruler ? of Russia was Catherine , and the greatest Austrian ruler Maria Theresa . " What we say , " he continued , " is that when yen get women like that we should be allowed to use them for the public good in the way that they can do the most good . " The Colonel then said that lie had found it of the greatest value to conduit women in many of the great problems of to-day . He mentioned the child labor laws and minimum wage and i immigration . rIn every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain women just as I turn to certain men on other questions , because they can give me the assistance and help I need . " Referring to the coming constitutional convention in this State the Colonel called upon the Progressives to consult and heed the women , saying that he did not believe it was right that half of the 10,000,000 people in the State should decide what was best for all . Then the Colonel took another tack which started applause . " Conservative friends tell me that woman 's duty is in the home , " he said . " Certainly . So is the man 's . The duty of the woman to the home is n't any more than the man 's . If any married man does n't know that the woman pulls a little more than her share in the home then he needs education . If the average man has more leisure to think of public matters than the average woman has then it 's a frightful reflection on him . If the average man tells you the average woman has n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home and do his duty . The average woman needs fifteen minutes to vote , . and I want to point out to the alarmist that she will still have left t04 days , twenty-three hours , and fortyfive minutes . " The Colonel produced a letter from another woman , who asked him if he thought that women would have the same respect of men with the vote . Isis reply was " Yes , and a good deal more . " There Is no surer sign of advancing civilization than the advanced respect Paid to woman , who Is neither a doll nor a drudge , " he exclaimed . He added that an investigation would show that in the section of this country and in other Countries where family life was found to be falling lower , the women did not have the right to vote . To the question " Are women physically , tenable to enter . the political arena ? ' his reply was : " ' Yes , wherever you find an honest election . I have already said . that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' work she would do if she had the right to vote . To cast the ballot does n't take the strength of a Hercules . Really , it 's difficult to answer that question without seeming humorous . " Those Opposed Silent . When Dr. Anna Howard Shaw called on the vast audience to adopt the/ resolution asking the United States Senate to pass the Senate joint resolution to give the franchise to women there was an " Aye " that made the echoes ring , and there was not a sound when she asked for those opposed . If there  --  were anti-suffragists in the house they were silent . Dr. Shaw addressed the audience as . " suffragists or those who soon will be . " The sixty-five years that the suffragists had worked , she said , should have brought them to their majority . " And in all those years , " she continued , " there has never been a time when I could say that I ' was ashamed of there women or the'means they have taken to gain their freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President of the United States , in a book he has written , says that , if there areany. part of the people who want to be ' taken care of I am  --  Sorry Tr them . We women may not be some at a the people , but we are ' any part ' of the people . If putting guardians over men has weakened them it has weakened the women of the country and we rebel against the g tutelae and guardianship . " Our sixty-five years of work has earned us the respect and consideration of the people and we protest against continued disenchisement because women in other parts of the world have used acts of violence while we have been patriotic and law-abiding . If any man says that , 1 want to hurl it in his face . The men would not vote , if they waited until all men were fitted , for even in our own country men are still taken by men from the jails and burned alive at the . stake .

It was given tinder the auspices of nine different suffrage societies . The curtain went up upon a beautiful twilight scene .

The orchestra was under the direction of David Marines , many women taking part through the courtesy of the Musicians ' Protective Union . The opera house was crowded as early as 8 o'clock . the hour set officially for Col. Roosevelt to make his apeparance , and there was some confusion in the lobby as men and women hurried to find their seats . Outside the theatre and in the lobby scores of women representing the organizations pushed through the throng calling out their wares  --  programmes and suffrage pennants . The programmes were all sold some time before the curtain went up , and the last hundred or more went at advanced price .

Miss Perkins Outside Their Quar. , ters with Suffrage Banner . There is indignation in the camp of the anti-suffragists , and Miss Elizabeth Perkins , an aggressive suffragist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Perkins , dressed in a black silk gown of the very latest style , stood in front of the window of the Anti-Suffrage Annex in Fifth Avenue , between Thirty-eighth and Thirty-ninth Streets , waving a violet and green flag en which was printed , " votes for Women . " The antis would n't have minded so much if Miss Perkins had n't persisted in covering the posters in the window of the antis with her flag . These posters bear crisp legends warranted to confuse the most ardent suffragist , such as the figures of the Michigan vote at the recent election , and the showing made by the women in California and other States which are trying the experiment of woman suffrage . The antis say they will put up still larger posters to-day , and if Miss Perkins stays around they will make it interesting for her .
