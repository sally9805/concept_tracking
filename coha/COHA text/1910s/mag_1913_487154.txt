President Wilson not only read his first annual message in person , but made it one that could be read . This is not merely a question of style , but of length . Compared with the messages of Taft and Roosevelt , Mr. Wilson has revised his downward by fully 75 per cent . This he has accomplished by leaving out the customary long reports on the various operations of the Government  --  reports which will be separately submitted to Congress and printed  --  and concentrating attention upon a few topics , such as our relations with Mexico , the establishment of a system of rural credits , and amendments to the Anti-Trust law . In all the points mentioned the President followed his known policies . The only surprise of the message is what may be called the political part of it . He urges legislation to bring about an , entirely new and uniform method of nominating candidates for the Presidency . This is by direct primary elections throughout the entire country , the National Conventions to be abolished , except for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he composed , not of delegates elected for the purpose , but of the party nominees for the Presidency and for Congress . In a word , the President would have the nation adopt what is virtually the system in States like Wisconsin and New Jersey . He gives no hint of the way in which Congress could attack the problem ; cites no Constitutional warrant for his recommendation ; refers to none of the enormous difficulties , both theoretical and practical , which would obviously have to be surmounted . One thing , however , is certain . Congress and the country will not dispose of this highly contentious subject so lightly as the President appears to be ready to do . When our income-tax law was first drafted , with the flat exemption of $4,000 , it was estimated that the number of persons subject to the tax would'be about 450,000 It is interesting to coinpare with this the following estimate of French incomes quoted by the Paris correspondent of the London Daay Tele-graph : Persons having an income of over ? 200,000 a year 40,000 a year ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year 9,800 ? 1,000 a year 51,000 ? 400 a year 123,000 ? 200 a year 294,000 ? 40 a year 8,000,000 This shows somewhat less than 65,000 persons with incomes above $5,000 ; and interpolated between that limit and the one next below it , we find approximately 100,000 persons with incomes above $4,000 . At this rate , allowing for differ- ? ence of population , the number in the United States would be about 250,000 instead of the estimated 450,000 , indicating the greater abundance of good-sized incomes here But the difference is far more striking when we go lower down ; for out of the eight and a half million incomes in France  --  that is , roughly speaking , the eight and a half million families  --  eight million fall below a thousand dollars a year . At that rate , there would be only one and a quarter million incomes in the United States exceeding a thousand dollars a year . Secretary Daniels 's first report is hailed as showing that he is " no one-battleship man " Nothing less than two will satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the advocates of an " adequate " navy and the disarmament fanatics been reduced ! But it is not this feature of the document that will receive most attention . Even the members of the General Board are frank to recognize " the futility of hoping or expecting that the ships and men its policy calls for will be provided . " It is the idea of a " naval holiday " that will have the strongest appeal for the nation , Ten years ago , Mr. Daniels points out , our largest battleship cost $5,000,000 ; the next Dreadnought will cost $14,000,000 . " When , " he asks , " is this accelerating expenditure to be reduced ? " Accordingly , while heartily endorsing Winston Churchill 's suggestion of a vaca tion of one year in battleship-building , he goes a step further by recommending the calling of a world conference to discuss the matter and see whether the nations " can not agree upon a plan for lessening the cost of preparation for war . " His desire that the United States should take the initiative in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a new party , innocent of the wiles of politics , Illinois Progressives must be granted to be rapid learners . Gov . Dunne , having some " minority patronage " at his disposal , informed the Progressive leaders of just what offices he ' had set aside for them and their followers , and left it to these leaders to do the " allotting . " Were they upset by this , strange offer ? Not in the least . A few conferences , and the thing was done in a way that could not have been improved upon by the Old Guard . It is true that one little rift remains unclosed . When the offices in question had been placed upon the table , there were strong hopes that everybody would give his endorsement to Mr. Funk , Progressive candidate for Governor last year , for the Public Utilities Commission " plum . " It is a good office , and Mr. Funk has fought hard for the party . But for some months Mr. McCormick has not spoken to Mr. Funk , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post without McCormick 's assent . So the progress of Mr. Funk  --  to office  --  halts . The whole affair , however , is reassuring as showing the ability of the Progressives to take their eyes off their lofty ideals long enough to fasten them upon mundane objects . A period of thirteen days was enough to give Louisiana a revised Constitution . The substance of the amendments is not of much interest outside of that State , the principal one being due to the necessity of improving the State 's financial condition . The circumstances of the revision , on the contrary , are of unusual interest . At a special election , held on the last Tuesday in October , the voters empowered delegates to adopt amendments upon two matters , these being named in the act- of the Legislature providing for the election and for the Convention . The Convention , however , . proceeded to frame and adopt several amendments dealing with other subjects , including an anti-Trust ordinance . This action would not be particularly serious if , as is usual in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final word upon it . In the present instance , however , the will of the Convention is absolute . The amendments went into effect the moment they were signed by the delegates , and popular opposition to any of them is limited to protest or possibly to appeal to the State Supreme Court upon the ground that the Convention exceeded its authority . Commission government came in like a flood on Monday , when 23 third-class Pennsylvania cities , of from 5,000 to 100,000 inhabitants , assumed a modified form of it . Mayor and Council were supplanted by five commissioners , one of whom is elected as chief executive , the others as departmental heads . The Pennsylvania Constitution requires the Legislature to include all the cities of a class in any change in city government The way towards the present innovation was paved last year by a bill which reduced the councilmen of second-class cities to nine , of whom three should be elected on a general ticket . The need of some kind of reform , moreover , has been demonstrated in the recent mismanagement of funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that the old plan was inefficient . But considering the mixed results with which cities have voted on the commission form in other States , Pennsylvania may think herself lucky that under her la w she has not spent the autumn watching a determined majority drag a pro . testing minority into line The issue on which Mayor Shank of Indianapolis has resigned office is one that rises above the level of a picturesque career of the kind that delights the writer of newspaper squibs . Hitherto Mr. Shank has indulged in comparatively harmless pranks in which the friend of the people and the mountebank were sometimes indistinguishable . But when it comes to the Mayor of a city taking sides in a street-car strike to the point of announcing that he would not afford protection to traffic against violence on the part of the strikers , thesituation has nothing of the picturesque in it . If the head of a municipality deliberately fails in the first duty of any chief of government , to preserve public order and afford protection to the citizen , he must step out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . While John P. White , president of the United Mine Workers of America , and other officers of that association are on trial in West Virginia , indictments have been found against them by a Federal grand jury in Colorado . They are charged in the Colorado indictments either with attempted monopoly or with conspiracy in restraint of interstate commerce ; and the West Virginia indictments , found several months ago , were likewise for offences against the Anti-Trust law . This has a special interest owing to the concern with which President Wilson 's action in signing the Sundry Civil Appropriation bill , in spite of its peculiar rider concerning labor unions and farmers ' associations , was so widely regarded . Whether these actions against labor-union heads were instituted by the respective local United States District Attorneys with or without consultation with the Department of Justice at Washington , their prosecution is calculated to set at rest any doubts that may have been entertained as to the President 's purpose strictly to live up to the declaration he made in signing the Sundry Civil bill . Comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute of Arts and Letters at Chicago would indicate that we are not yet prepared for an academy of " immortals . " But every recurrent December makes it plain that in one field there is , indeed , pressing need for some recognized authority to lay down rules and award honors . The present methods of picking an All-American eleven are arbitrary , uncodified , and productive of much geographical and academic heartburning . The West has long chafed under the arrogance of Eastern exclusiveness , and has gone in for an All-Transalieghanian eleven of its own . Even within the restricted area of the Atlantic seaboard the Thomas Aquinases of football have been having a dreadful time . They are swamped by the wealth of material . They have resorted to the expedient of picking first , second , and third All-American teams , substitute teams , defence teams , and attacking teams , and in many other ways have shown that their courage is not equal to their enormous fast . The time for one-man autnority in this important sphere has gone . We need a National Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the champion eleven and bestow honors in drop-kicking , punting , tackling , and backing the line . We look to see the idea , incorporated in the 1916 Bull Moose platform . Not often does one find in the day 's news a more pleasing item than that which came from Philadelphia on Tuesday in regard to the Glenriddell manuscripts of Burns . Here is a rare case of " all 's well that ends well " ; the conclusion of the affair is as delightful as its beginning was unpleasant . The sale of the precious relics by the Liverpool Athenum was  --  in our opinion justly  --  regarded as something very like a breach of trust on the part of the directors of that institution ; and , apart from this aspect of the matter , Scotchmen , and lovers of Burns generally , were indignant that the books , if they left their old repository , should go to a private individual across the Atlantic wrap happened to covet them and %I as able to pay for them . Now it turns out that they have fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchaser , announced at the dinner of the St. Andrew 's Society at Philadelphia that he was arranging to restore them to the land of their birth . Few such restorations have been received with such a thrill of genuine pleasure and gratitude as will greet Mr. Gribbel 's announcement , frae Maidenkirk to Johnie Groat 's . The story of the construction of the cathedral on Morningside Heights in this city bids fair to fall in with the tradition of church-building in Europe . We have the comparatively leisurely pace at which the work is carried on ; not quite so deliberate as Cologne or Milan , to be sure , but sober enough for our electric age . It must be close to twenty Years since ground was broken on Morningside Drive , and we are still far from the completed structure . Traditional , too , is the change in architect and plans during the course of the work . In medieval Europe such changes were inevitable as one generation of constructors succeeded another and put its own ideas and personality into the fabric . Perhaps it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hesitations , and the changes of mind of men as well as their aspirations and their faith . Rather novel is the decision of the trustees to submit the alternative plans for the completion of the cathedral to the adjudication of the public ; but the idea is not entirely new . On a small scale it has been followed in France , where statues and memorials have sometimes been set up on probation . Newspaper men have no reason to complain of the way they are treated by college professors . There are still plenty of academics to whom " newspaper English " is a synonym for slovenliness , prolixity , and violence ; and it would be too much to expect that the " highbrow " element should surrender without a struggle . On the other hand , the number of college instructors in English who are setting up the newspaper ideal for their students is growing mightily . What more could the reporter ask than this tribute from a member of the Iowa State College faculty ? With all its faults I still believe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for presenting informatiOh through the written word . It has been hammered out in the heat and stress of newspaper Work to meet the demands of millions for something to compel their attention , interest them , and give them information in the quickest , clearest way . . . . The news sense , the ability to see what is new , and its new meaning to the great world of humanity , is necessary to men in every field of endeavor , but especially to men who write . Newspaper English at its best has the qualities that its enthusiastic admirers claim for it  --  vigor , concreteness , directness , and that demand on the attention which comes from dealing with the living facts of a vital , contemporary world . Yet this is no more than to say that a stirring message usually compels fit expression . But newspapers are not always delivering vital messages ; yet they are bound to go on the assumption that every day is Armageddon . Then one gets newspaper English at its worst . Let a battle be fought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the issue , and the reporter will rise to his opportunity . But when no battles are fought , when no crises are reaching their climax , what comes out from Mexico ? Columns upon columns of vague conjecture , if not worse ; of irrelevant facts ; of rumors magnified and multiplied , and all this vague matter diluted with repetition , prolixity , tautology , pleonasm , and all the other ills against which the rhetoric textbooks warn us . Sir Wilfrid Laurier ' s espousal at Hamilton of free food as a campaign issue has been long foreshadowed , and is shrewdly calculated to appeal to both the St. Lawrence and the prairie provinces . That it does so on different and slightly contradictory grounds will probably be lost sight of in a general glorification of the principle of low tariff rates . To Manitoba and Saskatchewan Sir Wilfrid can promise that a free-wheat measure , operating through the reciprocity agreement with the United States , will throw open the great American market to Canadian growers . Just how this access to a new and higher market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not easy to see . But it would at least equalize prices , and might destroy the growing monopoly of the Canadian Pacific in wheat shipments , which has been a main factor in the high cost of food stuffs in the East . In the fact that since the passage of the Underwood tariff Canadian meats and dairy products have risen greatly , and are actually sold for less across the border than at home , the Liberals have a powerful appeal for demolishing the tariff wall . Nor is their stand unpatriotic , for they contemplate new preferential rates to England in woollen and cotton fabrics , of no less advantage to Manchester and Birmingham than to their own consumers . But in essence a victory for the Laurier platform will virtually accomplish what the Reciprocity bill of 1911 attempted . French railways , too , have need ot " safety first " provisions , even if their lack of them does not result so disastrously as does ours . There is a familiar ring about the report upon the recent Melun wreck : " The engine-driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for steel carriages , it may be doubted if France has so much as heard of them . Yet the schedules are not slow There is one train on the Northern Railway that has a run of a hundred miles in a hundred minutes , and makes it . The locomotives used on the French railways are more complicated than ours , and hence require closer attention from the driver , who is accordingly left with too little time to watch the track . Here are exemplified our own favorite faults of speed and economy , for it is the super-heaters and the steam-saving devices that have done much to make the engine engross the driver 's mind . Suggestions are not wanting for meeting the dangers created or increased by this more rapid travel . In addition to the block system of signals now in use , audible signals for the engineer 's benefit are sought for . It is interesting to note , however , that the French railway managers do not seem greatly disturbed over the imperfections of such audible signals as are already employed , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vigilance of the driver and thus renders him less of a man and more of an automaton . Ex-Chancellor von Bulow 's warning to his countrymen against French designs upon Alsace-Lorraine finds pertinent comment in the outbreak of something like open warfare between the inhabitants of Zabern , in Alsace , and the German garrison . If anything is likely to nurture the spirit of revanche in the hearts of the French people it is precisely such extraordinary exhibitions of militarist arrogance as have brought on the disorders at Zabern and have aroused resentment in the Reichstag , a body which , in spite of its large Socialist membership , is not inclined to be any too harsh on the Fatherland 's army . The spirit of toleration in dealing with a conquered people which the case of Great Britain has shown again and again to be the safest means of fostering loyalty , still seems foreign to German methods of government Arbitrary oppression of citizens by the military does more to foster the anti-German feeling in the conquered provinces than all the fulminations of Preach patriots . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot-heads across the frontier will make good use of it .
