txt Concerning that Inventors ' fund proposition I submitted some time ago to THE TunEs I am glad to see in Friday 's issue that Mr. Ernest Winne , with his proposed Inventors ' Institute , is putting the matter Into workable shape anti that before long It will take such form that millionaire philanthropists will see M it a prefi tat ie investment for their surplus money . It is not necessary for me to suggest that having seen that ft Is profitable they go farther and put their money into it . They are business men . As to the communication of " W. E. " concerning my poetry and his noble offer to help a needy poet , let EV3 say to him gratefully , that if he will find a publisher I will furnish the material and he will be given an opportunity to lavish half a dollar for a copy . I love to help those who want to help me . Failing to find a publisher , I may say to him that my first and only book of poesy is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 047 Eighth Avenue , which he can purchase for two half dollars , and It is a bargain , for soon It will be a " rare booa , " and rare books command fatulous prices  --  sometimes .
