txt Merciless denunciation of President Taft was Col. Roosevelt 's reply to-night to the President 's attack upon him yesterday . Some of Col. Roosevelt 's assertions were : That while President Taft has given the people of the country a " square deal , " he had , owing to a " quality of feebleness , yielded to the bosses and the great privileged interests . " That one part of the President 's attack upon him , referring to popular representation , was " the crookedest kind of a deal " and " deliberate misrepresentation . " That the President in the Harvester Trust case " has not merely in thought , word , and deed been disloyal to our past friendship , but has been disloyal to every canon of ordinary decency and fair dealing such as should obtain even in dealing with a man 's bitterest opponents . " That the President 's statement regarding the Influence of Federal office holders in the campaign was " not only an untruth , but it is an absurd untruth . " That Mr. Taft convicted himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That in speaking of Col. Roosevelt 's position in regard to the trust problem President Taft is himself guilty of a " crooked deal . " Col. Roosevelt took up President Taft 's attack upon him point by point , flaying the President in one scathing sentence after another . The Colonel quoted from a letter by Mr. Taft thanking him for his help in the Presidential contest of 11:10 . S. Then he said : " It is a bad trait to bite the hand that feeds you . " When Col. Roosevelt reached Worcester at the beginning of his trip through Massachusetts he found the streets near the station thronged . With . a band and a torchlight procession as escort , he was taken to Mechanics ' Hall , where he delivered his main speech . Several thousand Persons were unable to gain admission . Later Col. Roosevelt addressed an overflow meeting in Salem Square . Both audiences receives him enthusiastically . The Issues at Stake . Col. Roosevelt 's speech in part follows : " In this campaign I regard the issue at stake as altogether too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personalities between President Taft and myself . But Mr. Taft 's speeches yesterday contained statements that I must answer . Most of what he said needs no comment from me . When , for instance , he said that I have endeavored to minimize the importance of my Columbus speech he says what he must know to be untrue ; he can not have read my Carnegie Hall speech , my speech before the Massachusetts Lower House ; my noonday speech at St Louis , my Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and Louisville speeches , without knowing that I have elaborated and emphasized what I said at Columbus . " Again , when Mr. , Tait in any speech speaks of me directly or obliquely as a neurotic or a demagogue , or in similar terms . I shall say nothing , except to point out that if he is obliged to use such language he had better preserve his own self-respect by not protesting that it gives him pain to do so . No man resorts to epithets like these if it really gives him path to use them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these . " I rave not quoted his private letters or private communications . I have discussed exclusively his public actions . Even where I was obliged to be severe , I was always parliamentary and never hypocritical . Nor do I intend to-day to deviate from this standard , although the President 's speech makes it necessary for me to speak more plainly on certain subjects than I have yet spoken . " Col. Roosevelt referred to President Taft 's explanation of his statement that " ours is a Government of all the people by a representative . part of the people . " " For him to try , " said Col. Roosevelt , " to escape the-consequences of his statements by saying that he alluded only to women and children is trifling with the Intelligence of the people . To speak of such action on his part as a square deal ' is itself the crookedest kind of deal . He is trying to dodge the consequences of his statement by deliberate misrepresentation of that statement . " Tells What a Boss Is . Col. Roosevelt defined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between crooked politics and crooked business which has been responsible for nine-tenths of the corruption in American political life . " " If there is any such man among my supporters , " he continued , " I do ' not know him . Mr. Taft says that Mr. Flinn of Pittsburgh is a very bad boss . There is an element of grim comedy in Mr. Taft weeping over the thought of Pennsylvania being put under the rule of a boss through Mr. Penrose being ousted from control of the party organization . " Col. Roosevelt said Mr. Flinn had told him he was supporting him because he believed the former President was the only leader in public life who was earnestly and in practical fashion working for greater justice in matters industrial . The bosses , Col. Roosevelt declared , were on the President 's side " Mr. Taft says , " Col. Roosevelt continued . " that in my various campaigns I accepted the assistance of these bosses . So I did when they chose to go my way and to support the cause of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance at the price of going their way , and opposing the cause of the people . " Mr. Taft said yesterday that never in thought , word , or deed had he been disloyal in his friendship for me . It is hard for me to answer such a statement , save by calling it the grossest and most astounding hypocrisy . " When Mr. Taft made that statement he had just sent in to the United States Senate , on half an hour 's notice . obviously in collusion with the Lorimer Democratic Senator who made the request , papers which were intended to convey the impression that I had improperly favored the Harvester Trust by declining to prosecute it in 1907. - Col. Roosevelt repeated the asSertion that Mr. Taft . as a member of his Cabinet , had approved the decision to delay the Harvester Company suit . Taft Disloyal , He Says .

Such conduct represents the very crookedest kind of a crooked deal , and when Mr. Taft , within iwenty=feur hours Of taking it . complains that he has not // COLONEL SAYS TAFT IS THE DISLOYAL ONE // b6en given a - square deal by me , he weposes himself to derision and contempt . " This is not an exceptional instance of how he has behaved to me . The same course was followed last Summer in connection with the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company . The assaults upon me by Mr. Taft 's campaign manager. , , , made in Washington under Mr. Taft 's very eyes , have been foul to the verge . of indecency . Put . remember , I am not complaining of these things ; I care nothing for Mr. Taft 's personal attitude toward me . I allude to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such emphasis on the matter . " Defends Reciprocity Views . The speaker then turned to the subject of reciprocity . " Mr. Taft says that I changed front on the reciprocity measure , " he began . " This is untrue . He publishes a letter of mine , in answer to a letter of his marked Confidential . ' Incidentally , one of the unpardonable sins on the part of any man calling himself a gentleman is to publish confidential correspondence without permission : as to this I care nothing , but I warn Mr. Taft that in discussing negotiations with a foreign power it is well not to publish such expressions as that in his letter about making Canada only an adjunct of the United States . " In this letter I told him that I would support his reciprocity proposition . I did loyally support it , in several different speeches . At first I took the agreement on the faith of Mr. Taft 's representation . " Later , when I came to look up the Matter , however , I became convinced that the reciprocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because It improperly sacrificed tile interests of our farmers and fishermen , and because it carried indefensible action on paper . Nevertheless , because I had stated that I would support the treaty , I said not one word against it until it was dead . Even then I declined to speak on the subject until in several States Mr. Taft 's managers themselves , with what I can only characterize as unpardonable baseness , began to circulate the fact of my support of Mr. Taft 's proposal as a reason why I should not be nominated . Assails Abuse of Patronage . " Mr. Taft says , ? ' Col. Roosevelt continued , ' ? that the influence of . Federal officeholders in the Chicago Convention this year will be less effective for any one candidate than ever before in the history of the party . This is not only an untruth , hut it is an absurd untruth . Never in thirty years close observation have I seen such scandalous abuse of the patronage as this year . " Some of the abuse of pa tronage has been done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the various North Carolina nominations . Moreover , does Mr. Taft think that the people have forgotten the letter his secretary sent out as to restoring to the insurgent Senators the Patronage of which he . had deprived them ? Having all these facts in view , It is simply astounding that Mr. Taft should venture the assertion that he has not used the Federal patronage to defraud politics . " Mr. Taft states that I advised him to have a meeting with Cannon . I advised him to meet every one , to consult with every one , to try to get on with every one . But no less emphatically I advised him to follow my example , to consult freely with all the politicians , and to try to get on with them , but where the politicians split off iron/ the people then to stand with the people and not with the politicians : and it is precisely this that he failed to do . Charges Tariff Insincerity . " It is a most curious thing that Mr. ' raft should actually criticise me for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact I have eagerly endeavored to praise Mr. Taft wherever 1 possibly could , and where possible I have merely kept silence where I disagreed . As he now , insists that I should break silence about that tariff law I will say that I hold him culpably responsible for having fed the people to believe that Ile favored a substanclal downward revision , and that - he would work actively for it , and for then having sat supinely by and allowed his new friends , under the leadership of Messrs . Aldrich and Cannon , to produce a bill Which made him convict himself or insincerity when he signed it . " When Mr. Taft speaks of the trusts ' he is guilty of a deliberate misstatement of a great vital fact . He says I propose to abolish the anti-trust law . I never made any such proposal and this he well knows . When he thus deliberately misstates my position he Is himself guilty of a crooked deal . " Turning to President Taft 's statements in regard to a third term , Col. Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive terms , which might afford opportunity for the Executive to intrench himself in power . quotes Prom Taft Letter . " Mr. Taft , without my permission , " he continued , " has quoted entire letters from me written in answer to letters of his which were marked ' confidential . ' I shall so far avail myself of his example as to quote four lines of a letter from him to me which was not marked ' Confidential . ' It was written shortly after he became President . it runs : I can never forget that the power I now exercise was voluntarily transferred from you to me , and that I am tinder obligation to you to see that your judgment in selecting me as your successor and bringing about the succession shall be vindicated according to the standards which you and I in conversation have always formulated . " IL is a bad trait to bite the hand that feeds you . No other man in this country was as much interested as I was in having Mr. Taft succeed . No other , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and so bitterly regretted being unable to support him . I eagerly sought every opportunity to stand by him , and long after I felt deep in my heart that he was unfit to lead this people , I refused to acknowledge the fact to myself and struggled to convince myself that he was fit and clutched at every opportunity to back him up . Until less than a year ago I kept desperately hoping that either Mr. Taft himself would at least show himself reaI sonably fit for the task before him or that / if he failed some one else would arise to whom the people could ' turn . Reluctantly I made up my mind that Mr. Taft could r not do the task , and I became convinced that the people of the great West felt that I would be untrue to them if I refused to act as their standard bearer . " I do not think that Mr. Taft means ' ill ; I think he means well . But he means well feebly , and during his Administration he has been under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is this quality of feebleness in a normally amiable man which pre-eminently fits such a man for use in high office by the powers of evil .
