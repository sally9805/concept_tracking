" I can think of several reasons why I might vote against Wilson , " said a puzzled Independent the other day , " but I ca n't think of one why I should vote for Hughes . " This puts compactly the extraordinary nature of the present Presidential campaign . The voters are without the alternatives usually contemplated in a change of party control of the Government . The two-party theory is , and ordinarily the facts roughly correspond to it , that the things you object to in one party will be gone against by the other . There is seldom , to be sure , a clear-cut distinction in the whole line of party doctrine or of party personnel . It has often been true since Dr. Johnson 's day , as it was in his , that you have to think of a political party as a faggot , and content yourself with choosing the one in which there is the smallest number of rotten sticks . But we doubt if Americans who swear by no party ever before had to confront such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This fact has been the great weakness of Mr. Hughes 's campaign , and it has been the more glaring as his speeches and the days have slipped by . Many have disliked Mr. Wilson 's foreign Policy , for one reason or another . But have they a clearly different or more satisfactory policy offered them by his opponent ? After a careful reading of all of Mr. Hughes 's vehement speeches against the President 's conduct of foreign affairs , we can come to only one conclusion : his aims would have been the same as Mr. Wilson 's ; he would have reached the same goal ; only he would have used slightly different methods . There is no real alternative here . Mr. Hughes repudiates with emotion the intimation that he would have led the country into war . The legal and moral bases of the President 's action he virtually accepts as his own . He is compelled to do so . He admits , for instance , that Americans going to Mexico are subject to the law of Mexico . But somehow , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hughes would have prevented everything unpleasant that has occurred under Mr. Wilson 's Administration , and kept all the good results . At those results he would simply have arrived by another path . In all this , we submit , there is , in lawyer 's phrase , no true joining of issues . The unattached voter , troubled by Mr. Wilson , gets no real alternative in Mr. Hughes . In domestic matters the same lack appears . Are any large body of citizens still disquieted by the surrenders of President Wilson tothe demands of the militarists ? What relief does Mr. Hughes propose ? None whatever . He would outstrip all that Mr. Wilson has done in that direction . In the whole affair of " preparedness " and building up the nation 's military might , his little finger would be thicker than Mr. Wilson 's loins . Conscientious pacifists may be repelled by Mr. Wilson , but they can not possibly be attracted by Mr. Hughes . Or , take the other question , on which Mr. Wilson has disturbed so many of his former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective features in the tariff . We may speak of this as a huge inconsistency on his part , but if it is high protection which we wish to cast our influence against , there is no hope for us in Hughes . He has talked up a protective tariff in the blindest and crudest sort of way . It would be a topsy-turvy proceeding for any low-tariff man to vote against Wilson to punish him for assenting to a Tariff Commission , and give aid and comfort to a party that would , if it had the power , wallow in the mire of high protection again . Here , too , the dissatisfied voter is robbed of a party alternative . But is there not one undeniable difference between President Wilson and Mr. Hughes ? The latter strove to make one out in his prefilection statement on Monday . His words are as follows : My conception of the Presidency Qlffers absolutely from that of Mr. Wilson . I look upon the President as the administrative head of the Government . He looks upon the President as primarily the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two things are to be said . Mr. Hughes did not at all display that " conception " of the function of an Executive when he was Governor of New York . Then he was as truly an initiator of legislation as Mr. Wilson . He went to Albany for his first term with a draft of the Public Service Commission law in his pocket . It was his measure , so understood to be from the beginning , and enacted by means of his direct personal and official influence . Much the same could be said of his bill for direct primaries , for his public campaign in order to compel the Legislature to repeal the law permitting gambling at race tracks . As Governor , Mr. Hughes did not for a day relapse into the attitude of a mere public functionary , a do-nothing king . He threw himself heart and soul into the whole public work of the State . And what he did at Albany there is every reason to believe that he would do at Washington . He can not have suffered such a sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , if he desired to render the Presidency merely an office for the making of appointments and the signing of bills , he could not . The country has moved on since Buchanan . The stamp which Roosevelt and Wilson have left upon the Presidency can not be obliterated . The President will now have to be national leader , whether he wants to be or not . He will be obliged to have much to do with legislation , whether he likes doing it or not . So that in this aspect of the contest , too , a well-defined distinction between Wilson and Hughes can not be made out . And all along the line , the voters in doubt about supporting Wilson find no satisfaction in the thought of turning to Hughes . THE " FLAG OF TRUCE . " William Allen White , of Kansas , has not taken an active part in this campaign . Till now he has been content to make jokes about it , to remark humorously upon its various developments , to indulge in witticisms at the expense of the candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has resumed his favorite role of blurting out the truth . After a long conference the other day with Mr. Roosevelt at Denver , he delivered himself with great frankness in the Emporia Gazette . His long article he headed " Roosevelt 's Flag of Truce . " The whole argument of it is that there has been and can be no real union between the Progressives and the Republican party ; that the old " irrepressible conflict " exists ; and only a truce has been declared in order to give the Republicans an opportunity to make a complete surrender . Here are Mr. White 's explicit words : They the ProgressIves1 are voting for Hughes , many of them , in the sincere belief that he will wreck and utterly destroy the Republican panty of 1912 by discrediting its leadership and discarding its conservatism . Upon no other basis would they vote for any Republican candidate . Great comfort is got by Mr. White out of the fact that at Denver Mr. Roosevelt actually quoted a couple of planks from the Progressive platform of 1912 . They related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to the inference that , in the act , the Colonel intended to " nail the Republican candidate for the Presidency to the Progressive platform of 1912 . " Hence the Denver speech , affirms William Allen White , is Mr. Roosevelt 's " alibi . " You may think that you know where lie is , but he is really " elsewhere . " He is still a Progressive . His desertion of Social Justice is only temporary . After Hughes is elected , or , horrible thought ? though it may not be so horrible to the Colonel , after all  --  defeated , he will be the same Progressive that he suddenly ceased to be . Meanwhile , " voting for Hughes does not reunite the Republican party . Every Progressive who votes for Hughes has the same reservation that evidently Col. Roosevelt has . " This will be mighty interesting reading to a good many Republicans . It can hardly be very pleasant reading for Mr. Hughes . His campaign has been conducted throughout on the theory that there is the most perfect union between Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All bygones are to be forgotten . In the presence of the common enemy the grand old party has healed all its divisions . But into this happy family now bursts the naughty boy from Kansas . Do n't fancy for a moment , he cries out , that we Progressives are embracing the Republicans because we love them or trust them . We are only waiting to see if they will knuckle under to us and , if they do n't , let them beware the spear that knows no brother ! If there is a certain defiance in all this , it must be admitted that there is also a lurking apology . Like many other Progressives , Mr. White is apparently a bit ashamed of the new banner under which they are asked to march , " Anything to Beat Wilson . " The betrayal of the Progressives at Chicago by their leader , with his subsequent mad rush to " tear Wilson to pieces , " must have left a feeling of shame in many a Progressive heart . And Mr. White , after communing with Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Progressives have not surrendered ; they are going to call upon the Republicans to surrender . During the momentary truce a semblance of harmony has to be kept up , but only wait and see how the Progressives will fly at the throats of their present allies as soon as the chance comes ! This may be an ingenious way of appealing to the old militant spirit of the Western Progressives , but it must throw a chill into complacent Republicans . And it is a bold attempt to shatter Mr. Hughes 's assumption that all is forgotten and forgiven . Mr. William Allen White may save his own soul by this utterance of his , but where does it leave his idolized Colonel ? If what Mr. White , speaking almost in Mr. Roosevelt 's name , says , is true , the pretended union of Republicans and Progressives , is a conscious fraud . An English political party was once denounced as " organized hypocrisy . " But we have a case here of disorganized hypocrisy , if this Progressive spokesman is correct . The boasted reunion is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrust each other , ana are only waiting for the day when they may again get their daggers out . So much we learn from the Kansas enfant terrible . One conclusion from what he says is irresistible . It is that Mr. Hughes missed another opportunity for bold and constructive and appealing leadership . He might have stepped forward as one who hoped to rejuvenate , as well as reunite , his party ; to make it forward-looking ; to give it fresh issues and new goals ; to declare that it would be made the effective instrument for accomplishing what the sincere and self-sacrificing Progressives had prayed for and labored to bring about . But he took the other line . His preferred plan of campaign was to sit tight and to sing low of all being now Republican grace , mercy , and peace . And the Emporia bombshell now explodes to prove that he has been crying peace when there was no peace . HOW THE OTHER HALF THINKS . " If you want to pay twenty dollars a barrel for flour , vote for Wilson " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently perfectly sincere man was overheard saying to a little group of more or less serious thinkers in a country hotel In Connecticut . How fully he may have developed the argument the witness is unable to say ; but from the hearty response visible in the faces of his auditors it was plain that any elaboration of the reasoning was unnecessary . Flour is in the neighborhood of ten dollars a barrel under Wilson , whereas it was four or five under Taft and Roosevelt  --  and do we not all know that a word to the wise is sufficient ? If , however , anything more were needed , the figures of the market furnish it in abundance . On Tuesday of last week " Flour , Minn. , pat. , " was quoted as $9.20 , and $5.50 on June 23 , 1916 . This is an advance of 67 per cent . in four months , which percentage of increase , if continued , will bring the price to twenty dollars a barrel very soon after the inauguration of the next President . And if that President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price will go to that level , or even higher ? If we want to continue to eat the white bread that we love , we must put in a Republican President , who will put prices down by the enactment of a good stiff old-fashioned tariff . But on the other hand , look at the way business is booming , factories are workingovertime , the job seeking the man instead of the man seeking the job . Why , right in the city of New York a sub-committee of the Board of Estimate has recommended the discontinuance of the city 's Employment Bureau on the ground that there is no difficulty about getting employment , and the persons who want the Bureau kept up have a hard time getting the public interested in the matter . Is it to be supposed for one moment that the working people of the United States are going to run the risk of falling back from this fine condition ? Not on your life ; work is abundant and wages high , and who knows what will happen if we make a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the abnormal character of present conditions , till they are black in the face , but what we know we know , and the rest is all guesswork . " The present moment is our own , the next we never saw " ; Wilson has given us prosperity , and he 's good enough for me . Besides , did n't he make Congress pass an Eight-Hour law for the railways , and wo n't he be sure to go ahead on the same line till we all get it ? Wilson for mine , A say , and let the logic-choppers chop away till they 're tired . An amusing  --  or , if you choose so to take it , a depressing  --  contribution to the campaign in its more childish aspects is furnished by the news that Mr. Henry Ford , as the result of " an inspiring talk " with the President , put all the women in his factories on the five-dollars-a-day minimum wage basis . This move , on the eve of election , is expected to swing an enormous number of Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an ardent Wilson man was known before ; that he can afford to give whatever largess this act implies to the women workers in his establishment out of the $60,000,000 annual profit that it is yielding , is equally obvious ; what else it means as regards the election it would be difficult for any one to say . Employers who are making from 6 to 20 per cent . profit on their investment can no more afford to follow , in this move , the example-of an employer whose profit is 3000 per cent . or thereabouts than they could afford to follow it in the original five-dollars-a-day move ; still less can any prediction be made of such possibilities in times less prosperous for American manufacturers than the present . Never mind . Mr. Ford is a good man , he is for Wilson , he is setting an example that other people ought to follow if they could ; is n't that a sufficient reason for reelecting the President ? How large a proportion of the voters of the United States are going to be swayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this degree of political profundity , we would not undertake to say . Whether it is one-half , or one-fourth , or three-fourths , however , makes little difference . In this country , and in every other , the body of citizens who rise hardly , if at all , above this level in their political thinking , is very great  --  so great that one might be inclined , in reflecting upon it , to take an utterly despondent view of the nature and prospects of democratic government . Nor can one 's gloom be dispelled by the thought that it is a new thing , or even that it is a character attaching to universal suffrage as distinguished from a more limited voting franchise . " Pickwick " was written three-quarters of a century ago , and when the franchise in England was the privilege of a very limited class ; yet the picture of the Eatanswill contest , with its mighty issues between the Buffs and the Blues , was quite as much a portrait as a caricature . Nevertheless , this despondency would be misplaced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is largely illusory , the common man is not such a fool as he seems . It is , in the main , the man who wants tie vote against Wilson that finds him responsible for the price of flour , and the man who wants to vote for him that gives him credit for the demand for labor . And , what is still more important , whatever " the other half " may be thinking , elections are decided , nine times out of ten , by that fraction to whom arguments really appeal . TO MAKE THE PEACE SECURE . During the past month or two there has been a great deal of talk about peace in high quarters in England as well as in Germany . But between the things that have been said in England and the things that have been said in Germany there is a sharp contrast in two essential respects . In the first place , what the German statesmen 's thoughts are centred upon . is the possibility of bringing the war to an end by coming to terms with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war out to the bitter end ; whereas the men at the head of affairs in England ? Asquith , Lloyd George , Grey  --  are absolutely unbending in their resolution to entertain no proposals of peace except such as would be predicated on the decisive defeat of Germany . And secondly , the German preoccupation is wholly with the queston of the ending of this war , and has no concern with the prevention of future wars except in so far as this may be implied in the demanding of terms of peace which shall leave Germany a mighty state , fully capable of defending itself against aggression ; whereas in utterance after utterance of the leading English statesmen the idea is put forward of establishing a new regime , under which , through some form of international cooperation , a repetition of the stupendous calamity that has befallen the world will be made impossible . Within little more than a fortnight , all three of the chief figures in the British Ministry have made statements showing how serious a place is occupied in their thoughts of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed at in the project of a League to Enforce Peace . In a speech made a few days ago before the Foreign Press Association , Viscount Grey referred to the fact that " not only President Wilson , but Mr. Hughes , is supporting a league started not with the object of interfering with the belligerents in this war , but which will do its part in making peace secure in the future , " and declared that this " is a work of neutral countries to which we should all look with favor and hope . " What the Foreign Secretary took occasion to say in connection with the position of the President and Mr. Hughes , he had said on his own account long ago . This fact was pointed out by Lloyd George in a recent debate in the House of Commons , in which he reminded a critic of the Government that Viscount Grey had publicly advocated the plan of an international combination to enforce peace before President Wilson had expressed himself on the subject . And in the course of the same debate Premier Asquith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanence of peace , yet referred in most impressive language to a goal that can hardly be attained in any other way . The tremendous sacrifices which the war has exacted have been given , he declared , in the firm belief that they " will purchase and surely hold in the years to come protection for the weak , the supremacy of right over force , and the free development under equal conditions , and each in accordance with its own genius , of all the states , great or small , that make up the family of civilized mankind . " Apart from the prospect that these utterances hold out of the actual inauguration of so momentous a plan for the promotion of the world 's welfare , the mere fact thatentered into millions of homes , may we expect that in Germany , no less than in England and France , the nation 's voice will be heard in one imperious and universal cry of Never Again ?
