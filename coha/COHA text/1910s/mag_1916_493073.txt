A Question of Quality Immigration in the Light of History : III IT might be easy for anyone to agree with the presentation of the subject as thus far developed , to admit that the immigration in the years preceding the Revolution proportionally equaled and even exceeded both in extent and variety that of our own day , and still to object that the all-important difference remained as to kind and quality . Perhaps the most frequent cry of the immigration alarmist relates to the changing character of our immigration in recent years . In the decade of 1880-1890 over 75 per cent of the incoming foreigners were from Germany , Scandinavia , and Great Britain , while only 17% per cent were from Italy , Austria , Russia , and Poland ; and this latter percentage was two or three times greater than for the ten years preceding . On the other hand , in 1907 these figures were almost reversed-76 per cent coming from the latter countries and less than 17 per cent from the former . In this connection President Lowell 's words are sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rearing eaglets from eagles ' eggs placed under a hen than from hens ' eggs placed in an eagle 's nest . " Without in any way minimiz'ng the seriousness of the situation , it should be remembered that the time has been as yet too short to reach any conclusion . It is the next and the second generation that will tell the story of the new type of immigrant . In the meanwhile , the reports from our public schools which have come to the writer 's notice are not unfavorable ? and the public school is one of the greatest factors in assimilating the rising generations . But the whole immigration question has taken on a new aspect since the publication by the Immigration Commission in 1910 of the results of the investigation carried on under the direction of Professor Franz Boas . In his report , " Changes in Bodily Form of Descendants of Immigrants , " are recorded results from the measurement of a few thousand cases of two radically different types ? the east European Hebrew and the Sicilian . The head form has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent race characteristics , and the above types were chosen because the one is a round-headed and the other a long-headed stock . The investigation shows such changes in the head form of children born in this country that the two stocks approach a uniform type , and the difference between the two stocks is // less than the difference between the children and parents of either stock . Although Mr. Boas would be the last to claim any final conclusions from the rather limited number of cases examined , it is impossible not to agree with his comment , " and we are compelled to conclude that when these features of the body change , the whole bodily and mental make-up of the immigrants may change . " In the face of these unexpected findings , the least that one can do is to suspend judgment . It looks , however , as if nothing were impossible in the way of absorption of European races ? of Europeans , because we seem to be no more ready ethnically for the Oriental than we are for the Negro . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase of the question appears different and in general more favorable . One is more ready then , for example , to admit the claim , presented so clearly by Professor Commons , that so far as the production of wealth is concerned , the immigrants since the Civil War have contributed enormously . Over four-fifths of the immigrants being " in the prime of life , between fourteen and forty-five years of age . . . their home countries have borne the expense of rearing them up to the industrial period of their lives , and then America , without that heavy expense , reaps whatever profits there are on the investment . " A little farther on in his " Races and Immigrants in America " Commons points out some of the unfavorable features , showing how the employers of labor have played one race against another . In the competitive struggle , " each race comes from a country lower in the scale than that of the preceding , until finally the ends of the earth have been ransacked in the search for low standards of living combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a striking similarity to this situation in the period before the Revolution . The greatest need of the country in the early days was for settlers and laborers . Some of the colonies held out inducements in the way of cheap or even free land , and bonuses were offered to individuals or companies who would promote immigration . Transportation and emigration companies resorted to methods of persuasion that were similar to , and relatively as effective as those of the present . Such methods inevitably result in procuring quantity rather than quality . Many excellent people were among the newcomers of the eighteenth century just as there are to-day , but the mass of them , as of practically every other large immigration , was of a lower social class . It is time that we got away from the tradition that the men who fought our war of independence and framed the present government of the United States were demigods whose servants even were of a superior class . Too many of the people who wanted to emigrate to America were so poor that they could not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they would pledge their services for a number of years on arrival in this country . This must have been profitable for the promoters , as shown by the extent to which it was engaged in , and from the fact that one reads of emigrants being trapped into , signing these service bonds where it was not necessary . This sort of advertisement in 1728 was not uncommon : Lately imported and to be sold cheap , a parcel of likely men and women servants . Or one might read such an item as this of 1729 : In New Castle government there arrived last year , says the Gazette , 4,50o persons , chiefly from Ireland ; and at Philadelphia , in one year , 267 English and Welsh , 43 Scotch ? all servants , 1,155 Irish , and 243 Palatines , of whom none were servants . The price of German servants about that time was said to have been ? ro apiece for five years of servitude . These were the redemptioners of whom one reads so frequently , and McMaster says : The advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiths , wheelwrights , shoemakers , and school teachers , stonecutters , bricklayers , tailors , hatters , harness makers ? men and women skilled in every sort of labor then needed in the country . When their terms had expired , these indentured servants might remain in their same situations on salary or wages , but the more enterprising and energetic of them would strike out for themselves . The most common practice was to take up new land . Jonathan Dickinson in a letter of about 1722 says : " Many who have come over under covenants for four years are now masters of great estates . " While settlers and laborers were wanted , it was possible for the supply to exceed the demand , and from some sections of Germany and Ireland the immigration became almost a stampede . No provisions had been made or could be made for any such numbers as we have seen were coming into this country . James Logan , Penn 's agent , complained in 1725 that there were " as many as one hundred thousand acres of land possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improve it without any right to it . " And he was at a loss how to dispossess them . As the best way out of the difficulty , the authorities in many of the colonies let the immigrants go , or sent them out , to the frontier where they could cultivate the wild lands and also serve as a buffer between their superiors and the Indians . They there served a useful purpose , but frontier life proved demoralizing . Deterioration was so rapid that we soon find charitable and missionary societies established in Europe for the support of religion and education , not among the Indians or even among the Negroes , but among these poor benighted whites in America . Such elements in the population would present serious problems , and that the question of control was not an easy one is evidenced by Kercheval : It was customary for the Dutch , on St. Patrick 's day , to exhibit the effigy of the saint , with a string of Irish potatoes around his neck , and his wife Sheeley , with her apron loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riot . The Irish resented the indignity offered to their saint and his holy spouse , and a battle followed . On St. Michael 's day the Irish would retort , and exhibit the saint with a rope of " sour krout " about his neck . Then the Dutch , like the Yankee , " felt chock full of fight , " and at it they went , pelf mell , and many a black eye , bloody nose , and broken head , was the result . Nor is this all of the story . Robert Proud in describing the people who were coming into Pennsylvania between 176o and 177o , after speaking of the Germans and Irish , said : There is another class of people , whose numbers here , in latter years , have annually so much increased as apparently to portend consequences no less dangerous and unhappy to the public good . . . . I mean such as flee from justice , in other countries , and convicts from Great Britain and Ireland ; who frequently find the way hither , after they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the honest part of the community . There is much food for thought in a simple statement by Crevecceur , almost in the nature of an aside : From whence the difference arises I know not , but out of twelve families of emigrants of each country , generally seven Scotch will succeed , nine German , and four Irish . . . . The Irish do not prosper so well ; they love to drink and to quarrel ; they are litigious , and soon take to the gun , which is the ruin of everything . While this is not to be taken as based upon statistics , it is important as a contemporary and probably a popular estimate , that only a little more than half of the immigrants succeeded . Immigration may have been an economic factor of value in hastening the settlement of the new country , and it may have furnished labor that was as valuable in production as it has proved to be since the Civil War , but socially and politically the immigrants were regarded as of an inferior class and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pudding is in the eating , and the best indication of the immigrants ' position is shown by the political treatment accorded them . Our fathers met the situation boldly and in a way that might excite the envy of many of the present day . This was not a democratic country and these newcomers were not allowed to have what we should call an equal or a fair share in the running of the governments of the various colonies . By limitations of one sort or another , and by various arbitrary restrictions , the control of affairs was kept in the hands of the old order . With increasing numbers , it was only a question of time before the newer elements should insist upon recognition and better treatment , and in the ten or fifteen years preceding the Revolution a domestic struggle was in progress resulting in bloodshed in several instances , and rivaling in its ultimate importance the struggle for independence from Great Britain . Eventually this proved to be the decisive factor in establishing our American principles of equal rights and of representation upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like an adequate idea of the pre-Revolution immigration it is necessary to take the importation of slaves into account . Ever since the census of 1790 when we have our first accurate figures , the Negro population has been increasing , but the percentage of Negroes to the total population has steadily decreased , and has fallen to less than II per cent in 1910 , none of which is the result of immigration . On the other hand , in the pre-Revolutionary period the Negroes were increasing both in numbers and proportions and by the time of the Revolution they amounted to i S or 20 per cent . The importations were said to have been from 10,00o to 20,000 a year . The Negro problem now is partly social , and that phase of it did not exist in the earlier times . The other aspects of it , however , that is of numbers , proportion , and economic value , although not necessarily recognized , were much more serious then than now . As the slaves were being so largely brought from abroad , they complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it would otherwise have been , and unquestionably lowering the quality of the population as a whole . It was with this in mind that Channing 's estimate of one-third of the population being foreign-born was accepted as a fair indication of the situation which the eighteenth century had to face .
