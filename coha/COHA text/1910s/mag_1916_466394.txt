THE chief difference between man and the lower animals lies in man 's capacity for sinning . Obviously he has no monopoly of the virtues . A dog may be faithful , an elephant may be kind and true , a cat is said to love - home and fireside ; the parental instincts of the penguin would put nine-tenths of the leaders of our best society to shame . It is not by possessing such attributes that animals become " almost human . " It would he fairer to our furred and feathered friends to say that the man who possesses these traits in fine degree is almost animal . There is a horse of vaudeville fame that reckons simple sums in addition , and answers a wide variety of questions , if my memory serves me ; I will even allow him to write his own first name with his hoof in the sand . The show-bills call him " human , " yet we feel no sense of kinship as we watch the performance , even though we should grant him all the ratiocination his exhibitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever horse ! " bestow a word of praise upon his trainer , and that is the whole story . I have seen a dog perform agile tricks with prompt obedience and obvious enjoyment , and to me he was still a dog . But when some canine friend bides on his wash-day ; when he steals the cat 's milk and pretends he did not ; when he slinks in at a dour with every expression of eye and limb crying " peccavi , " ah , then I say to myself , " There is something human about that dog . " In formulating this theory we must presume that a sin , to be a sin , creates a consciousness of violated moral law . A kitten after a canary or entangled in a skein of yarn retains an untroubled conscience ? if you will grant a con-science to a cat , even for purposes of argument . But a bronco which has devoted an hour to general devilment , putting her ears back and wearing an expression of confirmed viciousness , perhaps scraping her rider off against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her every act , and prove a definite consciousness of sins committed . There are many dogs that have awakened in me this sense of human kinship , and some horses , and elephants that one has read about . Cats or parrots have never done it , nor rabbits nor white mice . I have seen such animals trained to exhibit cleverness , but I never yet saw one exhibiting remorse . Not only parrots , but birds in general , I had always thought incapable of human foibles and failings . True , they are dainty and beautiful things , and one who does not enjoy them as neighbors , and desire to cherish and protect them , is not a very good citizen of this footstool . But a specific individual bird somehow never seemed to me to possess personality . Its mental or moral experiences seem quite remote from ours . This at least was my feeling ( if I had bothered to analyze it ) until a recent investigation into the alleged behavior of certain woodpeckers quite upset my attitude of mind . In the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books , particularly the statute books . Fish in Maine are of incredible weight , as proved by their own scales ; the marksmanship of Maine hunters is akin to that of Natty Bumpo ; and the prowess of Maine guides is to the prowess of all other woodsmen as x is to any mere known quantity . For these reasons I listened with placidity to the account of a coterie of depraved woodpeckers who were seen several times in advanced stages of intoxication . Yet in due time the circumstances of the story began to stir my curiosity . Two large white birch-trees , spared for the shade they gave , were standing quite alone in our camp 's central clearing . A dozen or more log-cabins in a semicircle rimmed this campus , all facing those two trees out in the open and overlooking the pond whose shores roughly completed the circle . One of these trees was dead when we first saw it , and as full of holes as a sieve , up and down its trunk . A year later we revisited the camp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its companion . " ' T was woodpeckers did it , " 1 was told . " They dug the first holes fer one reason or another . Then they come back later and found the sap that was standin ' in them holes had got hard . It seemed to hit ' em in the right spot . The whole crowd got tight . " " What ? " " Lit up ? spiflicated ? dead drunk . We could pick ' em off the tree with a noose at the end of a fishin ' - rod . " " Poor things ! " " Poor things nawthin ' They kep ' comin ' back fer more , and dug new holes till they killed the tree . " It was this first statement of the case that I heard with placidity . One hears so many careless assertions from time to time about the use of intoxicants in Maine . I referred to the yarn casually as I sat in one of the cabins that evening , partaking of crackers and ginger-ale . " Well , " said my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You saw them ? " " I held one in my hand . " It is annoying to feel oneself the butt of a concerted joke . Many tall stories from one friend are all in the day 's play . One tall story from several friends argues oneself an object of ridicule . Absent-mindedly I accepted a proffered clove and departed , ruminating . There approached in the dusk an elderly , serious-minded Boston business man , evidently seeking the oasis I had just left . I stopped him with the direct attack , " Did you ever see one of these woodpeckers around here drunk ? " " They are n't all woodpeckers ; there are yellow- bellied sapsuckers among VoL . CXXXII. ? No. 738. - 33 ' em , " he evaded , and hurried on toward the beckoning lights . The pursuit of trout for a day or two drove any thought of other researches from my unscientific mind . But a few mornings later , as we sat repairing our kits , a peculiar and resonant rattle broke the quiet of the place . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I followed his glance and saw a bird perched on the brass ball that topped the little flag-pole of our dining-cabin . He was busily tapping it with his beak . " Does he think there 's a worm in that ? " I asked ? " or juice or something ? " " Nast- ; he 's been there before . He ai n't a fool , by a long sight . " " Is he drunk ? " The guide regarded him solemnly . " No , he ai n't drunk ; he 's just disturbin ' us for the fun of it . " Not drunk , but disorderly ! I got up and watched him as he flew away . There was a certain pertness in his manner of flying . Obviously this was one of that band of roystering camp-followers , and I followed him with my eyes till he was lost to sight in the woods . " There 's something human about that bird , " I found myself saying . At a city dinner-table , after camping days were over , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As is often the case , the challenge of these skeptics made ' us advocates where before we had been neutral . " No , we did not see them intoxicated . We saw those who had seen them . We saw the trees full of holes . We saw the birds . Some of them even woke us in the morning tapping on our cabin roofs and drain-pipes . But this was not enough . Shame upon us for presenting such weak evidence ! Then and there I vowed to search for affidavits , experts , whatsoever those scoffers demanded to silence their scoffings . If I could not prove the case against my Maine woodpeckers , I would show up the depravity of the whole woodpecker tribe in general . First of all I resorted to an old friend , an eminent editor claiming some acquaintance with birds and beasts . " Your story is obviously improbable from the very start , " said he . " A woodpecker does not drink sap , nor does he drill a hole in a tree unless his instinct informs him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree was as full of holes as you say , it must have been so full of bugs or worms that it was dead before the woodpeckers attacked it . Therefore it could not have had any sap . " Meekly I called attention to the woodpecker who tried at regular intervals to make a hole in the brass ball on top of a flag-pole , and to those attacking a tin drain-pipe . My persistence produced nothing but irritation . Here was discouragement at the start , and yet somehow it failed to dose the question satisfactorily . There was a final recourse . I would write letters of inquiry to the most eminent experts . My first reply added such a weight of discouragement that I deeply regretted the other letters already sent on their absurd mission . ZOOLOGICAL PARS , NEW YORK . " I never heard of such an occurrence as was described to you in Maine . The information that was given you is certainly remarkable ? to say the least . / would not venture to publish anything of the kind unless I saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would not doubt the evidence of my own eyes ! " My disbelief is based on the ground that one or two , or even half a dozen holes such as a woodpecker could drill in a green tree could not possibly kill the tree . The sapsuckers do kill apple-trees by drilling an immense number of holes in rings , completely around the trunk , and extending upward and downward for several feet . These holes , however , are exceedingly small ? no larger than a slate-pencil ? and as fast as a hole is dug and the sap extracted from it , another hole is bored in order to produce a fresh supply . " I do not know of any tree in the North which produces any poisonous sap that would stupefy creatures as well organized and vigorous as woodpeckers . I advise you to regard the alleged observations as not proven ! Sincerely yours , " WILLIAM T. HORNA ? AY . " Although now convinced of the absurdity of my story in its main features , certain details seemed to be left in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate , so I gathered up its fragments and laid them out in the following reply to Mr. Hornaday : " Thank you very much for your prompt and definite letter . I should not bother you with further correspondence on this subject if it were not for the fact that you denied the only part of the woodpecker story which I know to be true . You say your disbelief is based on the ground that one , or two , or even half a dozen holes such as a woodpecker could drill in a green tree could not possibly kill the tree . There were two trees left in the clearing . I have been up there twice . The first time I went there one tree was dead , and as full of holes from top to bottom as a sieve . Let us assume that each was a dead tree in the first place , despite the statements of the campers there . The only tree that was perfectly good on my first visit I found on my second to be dying , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches . In order to be thoroughly conservative , I will say that I have seen as many as twenty woodpeckers flying around there at one time . There is my data on which I would give oath . As to whether those disreputable birds killed the first tree , and had an orgy when they did it , and as to whether they alone are the cause of the dying condition of the second , I can ofFer only hearsay . " The story disturbs my mind considerably . I hate to tell it , because if I am to get the credit of being a liar I should like to fix up a real , thorough , complete and artistic lie that is all my own ; this one I can not claim , and part of it is apparently the truth . What am I going to do about it ? " This letter brought the following re-ply : " Your last letter is a puzzler , and I pass ! I think you will be eminently justified in writing up the whole matter exactly as you saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people whom you believe to be careful observers , and also truthful . It seems quite apparent from the great number of holes that were drilled into those trees , that the birds really did kill the trees ? a most unusual thing to happen in this part of the world , though common enough in California by a different procedure . It will be interesting to your readers to know the species of the trees that were killed , and any other details bearing upon the sub- , ject . . . " Of course you will not fail to mention the species of woodpeckers that were connected with the episode you are going to describe , because that is quite important . Weigh carefully every observation reported to you by other persons , and if you can give the names of your informants it will be well to do so . This will throw the burden of proof of any statements of theirs that may be doubtful upon them , and not upon you . " But by all means write your story and publish it . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I can promise that at least one man in this part of the Bronx will read every word that you write . " Here was new incentive . Perhaps these inquiries might result in a contribution to science that would group my name with that of Audubon . But hard upon the heels of that friendly and stimulating letter came a confusion of replies that left me perplexed , my mind bruised by words that I could not pronounce , some of them at least sixteen letters long . Among them , however , were some wholly within my comprehension , and these I quote . Fur assuredly it is never wise or even safe to set down words one does not understand , though one should hedge them by a veritable bristle of quotation-marks . " The story of woodpeckers getting drunk on fermented sap is an absurd fable . They drink the fresh sap . " Yours truly , " ERNEST THOMPSON SETON . " " Replying to yours of the 5th , I have never witnessed a scene such as you describe . The red-bellied woodpeckers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the soft inner hark , the cambium layer , but I have never known them to kill a tree . Both birds and insects might get drunk on the fermented sap . " Very truly yours , " JOHN BURROUGHS . " JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY , " I am pretty familiar with the woodpecker , and I doubt if they are responsible for the foul work of which they are accused . So far as I know , a woodpecker never drives holes in a tree until a worm or insect has previously bored in . Whether the holes he drives are hard on the trees is another matter . I am inclined to think that it is better to have the worms and insects out , because the wound will heal . In my judgment trees would have died anyway . " Now as to the lack of sobriety ? I do not doubt that fermentation often takes place and that some of the birds , in search for food which had entered the old holes , might have taken too much of the fermented products . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berries in the South . " With regrets that I can not give you more exact information , I am " Sincerely yours , " JOHN B. WATSON . " DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE , WASHINGTON . D. C. " In response to your request of July ith , I take pleasure in forwarding a copy of Biological Survey Bulletin , No , 37 . " I think there can be no doubt as to the fact that occasionally woodpeckers destroy trees of considerable size , though naturally the principal damage they do is to young and rather small trees on which an equal amount of damage is , relative to the size of the tree , much greater . " There is not the slightest doubt as to the sapsucker habitually drinking sap . Other species have been known to do the same thing , though not habitually . Very truly yours , " H. W. HENSHAW . " " I have just returned from the camp after a very pleasant stay of nearly five weeks . I regret I am unable to add anything of import to the controversy regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large birch-trees about the camp have been removed except one . The ones removed did not show that they had been untimely cut off by the acts of the birds , as they were very large and fully matured . The downy woodpeckers were at work on the remaining one , feeding on the inner bark . And my judgment is that they were not helping to prolong the life of the tree , as the scars they left were quite extensive . I only noticed two yellow-bellied sapsuckers about the camp ; and , as there were no trees near to feed on , their behavior was quite proper . I am unable to pass an opinion as to what it might have been if they had had an opportunity to get full . " However , I hope there is some one who can settle this momentous question for all time . . . . " Yours truly , " R. T. GREENE . " WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY . " I have never found or seen an intoxi-cated woodpecker , though I have heard the story that they occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favorite trees . Before expressing or even entertaining an opinion on the probability of such an occurrence , I should wish to know the proportion of sugar in the sap of , say , the birch or the apple , if that tree also were in question . This I do not know , but doubt if sugar is present in sufficient quantity to produce the result described , and of course there could be no alcohol without sugar . There is another point : the woodpecker makes the holes on a vertical limb , and the sap flows nut ; this sap is of course fresh and unfermented , and could accordingly produce no such untoward result ; the woodpecker goes away , but later returns and finds fermented sap , drinks , and falls down stupefied ; that , I believe , is the idea . But , as you will see , this explanation is vulnerable at more than one point ; a liquid can not concentrate in a vertically placed hole , but will ooze out by capillary attraction as well as by gravity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tend to keep the sap fresh in the hole made by the woodpecker , and where he is supposed to get his grog . So you see that such general considera-tions are nut very favorable to the idea . Further , I am not at all sure that overripe fruits , when hanging to the bush or tree , undergo alcoholic fermentation ; they certainly do not unless their skin is broken by force or decay ; the general tendency is to shrink by drying , leading to a concentration of their juices , while they cling to the tree . . . . " Very sincerely yours , " FRANCIS H. HERRICK . " MERIDEN , X. H. " I do not think it impossible , perhaps not improbable , that a woodpecker , at least a yellow-bellied woodpecker , might become stupefied by drinking the fermented sap of a birch-tree . Birch sap constitutes a favorite and , at times , the principal food of this bird , and if for domestic or other reasons he were driven to drink it when it had fermented , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clifton W. Loveland , Ornithologist of the Rhode Island State Board of Agriculture , has observed that humming-birds and some squirrels which fed on sap flowing from pits made in birch-trees by yellow-bellied woodpeckers appeared to be stimulated , while other squirrels were rendered loggy and stupid by drinking the same sap . " Robins overtaken by late snowstorms in the spring , and reduced to eating the decayed apples which still hang on the trees , sometimes roll around on the snow , utterly helpless , apparently from the effects of the fermented apple-juice . " A young black bear , with whom I had a close personal acquaintance , once showed all the usual signs of intoxication after having surreptitiously ? or perhaps I should say sirup-titiously ? eaten all the molasses he could hold . " I doubt if woodpeckers or other birds ever do wilful mischief . That is to say , whatever damage or annoyance they may cause by their actions , I believe that those actions were performed without any intention of causing damage or annoyance , without even the knowledge that such damage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably the primary object of the drumming of woodpeckers is to signal . to other woodpeckers . The act per-formed by hammering rapidly with the FROM THE NOTE-BOOK bill upon some resonant object . Formerly this object was usually a hard , dead branch or twig . But , like purple martins , chimney - swifts , and many other birds , the woodpeckers find that certain changes in their environment are advantageous to them , and take advantage of these changes . They have found that metal water-spouts , taut wire , tin cans , and perhaps screen-doors are more resonant than dead branches , and drum upon them probably for that reason . " In some cases it would appear that they have developed a taste for the music as well , and drum away , apparently quite indifferent as to whether they are heard by others of their kind or riot . Sometimes , unfortunately , they select , and repeatedly visit , drumming-posts close to the abodes of people who do not appreciate that kind of music , and their innocent attempts to express themselves are mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " however , that those people who visited the camp fur two or three years while this was going on were firmly convinced that the woodpeckers ate the sap and that it dulled their faculties . " Yours faithfully , " CHARLES N. CODDING . " Extract from " Instinct and Intelligence in Birds , " by Prof. Francis H. Herrick , in Popular Science Monthly : " The president of a large university recently compared the futile efforts of certain reformers with those of a flicker which was seen to be repeatedly engaged in the vain attempt to ' drill a hole through a copper gutter . ' The comparison may be apt to point a moral , but is a trifle unfair to both the instincts and intelligence of a useful bird , which will drum on any resonator , either to call its mates or for the pleasure of the sound , and by habit will come to the same place daily for more than a week , as in a case which we recently noticed . In this instance the resonant body was the roof of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that been its object , one or two blows of its strong bill would have sufficed . " Long before the arrival of the last word from these correspondents I had ceased to hope for a settlement of the original problem . What those Maine birds did or did not do would never be proved . But what a woodpecker or even a robin might do if tempted was a more interesting question . May there be in a bird 's nature capabilities for mischief or crime I had not hitherto suspected ? My eyes were opened to evidence . An item in the day 's news caught my attention : WOODPECKERS DESTROY CHURCH ANCIENT EDIFICE IN PENNSYLVANIA VILLAGE PRACTICALLY WRECKED BY MISCHIEVOUS BIRDS Can there be atheists among them ? I have heard that there are kindly disposed people ready to devote funds for the establishment of cemeteries for pet birds and beasts . Do they not owe a greater duty to the living ? Let them seek out woodpecker colonies where the moral tone is low , and provide funds for the maintenance among them of settlement-workers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they would not volunteer . These are but leaves from the notebook of an unscientific person ; they arnye at no conclusions ? not even a summing up ; yet perhaps some passing scientist may find a grain of wheat among the chaff . As for myself , I seem to possess a changed attitude of mind toward the whole feathered tribe . Professor Herrick 's woodpecker acquaintance who drummed upon the roof of a bird-house daily for more than a week may have been calling his mates or he may have loved the music of his own making . But if I were asked to give an unscientific opinion upon the question , I should say , " Tell me first what family lived within that birdhouse , and all that you may chance to know of the social gossip of that bird community . " Only a day or two ago we were waked at a very early hour by a woodpecker who rapped resoundingly on the wire netting in our front screen-door . No one can convince me that he sought food or drink ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree close at hand , caught sight of me , and immediately put the tree-trunk between us . One time I should have admired his plumage , felt some little pride because of his tameness , and given him no further thought . But now I dropped my rake and followed him around his tree-trunk , saying , pleadingly : " You 're up to something , old chap . Let me in on it , wo n't you ? I 'm a good fellow , myself . "
