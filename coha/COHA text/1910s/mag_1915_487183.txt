The report of the Commissioner of Navigation on the activity of American shipyards can not be characterized as a piece of all-round teamwork with the backers of the new Government shipping measure . It gives the unfortunate impression that the yards are crammed to capacity with business . As the essential feature of the new bill is that it would make the Government a sort of ship-broker , buying or building a specified total of shipping and leasing the vessels in large part to private parties , the report casts doubt on the wisdom of the Government 's entrance at just this juncture . All available yards , all that can be refurbished , are choked with contracts . How can the Government procure the building of ships without forcing out of these shipyards vessels that would go direct to Private operators ? If the Government proposes to fit up merchant yards of its own , that is an expensive enterprise , and requires time ; and the shipping bill is admittedly an emergency measure . Above all , it must be remembered that if the Government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must build or have built on a large scale . The Commissioner reports 98 merchant vessels of over 3,000 tons , ' 70 of more than 5,000 , now under construction or contracted for . Not by obtaining and leasing a mere handful of ships could the Government pretend that it had rescued our commerce . There was no closure in the Senate last Friday , but Senator Penrose was closed up by Mr. Underwood . The Alabama Senator , on the question of revenue from the tariff law and the general relation of prosperity to high protection , carried altogether too many guns for the Pennsylvanian . The latter , in the running debate between the two , was driven into several different corners and walked into a number of traps . All that he could do at the end was to declare that , anyhow , if the country must be admitted to be flourishing under a Democratic Administration , the prosperity is " meretricious . " This is pretty nearly to plagiarize from Horace Greeley , who wrote of the low tariff of 1833 that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factitious but seductive semblance of prosperity . " On . the main queStion before the Senate  --  the extension of the war-taxes for another year ? there was really but one thing to do . " Excoriate " the Administration as the Repub licans might , and make party speeches as they pleased , the money to carry on the Government must be voted . The Republican opposition was purely formal and partisan . If any wonder that the whole subject should have been disposed of in one day , they should observe that it was the day before the holiday adjournment . If Christmas came once a week , there would never be any need of closure in the Senate . The recommendations which Governor-General Harrison has made for changes in the Jones-Hitchcock bill , as reported to the Senate Philippines Committee , breathe a spirit of caution . He would have the preamble amended to declare the intention of the United States to grant the islands their independence when , in. the American judgment , it would be " to the permanent interest of the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filipinos " shall haire shown themselves to be fitted therefor . " It is explained that no Filipino will admit himself unfitted for independence , though many admit that it will not be to their best interests for a long time to come . He would lower the voting age by one or two years , to include a greater number of American-educated young men . For stability he would hold elections triennially instead of biennially ; he would increase the present Senate of nine merely to twelve , instead of twenty-four members , as likely to bring out better men ; and he would elect the resident commissioners by the Legislature instead of by popular vote . One change to which the Republicans may object is that vesting in the Governor-General the assignment of duties to the Vice-Governor . The bill now specifies that the latter shall be in charge of education , health , and the non-Christian tribes . This would enable the Governor , upon his own discretion , to place these departments in. charge of Filipinos whom he thought fitted to administer them . But this involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill ; and the Administration is committed to an increase of the participation of Filipinos in the Government . Why should people puzzle over Mr. Roosevelt 's presence at the Gary dinner ? The Colonel did not go as a politician , he did not go as a social-justice expert , he did not go as a magazine writer . He went as a faunal naturalist , as a scientist led by that vast curiosity for new lands and new people which has taken him to Africa , to South America , to slums and factories and picture exhibitions . Here was a Gary dinner recalling those famous Gary dinners at which , between the soup and the entree , extraordinary things used to happen to the iron and steel trade . We wonder if any one has kept a record of the table-talk at the Gary dinners . There must have been a flow of soul and high conversation . People spoke there of the novels of the season , of Futurist art , of Bernard Shaw and Richard Strauss , of the Boy Scouts , and amidst the flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much , steel billets so much , and tubes so much . It was inevitable that the man who has penetrated so many dark regions of the earth , traversed so many jungles , mapped so many rivers of doubt , should have been impelled to find out the mystery of the famous Gary dinners . Mr. Roosevelt went as a naturalist  --  studying the habitat and habits of Octopus Gariensis . It would never do for a party which furnished such a sensation as did the Republicans in 1912 to settle down to tame and commonplace procedure in 1916 . So the Republican Committee springs a surprise by setting the date for the Republican Convention ahead of that selected by the Democrats . At one stroke it astonishes the nation and stimulates itself . Could its lost leader do more ? When the Chicago Convention has finished with the issues and named its candidates for 1916 , let the St. Louis Convention do what it can with what it finds left . The Chicago Convention will be based upon the new apportionment plan , with the Southern delegations materially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago of 1912 wrote large for the Conventions that were to come after , and the results will be interesting to observe . Lovers of historic parallels  --  and reversals  --  may be impressed with the contrast which the Convention arrangement for next year affords with that for just twenty years ago . McKinley was nominated at St. Louis , as everybody knew he would be , a few days before the Democratic Convention met at Chicago , at sea as to candidates . It appears that in . France , as well as in England , there is a lack of that swift and penetrating hindsight which enables so many of our bright American journalists to pronounce an unqualified judgment of incompetence and failure on a man like Sir John French . The Manchester Guardian has never been accounted either stupid or ignorant , yet it has the tactlessness to draw attention to the difficulties with which it imagines that the British general had to deal , and even the boldness to make this assertion : The movement from the Aisne to Flanders , which was Sir John French 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved the French system of defence , which must otherwise have gone to pieces entirely . This movement is one of the few instances in the war of our having divined in advance and forestalled the enemy 's strategy . As for the Paris press , instead of rejoicing at the removal of an incubus , the cable informs us that it " is unanimous in expressions of regret at the departure of Field-Marshal French , and lays particular emphasis on his services during the trying times of the opening period of the war . " And as though this were not enough , the French actually carry their perversity to the point of expressing satisfaction over the appointment of Gen. Sir Douglas Haig , not because he is the diametrical opposite of his predecessor , but because he is one of Field-Marshal French 's most apt pupils ! The German Finance Minister , Dr. Karl Helfferich , in his speech before the Reichstag on Monday , recognizes a limitation on the possibilities of the war indemnities to be wrung from Germany 's enemies which did not appear in his speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " upon which we naturally reckon , " but he now finds it necessary to acknowledge that , whatever may be the amount of it , it will not suffice to prevent the war from having brought upon the German people " its train of colossal tax burdens . " Just what consequence this consideration will have in the shape of new taxes to be immediately imposed , does not as yet appear ; indeed , it is not plain whether Dr. Helfferich has in mind any very heavy augmentation of immediate tax burdens . The emphasis of his speech is all upon post-bellum taxes . That these will be " colossal " he now frankly admits ; but he makes it clear that the policy will be continued of placing as much as possible of the expenditure , while the war lasts , upon loans , leaving for new taxation only what can not be avoided without grave financial danger . How long this policy can stand the strain is a question which is bound to become of critical urgency unless the war should come to an unexpectedly speedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peril in Egypt , reported from Rome , call for some consideration . And first as to the double-track railway " from Damascus " to the Egyptian frontier , which has been pushed with extraordi nary speed , and which needs only fifty miles more of track before the peninsula of Sinai is reached . As a matter of fact , there has been for ten years a railway from Damascus in the general direction of the Egyptian frontier . This is the famous Damascus-Mecca Railway , which , at Maan , is about fifty-five miles from the Egyptian frontier . Apparently , then , the extraordinary speed with which the railway has been pushed has resulted so far in five miles of new track , with fifty more to be completed . It may be , of course , that part of the work consisted in double-tracking the original single line from Damascus to Maan . At any rate , there remain fifty miles of double-track to build before Sinai is reached . How long will that take ? The Damascus-Mecca line was built ' as a pious undertaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed in its construction . In seven and a half years 820 miles were built , or an average of less than ten miles a month . The best record was on the stretch to Medina , 350 miles in twenty-four months , or fifteen miles of single track a month . The fifty miles of . double-track to Sinai would thus take about six months , even if we suppose that Turkey , in time of war , with her armies very busy , could equal the record of peace time . When the double-track railway reaches the Egyptian frontier , what then ? The implication of the Rome dispatches is that once an army has reached the Egyptian frontier it is at the Suez Canal . As a matter of fact , the Suez Canal lies 150 miles west of the frontier and between is the whole of the peninsula of Sinai . If the Teuto-Turkish army of invasion leaves the rails at the frontier , it is no better off than the Turkish army which made the first attempt against the Suez Canal , with this important difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplying an army of 300,000 men across 150 miles of desert , instead of the comparative handful which the Turks employed . If , on . the other hand , it is the intention to push the railway straight across the Sinai peninsula to within striking distance of the Canal , the Kaiser and the Sultan have undertaken a building operation of a couple of years , and not a task that will be finished by next February , as the dispatches from Rome assert . In addition there are all the miles of water-pipes to lay across the desert ! By that time England should be in a position to meet the attack with adequate forces . We are very much inclined to think that England to-day has enough men for the task in Egypt , which is her principal base for the operations in the Balkans . The proprieties in the Balkans are being carefully observed . Italy , for example , has been pouring out her blood against Austria , but with Austria 's great ally Italy is not at war . She may soon be , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own punctilio : the Germans and Austrians may cross the Greek border in pursuit of the Allies , but the - Bulgars must not . It is a choosing of partners in a tragic quadrille . Austrians are matched off against the Montenegrins because the Germans , by attacking Montenegro , might irritate Italy , whose Queen is a Black Mountain princess . For the same reason Germans will not enter Albania , but will let the Bulgarians do it , while they do the Bulgars ' work in Greece , etc. , etc . Is this another sign of diplomatic Bourbonism which insists , even in the midst of a world catastrophe , on its little convenances ? Or is it cool-headed recognition of the fact that life will go on after the war and that every trifle which may help the reestablishment of civilized relations is worth preserving ? A literary entente seems to be forming rapidly among the Allies . A few months ago sixty-seven Russian writers addressed an appeal for closer relations to the British world of letters . Emile Boutroux has headed a committee designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared a literary " manifesto " signed by Belgians and French . In such a time the literary men . recall the fact that so long ago as 1754 humanistic cosmopolitanism bore fruit In a French periodical called the Journal Etranger , and that it aimed to include all Europe , not merely the nations of a military alliance . Its first editor was Grimm , whose cosmopolitan tastes were among his chief distinctions , and its second the Abbe Prevost , a renowned traveller , who knew English literature as no other Frenchman of his time . Among its supporters were the royal families of France , Poland , and Prussia , and libraries of all Europe , and among its contributors were Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Malesherbes . The Journal Stranger endured three years , one of its strangest adventures into foreign fields , the publication of three Iroquois chants , proving its swan song . It did not , as its prospectus hoped , see born a literary age to be called the age , not of Elizabeth or Louis XIV , but le sickle glorieur de l'Europe entiare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can succeed only by a spirit that will overcome such barriers as now exist between the Teutonic and the other Pi3wers . The death of Francis M. Cockrell recalls to mind not so much his own thirty years ' service as United States Senator from Missouri , though that was of respectable quality , as the career of the man whom he succeeded . When Missouri went back to the Democratic fold , it was plain that Carl Schurz could have no political future in that State , and his retirement from the Senate in 1875 , after a single term of distinguished service , was felt by intelligent citizens to be a serious loss to the nation . He was , indeed , enabled to continue to render services of the highest value to the country , as Secretary of the Interior under Hayes and afterwards as journalist and as a personal leader of opinion . But the natural sequel to such a career as his had been  --  beginning almost with his arrival in the land of his adoption and continuing throughout twenty of the most crucial years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service in public posts of the highest importance . It is one of the serious drawbacks of our State system  --  arising by no means solely from Constitutional restrictions , but even more from the traditions of local pride or exclusiveness  --  that the future of a man who is essentially a national figure depends on circumstances peculiar to his own . State . A change of residence is indeed possible , but the new arrival labors under a tremendous handicap . What might it not have meant for the country if New York had risen to its opportunity and sent Schurz to the Senate ! Secretary Redfield 's annual report contains a reminder to Congress that the new orders he issued following the Eastland disaster by no means serve as a full protection against future occurrences of the sort . The two most important forbade the issuance of an increased passenger-carrying license except after a personal inspection , and called for " inclining tests " of any vessel whose stability the inspectors questioned . But there is still no law giving the Government adequate control over the structural strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builder 's judgment , and only the likelihood of incurring the disapproval of Lloyd 's and other classification services operates as a restraint upon the launching of unseaworthy craft . The Secretary asks for power to centralize the inspection of hulls and boilers in the Supervising Inspector-General , for a law requiring fireproof construction of all excursion steamers built after 1917 , and , above all , for a much larger force in the Steamboat Inspection Service , which is at present " seriously overworked . " The Chicago grand jury complained that the inspectors were untrained men , and prayed that the service be turned over to the Navy Department . If it is the duty of Congress to see that the appropriation for the inspection service and the powers granted it are enlarged , it is the duty of the Secretary to see that his field force is well chosen . The election of Major R. R. Moton , of Hampton Institute , as head of Tuskegee to succeed Dr. Booker T. Washington , will everywhere cause the friends of negro education to rejoice . Major Moton has well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will keenly feel the loss of his services . An excellent orator of exactly Dr. Washington 's type , with a thorough understanding of conditions in the South and the Southern white people , Major Moton could not be better equipped for the great task which he assumes . Like Dr. Washington , he has made his way up from small beginnings , but , unlike his predecessor , - he has given his whole life to service at Hampton , where his tact , his self-subordination , and his never-failing patience and good humor early attracted attention . Finally it is interesting to note that Major Moton is a full-blooded negro , who in his new position will , like Richard R. Wright , of the Savannah Industrial School , and many others , give the lie to the old fable that only mulattoes advance to responsible intellectual positions . As it is , there is now every assurance that Tuskegee will go on with as slight a break in leadership as possible , and will be carried on as an educational institution in precisely the spirit of Booker Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Moton , it will be further gratifying proof of the ability of the colored petiple to develop high and worthy leadership . That one " purpose play " has lived three-quarters of a century is a fact recalled by the death of an actor said to be the original " Uncle Tom " ; for no doubt there are still stray companies presenting one version or another of Mrs. Stowe 's story . Its production on the stage was simultaneous with its publication as a book , for it first appeared in a periodical . While in 1852 it was running up a sale of 300,000 copies , there were beginning those performances which have reached a total beyond those of any other play in America . It was perhaps with the stage version in mind that Fanny Kemble wrote the London Times that she could bear witness to the truth and moderation of the book as a representation of the slave system . Yet the history of the play must be looked back upon with mixed feelings . Its great vogue during the years preceding and immediately following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most vital question of the time . Its long vigor since then is much less attributable to its historical interest than to its melodramatic thrills ; and it is not pleasant to consider that the most popular American drama has been one dramatically cheaper than " East Lynne . " Not merely rural , but metropolitan , audiences have helped make Topsy the prototype of all negro comic characters , Legree the symbol of an arch-villain , and Little Eva the object of a wider bathetic regard than Paul Dombey . It was in the large cities that the apotheosis of Uncle Tom reached its most magnificent absurdity . The Villistas'acknowledgment that the game is up is formal recognition of a fact that has been patent for some months . It marks the end of an epoch and the beginning of another which will ' be signalized with due pomp when Carranza enters Mexico City and sets to work at the reconstruction . of Mexico with the good will of the nations . For the moment our interest attaches to the flitting from the contemporary stage of one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlaw , who came within striking distance of the Presidency of Mexico , the bandit who developed into a military genius , represented in his own person the raw capacities of the Mexican people for good and evil . He was the peon to whom the policies of Diaz denied the opportunity for aeveloping into a contented and prosperous citizen of his country . It has been a romantic career . Yuan Shi-Kai , who has won an emperor 's crown , set out from the high position of Governor of one of China 's greatest provinces , and has traversed the interval in fifteen years . If we measure the distance from Villa 's starting point to where he stood at the height of his power , the record is no less impressive . Nor does the picturesque record suffer from the fact that the outlaw Villa rose to fame on the crest of a great cause , that he will go down in history as one of the avengers of Francisco Madero and a vindicator of the cause of Mexican democracy .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
