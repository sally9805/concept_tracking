txt When the Aldrich-Payne Tariff bill was passed its admiring authors announced to a weary country that at length there would be peace in the land , that the troubling ghost of tariff agitation was laid , and men might go about their business undisturbed . In this spirit of gratulation President TA.FT shared and expressed it with an emphasis that to those who understood the real situation seemed pathetically premature . From that moment to this the discussion of the tariff has hardly ceased . At times it has slackened , but only to be renewed with increased vigor . Curiously enough , the agitation was begun by the President himself . Hardly had the extraordinary session of Congress ended when ho started to " swing around the circle " of the continent after the fashion set by one of the most noted , ? but hardly the most admired , of his predecessors , the late ANDREW JoHNsoN . And in the first of a long , long series of speeches he lauded the inventors and manipulators of the tariff , and then , with amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to denounce , in an entirely needless and in a somewhat offensive manner , the motives and conduct of those who had opposed the tariff . Inevitably they defended themselves , and the long continuation of the debate was on . On Saturday Mr. Foss , the Massachusetts tariff-reform Republican , entered the discussion in the House of Representatives . His very presence there was a striking evidence of the hopeless error of the President and the anti-tariff reformers in estimating the force and direction of popular sentiment . He represents a change of some twenty thousand votes in a formerly overwhelming Republican district on the sole issue of the Aldrich-Payne tariff . And , especially , he represents that split in his party which the President had solemnly declared would be prevented by the signing of that tariff . On the other hand , he also represents one of the most significant and influential elements in the actual sentiment of the country , the resolute opposition to the tariff of a large body of manufacturers who find its favors harmful and its protection fraught with injury and tnestaalrig --  -- didazten- : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points pointa-that he , made in , his-sPeech , Was . his assertion , as a practical manufacturer , : employing a multitude of workmen , in not merely one but in several important industries , supposed to be especially helped by the metal schedule of the tariff , . that , with the duties removed alike from the materials and the products of those industries , they could compete with all rivals at home and throughout the world . This statement , sustained by his unquestionable authority as a successful man of affairs , is a blow at one of the vital supports of the tariff , not only the present misbegotten measure , but the whole protective system . It applies to the main features of the system as much as to those with which Mr. Foss has to deal . The truth embodied in it can not be brushed aside or suppressed . Nor can it be obscured by the utmost display of energy by the President in behalf of the tangled web of measures he calls his " programme . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
