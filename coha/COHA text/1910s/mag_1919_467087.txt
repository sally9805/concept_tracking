THE most dramatic scene I ever witnessed in the House of Representatives was presented on a question of personal privilege , a performance now generally ridiculedby the press and seldom considered impressive by the members , as it is ordinarily a signal for an exodus to the cloak-rooms , for the exhibition of sore toes is not popular in the House . But when James G. Blaine announced that he would address the House on a question of personal privilege , June 5 , 1876 , it was a notice to everybody in Washington that something out of the ordinary was about to take place . Full-page advertisements in all the papers could not have aroused more interest , curiosity , and desire to be present than that simple announcement of Mr. Blaine in the House on Saturday , June 3d . Mr. Blaine was in the prime of life and at the zenith of his public career , a magnetic personality and one of the greatest political and parliamentary strategists ever seen in Congress . He had been Speaker of the House for six years , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War , a popular candidate for President , and " the best-loved and most-hated man " in public life . He had been in the center of every political battle for many years , had given and taken blows like a gladiator , and when it was known that he was to speak in the House there was always a scramble for admission to the flour and the galleries from Senators , judges , and the public generally , for Blaine had his admirers and champions in every walk of life . This announce-went that he would speak to a question of personal privilege was , however , a notice of something unusual because Mr. Blaine had been goaded by his opponents in his own party and in the Democratic party until we all expected to " see the fur fly , " as it is familiarly expressed in the West . And we were not disappointed , for Blaine rarely disappointed either his admirers or his enemies . The House in the Fourty-fourth Congress was Democratic for the first time in a generation . That party had come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it started the wheels moving with investigations , on the assumption that everything which had been done while the Republicans were in full control of the government was wrong and had been inspired by corrupt motives . It started investigations against President Grant , one of them an inquiry as to whether the President had performed any official acts in any other place than the seat of government , the National capital ? a question which no good Democrat would dare bring into Congress now ; but in 1876 it was considered a vital question , and the resolution introduced by . Joseph C. Blackburn , of Kentucky , was adopted by a party vote , because President Grant was spending a part of the summer at Long Branch , five hours ' ride from Washington . But the Executive was not the only part of the government to be investigated . Mr. Blaine had been Speaker of the House through three Congresses , and he , too , was to be impeached " for high crimes and misdemeanors " before the American people , for one reason because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . This was not to be done by a direct move against Blaine , but by indirection , in an investigation of the Pacific railroads . Malicious gossip had followed Blaine since 1872 , when the Liberal Republican movement joined the Democratic party against President Grant , and after the humiliating defeat of Greeley , and the laying of the " third - term ghost , " Blaine was looked upon as the heir to the Republican succession . A good many people still believed , as one of the early governors of Illinois observed many years ago , that they could " destroy the political principles of a party by lying about the candidate of the party , " and I am sorry to say that that old idea is not yet dead . In 1873 the gossips tried to involve Blaine in the Credit Mobilier scandal , and he promptly left the Speaker 's chair and demanded a committee of investigation , which , after full investigation , completely exonerated him . Then the gossips connected his name with certain bond transactions of the Pacific railroads , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary evidence showing the falsity of that gossip . In closing his statement on that occasion , Mr. Blaine said that he had given and taken blows in the House for fourteen years , had in the heat of debate said some things that he would gladly recall , given some votes which in the light of fuller investigation he would gladly change , but that he had done nothing in his public career for which he could be put to the faintest blush in any presence , or for which he could not answer to his constituents , his conscience , and the great Searcher of hearts ; and the majority of the older members who knew Blaine believed him . But Blaine had in the very beginning of that Congress touched the quick of the Southern Democrats by opposing a bill granting full amnesty to all who had taken part in the rebellion . He had defeated that bill and then moved to reconsider the vote by which the suspension of the rules had been denied , and offered a substitute by which full amnesty should be granted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech on that motion in which he arraigned Jefferson Davis as the author of the inhuman acts of Wirts at the Andersonville prison . That speech brought the bitter reply of Representative Benjamin H. Hill , of Georgia , and inspired the eloquent tribute of Robert G. Ingersoll in the Republican national convention in presenting Blaine 's name for the Presidential nomination : " Like an armed warrior , like a plumed knight , James G. Blaine marched down the halls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and fair against the brazen forehead of every traitor of his country and every maligner of his fair reputation ? the man who had torn from the throat of treason the tongue of slander . " The South " was in the saddle , " and the Southern men took up the fight against Blaine from the day he opposed amnesty for Jefferson Davis , and they had the sympathy , if not the active aid , of some of the old Republican leaders of former days , who , like Brutus , " loved not Caesar less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slanders against /dm in April , Representative Tarbox of Massachusetts introduced a resolution instructing the Committee on Judiciary to investigate certain transactions of the Union Pacific Railroad , and other Democrats introduced resolutions to investigate other Pacific roads . Proctor Knott , of Kentucky , was chairman of the Committee on Judiciary , and he appointed a sub-committee to make the investigation , placing on it the only two Southern Democrats on the Judiciary Committee , Hunton of Virginia and Ashe of North Carolina , to have charge of that investigation . Both had held commissions in the Confederate army and both resented Blaine 's attack on Jefferson Davis . All Northern Democrats on the committee were passed over . DRAMATIC SCENES IN MY CAREER IN CONGRESS 41 The Mulligan letters played a leading part in the investigation , showing that the committee was in fact investigating the private affairs of Blaine rather than the official conduct of the Pacific railroads . Those letters ? about a dozen ? which had been written by Blaine to Warren Fisher of Boston during the course of as many years , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been in his employ , and by that gentleman brought to Washington to add to the sensational gossip . It was known that Blaine had secured possession of the letters from Mulligan and the suspicion was that he had done this to prevent them falling into the hands of the committee , for Senator Knott threatened all sorts of drastic action by the House to secure the letters . The House was the center of sensational interest on Monday , June 5 , 1876 . It was only ten days before the national Republican convention , and Blaine was the most popular candidate for the nomination . He was the storm center of American politics . The galleries were packed and the floor crowded with members , Senators , ex-members , and whoever could by hook or crook get on the floor . I never saw a joint session of the two Houses better attended , for there were members of the Cabinet and of the Supreme Court on the floor . The stage was set for a historic scene . Speaker Kerr , who bad been elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an investigation of charges as sensational and as malignant and untruthful as those against Blaine , and he was also in the very shadow of death from a fatal malady . The " House jester , " Sunset Cox of New York , was in the chair as Speaker pro tempore . Mr. Cox was a brilliant man and a good legislator , but he had acquired the reputation of being the humorist of the House and was often taken less seriously than he intended . In the chair he might pound the desk and threaten to clear the floor and the galleries , without CXL. ? No , 835. - 6any effect except to add to the confusion and laughter . The gavel , voice of authority in the House , was Iike a child 's rattle in the hands of Mr. Cox . Down in front of the Speaker 's rostrum , which is now the forum of the House and always regarded neutral territory , was the almost mummified form of Alexander H. Stephens , former Vice-President of the Confederate States , who , by reason of physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trundled into the House and throughout the session occupied that central position , almost as conspicuous as the Speaker . Directly to the left of Stephens , on the front row of seats on the Republican side , was another figure linking that Congress with the past ? Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks , of Massachusetts , who , after the long deadlock in 1855 , was elected Speaker of the Thirty-fourth Congress , the first Republican to occupy the chair . Both these men had been in the House before the war , both distinguished themselves in the war , and both returned to the House several years after the war , but with qualifications prefixed to their party names ? Banks calling himself " a liberal Republiean " and Stephens calling himself " a straight-out Jefferson Democrat . " Banks did not love Blaine and Stephens did not love Ben Hill or Proctor Knott ; and they sat there like elder statesmen to referee a partisan duel . On one side of the House were some sixty members known as Southern brigadiers , because they had all held commissions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been amnestied by Republican Congresses presided over by Blaine , they were still called " Rebels . " On the other side were quite as many members who had been soldiers in the Union army , and many of them still carried themselves with a military air and chaffed their opponents about their defeat in the war . On that side also sat several black men who had been slaves under the old dispensation , had been freed by Lincoln , made citizens by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution , and elected representatives in Congress from Southern states ; and they were able men , as any one will realize who reads the lives of Robert Smalls , John R. Lynch , and Joseph Rainey . There were others on both sides who linked that time with the future ? Garfield , a future President , whose assassination had an unfortunate reflex on his party and on the country ; two future Vice-Presidents , William A. Wheeler and Adlai E. Stephenson ; a future justice of the Supreme Court from the South , Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar , of Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats had seats on the Republican side , and Stephenson and Lamar sat near Blaine , the latter almost elbow to elbow with his negro colleague , John R. Lynch ? two future Speakers of the House , Randall and myself , and a long list of men who afterward became Senators , judges , diplomats , governors , and contributed to the political history of the country in one way or another ; but on that day we were simply a part of the stage settings for the most talked of and the most dramatic figure in American polities since the days of Henry Clay . Blaine was the star player and Proctor Knott was his unwilling foil . Blaine sat midway back on the third aisle of the Republican side , in the very center of his party associates , with . Garfield , Hale , Frye , and Kelly immediately surrounding him . Proctor Knott had a relative position on the Democratic side with Blount , Hill , and Hunton , all Confederate brigadiers , as his immediate neighbors . My seat was a few rows behind Blaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had a good position from which to see the whole stage , and to me it was like a play . Blaine was the center of attention , while the House was disposing of the morning business , and many members from his own side stopped to shake his hand as they passed to theirseats . He was apparently unconcerned about the part he was to take in a few minutes . He chatted with his neighbors and whoever passed his seat , and when I reached out my hand merely to show my confidence he gave it a warm grasp , accompanying it with a cheery word which he always had for the younger men of the House . I doubt if any of Blaine 's friends knew what he intended to do or say on that occasion . Hale and Frye from his own state , and Garfield , professed to be as much in the dark as any of us . We all had confidence in his ability to confuse his enemies , but our confidence was based on faith and not on information . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to deliver them to the committee . We accepted the general theory that he intended to keep them from being made public . As soon as the formal business on the Speaker 's desk was disposed of , Blaine addressed the Chair : " Mr. Speaker , if the morning hour has expired I will rise to a question of privilege , " and he proceeded to read the resolutions that had been adopted early in May , directing the Judiciary Committee to investigate certain transactions of the Pacific railroads . He said that the resolutions , on their face and by fair import , called for an investigation of the railroad companies as to the legality of certain transactions . Then , turning to the chairman of the committee , he said : " Now , I say ? and I state it boldly ? that under these general powers to investigate Pacific railroads and their transactions , the whole enginery of this committee is aimed at me ; and I want that to be understood by the country . I have no objection to it , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This plain and direct challenge to the committee was greeted with a demonstration of approval from the Republican side and from the galleries , and it was several minutes before Mr. Blaine could proceed . He then told the story of the Mulligan letters that had been stolen DRAMATIC SCENES IN MY CAREER IN CONGRESS 43 from the files of Warren Fisher in Boston , the sensational use that had been made of rumors concerning them , and the efforts of the committee to secure possession of them . He admitted that he had secured possession of the letters and had defied the power of the committee and the power of the House to compel him to produce them . He knew the power of the House ? none better than he ? and he respected that power ; but he boldly declared that the House had no more power to order what should be done or not done with his private correspondence than it had with what he should nurture his children or how he should educate them . That , right was as sacred in one case as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing by it and ready to make any sacrifice in defense of it and engage in any extremity of contest or conflict in behalf of that right , he completely surprised the House by taking from his desk a bundle of old letters and holding it up , said : " And while I am so determined , I thank , God I am not ashamed to show those letters . There is the original package ; and with some sense of humiliation , with a mortification that I do not pretend to conceal , with a sense of outrage which I think any man in my position would feel , I invite the confidence of forty-four million of my countrymen while I read those letters from this desk . " It was a fitting climax to a plain story that had been recited in ordinary tones and without anyeffort to create sympathy or suggest martyrdom ; and the Democrats , who had been scheming and threatening to use the full power of the House to secure those letters as the clinching evidence needed to give substance to rumor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author of the letters to read them to the House , have them printed in the Congressional Record and given to the press which had been for weeks resorting to every form of strategy known to it to secure copies of them . The newspaper correspondents in the press gallery , experienced in the development of dramatic surprises , were as much excited as the occupants of the other galleries and the men on the Boor . They had pictured Blaine as going down on his knees in supplication to Mulligan , with tears streaming down his cheeks , and even threatening suicide , if those letters should ever be given to the public to ruin him and his family ; and here was the same Blaine standing in his accustomed place in the House with that bundle of old letters in his hand and proposing to read them to all his countrymen . He appeared the only calm man in the chamber . Every other human being on the floor and in the galleries was wild with excitement , some with exultation and admiration for the man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those for whom they were set . The confusion was so great that the Speaker could not be heard , nor the raps of his gavel . I could see his lips move and the gavel swish up and down , but all sound of authority was drowned in the noise of cheering men and women . Senators and Representatives on both sides of the chamber were like boys at a rough-and-tumble baseball game , with no semblance of dignity or order . After a while we could hear the Speaker calling on the sergeant-at-arms and the police to clear the floor and the galleries , but he might as well have joined the others in shouting and running about . The gavel and the mace , the emblems of authority , were without reverence on that occasion . Blaine was in as complete control of the House as he ever was when Speaker . It was only at a signal from him that order was restored . As a master of parliamentary practice and political strategy , he had his enemies in a panic and helpless to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest individual triumph I ever saw anywhere , but Blaine did not encourage the continuation of the demonstration . He lifted his hand , signifying that he was about to proceed , and then he read those old letters . There were about a dozen of them in the package , some stained with age and all in Blaine 's handwriting , all addressed to Warren Fisher and all about personal business affairs . I do not remember a political note in them , and they presented only one side of the correspondence . This necessitated some explanation to make a story , but it was not a thrilling story from any point of view . The letters referred to disappointments over business ventures , inability to meet notes that had been given , and the embarrassments of others who had relied on his judgment in making investment of life 's savings . Written by one man to another about business affairs , these letters were stale reading as compared with the many speculations as to what they would reveal . They had been discussed by thousands of people who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip and that which circulated about the capital ; and such speculation as to what the letters would reveal regarding the most popular candidate for President had aroused sensational interest which could not be sustained . Mr. Fisher had denied the stories about the transactions of Blaine , and so had Thomas A , Scott and Morton &; Bliss of New York , who had handled the stock of the Pacific railroads ; but these denials only whetted the appetite of the scandalmongers and brought out new rumors . Mr. Blaine gave some explanations of dates and incidents as he read the letters , some of which bore date as far back as 1801 , before he was elected to Congress . The half-hour consumed in reading was a sharp let-down from the dramatic introduction of the letters , and it began to look to me like an anti-climax ; but as Blaine finished the last letter and handed the bundle to the reporter , he said , apparently apologetically , that there was one piece of testimony wanting , one witness who had not appearedbefore the committee , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness . Then , striding down the aisle to the arena of the House in front of the Speaker 's desk , he asked if the gentleman from Kentucky had sent a telegram to Josiah Caldwell . Mr. Knott replied that he and Judge Hunton had both tried to get the address of Mr. Caldwell , but they had not succeeded , as the witness was not in this country and the telegram had not been sent . While making this explanation , Mr. Knott walked down the aisle to the well and the two men stood there in the arena of the House , about ten paces apart , with only old Alexander Stephens in his wheel-chair between them . I felt that the real act of the play was to begin , and it . did . Blaine 's next question caught Knott off his guard and again roused the expectations of every one else . " Has the gentleman from Kentucky received a despatch from Mr. Caldwell ? " asked Blaine , in even and polite tone . " I will explain , " replied Knott , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , " with an emphasis that was like a blow in the face . He strode across the area to face Knott on the Democratic side , and the members from both sides began moving toward the wall , anticipating a personal encounter . The Kentuckian was an eloquent man , a master of ridicule and sarcasm , and could with these weapons handle himself in almost any kind of parliamentary skirmish , but the incisive demand of Blaine for a categorical answer to his direct question put him on the defensive . He realized that he could not evade that question and he admitted that he had received a despatch dated London and " purporting " to be from Mr. Caldwell ; and still on the defensive , but with an effort to counter , he asked , with almost a sneer , how the gentleman from Maine knew of the despatch . But Blaine came back with another question so searching that Knott winced , as he DRAMATIC SCENES IN MY CAREER . IN CONGRESS 45 realized that his opponent had more knowledge that could be parried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get its " snapped out Blaine . " I want the gentleman from Kentucky to answer this House when he received that despatch . " The pebble from David 's sling was not more effective in silencing Goliath than that question in making Knott tongue-tied . His silence in the face of this direct and emphatic challenge was embarrassing to his friends , and so irritating to the Hotspurs on his side that John . Young Brown , another fiery Kentuckian , demanded action . He expected direct action in resenting such a challenge and reflection on the honor of a gentleman , and members from both sides pushed forward until the two principals were hemmed in by excited men ready for a general melee . But Proctor Knott knew the significance of the scrap of yellow paper which Blaine held toward him , for it was a copy of the Ca/dwell despatch , and , flushed with anger and humiliation , he accepted the challenge in silence . There was no other way for a brave man to meet the situation , and Knott was not a coward . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these two men stood like gladiators within striking distance of each other , but with no suggestion on their part of physical encounter or the violation of the rules of the House . Knott saw that he had been trapped , and for a moment he appeared defiant as he replied that he would answer when he pleased . Blaine stood there like a " Plumed Knight , " with his lance in rest , his adversary unhorsed and his armor pierced , and then he compelled the gentleman from Kentucky practically to appear at the bar of the House and confess that he had received a cable despatch from Josiah Caldwell in London , stating that he had read the testimony of Thomas A. Scott as printed in New York papers , and that Caldwell corroborated thattestimony and wanted , so far as his testimony could , to vindicate Mr. Blaine from the charges that had been made against him . Blaine held a copy of the despatch in his hand , but did not read it . He compelled Mr. Knott to reveal its contents under cross-examination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but compelled him to admit that he had received that despatch five days before , or on Thursday morning of the preceding week , and that as chairman of the committee he had not seen fit to lay that evidence before the full committee or the subcommittee , but had shown it only to Judge Hunton , who had become the chief prosecutor of Blaine in this indirect investigation . No Republican member of the committee had been shown the despatch . Mr. Knott was beaten and he showed it as he tried to excuse his conduct by saying that he did not know how to reach Mr. Caldwell and secure confirmation of the despatch ; but that excuse was quickly punctured with the inquiry if he could not trust the cable company to find the man who had sent the telegram . It was apparent that Blaine had unmasked the underground mine laid for him and that Proctor Knott was the victim of the explosion . That incident was no doubt the inspiration for Ingersoll 's line , " The man who had torn from the throat of treason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty clear that the committee in trying to involve Blaine in its investigation of Pacific rail. - roads had not been full and frank in its efforts to secure evidence on both sides ? to give Blaine the benefit of Josiah Caldwell 's voluntary testimony cabled from London to the chairman Blaine 's triumph was complete and the House was a bedlam , with the Speaker , the sergeant-at-arms , and the Capitol police as helpless as babes in a mob . They were the comedians of this dramatic performance . Republicans cheered their leader until they were hoarse ; the galleries were as turbulent . Only the Democratic side of the House was silent , and the silence there was sullen , evidence of disappointment and chagrin al Lhe Judiciary Committee and its chairman , who had led the party into such a humiliating defeat at the hands of one man , Mr. Blaine . Proctor Knott had led his party into an ambush of his own creation , and " in politics a blunder is worse than a crime ; " but here was ground for the double charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to suppress important evidence in the investigation they had unfairly diverted from its legitimate purpose to destroy a political opponent whose popularity was the inspiration for the whole effort to involve him in the Pacific railroad scandals . In the last half-century I have participated in many exciting contests in the House , but that was the most dramatic scene I ever witnessed on any stage . Those two men , both handsome and impressive in bearing , with voices trained to make speech most effective , face to face in the arena of the greatest legislative body in the world , supported by their partizans and surrounded by a company of the most distinguished men of the time , impressed rue like a revival of the tournaments at King Arthur 's I confess that I was not an impartial witness , for I was a partizan then and something of a hero-worshipper . I have heard men say they were impartial , but 1 knew they were fooling themselves . A dead man may be impartial , not a live one . Certainly nobody in the chamber of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even tried to appear impartial . We were as lusty in our partizanship as a lot of men at a prize-fight . Blaine walked back to his own desk during the confusion on the floor , and after we had worn ourselves out with cheering and congratulating him , he offered a resolution calling on the Judiciary Committee for the despatch from Josiah Caldwell and took his seat . Holman of Indiana , who was one of the best parliamentarians on the Democratic side , made a point of order which furnished an opportunity for diverting the subject from personalities to methods of procedure ; and Judge Hunton of Virginia , as chairman of the subcommittee , took the floor to make a speech . He assured the House that there had been no effort to involve the gentleman from Maine in the investigation ; that the committee had called such witnesses as Mr. Blaine requested ; that it had tried to secure the address of Josiah Caldwell , and that the despatch from Mr. Caldwell had been shown to him , but he had doubted its authenticity and had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , while not contributing much to the Democratic side of the controversy , did bring the House back to ordinary conditions and relieved it of the intense dramatic situation which had been created . Then Proctor Knott took the floor and did his best to fill his old role as satirist which he had so often played with other members as the victims of his ridicule , but it was apparent that he had not recovered from the punishment administered by Blaine , for his own side of the House did not rally to him . It could not get rid of the picture of the chairman of the great Judiciary Committee at the bar of the first Democratic House confessing to having suppressed important evidence in an investigation which struck at the private character of the most popular man in public life at that time . Blaine 's resolution was not adopted . He did not expect it to be . He had compelled Knott to reveal its contents and the whole story of its suppression . It was the parliamentary finale to his dramatic presentation of a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and finally laid on the table by a party vote . The majority could do no less than stand by the majority of the committee on a record vote , but that vole did not represent the sen ; timeats of all the Democrats , for it was DRAMATIC SCENES IN MY CAREER IN CONGRESS 47 noticeable that few of the old leaders of that party gave Mr. Knott any material assistance in the contest . Throughout the whole debate such Democratic leaders as Randall , David Dudley Field , Abram Hewitt , Fernando Wood , Morrison , and Hurd from the North , and even Lamar , Alexander Stephens , John Randolph Tucker , and Roger Q. Mills from the South , were silent spectators of Mr. Knott 's humiliation . Some of them were personal friends of Mr. Blaine , most of them respected him , admired his dash and ability , and all of them sympathized with his defense of private correspondence as beyond the power of the House . As a rule , members of Congress do not lose their sense of fair play or strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on that occasion the majority of the members on both sides felt that Blaine bad been the victim of persecution by the committee , and they were gratified at the way he had turned the tables and punished his persecutors . The Mulligan letters , after they had been read to the House and published , lost their sensational character , as do most scandals after they have been brought out of the closet and exposed to the light , and printed facts take the place of veiled insinuation and gossip . As political material they ceased to function because the mystery had been cleared up with the letters in The Record , and the Representative who would have attempted to revive the newspaper stories about the correspondence would have been ridiculed . No one now reads those letters to find evidence of improper conduct by any man , but the scandal that had been built around them while in the possession of Mulligan continued to circulate for a time , and they may have had a minor part in the defeat of Blaine in the Cincinnati convention held just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I doubt that , because he led all other candidates and steadily gained in seven ballots , and was onlydefeated by the combination of all other competitors who united on Governor Hayes . Mr. Blaine was called an eloquent speaker , but he did not indulge in word-painting which is so generally considered the principal part of the orator 's equipment . He did not have the gift of Garfield or Ingersoll in imagery , or that of Tom Reed in the use of epigrams . He did not dwell in the odor of phrases . His power as a public speaker was in his ability to marshal facts and group situations to present . dramatic conclusions . In that speech on a question of personal privilege there was no impassioned appeal , little of denunciation by words , few striking paragraphs which taken alone would attract unusual attention ; and I doubt if any present-day reader of The Congressional Record would linger long over any part of his speech or the debate . But , taking the whale performance with the prologue furnished by James Mulligan and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the epilogue supplied by Proctor Knott , it was the most completely dramatic scene I ever participated in , either in the House of Representatives or elsewhere . Some men assert an established truth with an air of apology . Blaine was not of that sort . He made an explanation with the attitude of a belligerent when the enunciation of commonplace sentences was with the force of blows . Such was the effect of his questions to Proctor Knott , and when he presented two great surprises to friends and foes alike in his personal explanation , he developed two dramatic climaxes that would have done credit to the father of the English drama I have seen the elder and the younger Booth and other actors who made the American stage famous , but I never witnessed a mimic presentation which approaches that scene in the House of Representatives when James G. Blaine was the central figure ? stage-manager , curtain - raiser , scene - shifter , call-boy , and star ? by rising to a question of personal privilege . He transformed the psychology of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a great actor , but I never knew an orator or debater who could impress his views on others who was not an actor . Garfield and McKinley , Proctor Knott and William J. Bryan were actors in the same sense . They all appealed to the dramatic instinct and employed dramatic art. ; and Proctor Knott afterward admitted in the cloakroom that Blaine 's question of personal privilege was the greatest histrionic performance he had ever seen on any stage . And did not Macaulay describe Pitt as an actor in his closet as well as in the House of Commons ? So , there is no reflection on Blaine or any other great orator in calling him an actor . The world 's a stage and we are all players . The secret of Blaine 's leadership was courage to meet situations , accept responsibility , and fight as a gladiator with a challenge to any extremity of conflict , and the ability to use the weapons of political strategy and parliamentary rules with more skill than any of his colleagues . Such leadership gave him more ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other masterful men in his own party combining against him , he held his following through twenty years in Congress and four Presidential campaigns . The one most accepted criticism of Blaine was , like that of Caesar , that he was ambitious , and " it were a grievous fault , and grievously hath Cesar answered it . " And , like Caesar , Blaine is remembered and admired for the malicious attacks on him as well as for his gallant leadership . I would n't give three whoops for a man whose heart did not beat faster , whose eyes did not take fire , and whose spirit did not sweIl ? who would not be moved to laughter or to tears by the voices of birds and children , by a song from the heart , by a woman 's pleading , by noble oratory or noble acting , by any human action through which the spirit in one speaks to the spirit in others . Our human weaknesses are often the secret of our salvation . So , loving life , I have always been impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheers , laughter , and tears , and without shame in any of them . I cheered Blaine until my voice had frazzled to a childish trebble.
