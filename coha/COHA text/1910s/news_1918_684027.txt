txt A Branch of War Medicine That We Must Consider in Our Turn . When Carrel discovered that Pvery tissue of the body is capable . under proper conditions , of reproducing cells like its own , and hence can grow independently . he little thought of the practical applIcation'of his discovery in war surgery . Among t he marvelous new achievements obtained by surgeons in this war none is . if snore vita I inwer:r , nee t hrs n the process of restoring faces to p ? - usons hideously disfiEru red . The a npeurr.nee of a. man without a. nose . with 1 he lower , law torn off , with a. cavity its the cheek . with an eye and temple gone . or with extensive . burns from mnstard , : - .. as . is such as to awaken repulsion and disgust . Men have committed suicide rather than return to their families in such a stale . And : 1 per cent . of the wounds received in trench fighting are in the face . , III The restoration of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years in England , as has been told us by Sir Arbuthnot Lane on his recent rs7t. to Ncw York . To reach the dekgrad result a photograph of the ma.n taken before his injury is studied by a skillful French sculptor and a careful model of the face is made in plaster . Tills man has given all his time to this work for the last three years , as it is an essential preliminary to success . The model is used by the surgeon as a guide for his work . By transplanting hits of cartilage and bone from the man 's ribs or legs . holding them in place by paraffin or a plastic material such as dentists use in molding false teeth ; and then bringing over this portions of skin , lifted from the forehead or cheek or neck , skin which is left with some natural attachment to aid its nutrition , a new face is actually built up . And in the course of a few months the man is given an appearance not only agreeable to look at , but actually resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been attained by long and arduous work , and which is successful only in specially skillful and experienced hands . A hospital near London is devoted exclusively to these operations , and twelve surgeons in addition to the sculptor are constantly employed . And now Sir Arbuthnot Lane is anxious to give our soldiers in need of such operations the full benefit of the skill obtained by long practice . For while American surgeons could doubtless learn to do this work , it would be a long time before they could acquire the dexterity already possessed by those who are now at work , and many failures might precede success . Such failures may be obviated and delay in achieving results avoided if the offer of the English surgeons is promptly accepted It will be necessary for the Medical Department of the army or for the Red Cross to provide huts to accommodate our soldiers near the hospital and to furnish funds for their maintenance . The surgery would , of course , be done without charge . It is because there is sonic need that these proper provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army and the Red Cross that I venture to enlist the co-operation of your paper , as this is an effort which should not be limited to medical men .
