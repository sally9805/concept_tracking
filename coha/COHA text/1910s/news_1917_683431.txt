txt Cheering like soldiers after a victory , waving ' flags ... hats , and handkerchiefs , and all e &-thern; ' smiling and happy , the 1,842 men who compose New York City 's first contingent of soldiers for the National Army of the United States left for Camp Upton yesterday morning . The four long special trains in which the men traveled left from Long island City , and the Flatbush Averse Station in Brooklyn , and a more enthusiastic crowd of soldiers never started for the front than those young men who arrived at Camp Upton yesterday afternoon . Brig . Gen. Enoch II . Crowder , Provost Marshal General , was at the Long Island City Station when the units from the draft districts of Manhattan- and the Bronx began arriving , and his face was a happy study as he stood up in his automobile and watched the men . " This is one of the most inspiring sights I have ever witnessed , " he said . " There is enough inspiration hero to stimulate the whole nation . " Accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Deputy Attorney General Roscoe S. Conkling , General Crowder went with the men to Camp Upton . A big automobile was waiting to carry him to the camp , but General Crowder went with the men on the first of the four sections , traveling in the same car with the units from four of the Harlem districts . The units from the 189 districts of New York mobilized at 7:30 yesterday morning and the total number of absentees was five . Three joined their district organizations at the stations , one was arrested and the last ordered taken into custody . Both of these men , it is expected , will be able to satisfactorily ' explain why they were absent . The first quota to arrive at the East Thirty-fourth Street ferry was that of Ditsrict 128 , the headquarters of which are Fifty-first tSreet and First Avenue , There were no tears and no discontent . " Here we are , and we are glad we are here , " a big strapping fellow yelled as the first of the big touring cars in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederic R. Coudert , Chairman of the board . was in command , and when somebody asked him if he was proud of his men he answered with a quick and snappy " You bet I am . " Next came Board 38 , and as its first automobile came to a stop the head of another column of machines bringing the men from the 107th and 108th Districts came into view at First Avenue . A moment later the soldiers of District 138 were in sight , and after that it was a case of one district after another . In every instance the automobiles in which the men rode from their district headquarters to the ferry were decorated with flags , while big cardboard signs on either side of the car showed the number of the district . Street Filled With Relatives . By 9 o'clock Thirty-fourth Street in front of the ferry entrance for a block west was jammed with relatives , friends and sweethearts of the men . Some of the women and girls appeared a bit downcast at first , but the joy and hilarity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the first of the ferryboats pulled out for Long Island City , everybody in that big crowd had caught the happy spirit of the occasion . The men v.-no had been previously instructed to wear old clothes that " they want to lose " appeared in every conceivable kind of garb . from the khaki uniform of the former Plattsburg man to the overalls of the blacksmith . Gosh ! " said a youngster from the 113th - District . " I sure hope this old suit holds together until I get to Yaphank . " The men of Board 146 were the guests of their board officials at an early breakfast , and came to the ferry in a Fifth Avenue bus . Board 157 came in touring cars , and the six banners that the men waved on high indicated the enthusiasm that exists for America in that Harlem stronghold . " Kaiser Banners Union ra , " the sign being in the shape of a Union label . was the foremost of the banners these cheering Harlemites waved . These men also had a yell , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up the rear carried a youngster who held aloft a banner which announced that " we are all walking delegates of the K. K. U. " Bronson Winthrop . George Gordon Battle , and Dr. Royal Whitman piloted the contingent from Board 1:70 . Apparently these men , the Board officials included have been doing a little drii ; - ing on the side , for when the contingent alighted the men formed in double file , and at Mr. Winthrop 's command " forward march " swung like regulars into the ferry house and then to the boat . Mr. Battle acted as First Lieutenant of the unit , while Dr. Whitman was the Surgeon General . All the selectiv.e draft men in the unit - were Sergeants . One of the men in this unit Was Clarence Schmiezel , the Republican leader of the Tenth Assembly District . " Of course I am glad I am going . This is the greatest day in ? my life , " said Mr. Schmiezel . One of the unit . leaders was George W. Perkins , Jr. , who came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx districts came to the station together , traveling in forty automobiles , while ahead rolled a big bus on top of which was a brass band . The Bronx boards assembled their men ahead of time and'paraded through the borough before leaving for the trains . Just tefore the first of the specials got under way it was reported that two men from an uptown district were missing . These men were later discovered in the wrong coach , and were told to stay there until they arrived at Camp Upton where they would join their proper unit . The first man reported missing and who was still missing when the second train left was Philip Pearistein , s school teacher who lives at 549 Riverside Drive . The case was reported ; to the Federal authorities and an agent of the Department of Justice went to Pearlstein 's apartment . He found the man asleep in bed , and when asked to account for his failure to report for duty Pearlman said that he was ill and unable to make the journey to Camp Upton . The man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was said that the doctors failed to discover anything serious the matter with him . The other man reported missing , last night was David Roddenberg of 2,065 Belmont Avenue , the Bronx . Roddenberg was ordered to report for duty with the quota from Board 161 . The police were asked last night to locate Roddenbers , and take him to the Seventy-first Roddenberg Armory for examination by army officers . ? Over in Brooklyn Theodore Johnson ef 1,317 Park Place failed to appear at the mobilization hour . The case was reported to United States Marshal Power and the Marshal sent for Johnson . A fatherly talk by the Marshal followed and Johnson hurried to the Flatbush station and proceeded to Camp Upton with his GEN . CROWDER PRAISES ARMY . Special to The New York Times . CAMP UPTON , Yaphank . L. I. , Sept. 10 . ? The first contingent of the national army from New York City , reported for duty this afternoon . If General Bell 's declaration that a " singing army is a fighting army " is correct , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the army . The first section , with men from Brooklyn and Staten Island , arrived at the Camp Upton siding at 1 o'clock . Major Gen. J. Franklin Bell , in command at Yaphank , with his Chief of Staff , Lieut . Col. E. E. Booth , were waiting . The first man to alight was M. Decker of Bloomfield , Staten Island . All carried either suit cases or bundles and one sight which brought smiles from the officers was a contingent from one of the east side hoards , every which wore a wrist watch . Uniforms they had none , but the men were conscious of their superiority . The holiday spirit of last Tuesday 's parade was shown today . Various . inscriptions were chalked on the sides of the oars , " Bowery to France " was one , while another read " On to Berlin ! First stop . Yaphank . " Each car was in charge of an officer who met the trains at Medford Station , and marched the men from Camp Upton siding a half mile to to , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge and receiving mess kits , the men had their first taste of camp food . Chefs sent to Camp Upton by the jiotel Men 's Association had ready the following menu : Pork and beans with tomato sauce , rice pudding , bread and coffee . This chow beats what we got on the border , " said a former member of the Seventh Regiment , while the men at the same table all expressed their satisfaction . After dinner mess kits had to be washed arid packed away . This was a new experience for many , for among the recruits reporting were accountants ; advertising managers , electrical engineers , while others said that they had just left grocery stores and many were laborers . One man said that he had just closed his delicatessen store Saturday . George W. ? Perkins , Jr. , was there . He had been in army Young Men 's Christian Association work , and an exemption had been taken out for him by officers of the organization , but young Perkins waived exemption , although recently married . Among today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas Avenue , the first man drafted . from New York City , and Ralph Barton . a Londoner , who fought with the Royal Fusiliers at Mona and at Antwerp and was wounded five times . . As he returned to divisional headquarters after having watched the recruits leave the cars , General Dell said : " I am well satisfied with the new men , and I have little doubt but that they will make good soldiers . " Brig . Gen. Enoch R. Crowder , Provost Marshal General , gave out the following state . ment : ? " I came to New York today accompanied by Colonel Johnson to observe the details of the execution of the mobilization.regulations and to see the concrete result of the plan of raising a national army under which we have been working for so many weeks . Today has justified the words of the President 's registration proclamation in which he said ' This is in no sense a conscription of the unwilling . It is , rather , a selection from a nation which has volunteered in mass . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the selected men who marched , cheering and singing , to their duty , have made it most difficult for me. to forget , my own entbusis. asm and pleasure and to devote myself to the study of detail . I am not sure that a critical inspection of the strings and pulleys of the machine in New York City is necessary . The splendid result demonstrates the efficiency and the well sustained effort of Mr. Conkling and of the local boards here , and gives ample assurance of the perfection of detail which has characterized the mobilization , and dispels every apprehension of deficiency anywhere . " The sacrificial and burdensome law which Congress has enacteu for raising the national army , the execution of which has directly or indirectly invaded every American home , has received its efficient execution at the hands of selected representatives from among the peca-de themselves . There has been no mill Lary invasion of our committees , but rather a proffer by the several States and sub-divisions thereof of their respective contingents . This proffer was complete when the contingents reached their cantonments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is gratifying to the national vanity that such a plan can succeed . It is an assurance of the safety of our democratic institutions to observe this visible proof of the ability of democracy to measure its Governmental efficiency against the vaunted perfection of Prussian autocracy and to prevail . The men who this day responded to their country 's call came to the colors in a new way , it is essentially a democratic way . Not the least of the advantages becomes obvious when we contemplate 4,557 local boards , who , through great sacrifices of business interest , have evolved this great force and who have been for the past week functioning so efficiently as elements in the administrative machine that is this day accomplishing the greatest mobilization of men ever seen on this continent . " Although one of the recruits carried a sign reading " We are on our way to - France " it will be some time before the Seventy-seventh Division leaves Yaphank . Only a third of the buildings at Camp Upton are completed and a training field has yet to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is situated . In all probabilities the Seventy-seventh Division can not be moved from Camp Upton until late next Spring or early next Summer . The National Guard will sail before the national army . Once the national army sails for France those divisions which have had the most training will he sent first , notably from the South , where also work is possible in Winter .
