 |p803  KIOTO , that city of the soul , is the a paradise of lovers of landscape art . more than a thousand years the greatest gardeners wrought their masterpieces there , and their creations endure . The city , lying in the long , level valley of the Kamogawa , has an admirable landscape setting , the continuous , wooded hills on the east and west converging and breaking into the foot-hills of the noble mountain that dominates the north , to form a composition worthy of the greatest of landscape-artists . Along the base of the eastern hills stretches a five-mile chain of temples , monasteries , and villas , each with a garden or many gardens within its walls . On the other side of the city there is another such combination of religious and landscape beauty three miles in length . In addition , there are innumerable palace and temple gardens distributed over the level city , One temple compound covers twenty acres , and its eighteen monasteries have many separate garden-courts . Garden-making has always been classed as an art ( bijutsu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as vital to-day as for all the twelve hundred years that Kioto has been the seat of religion and the arts , of learning and all luxury . In Japan every one loves gardens , knows gardens , and makes gardens . The children amuse themselves with toy gardens instead of mud pies , and model relief-maps in the sands of school-playgrounds . In the recent wars the soldiers , after long marches , amused themselves by making little home landscapes before their tents . In more remote times emperors and shoguns abdicated and joined or established monasteries in Kioto that they might the better meditate upon the eternal truths , and enjoy gardens of their own designing . Priests , nobles , and court ladies all observed the conventions and practised the rules of landscape art . Of the making of gardens and illustrated garden-books there was literally no end in the leisured centuries before the Restoration . The esthetes of the Nara court had long delighted in natural landscape-gardens and in miniature scenic effects before the capital was moved to Kioto ( 784 A.D. ) . The formal rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had vogue in Japan ,  |p804  along with the other things that came over from the mainland with the Indian faith ; but like all other importations , it was soon adapted and modified ? gently " Japanned " and given more grace and softer sentiment . Much of the arbitrary placing and relation of garden stones , the dominance of the " principal stone , " and the religious symbolism , first came from the formal Chinese rock gardens , which embodied suggestions of the crags and islands of certain classic Chinese lakes and Himalayan valleys . The greatest gardeners of Japan , the master landscape-artists , wrought their miracles of " beauty-craft " in the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries . Then Rikvu , the lord abbot of the Daitokuji Temple , mentor and esthetic tutor to Hideyoshi , the military ruler , and Kobori , lord of Enshiu , the greatest esthete of them all , devised the exquisite landscape-gardens of palaces and the toy tea-gardens which are the models most studied and followed to-day . These arbiters of all elegance crystallized the canons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art , constructed after a definite scheme and plan , ordered by fixed conventions , every detail as much a matter of prearrangement as the strategy of a miliitary campaign . Like the Japanese painting , it aims to express the spirit , the soul , the sentiment of a landscape ; and while it is conventional and the product of arbitrary arrangement , it is yet nature ? nature idealized , tamed , trained , and brought to perfect scale and harmony . It is a great landscape in miniature , often the mere suggestion , the impression of some famous landscape of the empire , hut never the abject copy of any one natural scene . Rather it is an idealization of some happy accident of nature , or an improvement on it . Japanese gardens are not places for exercise , nor yet for growing flowers , like our gardens , save as nature may strew the wild moors with flowers or set iris by the marshy borders of lakes . A tree or a shrub may glorify a garden with a burst of bloom , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full bloom may be ruthlessly clipped if its exuberance overruns the perfect lines and balance of the garden plan . The garden is considered as the perfect picture , the living work of art always in view from the main rooms of a house . The landscape-artist composes his garden as a painter composes his picture , carefully considering proportion , balance , harmony , lines , masses , and color tones and values . Nothing is done or arrived at by chance , for all experiments were concluded long ago . There are fixed conventions and arbitrary rules , as in flower arrangement , where Kobori devised thirty ways of arranging each flower . Gardens must be either " flat gardens " or " hill-and-water gardens " ; in formal or finished style , in half-formal style , or in wild or natural style . The outlines of the lake , the course of the stream , the position and height of the hills , the type , size , tone , texture , and position of every stone , conform to the canons of centuries . Yet one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strictest proportion , and even the pebbles and spears of grass are in scale . There must be the " near , " the " distant , " the " side " mountain ; and with these three hills or multiples of their number there must be water or an effect produced by water , like the stony bed of a river or torrent , or a sandy beach . A stream or lake must have a visible , logical source in one or more cascades , and , as reasonably , there must be a stream flowing from a lake . By the rules of all the ages , the water must enter from the east , flow toward the south , and depart to the westward . There must be three islands in every lake , no matter how tiny these Elysian isles of Chinese mythology . The rocks are the foundation on which the whole garden-plan rests , and four stones lying down and five erect are inevitable in the principal view . When the observer has been initiated , he recognizes " the principal stone " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cascade . With that best boulder as key , the composition and intent of the garden are revealed , the mountains , trees , and every feature falling into place in relation to it . The Japanese have a strong sense of the innate beauty and artistic value of rough stones and boulders . Every lake or stream is bordered with them in such natural arrangements that one can always study the dispositions with interest . The flat stepping-stones , the huge boulders of steps .  |p805  the water-basins , lanterns , and long slabs for bridges , are garden materials that cost incredible sums , and the strictest conventions are observed in placing and grouping them . No novice could possibly group mossy stones and their attendant azalea-bushes as one sees them in august monastery gardens and forecourts , where they are natural poems far removed from the crude dump-heaps of Occidental " rockeries . " Four fifths of the trees in a garden must be evergreens , since the garden is to be an intimate and lovable companion the whole year round ; and every tree as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " snow-viewing . " The " principal tree " is placed beside the guardian stone ; the " distant pine-tree " is in farthest perspective , while the " view-perfecting-tree " is on the Elysian isle or some promontory in the middle distance . The " sunset tree , " nominally screening the glare of the western sun , is usually a maple or some other tree of brilliant foliage . The beloved cherry-tree , the poet 's plum-tree , and the red-berried laurel , are always in the nearest foreground , even touching the house ; but all other deciduous trees are in the background , where their autumn litter and winter skeletons are inconspicuous . The gardens of the old imperial palace , sprinkled many times a day to assist the growth of the ae of such garden ornaments . containing the most splendid garden stones in Kioto , are no longer shown . One sees only the formal sanded courts as he trails through the main apartments after the guardians , and they discourage any peeps from inner corridors at curving bridges and magnificent rock masses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperors , has the noblest garden in Kioto . The swelling summits of the great camphor-and keyaki-trees , and the sweep of great pine branches above the long , yellow walls , proclaim its splendors before one enters this park of six or seven acres , a garden of eternal repose and earthly rest .  |p806  It was laid out on broad and simple lines in natural style , and three centuries have served to perfect the design and realize the maker 's dream . In it there is the quiet of an enchanter 's spell , and one is impressed by the long stretches of still water between steep banks , the mossy and magnificent rocks , the gigantic network of camphor roots over the ground , and the great age of every living thing , tinged with the atmosphere and poetry of antiquity . Peninsulas and chains of islands divide the lake virtually into three lakes , and a wistaria arbor completely roofs the longest of the many bridges , where flower tassels four and five feet long swing double during every spring . The " sunset tree " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of the view from the emperor 's favorite tea-housetrees whose myriad tiny , finely pointed leaves are a revelation of color in spring as well as in autumn . There is a broad , shelving beach along one shore of the lake , intended to suggest the sea at low tide , which is evenly covered for more than a hundred yards with dark , weather-worn stones , each the size of one 's palm . These stones were brought from a river-bed at @# the foot of Fuji-yama , nearly three hundred miles away . Such vast pains in regard to every detail in garden-making continually amaze one . Every landscape effect , every detail , stone , lantern , and bridge slab , is so supreme of its kind that this garden is an object of wonder to the few visitors who gain official permission to visit it . Possessing this most beautiful garden in Kioto , the Imperial Household Department seems barely willing to let the world know that it exists . No profane sketching or irreverent photographing is permitted , although the palace has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . Once an illustration was grudgingly granted for an official publication by the city of Kioto , and a court noble was permitted to photograph a new stone bridge ! About the time that the Pilgrim Fathers landed on Plymouth Rock , the retired emperor Go- ' Iizuno made the gardens of the Shugakuin villa north of the city , although the gossipy legends say that those three dream-gardens hanging on the terraces of Mount Hivei 's foot-hills were really designed by one of his favorite court ladies . The third and highest garden is a hanging paradise of such size as to make it  |p807  really a mountain park . It is treated in the wild or natural style , and the original forest remains as an ideal of a sophisticated wilderness for background and wanderings . Bridged islands fairly cut the lake in two , and one covered bridge , with a raised " moon-gazing " platform in the middle , was the gift of a great daimio who was punished for this tribute by a jealous and envious shogun . It is as famous as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaze of red maples is indeed a perfect picture . " The maple is king " at Shugakuin ; but the old guardians fondly say in the spring , " Go-Mizuno 's cherrytree 's children are blooming now . " Besides these rosy clouds of blossoms , there are some wonderfully blooming new-comers , which the emperor Kokaku set out as recently as a hundred years ago . There is a far view of the Kioto plain from a tiny Gesso on a steep , camellia- and azalea-clad hill , the smooth surface of which becomes a shelving snow-bank when the white azaleas bloom . One 's breath may well go away when he is lucky enough to see this hill covered with real snow and brightened with the incredible masses of big , red winter camellia-blossoms . The garden of gardens is that to which the little Katsura Palace is attached in a far southwestern suburb . It is the largest garden designed by Kobori , lord of Enshiu , and his acknowledged masterpiece . It sounds every note of beauty , includes every effect , epitomizes and surpasses all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hikone Castle , on Lake Biwa . For the making of this garden , Kobori was granted unlimited time and means , and inviolable privacy for the years that the work was in progress . The garden is in natural style , and covers a space of eleven acres , shut from busy country roads on two sides , first by a belt of bamboos , and then by the tall , old trees that form the background and sky-line for all the landscapes within . It was conjured from the level ground without one natural feature on which to hang the plan , but its hills seem as everlasting as any not made by hands . Its lake has many arms , and therefore many bridges of every type . One narrow arm winds round to form a deep , dark pool overhung by tremendous trees , yet visible in a far view from the veranda of the little palace . It is the Firefly Valley , where these insects twinkle with the second flushing of the tea-bushes in May . One thousand stepping-stones  |p808  and rock-paved paths offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the round of the garden , mounts the rocky hills , visits all the tea-houses , summer-houses , rest-houses , and shrines , and penetrates to the hidden garden of palms and to the archery-range between rows of cherry-trees and camelliahedges . There are trees so old that one marvels that life can be kept in the hollowed , lichened limbs . They are veterans which , with props and bandages , are saved by the most wonderful tree surgery . Notwithstanding all that the master lavished on it , the Katsura garden is not crowded or overloaded with ornament and detail , and with all its leafy richness and rocky splendor there is still an atmosphere of repose . The little palace is very simple , but so complete that imperial personages could live there comfortably in the stately centuries . But no member of the imperial family has even visited this charming Sans-Souci in fifteen years , and only the caretakers enjoy the " moon-viewing platform " and the countless night effects . No sketching or photographing is permitted , but one may find sketches and plans of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old books , in which it is related how the stones came from all over the empire , and how Rikyu and the greatest were honored by having their arrangements of tatami 1 paths worked out in rough cobbles and flat stones . One such path of forty-three irregular flat stones is so famous that the guardian watched me out of the corner of his eye to see that it was not piratically and irreverently sketched . It is all beautiful and wonderful , and the design has " no front and no hack , " as they say ? that is , no one principal view . Every stone by the lake is a " worshiping-stone , " a separate point of admiration . The Kinkakuji ( Golden Pavilion ) and the Ginkakuji ( Silver Pavilion ) , two little suburban monasteries , possess the bestknown and most-visited gardens in Kioto . They are the creations of two fourteenth-century shoguns , who retired from high office to become priests of the Zen sect . The Kinkakuji , with its large lake , the islands of which are a freely rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition that for five centuries has been studied and adapted by gardeners and amateurs . With their graceful roof-lines reflected in the water or touched with snow , both pavilions are favorite motives with artists and art-workers , and every @#  |p809  tourist learns to love the little Ashikaga palaces by their rock-hound lakes . In the tiny tea-house of the Ginkakuji , the priests Shuko and Soami , those master celebrants , gave the awesome rites of Chano-Yu ( ceremonial tea ) their final form , and the kindred arts of landscapegardening and flower arrangement flourished with it . Simplicity was the key-note of the cult , and the tea-gardens of Shuko at the Kurodani Temple , and of Soami and later abbots at the Daitokuji Temple , as also their classic rock gardens , are almost too simple for an Occidental to grasp the idea that they can be called gardens at all . Shuko 's " Garden of Pearl and Jade , " in a court of the " Temple of Emerald , " and other such poetic names appeal strongly to the imagination . One seeks them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veranda and a camellia-hedge , with mossy rocks standing and lying here and there , a few tiny azaleas growing behind and between them , and nothing more . The alien eye lifts more approvingly to the far outlines of Mount Hiyei and the row of picture pines marching with the riverbank , silhouetted in middle distance against the vaporous blue hillside . The genius of Kobori of Enshiu is expressed in gardens of every kind in every quarter of the city . He created a jewel garden for the little Awata Palace , the monastery of a retired emperor adjoining the Chioin Temple , and this simple bit of landscape harmony in half-formal style shows him at his best . It is an open , sunny strip of garden lying on a shelf of the Maruyama hillside , and the curved lakelet is crossed by an arching granite slab . The foot sinks deeply in a foreground of soft Korean grass , and on the opposite side of the lake azaleas grouped on rounded hillocks give the impression of rolling hills and distance , and a rustic gate opens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill forest . Tall azaleatrees , their trunks crusted with the lichens of three centuries , every spring form incredible masses of rose-colored blossoms that merge with the hills and the far , blue peak of Mount Hiyei . Kobori created other bits of beauty for various abbots of the city temples , and with the Taiko he created the garden of the Sambo-in , the temple at Daigo village behind the great palace on Momoyama . That favorite retreat of the esthetic old  |p810  tyrant is redolent of him still , and one has a sense of his presence in the open , sunny , formal garden , where every little pine-tree is as crooked as it can be , and every bridge as humped as possible . The inevitable waterfall and guardian stone are far back in the forest , as also is the midget teahouse where greatness compressed and suppressed itself for hours and hours . This Shingon temple was the home of the occult : its priests fasted until they saw visions ; they sent their astral bodies about ; they gazed into crystals , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charms and miracles ; and there the supernatural was the regular order . The Taiko , who was as superstitious as any peasant , was abject before these yogis , and sought absolution and indulgence , like his kind the world over . One of the most exquisite of Kobori 's old gardens is that by the lord abbot 's palace at the Kenninji Temple , which was opened one day to all the masters of flower arrangement and the most distinguished amateurs , who sent their compositions of autumn flowers to be ranged in the long suites of rooms against plain-gold leaf screens . It was distracting to gaze upon the wonderful flower arrangements , the lovely , mossy , old formal garden , and the unusual company gathered there . The  |p811  faces , the voices , the manners , of the scholarly priests , of the poets , teachers , nobles , and dilettanti of the old capital , and their gracious wives and graceful young daughters in wonderful crape gowns and goldbrocade sashes , were a revelation to the stranger who knows only the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later they gathered at the palaces of the lord abbots of the Tofukuji and the Daitokuji temples , for similar esthetic tourneys , as their ancestors had done before them every season for centuries . The Kenninji garden is the mossiest , greenest , most ancient-looking spot I can remember having seen , with its narrow water court following the angle of the veranda , its level of lotus-leaves backed by a steep bank set with a noble composition of lichened stones and clipped shrubs , shaded by tremendous trees , so old that they are barely kept alive by miracles of care and tending . All the level ground is covered with a cushion of theatrically green moss , and beneath a picture pine gracious companies grouped themselves on red-blanketed mattings , where an accomplished Zen priest served ceremonial tea in precious bowls . WHEN the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa finished his Kinkakuji garden five hundred years ago , he gave the surplus stones and materials and a bit of land to his favorite armorer , the gifted Goto , who carved the microscopically fine gold and silver ornaments for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iyeyasu gave the Goto of his day more stones and more ground , and the little paradise held such a treasure of garden ornaments as few princes could equal . The sixteenth descendant of the long line of metal sculptors lives on in the same long , low-eaved house giving upon an oblong grass-plot defined on two sides by great boulders . The ground drops to a broad bed of a stream , with one rocky island at the bend , and another in the foreground . Bridges lead to a tea-house and a shrine in the heart of an old forest . Great camellia-trees and camellia-hedges , with winter blossoms like huge , red Cherokee roses , and a profusion of the red-berried nandina , or poet 's laurel , give this garden a special character . But its glories are departing with the fortunes of the house since the sword of ornamental hilt and scabbard has become a tradition  |p812  and a museum treasure . No one wears sword furniture now , and metal sculptors have turned to other things . Ten years ago , progress diverted a useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great " hilland-water " garden was involuntarily classed with " dried-up-water-scenery . " Stone by stone the garden ornaments , gifts of shoguns and princes , have been sold to enrich the gardens of the new people across the city , and the sixteenth Goto bends over the ledgers of a city bank . Everywhere one comes across unique bits of beauty in this city of gardens , for even in a space measuring two feet by six , against a blank wall , Japanese genius can compose a landscape poem . The flower teacher 's rooms in a city temple look upon a crevice of a court with a classic grouping of lichened rocks by the dry bed of a torrent , with a stone lantern beneath a crooked pine-tree ; a photographer has a midget garden all in a dog-kennel 's space ; beyond the dripping stone tables and floors of a fish-dealer 's shop , in the crowded market street , one may see two rooms as simple and exquisite as the lady abbess 's own , and beyond them a flat formal garden where ranks of stately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those in the palace tents . The most prosaic dwelling may have its tiny space for beauty , and one gets tantalizing glimpses as one passes open shops . Often , at summer festivals , Kioto folk draw back all the screens in front to show the gardens in far perspective , quite as they display the best screens and noble floral arrangements at the front of the house . Even the lowliest may coddle and train a seedling pine or maple in a tiny pot , and dream of forests ; and " boxgarden " artists teach women and girls to mimic the famous landscapes of the empire with a few rocks , wisps of moss , and trees in a saucer-sized flower-pot , until they know them by heart . Since the end of the eighteenth century , and progressively since the Restoration , the character of great Japanese gardens  |p813  has been changing . An apostle of sunlight and air made a crusade a century ago , and opened many damp and gloomy gardens to the light of day . Custom and convention were too strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . The deep , dark pools beneath somber masses of foliage are out of favor now , and gloom is only the specialized accompaniment of ceremonial tea . All gardens are more open , joyous , and cheerful , with possibly an approach to foreign styles . Old gardens are being enlarged , landscapes are being pushed farther back to provide real distance and perspective , for in this era of progress and war-taxes there is not so much time for meditation . With the removal of the court and the disestablishment of Buddhism ( in 1868 ) , many old Kioto gardens were abandoned or neglected , and many were sold for less than their stepping-stones had cost . " It no longer exists , " " It has been destroyed , " said my mentor , turning page after page of a very old book of " The Famous Gardens of Kioto . " In recent years there has arisen a great demand for such ancient gardens . The newly rich of the old capital , the millionaires of near manufacturing centers , aspire to possess a garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape-gardeners to restore and recreate such old gardens for them . New nobility , old nobility , lord abbots , war heroes , cotton , paper , and tobacco millionaires , tram-car and cinematograph kings , European art collectors , American exiles , the " language-men " of foreign armies , and even the ubiquitous " remittance men , " all neighbor one another in tenancy of such green gems of beauty around the Nanzenji Temple , in the range of the Yasaka Pagoda , and within the Tofukuji Temple inclosure . Some have kept these dream-gardens to their original designs , others have enlarged their holdings until they have almost parks , and some have committed the sacrilege of such foreign innovations as large summer-houses with chairs and tables and bronze lions disporting on trim lawns ! Even the spouting fountain in a circular stone basin now dazzles the rustics in the grounds of a great city temple ! And once in a lonely monastery garden I saw that rare exotic , the sunflower , show its head on an Elysian isle ! Since it is only on pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , the captains of industry , the plungers on the rice exchange , can spend their money , to the envy of the cultivated poor , every one must have a garden , and the landscapeartist is king . " Can you make me a garden as good as X -- - 's ? " asked a plutocrat who had bought a two-acre rice-field near the university .  |p814  " Yes , " said the wizard landscapist , the latest incarnation of Kobori 's spirit on earth , " in three years , for thirty thousand yen $15,000 . " Then followed sketches , with the outlines of the lake and bridges , the sky-lines of the hills , and the foliage indicated by broad washes . After a garden is finished , the house is built to harmonize with it , and to command the most perfect view , as prearranged . The " wild moor " is a favorite theme of this master landscapist , and there are two examples in Kioto which are supreme of their kind . On these little moors all art is completely concealed , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely or remote garden ) of Prince Yamagata is less than an acre in area , but that great field-marshal , poet , and passed-master of the tea ceremony , has the felicity to look upon a lonely little moor , cut by a wandering , singing stream , which is fed by a softly roaring waterfall back in the encircling wilderness of pine , maple , and cryptomeria , that might well be far away on the wildest mountain-side . The moon rises for him above the solid bar of the eastern hills and through the branches of the mighty pine-trees that lead to Nanzenji , and the moor discloses halfsunken boulders that it seems impossible could have been transported . " The Taiko 's Seat , " the enormous rock mass upon which that other martial esthete sat to watch the clouds of cherry-blossoms on distant Maruyama , was a gift from the emperor , and was drawn from its restingplace in the crown forest on Daigo Mountain by a train of fifteen bullocks . The sovereign also gave a pair of young pinetrees from the palace grounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moor of the old field-marshal is an ideal bit of wild nature , a place for poetry-making and dreams , for solemn tea-drinkings , reveries , and meditation ; but the demon of progress strung the wires of a clanging tramway along one wall , where tall electric lights outshine the moon . Not only does the strenuous life of this veteran warrior , who is first of the elder statesmen at the sovereign 's side in Tokio , keep him from visiting this dream-garden oftener than once a year , but he possesses another Murin-an at his home in Choshiu Province , a garden which is larger , remoter , wilder . and in its silence more ideally what the name implies . When a convention of landscape-gardeners was held in Kioto a few years ago , a map was provided showing sixty-three famous gardens courteously opened to the delegates , each one of whom availed himself of the opportunity to see them . The keepers of the Murin-an were aghast when six hundred visitors had bowed reverently at the gate , slipped off their hard wooden clogs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such gardens , for one does not tramp rough-shod over precious stones , the values of which are as jade or coral or onyx . Not a leaf or a pine-needle or a pebble was injured or misplaced , not a souvenir was stripped or chipped or carried away , not a tea-cup was filched , and at sunset there was no remaining evidence that such an army of visitors had invaded the lonely moor . AT the home of a silk merchant in the heart of the business quarter , the inner garden of his ancestors has been enlarged and made all of fifty feet square , and there the same artist has created another lonely moor , which is a most successful composition of its kind . The inevitable waterfall is far back in a dense forest of pines and cryptomeria , and a stream comes out to the light , skirts the moor for a while , slips over a sloping boulder , and , crossing the foreground , widens out to a pool spanned by a granite slab bridge at the extreme right . Stone lanterns hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen through the screen of pine-branches . The different notes of the waterfall and of the sliding , gurgling stream are carefully considered and deliberately produced , and exert a hypnotic spell . Even in this wilderness the stream observes the etiquette of its kind , entering from the east and flowing to the south . The water is so clear that in the broad pools at the stage front the small golden carp and the fantailed coral and crimson fish appear to float in clear air beneath plate-glass . When the solemn lanterns are lighted , and show like will-o ' - the- wisps far back in the forest , and , better still , when the moon rises over the tops of these forest trees and floods the wild moor with silver light , the poetry and illusion are complete . One might walk across the moor and into the  |p815  lonely forest path , and lose one 's self for hours miles from the haunts of men , far from the madding silk mart .

Nature has willingly obeyed and done everything intended and asked of her . The guest-room of the house overhangs the lake , which is fed by a waterfall at the east and by a gurgling brook which enters farther down the middle distance , but from the east also , of course . The teahouse by the singing stream is only half hidden by trees , so that all need not be gloom , meditation , and introspection . There is a green sea of soft Korean grass , with mossy rocks islanded in groups here and there , but not haphazard at all , for each one is exactly where it should be to make the perfect picture . Beyond a discreet hedge of low-drooping cherry-trees there is a long strip of lotus pond , a wistaria arbor , and a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mossy old thatch of which one might rest his Brobdingnagian elbow , has a mossier green wheel , which clanks softly , deliberately , cheerily as it goes round and round , half hidden from the guest-room across the lake by a creeping , crouching pine , which lived for more than two hundred years in a noble garden miles away before it was transplanted . A silk merchant on the busiest dry-goods street has a famous " Garden of Little Cryptomerias " in a court perhaps twelve by twenty feet in extent . One sees the fold of overlapping , forested hillsides and a stony path leading away between them to the imaginary hamlet which is always supposed to lie in such a ravine . The whole composition is in young cryptomeria-trees , the smallest less than three feet high , and they rise evenly behind one another , like giant trees on a forested mountain slope . The illusion is complete . The sense of a wide landscape is there , and for decades to come this garden picture will not change by a line or an inch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number the pine-needles , and train the branches to his ideals . It was ages ago when the Japanese gardener realized that the graceful , stormbent old pine , whose pointed tip had been wrenched off in its sapling stage , and whose branches thereafter fell over in rounded , softly drooping , billowy , cloudlike outlines , was a thing of beauty easily attained by his own hand . One often sees spindling and awkward young pine-trees being trained for an after-life of beauty by first being decapitated , cut squarely off near the top , where two or more branches spring from the stem . These branches , weighted or tied down , soon curve into graceful cloud outlines , each tree taking on individual character and form when once released from the obligation to aspire upward to a sharp , tapering point . A stiff bamboo may even be taken in hand and decapitated at the right stage , and then it will dutifully bend over in a soft , full , willowy plume of foliage that is the most beautiful thing that ever sways in the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing a neglected Eden to order , this education of the pinetree was to be noted on every hand . Branches were being wired to the lines of beauty they should assume , or weighted with noosed stones . Even a bitter persimmon-tree was having its awkward , obstreperous branches brought down to graceful , drooping lines by the insistence of some fifty pounds of stones swinging like grotesque fruits from the tips of the longest branches . Another old garden was a very hospital of plants and trees , all the patients in splints , bandages , or casts , with grafting , training , transfusion , transplanting , and cures of every kind going on . There are already some successful examples of Japanese landscape-gardens in America , also many travesties and burlesques , in which all the first reasons , and all the canons and conventions of the art , are ignored .
