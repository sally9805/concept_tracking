The office of " The People , " a morning in March , 1917 . There is little furniture  --  a long table strewn with manuscripts and papers , a desk . On the walls are revolutionary posters ; wads of paper are thrown about on the floor  --  the office of a publication which is radical and poor . This is an inner office ; at the rear is the door into the outer one . OSCAR is seated at the table writing . TOM , a printer who loves the cause  --  or the crowd  --  almost enough to print for it , comes from the other room , a galley-proof in his hand . HOWE Why are you writing ? TRIPP Jauntily . Because I am a writer . HOWE But I thought you said there was n't going to be another issue of The People . TRIPP With dignity . I am writing . HOWE There 's a woman here with a suit case . TRIPP What 's in it ? HOWE She wants to see the Editor . TRIPP After writing . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman appears . She is middle aged , wears plain clothes not in fashion . Her manner is a little shrinking and yet as she stands in the doorway looking about the bare room , her face is the face of one who has come a long way and reached a wonderful place . p. 3 WOMAN This is the office of The People ? , TRIPP Um-hum . WOMAN In a bated way . I came to see the author of those wonderful words . TRIPP Rising . Which wonderful words ? WOMAN About moving toward the beautiful distances . TRIPP Oh . Those are Mr. Wills ' wonderful words . Begins to write as one who has lost interest . WOMAN Could I see him ? TRIPP He is n't here yet . He 's just back from California . Wo n't be at the office till a little later . WOMAN With excitement . He has been to California ? He has just ridden across this country ? TRIPP Yes . Long trip . He was very cross over the ' phone . WOMAN Oh  --  no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me about ? WOMAN After considering . I could see him a little later , could n't I ? p. 4 TRIPP Yes , if its important . Of course he 'll be very busy . WOMAN It is important . At least  --  yes , it is important . TRIPP Very well then  --  later in the morning . WOMAN Thinking aloud . I will stand down on the street and watch the people go by . TRIPP What ? WOMAN The people . It 's so wonderful to see them  --  so many of them . Do n't you often just stand and watch them ? TRIPP No , madam , not often . I am too busy editing a magazine about them . WOMAN Of course you are busy . You help edit this magazine ? Looks about at the posters . TRIPP I am associate editor of The People . WOMAN That 's a great thing for you  --  and you so young . Does Mr. Wills write in this room ? TRIPP That is his desk . WOMAN Looking at the desk . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same room with him . TRIPP Well , I do n't know ; perhaps it is a wonderful thing for him to  --  I am Oscar Tripp , the poet . p. 5 WOMAN Wistfully . It would be beautiful to be a poet . Pause . I will come back later . Picks up suit-case . TRIPP Just leave that if you are n't going to be using it in the meantime . WOMAN Putting it down near the door . Oh , thank you . I see you are a kind young man . TRIPP That is not the general opinion . WOMAN I wonder why it is that the general opinion is so often wrong ? Stands considering it for a moment , then goes out . TRIPP I do n't quite understand that woman . Tom comes back . HOWE If this paper ca n't go on , I ought to know it . I could get a job on the Evening World . Oscar continues writing . Can it go on ? TRIPP I do n't see how it can , but many a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Doubtless it will go on , and will see days so much worse than these that we will say , " Ah , the good old days of March , 1917 . " HOWE But can it pay salaries ? p. 6 TRIPP Shocked . Oh , no , I think not ; but we must work because we love our work . HOWE We must eat because we love our food . TRIPP You 'll know soon . There 's to be a meeting here this morning . Enter SARA . TOM goes into the other room . SARA has the appearance of a young business woman and the simple direct manner of a woman who is ready to work for a thing she believes in . SARA Ed not here yet ? TRIPP No . SARA Did he get any money ? TRIPP Does n't look like it . He was snappish over the phone . Guess he 's for giving it up this time . SARA I do n't want to give it up . She takes a seat at the table where OSCAR is writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRIPP Well , it 's not what we want , it 's what people want , and there are n't enough of them who want us . SARA The fault must lie with us . TRIPP I do nt think so . The fault lies with the failure to  --  THE ARTIST has entered . p. 7 ARTIST I 'll tell you where the fault lies . We should give more space to pictures and less to stupid reading matter . TRIPP We have given too much expensive white paper to pictures and too little to reading matter  --  especially to poetry . That 's where the fault lies . Enter EDWARD WILLS , editor . WILLS I 'll tell you where the fault lies . Points first to THE ARTIST , then to OSCAR . Here ! Just this ! Everybody plugging for his own thing . Nobody caring enough about the thing as a whole . TRIPP Rising . I 'll tell you where the fault lies . Points to Ed . Here ! This . The Editor-in-chief returning from a long trip and the first golden words that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinates . SARA How are you Ed ? WILLS Rotten . I hate sleeping cars . I always catch cold . SARA Any luck ? WILLS His hand around his ear . What 's the word ? Enter THE EARNEST APPROACH . EARNEST APPROACH I have heard that you may have to discontinue . p. 8 WILLS Sitting down at his desk , beginning to look through his mail . It seems we might as well . EARNEST APPROACH Now just let me tell you what the trouble has been and how you can remedy it . The People has been afraid of being serious . But you deal with ideas , and you must do it soberly . There is a place for a good earnest journal of protest , but all this levity  --  this fooling  --  Enter THE LIGHT TOUCH . LIGHT TOUCH Came in to see you , Ed , to say I hope the news I 'm hearing is n't true . WILLS If it 's bad , it 's true . LIGHT TOUCH Well , it 's an awful pity , but you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what The People needs . You 're as heavy as mud . Try it awhile longer along frivolous lines . I was in the building and just ran in to let you have my idea of what 's the matter with you . TRIPP If we had as many subscribers as we have people to tell us what 's the matter with us  --  Enter PHILOSOPHER and FIREBRAND , TOM follows them in , a page of manuscript in his hand . WILLS Now the Philosopher and the Firebrand will tell us what 's the matter with us. p. 9 FIREBRAND Too damn bourgeois ! You should print on the cover of every issue  --  " To hell with the bourgeoisie ! " Pigs ! PHILOSOPHER The trouble with this paper is efficiency . This is too much for all of them . The PRINTER falls back against the wall , then staggers from the room . WILLS Dear God ! There are things it seems to me I can not bear . PHILOSOPHER It should be more carelessly done , and then it would be more perfectly done . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definiteness . You should not know what it is you want , and then you would find what you are after . TRIPP You talk as if we had not been a success . But just last night I heard of a woman in Bronxville who keeps The People under her bed so her husband wo n't know she 's reading it . FIREBRAND If you had been a success you would have fired that woman with so great a courage that she would proudly prop The People on the pillow ! ARTIST Who is sketching THE FIREBRAND . It was my pictures got us under the bed . TRIPP Haughtily . I was definitely told it was my last " Talk with God " put us under the bed . p. 10 FIREBRAND Can you not see that she puts you under the bed because you yourselves have made concessions to the bourgeoisie ? Cows ! Geese ! ARTIST It must be more frivolous ! TRIPP It must print more poetry . They glare at one another . EARNEST APPROACH It should be more serious . LIGHT TOUCH It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed like a freshman with a good allowance . BOY Is this the office of The People ? TRIPP No , this is a lunatic asylum . BOY After a bewildered moment . Oh , you 're joking . You know Confidentially , I wondered about that  --  whether you would joke here . I thought you would . Stepping forward . I came to see the Editor  --  I want to tell him  --  WILLS So many people are telling me so many things , could you tell yours a little later ? BOY Oh , yes . Of course there must be many important things people have to tell you . p. 11 WILLS Well  --  many . THE BOY goes out  --  reluctantly . ARTIST Who has all the time been glaring at OSCAR . Speaking for the artists , I want to say right now  --  TRIPP Speaking for the writers , I wish to say before we go further  --  EARNEST APPROACH A more serious approach  --  LIGHT TOUCH A lighter touch  --  FIREBRAND Speaking for myself  --  PHILOSOPHER Speaking for the truth  --  Phone rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  slow , heavy . WILLS You have come to tell us something about this paper ? MAN Yes . WILLS There are a number ahead of you . Will you wait your turn ? A look of disappointment . I 'll be glad to see you as soon as I can . There in the outside office ? A moment THE MAN stands there , a mute ponderous figure , then very slowly goes out . TRIPP Hanging up receiver . Moritz Paper Company . Bill got to be paid today . And here  --  Takes from his drawer a huge packet of bills . p. 12 EARNEST APPROACH You could pay your bills if you were not afraid to be serious ! LIGHT TOUCH You could pay your bills if you were not afraid to be gay ! EARNEST APPROACH From the door , solemnly . A more earnest approach would save The People . LIGHT TOUCH A lighter touch would turn the trick ! With that they leave . FIREBRAND Going over and pounding on THE EDITOR 'S desk . To hell with the bourgeoisie ! Apes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as long as the spark appears to be good and out , may I , in the name of efficiency , ask you who do not belong here to retire , that we may go ahead with our work ? PHILOSOPHER There would be greater efficiency in our remaining . There would be form . You have lacked form . FIREBRAND You have lacked courage ! Donkeys ! WILLS It would be illuminating , Leo , to hear you run through the animal kingdom  --  toads , crocodiles , a number of things you have n't mentioned yet , but the animal kingdom is large  --  and we have work to do . p. 13 PHILOSOPHER You lack form in your work . By form I do not mean what you think I mean . I mean that particular significance of the insignificant which is the fundamental  --  WILLS We could n't understand it . Why tell us ? PHILOSOPHER No . You could n't understand it . He leaves them to their fate . FIREBRAND Rest in peace . Gesture of benediction . Then hissingly . Centipedes ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter with us is our friends . SARA Quietly . Well , to be or not to be . I guess it 's up to you , Ed . WILLS Just what would we be going on for ? To make a few more people like the dear ones who have just left us ? Seems to me we could best serve society by not doing that . Precisely what do we do ?  --  aside from getting under the bed in Bronxville . Now and then something particularly rotten is put over and we have a story that gets a rise out of a few people , but  --  we do n't change anything . SARA We had another hope . We were going to express ourselves so simply and so truly that we would be expressing the people . p. 14 WILLS Wearily . The People . I looked at them all the way across this continent . Oh , I got so tired looking at them  --  on farms , in towns , in cities . They 're like toys that you wind up and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed . It would topple them over . The longer I looked the more ridiculous it seemed to me that we should be giving our lives to  --  Picks up the magazine and reads . The People  --  " A Journal of the Social Revolution . " Certainly we 'd better cut the sub-title . The social revolution is dead . TRIPP You do n't think you are bringing back any news , do you , Ed ? ARTIST Taking up magazine . Instead of a sub-title we could have a design . Much better . Glares at OSCAR , then begins to draw . SARA This is a long way from what you felt a year ago , Ed . You had vision then . WILLS You ca n't keep vision in this office . It 's easy enough to have a beautiful feeling about the human race when none of it is around . The trouble about doing anything for your fellow-man is that you have to do it with a few of them . Oh , of course that is n't fair . We care . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't work the way he has . But what does our caring come to ? It does n't connect up with anything , and God knows it does n't seem to be making anything very beautiful of us . There 's something rather pathetic about us. p. 15 TRIPP Or is it merely ridiculous ? SARA Let me read you something , Ed . She takes The People and reads very simply . " We are living now . We shall not be living long . No one can tell us we shall live again . This is our little while . This is our chance . And we take it like a child who comes from a dark room to which he must return  --  comes for one sunny afternoon to a lovely hillside , and finding a hole , crawls in there till after the sun is set . I want that child to know the sun is shining upon flowers in the grass . I want him to know it before he has to go back to the room that is dark . I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances . I myself could see farther if he were seeing at all . Perhaps I can tell you : you who have dreamed and dreaming know , and knowing care . Move ! Move from the things that hold you . If you move , others will move . Come ! Now . Before the sun goes down . " Very quietly . You wrote that , Ed . WILLS Yes , I wrote it ; and do you want to know why I wrote it ? I wrote it because I was sore at Oscar and wanted to write something to make him feel ashamed of himself . While SARA is reading , THE WOMAN has appeared at the door , has moved a few steps into the room as if drawn by the words she is hearing . Behind her are seen THE BOY from Georgia , THE MAN from the Cape . p. 16 WOMAN Moving forward . I do n't believe that 's true ! I do n't believe that 's true ! Maybe you think that 's why you wrote it , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living truth , and it moved in you and you had to say it . WILLS Rising . Who are you ? WOMAN I am one of the people . I have lived a long way off . I heard that call and  --  I had to come . BOY Blithely . I 've come too . I 'm from Georgia . I read it , and I did n't want to stay at school any longer . I said , " I want something different and bigger  --  something more like this . " I heard about your not being able to sell your paper on the newsstands just because lots of people do n't want anything different and bigger , and I said to myself , " I 'll sell the paper ! I 'll go and sell it on the streets ! " And I got so excited about it that I did n't even wait for the dance . There was a dance that night , and I had my girl too . WOMAN He did n't even wait for the dance . TRIPP The idealists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . WILLS To THE MAN . And what did you leave , my friend ? p. 17 MAN Heavily . My oyster bed . I 'm from the Cape . I had a chance to go in on an oyster bed . I read what you wrote  --  a woman who had stopped in an automobile left it , and I said to myself , " I 'm nothing but an oyster myself . Guess I 'll come to life . " WILLS But  --  what did you come here for ? MAN Well  --  for the rest of it . WILLS The rest of what ? MAN The rest of what you 've got . BOY Yes  --  that 's it ; we 've come for the rest of what you 've got . TRIPP This is awkward for Ed . WOMAN Give it to us . WILLS What ? WOMAN The rest of it . WILLS An instant 's pause . I have n't got anything more to give . BOY But you made us think you had . You led us to believe you had . WOMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , you could n't have given that . TRIPP Very awkward . p. 18 WOMAN You said  --  " I call to you . You who have dreamed , and dreaming know , and knowing care . " Well , three of us are here . From the South and the East and the West we 've come because you made us want something we did n't have , made us want it so much we had to move the way we thought was toward it  --  before the sun goes down . BOY We thought people here had life  --  something different and bigger . TRIPP Perhaps we 'd better go . Poor Ed . WILLS I wish you 'd shut up , Oscar . WOMAN I know you will give it to us . WILLS Give what to you ? WOMAN What you have for the people . OSCAR coughs . What you made us know we need . TRIPP You should n't have called personally . You should have sent in your needs by mail . WILLS Oscar , try and act as if you had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at OSCAR  --  then , warmly . At least he has a heart . It 's only that he feels he must be witty . But you  --  you 're not going to let us just go away again , are you ? He gave up his oyster bed , and this boy did n't even wait for the dance , and me  --  I gave up my tombstone . p. 19 WILLS Your  --  ? WOMAN Yes  --  tombstone . It had always been a saying in our family  --  " He wo n't even have a stone to mark his grave . " They said it so much that I thought it meant something . I sew  --  plain sewing , but I 've often said to myself  --  " Well , at least I 'll have a stone to mark my grave . " And then , there was a man who had been making speeches to the miners  --  I live in a town in Idaho  --  and he had your magazine , and he left it in the store , and the storekeeper said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , you like to read . Do n't you want this ? I wish you 'd take it away , because if some folks in this town see it , they 'll think I 'm not all I should be . " He meant the cover . ARTIST Brightening . That was my cover . WOMAN After a smile at THE ARTIST . So I took it home , and when my work was done that night , I read your wonderful words . They 're like a spring  --  if you 've lived in a dry country , you 'll know what I mean . And they made me know that my tombstone was as dead as  --  well , With a little laughas dead as a tombstone . So I had to have something to take its place . SARA Rising and going to THE WOMAN . Talk to him . Tell him about it . Come , Oscar ! p. 20 BOY As long as there seems to be so much uncertainty about this , perhaps I 'd better telegraph father . You see , the folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WOMAN He did n't even stay for the dance . BOY I 'll be glad to sell the papers . Seeing a pile of them on the table . Here , shall I take these ?  --  and I 'll stop people on the street and tell why I 'm selling them . TRIPP No , you ca n't do that . You 'd be arrested . WOMAN Let him sell them . What 's the difference about the law , if you have the right idea ? TRIPP The right idea has given us trouble enough already . MAN There 's something sure about an oyster bed . TRIPP You come with me and have a drink . Something sure about that too . WOMAN He could have had a drink at home . SARA To ARTIST . Coming , Joe ? To THE BOY . It was corking of you to want to help us . We must talk about  --  All go out except THE WOMAN and THE EDITOR . A Pause . p. 21 WOMAN I am sorry for you . WILLS Why ? WOMAN Feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say those things , and not the spirit to believe them . I could n't say them , and yet I 've got something you have n't got . With more sureness . Because I know the thing you said was true . WILLS Will you sit down ? WOMAN No  --  I 'll go . Stands there uncertainly . I do n't know why I should be disappointed . I suppose it 's not fair to ask you to be as big as the truth you saw . Why should I expect you would be ? WILLS I 'm sorry . I suppose now you 'll regret your tomb-stone . WOMAN No  --  it was wonderful to ride across this country and see all the people . The train moving along seemed to make something move in me . I had thoughts not like any thoughts I 'd ever had before  --  your words like a spring breaking through the dry country of my mind . I thought of how you call your paper " A Journal of The Social Revolution , " and I said to myself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't matter ! Seeing  --  that 's the Social Revolution . p. 22 WILLS Seeing  --  ? WOMAN As if it is passing before her . A plain , dark trees off at the edge , against the trees a little house and a big barn . A flat piece of land fenced in . Stubble , furrows . Horses waiting to get in at the barn ; cows standing around a pump . A tile yard , a water tank , one straight street of a little town . The country so still it seems dead . The trees like  --  hopes that have been given up . The grave yards  --  on hills  --  they come so fast . I noticed them first because of my tombstone , but I got to thinking about the people  --  the people who spent their whole lives right near the places where they are now . There 's something in the thought of them  --  like the cows standing around the pump . So still , so patient , it  --  kind of hurts . And their pleasures :  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other great words . I thought of Lincoln , and what he said of a few of the dead . I said it over and over . I said things and did n't know the meaning of them ' till after I had said them . I said  --  " The truth  --  the truth  --  the truth that opens from our lives as water opens from the rocks . " Then I knew what that truth was . Pause , with an intensity peculiarly simple . " Let us here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain . " I mean  --  all of them . A gesture , wide , loving . Let life become what it may become !  --  so beautiful that everything that is back of us is worth every-thing it cost . Enter TOM . p. 23 HOWE I 've got  --  Feeling something unusual . Sorry to butt in , but I can still get that job on The Evening World . If this paper is going to stop , I 've got to know it . WILLS Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop ! Last I heard , it could n't do anything else . WILLS That was  --  long ago . HOWE Oh  --  you 've got something to go on with ? WILLS Yes , something to go on with . HOWE I see . Looks at woman , as if he does n't see , glances at her suit-case . I 'm glad . But  --  I 've got to be sure . This  --  is the truth ? WILLS The truth . The truth that opens from our lives as water opens from the rocks . TOM backs up . WOMAN Turning a shining face to THE PRINTER.
