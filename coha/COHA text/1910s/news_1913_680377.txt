txt Ends Century-Old Tradition in To-morrow 's Memorial Exercises . Memorial services in honor of the late Vice President , James Schoolcraft Sherman , will be held to-morrow in the Senate chamber at Washington . It will be an impressive occasion . Besides the Senators , many of the most distinguished men in public life will be present and for the first time in more than a hundred years the President of the United States will address in person a house of Congress . He will deliver a eulogy on the Vice President . It is also announced that Speaker Clark will'pay a tribute to Mr. Sherman . Not since 1801 has the President spoken directly to either house of Congress , and " the record shows no precedent for the Speaker addressing the Senate . " These two incidents at the Sherman celebration to-morrow will give special interest to the proceedings of the Senate and will break a precedent that may very well result in a more perfect understanding between the several departments of the Government , to the general advantage of the country . *** During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom of the President , at the opening of each sess , ion of Congress , to meet both houses , and deliver a written speech , to which in the course of a few days each house would make answer through a committee appointed to wait on the President . and the President , in turn , would acknowledge by a brief reply . This plan was changed by Thomas Jefferson at the beginning of his first term as President . Instead of meeting the houses of Congress , and addressing them personally , he sent them a written message , thus substituting messages for speeches . In a letter to Aaron Burr , the President of the Senate , December 8. 1801 , he set forth the reasons for the change in these words : The circumstances under which we find ourselves at this place rendering inconvenient the mode heretofore practiced of making , by personal address , the first communications between the legislative and executive branches , I have adopted that by message , as used on all subsequent occasions through the session . In doing this I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the economy of their time , to their relief from the embarrassment of immediate answers on subjects not yet fully before them , and to the benefits thence resulting to the public affairs . Trusting that a procedure founded on these motives will meet their approbation , I beg leave through you , Sir , to communicate the inclosed copy , with the documents accompanying it , to the honorable the Senate , and pray you to accept for yourself and them the homage of my high regard and consideration . That was the beginning of the custom of the President communicating with the Congress by written message and not by word of mouth , a custom that has been invariably followed by all Jefferson 's successors in office . * , , , * ? In an address to the . Jefferson Club of St. Louis in October , 1893 , on the occasion of unveiling the Benjamin Harvey bust of Jefferson , Senator George G. Vest , one of the strong men of his day , and for whom Missouri has ' found no worthy successor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortality " the rights of man , religious liberty , and universal education . " In this address Senator Vest , though protesting that he would " worship no mortal man , living or dead , " if he " could kneel at such a shrine it - would be with uncovered head and ldeeing heart at the grave of Thomas Jefferson , " said that " the absurd custom of Congress being opened by the President with a personal address had been adopted in imitation of the English system . " and that the Jefferson plan had ever since been followed . There is no law on the subject . It is a matter of taste and convenience , a question which every President can settle for himself . Jefferson also followed some other plans which have rarely or never been Imitated by his successors . Senator Vest said : The new President rode to the Capitol on horseback , hitched his steed to the palings , and quietly took the oath of office . There was no procession , no inaugural ball , no show and parade . ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mob of sweating and rncomfortable people , in tawdry finery , torture each other and the President until life becomes a burden , but this travesty on common sense has since returned to plague the Chief Executive and disgust the sensible public . Jefferson sought to simplify the Government and relieve it from the display and extravagance by which monarchy aimed to dazzle the people and conceal the outrages inflicted upon them . All this is a familiar story and means as little or as much as the reader would have it mean . The story that Jefferson rode to the Capitol on horseback has been described as a fable by persons who have investigated it . Only a short time ago Woodrow Wilson himself threw some doubt upon the authenticity of the account that has been so much appealed to as proof that Jefferson was really " one of us ; ' but no one has denied that the beau ideal of the common people lived in clover , and in dress , home comforts and conversation held high rank among the gentlemen of his day . All his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his legs. , shoes with silver buckles on his feet , coats of the finest material , with hand-made lace ruffles at the cuffs , and breeches that were secured with garters or buckles , all of the most fashionable design and manufacture , and it is known that at his home he had carriages and servants that would have graced the es-tablishments of the much despised lords of the old country . *** Jefferson Was the father of democracy in this country . ' and in his name there has grown tip much snobbishness of the baser sort for the benefit of the galleries . In the farewell address of the Congress to Mr. Jefferson in 1809 the members of that body thanked him " for the model of an Administration conducted on the purest principles of republicanism ; for pomp and state laid aside : patronage discarded , " and so on as " points " Which " the historian will not fail to seize , to expand , and teach . posterity to dwell upon with delight . " *** It is all very interesting in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are of a contentious mind and who like to look through the seeming to the real . ' This , however , is not the matter of present interest . Tomorrow President Taft will speak to.the Senate in special session of the life and work of Vice President Sherman , and by so doing will break the custom of a century and establish a precedent which might well be followed by other Presieents touching other matters In which both President and Congress are concerned in the discharge of their respective duties of legislation and administration .
